Foreword
W
hen we launched Skype back in 2003, our dream was to allow people
around the world to talk to each other for free. To make this possible,
we created a little piece of software that people could easily download onto
their computers and use straight away. Today, talking over the Internet using
Skype has become a natural form of communication around the world.
The response to our technology has been amazing. It has exceeded even our
wildest dreams. Skype is now used by more than 113 million people all over
the world and is available in 27 different languages. And people don’t just use
Skype to talk to one another. They can do all sorts of things with it — from
instant messaging to sending photos to hosting conference calls.
When I found out that Skype was to be included in the popular For Dummies,
series, I was delighted. This book explains how a good idea can create power-
ful connections between people and their friends, family, and business col-
leagues across the world. It also tells you about some of the new gadgets and
software you can buy that make Skype really exciting to use. It’s incredible to
think that only a few years ago, if you wanted to call someone on the other
side of the planet, doing so would have cost you a fortune. But now, with
Skype, you can call whomever you want for free. And it’s fun, too! 
We are tickled pink by the way Skype has changed people’s lives. And we
hope to keep delighting our users just like you every single day. You make
Skype what it is. Thank you.

Introduction
“I
’ll skype you” is quickly replacing, “I’ll email you,” which ousted “I’ll
call you.” Before any of these, of course, came “I’ll send a telegram,”
which was supplanted by “I’ll write you.” The need to extend face-to-face
communication launched industries around distance messaging, and Skype
joins this chorus of change with a “voice” that resonates through the Internet.
Skype, however, is not just another way to say hello. Skype combines the
power of email, telephony, telegrams, and letters by providing an avenue for
text, data, voice, and even video communication. Skype reaches across oceans
but has tools to make the experience intimate. You can exchange files as easily
as handing someone a piece of paper. You can see eye-to-eye through video
conferencing. You can convene a group of friends with ease. Millions of people
are discovering all this versatility with Skype. Skype For Dummies makes it
easy for you to join them.
About This Book
Skype is simple to download and start using, so why write an entire book
about it? There’s much more to Skype than simply calling someone from one
PC to another, and Skype For Dummies opens your eyes to the many ways in
which you can put Skype to use, with exciting possibilities for both your 
personal and professional development.
As is true for the world of technology in general, Skype technology is a
rapidly moving and dynamically evolving target. So some of the software or
gadgets we describe here may have already changed between our writing 
and your seeing this book in print. But we have tried to capture the spirit of
where the technology is headed, and Skype For Dummies is loaded with the
information and ideas you need to get skyping right away.
This book shows you how to
 Get started if you’ve never used Skype and become an expert in no time
 Find Skype communities to join
 Pick out just the right gadgets for optimum skyping
 Discover Skype-based solutions for your business
 Explore, understand, and adopt a new set of ideas about communicating

How to Use This Book
Jump right in anywhere! We’ve designed this book so that you don’t have to
read it from front to back; it’s a user-friendly reference tool that you can even
start reading at the back if you’re so inclined — you won’t spoil the ending.
Foolish Assumptions
In writing this book, we’ve made the following assumptions about you:
 You wouldn’t mind making free or low-cost calls.
 You can use a telephone, computer, or mobile device.
 You are curious about technology and wouldn’t mind trying a few 
new things.
 You don’t want to be left out of the communications revolution.
How This Book Is Organized
We’ve organized this book so that you can easily find whatever you need or
want to know — whether you’re new to Skype or are fast becoming a veteran
skyper.
Part I: Getting Started with Skype
The first chapter in this part provides a snapshot of what Skype is all about.
If you’re ready to get skyping now, you can plunge in to Chapter 2 for every-
thing you need to know about downloading Skype and setting it up to make
your first call. In Chapter 3, we take you sightseeing through the Skype inter-
face, detailing its menus and toolbar. As you continue to explore the world
through Skype, use this chapter as a quick reference for whatever task you
need Skype to do for you.

Skype For Dummies 

Part II: As You Like It: Skype Your Way
We’ve found that the more you fine-tune your Skype settings to suit your
daily needs, the better Skype will serve you. To that end, Chapter 4 is full of
information on how to make Skype behave concerning notifications and
alerts, sound effects, protecting your privacy, and much more. Chapter 5
describes ways for you to broadcast your personality to the world, both for
fun and as a business communications strategy. In Chapter 6, you can find
out all about online chatting through Skype. Chapter 7 launches you into the
exciting world of skyping with video and shows you how to choose the best
webcam for your purposes. Finally in this part, Chapter 8 gives you the scoop
on connecting Skype with ordinary phones using services called SkypeIn and
SkypeOut.
Part III: Calling All Seasoned Skypers
Even if you’re not a seasoned skyper yet, browsing this part of the book may
make you eager to become one! Chapter 9 covers a host of ways to send and
receive messages, perhaps in ways you’ve never imagined. And Skype makes
conferencing easy, whether with one or many others and whether for business
or social activities, as Chapter 10 reveals. In Chapter 11, we unveil a gallery of
gadgets and add-ons that you can use to greatly enhance your skyping.
Part IV: The Professional Skyper
Skype is a heavy-duty communications engine for commerce, and Chapter 12
helps you consider whether it’s time to join with the millions of business
users who are already benefiting from Skype. But “professional” skyping
doesn’t just imply business-related topics, and Chapter 13 gives you a taste 
of the array of online communities springing up all over the world through
Skype. Last in this part, Chapter 14 tells you how to both join and create your
own Skypecasts, which are free, large-scale Web conferences.
Part V: The Part of Tens
We had fun brainstorming our lists of “ten things” in each of these chapters,
but they are also very practical. You might want to start with this part first,
just to get a sense what Skype is and how it’s helping to change the world.

Introduction

Conventions Used in This Book
We use some conventions throughout this book that merit a little explana-
tion. When you see a phrase such as “choose File➪Edit My Profile,” it means
to click through a given sequence of menu commands. In this example, those
commands are File followed by Edit My Profile.
Whenever we tell you to click something (most likely it’s a button or an icon),
you use the left mouse button and click just once. On those rare occasions
when clicking twice is required to get the job done, we tell you to double-click. 
To select an item, you either highlight it or click in a check box or radio
button, depending on the item. Text that we tell you to enter (that is, type)
into the program, such as in a text box, appears in boldface type. Web site
addresses and on-screen messages show up in monofont type. To signify
hyperlinks, otherwise known as just plain links, we underline the text of the
link. On your computer, clicking such a link transports you to another loca-
tion altogether, such as a Web page.
Finally, to avoid confusion, we use title-style capitalization for option names
and links when they appear in regular text, even when the program doesn’t. 
Icons Used in This Book
To flag special points we want to draw your attention to, we use the 
following icons:
This icon shows up next to a special tidbit of information or a trick to make
something easier.
This icon indicates information that we want to make sure you notice.
Text next to this icon tells you something that you need to, well, remember.

Skype For Dummies 

This icon signifies geeky stuff that may interest some, but certainly not 
all, readers.
When you see this icon, take heed; it signifies something you need to be
aware of before you act.
This one doesn’t show up very often, but it means be very careful — the
stove is hot and you can get burned.
Where to Go from Here
Without further ado, we urge you to start skyping. As you experience this
extraordinary way to connect to the world, pay us a visit from time to time at
the Web site for this book. We’ll be posting updates, tips, tricks, new gear,
stories, and more. Find us at

Part I
Getting Started
with Skype

In this part . . .
T
his is the place to begin if you’re not exactly sure what
Skype is, where to find it, or how to get started using
it. In this part, you get a brief introduction to the world of
Skype, find out how to download it, sign up for a Skype
Name, locate fellow skypers, and get talking! You also get
the lowdown on navigating through the Skype menu with
all its options and tools. 

Chapter 1
What’s All the Hoopla 
about Skype?
In This Chapter
 Introducing Skype
 Using Skype for more than a phone call
 Enhancing Skype
D
o you know what happens when you speak to someone over a phone
line? Your conversation is converted into an electronic signal and sent
over a copper wire or some wireless network to someone else’s phone. The
phone companies have set up vast networks to seamlessly connect you to
just about anyone on the planet and these days, the networks are all digital
even if your phone is not. In addition to managing the call, phone companies
track where you are dialing to and how long the call persists so that they can
send you a bill at the end of the month.
Wait a second — if the zeros and ones pushed through the phone lines are
the same as the zeros and ones found on computers like yours, networks,
and the World Wide Web, why can’t you push those zeros and ones through
the Internet? Well, you can. That’s what Skype is all about.
In this chapter, you find out what makes Skype different from regular tele-
phones, along with surprising ways to use Skype and a quick overview of
ways to make Skype fun and productive.
Seeing What Skype Can Do For You
Skype can dramatically alter how you exchange information, how you meet
new people, and how you interact with friends, family, and colleagues.

Although you can make calls on Skype, there is oh so much more to it. For
starters, here are some things you get or can do with Skype:
 Call to or receive a call from a regular telephone, a cell phone, or a 
computer on the Internet.
 Send or receive files over the Internet to and from fellow skypers.
 Search your Outlook contacts and call them within Skype.
 Search the Skype database of all Skype users on the planet.
 Hold a conference call with a group of people. Besides participating 
in audio conferencing, you can “simul-chat” with your conference 
participants — exchanging text, live Web links, and files.
 Make live video calls.
 Initiate a group chat.
 Hold a Skypecast for as many as 100 people at a time.
 Transmit secure and encrypted voice conversations, text, file transfers,
and video.
Skype (the basic stuff) is free
To use Skype, you need only three things:
 A computer with access to the Internet: Your Internet connection
should be faster than dial-up. Just as Web access with dial-up does not
work very well, the same is true of Skype with a dial-up connection.
You’re best off using a high-speed broadband connection DSL or cable 
 A free software program called Skype: You can get this program from
www.skype.com (see Chapter 2).
 A microphone and headset: Plenty of audio device options are available
(see Chapter 11), ranging from inexpensive ($20 or so) to a little more
pricey.
That’s it. To be able to make your first call, you just download the Skype 
software from the Internet, create a Skype Name for yourself, test your audio
connection through Skype, and you’re good to go. You can talk to fellow
Skype users around the world without any time limits and without having 
to pay anyone.
If you want more than just the basic service, however, you will have to pay.
Skype is free when you talk to another Skype user on a PC. But what if you
want to call, say, your grandmother, who doesn’t have a computer? For a
small fee (as low as two cents a minute or even free), you can “SkypeOut”
from your computer to a conventional phone. The cost depends on whether
10
Part I: Getting Started with Skype 

she’s in the same country as you are and how long you speak. Similarly,
someone who doesn’t have Skype can call you using the “SkypeIn” feature.
(See Chapter 8 for more about using SkypeIn and SkypeOut.)
You can use equipment and 
services you already have
Why would you want to use the Internet to manage phone conversations?
First, you already have it (and pay for it). Internet use is widespread; it seems
that nearly everyone has it. The technology keeps improving every day. If 
you already have access to the Internet, you can handle much of your long-
distance calling over the Internet for very low cost or for free, and often with
better sound quality than you get from cell phones and regular phones. Also,
you may be able to do things with an Internet-based phone system that you
can’t do with a conventional phone system. You can run a Skypecast with a
hundred people. You can send and receive files that would choke your email
system. You can send and receive live video from anywhere in the world.
Better yet, all these transmissions over Skype occur on secure and encrypted
lines of communication.
It’s great for personal communications
The Skype community is international. People from all corners of the globe
show up in the searches, so it helps to provide identifying information in
your Skype profile, such as your language, country, and perhaps city.
Click the Profile icon to get public information about any Skype user selected
in your search results (see Figure 1-1).
Figure 1-1:
The Skype
Profile page.
11
Chapter 1: What’s All the Hoopla about Skype?

More important, you can add a person to your Contacts list (see Figure 1-2).
Adding someone to your Contacts list entails seeking that person’s permis-
sion and receiving his or her contact information. See Chapter 3 for more
details about contacts, including how to find and add them.
You’ll quickly find that people enjoy working with Skype and are usually
eager to exchange information on how to best use Skype.
After you start making the rounds, you’ll want to try the chat or instant mes-
saging capabilities. You can find plenty of information about chats in Chapter 6.
And great for professional services, too
Chats are fun, but Skype can be good for your career, too. Think about how
Skype can serve you. Say, for example, that you’re sitting in an airport waiting
for your flight. The Director of Sales has just attended a briefing with a major
customer and found out that the customer needs double the amount of mer-
chandise that was negotiated six months ago. Now the two of you need to 
validate that you can fulfill the revised production schedule, and doing so
involves the Product Development Manager. Why not set up an impromptu
conference call that includes all three of you? You’re in an airport in Chicago,
which has a public Wi-Fi network. The Sales Director is in the Dallas office,
and the Product Development Manager is at home in San Diego. But that’s
okay — it doesn’t matter where you are.
One of the marvels of this technology is that any of you can instantly con-
vene a conference call, and you can all be in different cities around the globe.
It is great to have the convenience of a conference call. This one sounds as
Figure 1-2:
Adding a
Skype user
to your
Contacts
list.
12
Part I: Getting Started with Skype 

though it’s pretty serious. Think you might need to exchange documents,
such as spreadsheets or PowerPoint slides? Well, you can do just that. To
find how to transfer a file, go to Chapter 6.
Hold on — what about the fact that you’re sitting in an airport? An airport
can be a favorite spot for industrial espionage. Skype, however, creates a
roadblock for your corporate competitor: All the file transfers, all the chats,
and all the conversations that take place are secure and encrypted!
Going Beyond the Basics with (Not
Necessarily Free) Services
Skype does many things right out of the virtual box. But you can add a full
complement of features and services provided by Skype and third-party 
companies.
Skyping in from a phone
How can people call you from a regular telephone if Skype runs on a computer?
Well, for a small fee you can get a SkypeIn phone number that anyone with a
regular phone can call. There are no surcharges of any kind. The person calling
you calls your SkypeIn number. As far as he or she is concerned, the call is
being made to a regular phone number. The charges incurred by the call
amount to whatever they would be to make a call to a phone in your area code.
When you sign in to Skype, SkypeIn calls are automatically routed to you. You
can be anywhere on the planet. If you are connected to Skype, the calls get to
you just the same. 
Skyping out to a phone
Not only can people call into Skype using an ordinary telephone, but you can
call out to anyone on a landline or mobile phone using SkypeOut. Making a
call from a computer to a telephone is as easy as entering the phone number
and pressing Enter. The charge for the call appears on your screen (if there is
a charge; some calls are free). How do you pay for this? Buy a block of min-
utes with SkypeOut credits. When your SkypeOut minutes are used up, you
can purchase more. Chapter 8 gives you all the information you need to get
started with SkypeIn and SkypeOut. 
13
Chapter 1: What’s All the Hoopla about Skype?

Getting voicemail
What’s phone service without voicemail? You can add voicemail to Skype
with Skype Voicemail (a plain-vanilla service), or with Pamela or Skylook
(both are packed with features). Skype Voicemail is bundled with SkypeIn. If
you want Skype Voicemail without SkypeIn, you can purchase it with Skype
credit. Pamela and Skylook have “lite” versions for free, but the good stuff
costs a few dollars (really, just a few).
See Chapter 9 for more about Skype Voicemail, Pamela, and Skylook. 
Getting a Load of Add-Ons 
and Accessories
Having more features and capabilities to enhance Skype can be highly desir-
able, and Skype makes it easy to integrate third-party applications and plug-
ins to work with its software. Skype permits and in fact encourages
third-party companies to bring enhancements to Skype. (Such enhancements
are handled through something called Skype Application Programming
Interface [Skype API], but that’s more than you need to know.)
14
Part I: Getting Started with Skype 
Skype terms
These terms may not have made it into the
Oxford English Dictionary yet, but who knows,
maybe you can say you saw them here first!
to skype (verb, infinitive form): To communicate
over the Internet using voice, video, text, and file
transfers using a special program called Skype.
skyping (present participle): The act of calling
over Skype.
skyper (noun): A person who skypes.
Skype (proper noun): The software and the com-
pany that makes it.
Skype Name: Your personal Skype ID.
SkypeIn: A service provided by Skype through
which a person using a regular phone can call
and connect to a skyper.
SkypeOut: A service that allows a skyper to call a
regular telephone using the Skype software.
Skype Me: A mode of alerting the world that you
are available for contact and making new friends.

Going wireless
Skype delivers a new kind of freedom — the ability to make and receive calls
wirelessly and without even needing a computer. A new type of phone, called
a Wi-Fi phone, has Skype already built in and can tap into wireless or Wi-Fi 
networks. When you’re connected to a network, whether from your office,
home, or public Internet hot spot, you can use Skype. With these devices, you
sign on to Skype as you would from your computer and you’re good to go.
Software and gadgets, too
When you connect through Skype, you need some way to speak and hear
your conversations on Skype. Most computers have an audio jack for a
microphone and a speaker out line. If you don’t already have a microphone
and headset, you can purchase them inexpensively. Bluetooth (wireless)
headsets, USB headsets, USB speakerphones, mini-plug headsets, and built-in
microphones are available in all colors and sizes, some with noise cancella-
tion, volume control, and mute buttons. You have many choices.
The capabilities of Skype are not limited to traditional “telephone” calls.
Skype supports videoconferencing, for which you’ll need a good webcam.
You can record interviews and save them as media files with Skype, so you’ll
need recording and playback software. If you like to skype but don’t like to be
stuck at a desk, you can skype from digital handsets known as Skype Phones
that work within 50 feet of your computer. You can even store your whole
Skype operation on a USB drive, travel the world, and simply plug and play
wherever you land. Chapter 11 covers a galaxy of Skype gadgets and soft-
ware, so get ready to go where no one has gone before!
Making Skype Play Well with Others
Unlike telephones, Skype is a social butterfly capable of connecting a handful
of people for a conference call, up to a hundred people for a chat, or a hundred
people for a Skypecast. But as with all social butterflies, you have to set down
some rules. These rules and guidelines are spelled out in the various chapters
on Skype conferencing (Chapter 10), chats (Chapter 6), and Skypecasting
(Chapter 14).
15
Chapter 1: What’s All the Hoopla about Skype?

When enterprise security matters
Skype can pass text, data, voice, and video through firewalls and routers
without requiring special setup. For this reason, Skype can bypass normal IT
security controls. However, Skype can be deployed and configured to pro-
hibit file transfers over Skype and using the Skype API. Chapter 12 provides
some suggestions on how to deploy Skype in this locked-down mode.
When the Web is your playground
Skype mingles easily with social, business, and e-commerce networks, such
as Bebo and eBay (see Chapter 13). Skype social communites of all stripes —
for dating and friendship, education, special interests — are connecting
people from all over the world.
When you sign on to these Web-based communities, your Skype Name is
posted along with your email and any other contact information you provide.
On these online communities, a little icon next to your Skype Name changes
when you are online, offline, or just don’t want to be interrupted. But the best
part is that although everyone has your Skype Name, you can require people
to ask permission to speak with you (see Chapter 4). A little different from
annoying sales calls at dinner, isn’t it?

Chapter 2
Hooking Up with Skype
In this Chapter
 Downloading and installing Skype
 Establishing your Skype Name
 Presenting yourself to the world with your Skype Profile
 Testing your connection settings
 Eliminating feedback and echoes
 Making your first Skype call
 Searching for fellow skypers
S
etting up Skype and getting it working for you is not difficult, and you can
do it using the quick steps presented in Chapter 1. Knowing about the
process in greater detail, however, will help you get comfortable with Skype
more quickly. That’s what this chapter is for. Also in this chapter, you find out
how to install Skype and create a new account; how to fill in your profile to
let the world know who you are; how to find others on Skype; and, best of all,
what to do to make a Skype call and start speaking to the rest of the world
through your computer.
As mentioned in Chapter 1, the Web pages on www.skype.com are con-
stantly being enhanced. So, they may change from time to time. Don’t be 
surprised if the Web pages you’re looking at don’t exactly match the screen
shots in this book.
Downloading and Installing Skype
Ready to get started? First, pick up the latest version of Skype:
1. With your Internet browser open, enter www.skype.com in the
address line to open the Home page of the Skype Web site.
2. Click the Download button on the Skype home page to open the
Download page.

3. Click the link for the computer platform that you use to download the
software and then click the word Download immediately under the
name of the platform you just clicked (see Figure 2-1).
Skype works on Windows, Macintosh, Linux, and Pocket PC. In most of
the examples in this book, we use Windows, but we also discuss, where
appropriate, differences with other platforms.
4. Click the Download button (see Figure 2-1) to download Skype to your
hard drive.
The appearance of the download page and download button varies by
computer platform. On the Mac and Skype for Pocket PC, the button
says Download Now. You have to pick the particular variant of Linux you
want to download and then save the software to your hard drive.
After you click to download the program, you may be prompted to save
or open the program SkypeSetup.exe. Always choose to save the file to
your hard drive. Do not open or run the program during the download
process.
Skype often posts two types of downloads, the general public version
and the next new beta version. If you are just starting out, it’s best to
download the general public version because it’s more stable. In time,
the beta version will become the public version, and you can upgrade.
Figure 2-1:

Skype.
18
Part I: Getting Started with Skype 

5. Select Save to Disk.
Choose an easy-to-remember location, such as the Windows Desktop,
and click OK. Remember this location so that you can double-click the
file after it is saved.
When your download is complete and the program is saved to disk, follow
these steps to install the program:
1. Double-click the SkypeSetup program that you just saved.
If you are on Windows, you will see a little blue-and-white cube that says
SkypeSetup.exe. If you are on a Mac, you will see a standard installer
icon that looks like a disk drive but is colored blue and white with a big
Skype S on top.
2. When the installer program launches, it asks you to choose a 
language; select it from a drop-down list (see Figure 2-2). 
The installer program then asks you to read and accept the End User
License Agreement. You need to accept this to continue the installation.
3. Click the Options button (refer to Figure 2-2).
The Options page that results (see Figure 2-3) asks you to select where
Skype should be installed. In the field provided, enter the path to the
selected location. You can also click Browse to simply select a location
to install Skype.
You also have the choice to launch Skype as soon as the installation is
complete. This box is already checked. If you don’t want Skype to start
up right away, deselect the box by clicking it.
Figure 2-2:
Choose
among

19
Chapter 2: Hooking Up with Skype

4. Click Install.
Skype is installed and automatically launches (unless you deselected the
Launch Skype check box on the Options screen).
Just in case you want to use Skype in a language other than English, you have
a considerable range of options with a growing list of languages, including 
the following: Arabic, Bulgarian, Chinese Simplified, Chinese Traditional,
Czech, Danish, German, Estonian, French, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian,
Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Dutch, Polish, Portuguese, Brazilian
Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Finnish, Swedish, and Turkish. 
(Try saying that all in one breath!)
Choosing Your Skype 
Name and Password
When you launch Skype for the first time, you see the Sign In to Skype
window, shown in Figure 2-4.
To use Skype, you must set up a Skype Name and password. A Skype Name is
what other people on Skype see when they contact you. You use your Skype
Name to log on to Skype in combination with a password. Because you choose
your Skype Name, pick one that’s unique to you and easy to remember.
Figure 2-3:
Customizing
your Skype
installation.
20
Part I: Getting Started with Skype 

To establish your Skype Name and password, follow these steps:
1. Click the Don’t have a Skype Name? link (refer to Figure 2-4).
The Create a New Account page opens.
2. In the Enter Skype Name box, enter the name that you’ve decided 
to use.
One of the first questions that may pop into your mind is, “How will all
my friends and family find me on Skype?” If you already have a screen
name that you use for your email, try using the same name or something
very similar on Skype. However, be aware that Skype Names must start
with a letter and not include spaces. Skype Names also must be between
6 and 32 characters long, including letters and numbers. All Skype
Names are converted to lowercase letters, even if you use uppercase 
letters when you create your account. 
What if you have a great idea for your Skype Name but somebody else
beat you to it and registered the name on Skype? For that possibility,
Skype offers you alternative names to pick from — but also allows you
to set one of your own choosing (see Figure 2-5).
3. Choose a password and enter it in the Password box.
A Skype password must be at least four characters long. All Skype 
passwords are case sensitive.
You are asked to enter your password again in a second Password box
to make sure that you entered it accurately.
Figure 2-4:
Launching
Skype for
the first
time.
21
Chapter 2: Hooking Up with Skype

Pick a password that is easy for you to remember but difficult, of course,
for others to guess. A good technique is to pick two short but unrelated
words and separate them by some nonalphabetical characters — for
example, latte67chair.
4. Select the check box to accept the Skype End User License Agreement
and the Skype Privacy Statement.
Although you agree to the License Agreement when you download
Skype, you must check it again when you create an account before you
can successfully log on to Skype.
5. Click Next to continue to another Create Your Account Screen; there,
enter your email address.
Entering your email address is optional but recommended. Be sure to fill
this in. Email is the only way to retrieve a lost Skype password. Also, if
you don’t have email, you’ll have a difficult time making use of features
such as SkypeOut and SkypeIn (see Chapter 8).
6. Enter your country, region, and city.
This information is optional, but it’s useful when other skypers search
for you.
After you complete the Skype Name information, a page that looks much, if not
exactly, the same as that shown in Figure 2-6 appears. Click the Sign In button
to launch Skype. Skype is now live and ready to use, and you are greeted with a
helpful Getting Started guide. We encourage you to take the time to view this
simple tutorial, although you can find out how to perform all these tasks in this
book as well. The guide walks you through the general steps for:

Chapter 2: Hooking Up with Skype
What’s your Skype handle?
Choosing a Skype Name that represents your
personality, a character trait, or physical trait
recalls the “handle” craze in the 1970s, when
Citizen Band, or CB, radio became popular. CB
radio owners picked unique names, known as
“handles,” to identify themselves to other CB
radio operators.
CB radio was a free radio frequency set up by
the Federal Communication Commission in 1947.
CB radio is limited to a ten-mile radius — big
enough for plenty of conversation on a highway
filled with truckers. As with Skype, CB radio
operators loved the fact that the calls were free.
We wouldn’t be surprised if many of those pas-
sionate radio hams decide to use their old han-
dles with this new version of the “people’s
phone system,” Skype.
Your Skype “handle” is an opportunity to invent
your own branding. What you decide to call
yourself should also be influenced by whether
you plan to use your Skype Name for business,
personal, or both purposes. In considering your
Skype Name and how you fill out the whole
Skype profile, strive for balance between for-
mality and self-expression.

Filling Out Your Skype Profile: 
Making It Profile You
Every new Skype member has an opportunity to enter information into a 
personal profile screen. You don’t have to fill in any information; profiles are
completely optional. The Skype Profile window clearly states that whatever
details are included are “details that only my contacts will see” (see Figure
2-7). So, don’t feel obligated to fill in the blanks!
There are some good reasons, however, to populate those empty profile
fields. The benefits of adding information are to
 Help others find you in a Skype search if they don’t have your Skype Name
 Give clients easy access to telephone contact numbers that you 
make public
 Show new friends your photo
 Post an image of your business logo
 Provide contacts with a link to your Web site
 Show your local time so that others know when to contact you

Skype
Profile is

see you.

Part I: Getting Started with Skype 

Your Skype Name is not part of your profile. A Skype Name is not optional.
You need it to log on to Skype and to enable other skypers to contact you.
Your profile details give more information about who you are and what you
do. You can let the world know whether you are a businessperson, an artist,
an author, a fiddler, or just a seasoned skyper looking for a few friends to
hang out with online. As more and more people use Skype for business, spe-
cial interest groups, educational venues, and social gatherings, their location,
language, and other personal information may form the basis for a common
interest or mutual benefit. Personalizing Skype is more than self-expression;
in some cases, it is a courtesy to others reaching out to you.
To open your Skype Profile screen, choose File➪Edit My Profile from the
Skype menu. You have the option to fill in the following fields:
 Full Name: The first bit of information you can publish to the world in
your personal profile window is your full name. Many of us shy away
from offering our real names to the virtual world; others find it liberating
to invent an identity; and some prefer to be completely anonymous.
However, there are advantages to adding your real name to your profile:
• Adding your full name makes it easy for others to find you on
Skype.
• If you use Skype for business, your full name is a vital piece of
information for clients to access.
• In a conference call or chat, any member of the group can look up
your profile to find your name. If many people are conferencing or
chatting for the first time, forgetting a name is easy, and it’s handy
to have it available.
 Gender: Potential dates certainly want to know this fact. If your first
name is slightly ambiguous (think of all those male Leslies, and Lorens,
one of the authors of this book), filling out your gender might just turn
out to be the happiest bit of information you share with the world.
Gender is another option that can help you (or others) narrow a search
in the Skype directory. If gender is not included in a person’s profile, it is
not searchable. 
 Birth Date: Most people are reluctant to reveal this detail. There are,
however, some reasons to include your age, such as if
• You are open to meeting people your own age.
• You are an advocate for a specific age group, such as teens, the
elderly, or baby boomers.
25
Chapter 2: Hooking Up with Skype

 Country/Region, State/Province, or City: Skype is international. It’s
important for callers to have some idea of where they are calling.
Knowing where someone lives, and letting others know where you live,
can help you both prepare for cultural differences in communication.
Whether used for business or social reasons, this is an essential piece 
of information for smooth customer relationships. In addition,
• All locations are searchable in the Skype directory.
• Location provides information on local time zones. If this informa-
tion is not included elsewhere in the profile, at least you’ll know
when to call (and when not to call).
 Language: Choose your language from a drop-down list.
• Indicating your native tongue lets callers know whether they share 
your language. If they don’t, they may choose to engage a transla-
tor in advance.
• Language is a searchable item in the Skype directory.
 Home Phone/Office Phone/Mobile Phone: Skype allows you to list
three phone numbers, one for home, office, and cell. Some good reasons
to add these numbers are the following:
• Your Skype profile is available worldwide, so your phone numbers
have a global reach. If your phone number is listed in your local
phone directory or your business is listed in the Yellow Pages, you
would do well to place the equivalent listing in your Skype profile.
• You can update your telephone information on Skype instantly.
This feature enables you to provide the most current contact 
information, even if you are in the middle of a major relocation.
Updating local directories, or even Web listings, takes much longer.
• If someone cannot contact you on Skype, your profile gives that
person options in an emergency. People can SkypeOut to you from
within the Skype program, or just use a cell or landline. In either
case, they have instant access to your phone numbers.
 Homepage: It costs nothing to create a Skype account and list a Web
page that you want all the world to see. The Homepage box has room 
for only one Web address, but it can be an effective contact tool for you
because:
• Web site links are active. A contact can navigate to your Web site
directly from your profile.
• Posting a Web site in your profile is free advertising for your busi-
ness, product, service, or just yourself.
26
Part I: Getting Started with Skype 

 About Me: This is your chance to tell your story in 200 characters or
fewer (note that it’s 200 characters, not words). Plenty can be said in a
few words. You can
• Describe your business.
• Put in a short bio.
• List your hobbies, collections, or favorite activities.
 Adding a photo or artwork: You can add a 96-x-96–pixel graphic to your
profile. The format for your graphic must be JPEG or BMP. You can add 
a picture in two ways:
• Click the picture box in the lower-left corner of your profile
window. A My Picture screen opens. Click Browse to search 
for a picture you have prepared in your computer.
• Click the Change button to the right of the picture box. Doing so
also brings you to the My Picture screen. Click Browse and search
for a picture.
Your picture is visible only to your Skype contacts, that is, only people
you have in your approved contact list. People who find your Skype pro-
file in a search will not be able to see your picture until you give them
permission (see Chapter 4).
You may have hundreds of approved contacts, but you may post only
one picture. Pictures make your Skype profile more personal. They can
identify you with a business, club, or charity. They can add humor. Some
pictures on profile pages include:
• A business logo
• A recreation picture, such as skiing, surfing, or golfing
• A head shot
• A cartoon
• A favorite landscape
See Chapter 5 for more about including graphics with your profile.
 Show My Time: Skype is available 24 hours a day in all time zones.
Letting your contacts know your local time or time zone (only your con-
tacts will see your time zone) is important. Your profile page enables
you to do indicate your time zone in two ways:
• Click in the Show My Time box. This action displays the actual
time of day as shown on your watch or wall clock.
• Select a GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) zone from the drop-down list
provided (see Chapter 10 for more details).
27
Chapter 2: Hooking Up with Skype

 Show How Many Contacts I Have: Unless you tell it to do otherwise,
Skype automatically displays how many Skype contacts you have.
Although it is nice to share how many contacts you have, you may not
want to convey this information. Simply deselect the Show How Many
Contacts I Have check box.
 Email: You can provide up to three email addresses. These are com-
pletely private; no one, not even your contacts, can see these on your
profile. Even if no one can see them, there are two reasons to include
email addresses, as follows:
• If you forget your Skype password, you will need your email
address to retrieve it.
• People who have your email address can use it to search for your
Skype Name, even if the email address does not appear in any
Skype directory.
One great activity is to look up your own last name in the Skype search
window and see whether you find distant family members in other countries.
Some delightful surprises come out of this activity. In fact, we (Loren and
Susan) recently found a cousin from England we’d never met and we spoke
for the first time over Skype.

Part I: Getting Started with Skype 
Welcome to the skyper clan
In our example screen shots used throughout
this book, we show examples with various Skype
Names. In the early chapters, NewbieSkyper
appears often in our screen shots and exam-
ples. Later chapters contain numerous screen
shots of SeasonedSkyper. You’ll also see
TheProfessionalSkyper and CuriousSkyper.
I’m NewbieSkyper. Like yourself, I’m
new to Skype. I’ve heard about this
cutting-edge stuff called Skype and
thought that using it would be hard,
but it’s much easier than I thought.
I’m SeasonedSkyper. Skype has be-
come an integral part of my life. I have
friends and relatives overseas whom I
call regularly. With Bluetooth (see
Chapter 11), I am no longer tethered or
wired to my computer. I just started
using a webcam with Skype. I am
hooked!
I’m TheProfessionalSkyper. I train my
clients using Web conferencing in
conjunction with Skype. This makes it
easy to use applications, discuss
business strategies, transfer files, and
log communications with my partners
around the globe.
I’m CuriousSkyper. I like to call people I
don’t know and find out whatever I can.

You have a number of available options for setting the time that will be dis-
played. Generally, it is easiest and best to set the time to match your local
computer. If you are traveling for the week and will be in an entirely different
time zone, you can manually set the displayed time to match a specified time
zone. For example, if you reside on the east coast of the United States, the
local time zone is –5:00 GMT. If you are traveling to San Francisco, which is on
the west coast of the United States, you can set your time zone to –8:00 GMT,
because it is three hours earlier in San Francisco. When people view your
name on the Skype Contacts list, they see the time associated with where you
are traveling.
Testing Your Connection
Before you talk to someone, you should test your audio equipment to 
make sure that you have it properly connected and the volume levels are 
set appropriately.
To test your connection, follow these steps:
1. Double-click your Skype icon on the desktop or choose Start➪
All Programs➪Skype to launch Skype.
The main Skype window, which simply shows “Skype” followed by your
Skype Name across the top, appears and looks similar to the one shown
in Figure 2-8. If for some reason the main Skype window is obscured,
repeatedly press Alt+Tab on the PC or Option+Tab on the Mac to cycle
through all open applications until you navigate to the Skype application.

2. Enter echo123 in the text entry box that contains the text “Type Skype
Name or number with country code.”
Normally, this box is where you would enter the Skype Name or number
of the person you want to call, but entering echo123 connects you to the
Skype Call Testing Service.
3. Click the large, round green icon that appears just below the text entry.
The green call button represents a handset and is the one you click 
to place a call. (The red hang up button next to it is for hanging up or
closing calls.) Clicking the green button connects you to the Skype Call
Testing Service (see Figure 2-9). When you’re connected, you hear a 
personable voice calmly guiding you through an audio test.
4. Leave a short message when prompted, up to ten seconds long, and
listen for your message to be repeated.
If you don’t hear your message, something’s wrong!
The Skype Call Testing service allows you to hear how you sound when you
call others. Perhaps your volume is too soft or too loud, or nonexistent. This
is a good time to set things right before you attempt your first Skype call.
Here are some quick tips and suggestions for troubleshooting your sound
problems. The end of this section provides a link to a more comprehensive
troubleshooting guide on the Skype Web site.
If you have sound problems when making a Skype call, try the following:
 Make sure that your headphone and microphone jacks are plugged
into the right audio in and audio out sockets on your computer. Try
reversing the order.
 Compare your Windows Sound settings with your Skype Sound set-
tings. To locate your Skype Sound settings, choose Tools➪Options➪
Sound Devices. To locate your Windows Sound settings, choose Start➪
Control Panel➪Sounds and Audio Devices. (This path may differ on
some computers with different operating systems and configuration
setups, but your aim is to locate the Sounds and Audio Devices control
panel.) Make sure that the sound devices match.
 If your voice sounds very quiet to others over Skype, first try moving
your microphone a little closer to you. If moving your microphone
doesn’t work, try this: Choose Tools➪Options➪Sound Devices and 
deselect the check box next to Let Skype Adjust My Sound Device set-
tings. Skype no longer automatically sets the volume, thereby allowing
other programs, including your operating system, to set the volume for
sound input and output.
30
Part I: Getting Started with Skype 

 If no one can hear you, you may have the wrong device selected in
your Skype sound settings. If more than one device is listed, make sure
that the device selected is the microphone you are using. For example, if
you’re using a microphone that connects through a USB port, be sure
that you’ve selected a Sound setting that tells your computer to find the
mic in that port.
 If you can’t hear anything, you may have the wrong audio out device
selected in your Skype sound settings. If more than one device is listed,
make sure that the device selected matches the headset or speakers you
are using.
You can find advanced help in setting up your sound devices at www.skype.
com/help/guides/soundsetup.html.
You can hear the same call-testing service in Chinese if you skype 
echo-chinese (include the hyphen) instead of echo123. Another 
one is soundtestjapanese for Japanese.

Chapter 2: Hooking Up with Skype

Eliminating feedback
You may encounter some feedback problems when using Skype, but these
have simple solutions, as the next sections explain.
Feedback you can hear
Even if you are prepared with the appropriate headgear for Skype calls —
meaning that your headset/microphone unit is plugged into your computer —
the person you are calling may not be as prepared. If you skype someone who
is using his or her built-in microphone and no headset, you will hear feedback.
That is, you will hear yourself a couple of seconds after you speak because
your voice is coming back through the other person’s built-in microphone.
Your Skype partner will think all is okay because he or she doesn’t have the
same feedback problem (you have eliminated echoes by virtue of using a
headset). So, encourage people to use Skype with the proper equipment.
Trying to talk through a feedback loop is no fun!
If you don’t have a regular microphone, you can actually substitute it with
any available set of headphones. Just plug the headphone into the micro-
phone jack and speak into the earpiece. Of course, you need an extra headset
to use as a, well, headset! Go ahead and try it. We did, and it actually works.
We heard the giggles loud and clear.
Feedback you can see
Sometimes the person on the other end does not have a microphone handy
or can’t talk out loud because he or she is in a meeting, for example. In such 
a case, you may be the only one talking while your Skype partner is using the
chat window. (See Chapter 6 for details of how to conduct a talk/chat simulta-
neously.) This mode of communicating actually works more smoothly than
you might think. Other uses for this alternative to voice chat is for skyping in
a noisy office or with people with hearing difficulties. How many times have
you wished that you could hold up a sign to a person on the other end of the
telephone because the person couldn’t make out what you were saying? The
chat window is like having a built-in captioning service.
Making Your First Skype Call
Congratulations! Assuming that you’ve installed Skype, created a Skype
Name, and tested your connections, you’re ready to start skyping. The 
question is, Whom can you call?
32
Part I: Getting Started with Skype 

Conducting a simple search 
for a fellow skyper
You can get started by searching for fellow skypers. To do that, follow 
these steps:
1. Locate the Windows Start button on the lower-left corner of your
desktop and choose Start➪Skype to launch Skype. 
The Sign In to Skype window opens.
2. Enter your Skype username (that is, your Skype Name) in the Skype
Name box.
3. Enter your Password in the Password box.
4. Click Sign In.
The Skype program window opens. The menu across the top contains
File, View, Contacts, Tools, Call, and Help. (Check out Chapter 3 for
details about each of these menu items.)
5. From the Skype menu, choose Contacts➪Search for Skype Users.
Alternatively, you can click the Search icon to bring up the Search
window, shown in Figure 2-10.
6. Enter the person’s name in the uppermost text box.
In our example, the name Newbie Skyper appears in that box (refer to
Figure 2-10).
You can start your search by entering a full name. If your friend has 
not added his or her name to a profile, you may not be able to find 
the person this way. (The last section in this chapter provides some
additional information about searching.)
7. Click Search.
Skype searches through its directory to find the name you entered.
When found, this name appears in the lower half of the Search window
under “We found 1 contact.”
33
Chapter 2: Hooking Up with Skype

Initiating a call
Now that you’ve located someone you want to call, you’re just one click away
from a Skype conversation. To make a call from your Search window, follow
these steps:
1. Double-click the contact’s Skype Name to bring up your contact’s pro-
file window.
2. Click the green call button.
This button appears as a green circle with a white telephone handset
inside. When you click it, you hear the sound of a ringing telephone, and
a call window appears. The call window contains:
• The Skype Name of the person you are calling.
• A photo, if posted, in his or her profile.
• A red hang up button.
3. When your contact answers the call, just talk!
Sometimes your call is not accepted because you are not an authorized con-
tact for that person. Receiving authorization and adding names to your
Contacts list is an important part of communicating on Skype. This topic is
covered at length in Chapter 4.

Part I: Getting Started with Skype 

Using the Skype search directory
The ability to search Skype is a powerful feature. Although you can search for
a Skype Name, full name, or email address, you can narrow your search
based on a set of filters. An example of narrowing a search this way is shown
in Figure 2-11. Although this search example is contrived, the search results
are filtered using a specific age group and gender.
The Skype search directory gives you a number of ways to look for fellow
skypers. Sometimes it is difficult to find the person you are looking for
because he or she has not entered much information in a Skype profile. But
you can still perform a successful search because you have several search
options. If your Search window is not open, click the Search icon (looks like a
spyglass) or, in the Skype menu, choose Contacts➪Search for Skype Users.
You can search by adding one or more of the following search options:
 Use the Search for Skype User box to:
Enter a full name.
Enter an email address. This information is not revealed in a pro-
file, but if you know someone’s email address, you can use it to
find that contact if the person put it in his or her profile.
Enter a Skype Name. Sometimes you have a Skype Name but no
other information. You can search and then open a profile to find a
time zone, full name, or Web site for further contact.
Figure 2-11:

filters to

35
Chapter 2: Hooking Up with Skype

 Search by location. If you don’t have a name or an email address, you can
always try searching by location. If only a few Skype Names show up in an
area, you might be able to find an individual. Looking by location also
gives you an opportunity to meet skypers close by. To search this way:
Select a country or region from a drop-down list.
Enter a city, state, or both by entering the names into the boxes
provided.
 Search by language. Select your language from a drop-down list.
Language searches work best in combination with other parameters
unless you are looking for something very specific, such as people who
speak Vighur, Volapuk, or Shona living in Manhattan, Kansas.
 Search by gender or age range.
 Search people in Skype Me mode. Skype lets you display your online
status (see Chapter 3), and Skype Me mode is an online status that lets
the world know you are eager to receive calls and chats from anyone.
When you search for skypers, you may want to select the Search People
in Skype Me Mode box. Selecting this box guarantees that the people
you find are people who want to talk.
You can mix and match all the search parameters. When you have everything
entered in the Search window:
 Click Search to find skypers matching your search terms. Scroll through
the results of your inquiry.
 Click Search again after changing the search parameters if you did not
see the skypers you want to contact.
You can sort the order of the search results by clicking the appropriate
header bar of the search results.
If you use multiple Skype accounts and have just one email account for all of
them, all the accounts will turn up in a search.
Other than the email addresses you place into your profile, all the informa-
tion you place into your profile is visible. People can find you by searching
Skype using your email address only if they already know it.
Although you can opt to leave much of your profile blank, you will find that
populating your profile with information such as language and country is
helpful because this information is displayed in the search results. As the
number of users in the global Skype community grows, people trying to find
you have an easier time doing so with this extra information.

In This Chapter
 Finding your way around Skype’s menus and toolbar
 Announcing and changing your Skype status
 Getting help
S
o, now that Skype has found a home on your PC, you need to get in gear
so that you can drive Skype with precision and ease. As with a new car,
the console might be seem a little confusing at first. When you know where
everything is, though, you’ll find Skype to be a smooth ride. This chapter
eases you into the driver’s seat.
These pages familiarize you with the six main menus and toolbar in Skype 
so that you know right where to go for whatever task or activity you want to
engage in. Consider this chapter as your tour guide for getting around in
Skype. If we don’t cover the full details of a given feature here, we tell you
where in the book to go for more details about it.
You also find out about the various status icons that Skype uses to indicate 
a user’s status (online, offline, and others) and how to change your status.
Finally, we tell you about where to find the help you might need on occasion,
steering you in the right direction both within the software and on Skype’s
Web site. The creators of Skype want you to go from 0 to 60 mph in the short-
est amount of time so that you can feel comfortable and productive. The
menu is designed to help you become a player in the Skype global commu-
nity as quickly as you can say “Skype Me!”
Understanding the Skype Menus
Just as Skype is a breeze to install, Skype is equally easy to navigate and use.
The Skype menus make doing essential tasks simple. Here’s a quick summary

before we get into the details: On the File menu, you establish your online
presence, profile, and account information. The View menu enables you to
control which elements you want visible in your main Skype window. On the
Contacts menu, you manage the list of all your Skype buddies. Use the Tools
menu to make conference calls, use SkypeOut, set up SkypeIn, send SMS mes-
sages, and open previous chats. The Tools menu also enables you to config-
ure your Skype Options, or various settings. You use the Call menu to manage
your calls. Finally, the Help menu assists you in finding specific information
concerning setup information, checking for updates, and buying Skype credit.
Read on for details of each Skype menu.
The File menu
Fasten your seatbelts! We begin our tour of the Skype menus with the options
on the File menu.
Change Online Status
When you view your list of Skype contacts, you can immediately see whether
your buddies are available to take a call. Every skyper, yourself included, has
an online status. By default, Skype announces whether you’re online and
available to skypers who have you listed in their Skype Contacts list. You can
override this default by changing your online status. Also, you get to control
who can see whether you are online. (See Chapter 4 for details.)
Edit My Profile
Your Skype profile contains important information about you, some of which
is used only for administrative purposes. Other portions of your profile are
shared only with your Skype contacts. A third portion of your profile is
always publicly available for any skyper to search. Use your Skype profile to
set what information you want to appear in all three categories of your profile
(see Chapter 4).
My Skype Account
There are two reasons to go to your Skype account: to revise your password
and to manage your account. The latter includes tasks such as adding to your
Skype credit (see Chapters 8 and 12) and setting up SkypeIn and Voicemail
(see Chapter 8). You can review your history of SkypeOut calls, including to
whom you made the calls, what dates and times, and amounts charged, if any.
Sign Out
When you are using Skype, you are logged in using a specific Skype user 
ID, called your Skype Name. Signing out doesn’t actually quit the Skype 
program — it just logs you off and allows you to log back in using a different
38
Part I: Getting Started with Skype 

Skype Name. Skype remembers which users you previously logged in as (see
Figure 3-1). If you and several of your family members are sharing a computer,
this feature makes it easy for one person to log out and another to log back 
in quickly.
When you are signed out, some menu options are still available to you. These
include your Skype Account page, language settings, specialized network
proxy settings (covered in Chapter 4), and the general help features.
Close
The close action simply closes your Skype window so that one less window
takes up space view on your screen. Skype never stops running, and you can
make and receive calls just the same. You just have a little less visual clutter.
The View menu
The View menu displays which components of Skype’s interface are visible
on your screen (see Figure 3-2). Those that are visible appear with a check
mark next to them. You can change the setting by selecting the item from 
the menu. Selecting a checked item in the menu makes the check mark disap-
pear and causes the respective item in Skype to disappear. If you select an
unchecked item in the menu, a check mark appears — and the corresponding
item appears.

Chapter 3: Getting Familiar with Skype’s Interface

Wisely, the Skype installation defaults make the toolbar, addressbar, and status-
bar all visible (checked). You can remove these elements from view if you
want, but why make life more confusing?
View Toolbar
The toolbar makes it easy to add and search for contacts, conveniently call
ordinary phones and set up conference calls, start a text chat or send a short
SMS message (see Chapter 10 for more info on SMS messages), send files
from your computer to fellow skypers, and look up the profile of one of your
contacts or people you are about to call.
View Addressbar
The addressbar is the location where you can type in a Skype contact name,
a regular phone number, or even an Outlook contact name if you have
Outlook running. You can find out more about your Outlook contacts later 
in this section.
If you have History Quickfiltering turned on (this is one of the advanced
options settings discussed in Chapter 4), you need enter only a portion of the
name or phone number. Those contacts or phone numbers with portions of
text that match your entry are filtered and displayed. This handy feature
enables you to locate your contacts easily and quickly.
View Statusbar
The left side of your statusbar shows your current online status. When you
click the status icon, a context menu pops up and allows you to change the
status from the available options. These options are spelled out a little later
in the chapter.
While you’re on a call, the statusbar displays the name of whom you are
speaking to. If you’re on a conference call, the statusbar displays that fact.
The right side of the statusbar displays how many skypers are online.

View Dial
Use the Skype Dial tab to assist you in making calls to ordinary phones. This
facility is especially useful in placing international calls. Three quick steps
are involved:
1. Click the flag symbol or country name to which you are placing a call.
This action sets the appropriate country or region code.
2. Enter the local number along with area code.
3. Click the green call button to place the call.
There is also a link for calling rates.
If you are calling a place of business, you may be prompted to click certain
keys such as the pound (#) or star (*) key, or an extension number. Click the
dial pad keys as appropriate.
Unlike a PC-to-PC Skype call, SkypeOut and SkypeIn calls are not encrypted
over the connection from the landline or cell phone up to the point where the
phone line signal reaches the Internet. If you need to conduct a secure call,
make sure that both you and your colleagues are connecting from PC to PC.
Show Live Tab
Those of you who are using the latest version of Skype may have the option
to view ongoing Skypecasts directly from your SkypeLive panel. Selecting the
Show Live Tab menu item makes the SkypeLive tab and panel visible.
Show Text on Toolbar
The icons in your Skype toolbar for adding contacts, searching, calling phones,
conference calling, chats, sending SMS, files, and looking up a skyper’s profile
are pretty easy to figure out. Although you can forego text captions underneath
each of the icons, you lose nothing by keeping the text captions.
Show Text on Tabs
Each of the tabs (including Contacts, Dial, and History) in the Skype menu
has an icon as well as a brief text description. If you want, you can eliminate
the text description appearing next to the icon on the tabs.
Show Contact Groups
As your list of contacts starts to grow, you may find organizing them into 
specific groups helpful. For example, perhaps you hold conference calls 
with members of a committee you chair in a company of organization. Try
selecting all of them if your Contacts list grows from multiples of tens into 
the hundreds, or possibly thousands! In this case, you can definitely benefit
from defining groups and use them to organize your contacts.

Chapter 3: Getting Familiar with Skype’s Interface

Show Outlook Contacts
One of the nice features of Skype is how you can easily tap into your list of
contacts that reside in Microsoft Outlook. To make use of this capability,
simply run Outlook at the same time that you have Skype running. Skype can
read the list of Outlook contacts and phone numbers. When you look at your
Contacts list within Skype, you see your Outlook contacts as well. The steps
involved are as follows:
1. Start Skype and then start Microsoft Outlook.
2. In your Skype application, if no check mark appears next to Show
Outlook Contacts in the View menu, choose View➪Show Outlook
Contacts.
When you view your contacts, your Outlook contacts and their phone
numbers are listed along with the Skype contacts. You can call anyone
from your Outlook contacts directly from Skype.
Contacts menu
Another great feature of Skype is not having to worry about toting your list 
of contacts and installing them on each computer you run Skype on. Skype
conveniently manages your Skype contacts on a central repository some-
where out in the “Skype-o-sphere.” The Skype Contacts menu (see Figure 3-3)
has tasks for adding contacts, searching for Skype users, importing contacts,
sending contacts to another skyper, backing up and restoring contacts to and
from a file, and managing blocked users.
Read on for useful information about the options in the Contacts menu.
Add a Contact
When you add a contact, you can do so by one of two methods (see Figure 3-4):
Figure 3-3:
Find all your
Skype
Name and
SkypeOut
contacts in
this menu.
42
Part I: Getting Started with Skype 

 Find someone already in the Skype central database of Skype users.
 Add a SkypeOut phone number of someone who is not in any data-
base: For example, if you want to add your favorite cousin Jack to your
list of contacts but Jack is not yet using Skype, you can list Jack’s tele-
phone number as a SkypeOut phone number. This way, you can quickly
call Jack from your Skype contacts.
Search for Skype Users
Selecting this option opens a general search page that allows you to search
the Skype central repository for registered Skype users (and there are more
than 100 million of them!).
Here are several reasons you may want to search for a Skype user:
 To call or chat with a person.
 To add that user to your Contacts list and ask for the user’s contact
details.
 To look up the user’s Skype profile to find out about that person. As a
practical matter, this may be a person who is contacting you and request-
ing that you share your contact details. You may not recognize the person’s
identity. Looking at the person’s public profile may help you figure out who
is contacting you and determine his or her purpose for reaching you.
See Chapter 2 for more about searching for fellow skypers.
Import Contacts
Selecting the Import Contacts option launches a wizard that lets you import
your contacts from Outlook and the Outlook Express Address Book. The
import process does not require that you have Outlook or Outlook Express
actively running.
Figure 3-4:

Chapter 3: Getting Familiar with Skype’s Interface

If you’re using Windows, follow these steps to import contacts from Outlook
(steps for importing on the Mac are covered next):
1. Select whether you want to import your contacts from Outlook, or the
Outlook Express Address Book, or both.
When the import process is about to start, Microsoft Outlook pops up a
window and tells you that another program is trying to access your
email addresses stored in Outlook.
2. Select the Allow Access check box and then set the duration of
allowed access to, say, 10 minutes (see Figure 3-5).
While Skype is importing names from Outlook, it also searches the Skype
central repository to see whether any of the people who are listed in
your Outlook contacts list are already registered users on Skype. At the
end of its search, it provides you a list of potential matches.
3. Review the Skype profile of your potential matches and select the
names you want included.
When Skype finds Outlook contacts to be imported that have email
addresses and are not already on your Contacts list, Skype asks you to
select any of those contacts you would like to invite to join Skype.
4. Click Finish to complete the import process.
You can always re-import your Outlook contacts without worrying that you
will create duplicate entries in your Skype Contacts list.
Importing on the Mac works much the same as it does on Windows:
1. On the Mac platform, choose Contacts➪Import Contacts.
The Import Contacts window appears.
2. Select the various data sources and type of information you want 
to import.
Figure 3-5:
Allowing
Skype to

44
Part I: Getting Started with Skype 

When you import contacts with versions of Skype for Mac earlier than 1.5, be
aware of the following caveats:
 You can import phone numbers only from the system Address Book.
 Telephone numbers appearing in the Address Book must begin with the
international plus sign (+) prefix in order to be imported.
 The only information that gets imported is phone numbers. No other
general contact information gets imported.
When you import contacts with version 1.5 of Skype for Mac:
 You can specify whether you want to import contacts from the system
Address Book, Microsoft Entourage, or both.
 You can restrict the import to phone numbers only.
 You are not restricted to importing phone numbers starting with a plus
sign (+) prefix.
Send Contacts
A nice and probably underused feature of Skype is the ability to forward con-
tacts from your Contacts list to other Skype users. You can forward contact
names to any of your Skype buddies.
When you forward Skype contact names, you have to pick and choose which
contacts you are sending (that is, you are not obligated to send your whole con-
tacts base but can send only the individual contacts you select for sending).
If the people listed in the contact names you are forwarding set their privacy
settings (see Chapter 4) so that only authorized people can call or chat with
them, your Skype buddies may need to request permission to communicate
with them.
If you forward a SkypeOut contact to your Skype buddies, they will be able to
immediately SkypeOut to that contact, just the same as if they were placing a
regular SkypeOut call.
Backing up and restoring contacts
It’s a good idea to back up your Skype contacts even though the list is main-
tained at Skype’s central repository. Choose Contacts➪Advanced➪
Backup Contacts to File and select a location on your hard drive or USB flash
drive to store the contact info. The file gets saved as a VCF file, which is a
special format for exchanging contact info. If you’re curious, you can open up
the VCF file with a text editor such as Notepad.
Restoring your contacts is just as simple. Choose Contacts➪Advanced➪
Restore Contacts from File, locate your backup file on your drive, and click OK.
45
Chapter 3: Getting Familiar with Skype’s Interface

Manage Blocked Users
Anytime a person makes a person a nuisance of him- or herself, you have the
option of banning this person from directly initiating a call or chat with you
(choose Advanced➪Manage Blocked Users). A person who is blocked cannot
call you or initiate a chat with you, see your online status, view your picture,
or do or anything else that your regular contacts have available.
Keep in mind that if you block a user, it will not prevent someone else from
including both the blocked user and you on the same chat or conference call.
When you choose Advanced➪Manage Blocked Users, a window appears that
shows any currently blocked users and gives you the ability to take anyone
off that list.
The Tools menu
The Tools menu (see Figure 3-6) provides commands for such tasks as creat-
ing conference calls and setting up SkypeIn, SkypeOut, and call forwarding.
Within this menu you can also manage chats, set your language, and specify
options.
Create a Conference Call
Conference calls are a great way to huddle with a small group of people and
work collaboratively. Skype conferencing is extremely easy to set up. Follow
these steps:
Figure 3-6:

Tools menu.
The little

46
Part I: Getting Started with Skype 

1. Choose Tools➪Create a Conference Call or click the Conference Call
button in your Skype toolbar.
A window opens in which to set up your conference call.
2. To add participants, click the Add button or drag the contact name to
the list box showing your conference participants.
You can also edit the conference title.
3. Click OK when you are ready to start the conference.
SkypeOut
Voice over IP (VoIP) is about using the Internet as the transport medium to
make calls from one person’s computer to another. This is fine, but Skype
does it one better: A feature called SkypeOut lets you connect and make calls
from your computer to a regular landline or cell phone. Pretty cool.
Depending on where you are calling to (and from), SkypeOut can be totally
free or there may be a small fee for its use. If you want to place a call using
SkypeOut, you may need to purchase Skype credit. Choosing Tools➪
SkypeOut lets you purchase Skype credit if you need it (see Chapter 8).
Incidentally, when you hold conference calls, the participants on the calls can
be speaking from regular landlines. You can find out the details and plenty
more about SkypeOut in Chapter 8.
SkypeIn
The flip side of SkypeOut is SkypeIn. Anyone can call you from a regular or
cell phone and reach you on Skype. All that’s involved is setting up a SkypeIn
phone number. Choose Tools➪SkypeIn to set up a SkypeIn number. If you
want to establish an international presence for your business, or want to
make it easy for your aunt who lives overseas to call you from a local number
in her country, SkypeIn is definitely great news. There is a fee for setting up a
phone number, but it is low. Get the scoop on SkypeIn in Chapter 8.
Voicemail
You can’t sit by your computer 24 hours a day waiting to receive incoming
calls over Skype anymore than you can be near your home telephone all the
time. Skype provides an optional Voicemail service that makes it easy for
people to leave you messages when you are unavailable to take their call.
Choosing Tools➪Voicemail opens the Call Forwarding and Voicemail panel,
where you can record an audio greeting message as well as set your
Voicemail preferences. You can explore the details about Voicemail in
Chapter 10.
47
Chapter 3: Getting Familiar with Skype’s Interface

Call Forwarding
One of the convenient features of Skype is the ability to automatically for-
ward incoming calls. The call can be forwarded to a Skype Name of your
choosing. Optionally, it can be forwarded to a regular telephone number,
although you may have to pay a fee for SkypeOut charges. What happens if
the Skype number you are forwarding to doesn’t pick up the call? Skype
allows you to designate up to three call forwarding numbers, and each is
tried in succession.
To use Call Forwarding, follow these steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Call Forwarding to open a window and choose your
call forwarding settings.
2. Select the Forward Calls When I’m Not on Skype check box and enter
a phone number.
If you need more than one forwarding number, click the Advanced
Settings link. (See Chapter 9 for more details about Call Forwarding.)
Send SMS Message
Skype has a Short Message Service (SMS) through which you can send brief
text messages to mobile phones and devices that support the Global System
for Mobile Communications (GSM). To use this service, follow these steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Send SMS Message.
2. In the Add to SMS window, select names appearing in your mobile-
enabled and SkypeOut contacts and click the Add button to add them
to the SMS Recipients list box.
Alternatively, just click and drag the name over to the SMS Recipients
list box.
If you want to send an SMS message to a phone number that’s not on
any of your lists, space is available for entering the number. Click the
Add button to add it to your list of recipients.
3. Click the OK button in the Add to SMS window and then enter your
message in an SMS window; click the Send SMS button to send it.
See Chapter 9 for more details on SMS messaging.
Ringtone
Skype lets you set the kind of ringtone you want to hear when someone calls
you. Choosing Tools➪Ringtones lets you navigate and select from items in a
submenu. You can find out more about customizing ringtones in Chapter 4.
48
Part I: Getting Started with Skype 

If you are using a wireless headset and someone calls you on Skype, it would
be nice to know who’s calling without having to look at your computer
screen. There is third-party software that you can obtain to accomplish this;
read about it in Chapter 9.
Share Skype with a Friend
To encourage your friends or others to try Skype, you may want to send 
an eCard with information about Skype and its download links. Choose
Tools➪Share Skype with a Friend to open a form on which you can construct
an invitation to use Skype and have the form emailed.
Recent Chats
Skype supports text chats between you and your fellow skypers. Not every-
body will sit by his or her computer to keep a chat session going. And you
may be in the habit of shutting down your computer every night before you
go to sleep. What happens to your chat? Conveniently, Skype remembers the
chat content and lets you resume where you left off.
To resume a chat, choose Tools➪Recent Chats and select from a list of recent
chats. If the chat has not been given a title, what shows is the last line of the
chat. (See Chapter 6 for much more about chats.)
Bookmarked Chats
Although the Recent Chats feature is useful, you may want to retain the 
chat to keep it live and ongoing indefinitely. Skype gives you this ability 
when you bookmark a chat. Choosing Tools➪Bookmarked Chats lets you
open and resume your bookmarked chats. See Chapter 6 for more about
bookmarking a chat.
Change Language
Parlez-vous français? Sprechen sie Deutsch? ¿Habla español? The Skype 
program can be set to more than 27 different languages. You can set your 
language preference by choosing Tools➪Change Language and picking one 
of the languages listed in the submenu.
Options
Skype lets you set your application preferences for the following features:
General options, Privacy, Sounds, Sound devices, Hotkeys, Connection,
Updates, and Advanced settings (see Chapter 4); Videoconferencing 
(see Chapter 7); and Call Forwarding, Voicemail, and SMS Messages (see
Chapter 10). 
49
Chapter 3: Getting Familiar with Skype’s Interface

The Call menu
The Call menu enables you to manage your calls. If the Call menu appears
grayed out, you are not actively engaged in any calls on Skype. While you are
actually on a Skype call, or receiving an incoming call, the menu is no longer
grayed out.
The following options are available from the Call menu.
Answer
You can answer an incoming call from the menu, but it is probably easier to
click the green call button that is displayed with incoming calls.
Ignore
This option lets you ignore an incoming call so that you won’t hear it ring and
can continue your activities without interruption.
Resume
You can place a call on hold; Resume enables you to resume the call.
Hold
You can place a call on hold and answer an incoming call if you happen to
already be talking to someone on Skype and receive a call from someone else.
Mute/Unmute Microphone
During a call, you can select Mute Microphone. When you do, your micro-
phone stops sending sound to the audio-in device. While the microphone is
muted, the Mute microphone option changes to Unmute microphone.
Hang Up
At any time during a call, you can click the red hang up button to end the call.
All the items available from the Call menu are generally available to you by
clicking various Skype buttons and toolbar icons. Unless you need to navi-
gate the Call menu for these options, you may find clicking a visible button to
be easier and more convenient.
The Help menu
New Skype users typically wonder about a variety of issues. What kind of
headset should I get? How do I get Skype Credit? Why are my chats archived?
To answer these and other questions, Skype provides a variety of online help
50
Part I: Getting Started with Skype 

facilities through the Help menu. Some of these answer questions; others
take you to Web pages (see Figure 3-7) for specific tasks such as buying 
Skype credit.
Help
Choosing Help➪Help opens your Web browser to the www.support.skype.
com site. On this Web page, you can find links for troubleshooting, user guides,
announcements from Skype, and other kinds of helpful information. The Web
page also contains a searchable a knowledge base. (By the way, you may want
to check out Appendix B of this book for a variety of troubleshooting tips.)
FAQ
Choosing Help➪FAQ takes you to a page with answers to plenty of Frequently
Asked Questions.
Getting Started
This option opens a sequence of screens to give you an ultra-quick tour of
Skype. The very first time you install and launch Skype on your computer,
this Getting Started guide is displayed. It continues to be automatically dis-
played every time you launch Skype until you select the Do Not Show This
Guide at Startup option.

Get Headset
This option takes you to the Skype Web store, where you can purchase
Skype-certified headsets, speakerphones, webcams, and the like. Chapter 11
profiles some of these products.
Buy Skype Credit
Certain features of Skype, such as SkypeIn and some ringtones, entail a fee.
For this reason, you may need to buy Skype credit. You can find more infor-
mation about Skype credit in Chapter 8 and credit for Business Groups in
Chapter 12.
Redeem Voucher
Many of the Skype-certified gadgets on the Skype Web store as well as some
of the products described in Chapter 11 come with voucher numbers for vari-
ous Skype-related features, such as free SkypeOut minutes or Voicemail.
Choose Help➪Redeem Voucher to claim your free services.
While we’re on the subject of vouchers, look to the end of this book for
vouchers to use toward purchasing various software products for Skype.
Take advantage of these offers while they last!
Check for Update
Keeping up-to-date with the latest and greatest version of Skype might be a
chore if you had to remember to check for updates. Luckily, Skype makes it
easy for you to automatically keep your software up-to-date because Skype
does the checking for you, as follows:
 Choosing Help➪Check for Update lets you check whether you have the
latest version of Skype installed.
 Choosing Tools➪Options➪Updates lets you configure Skype to either
alert you about new updates or make them automatically.
For major releases, you have the option to have Skype automatically down-
load the new release, alert you that a new release is available and ask you for
permission to download, or ignore new releases altogether.
Every so often, Skype may have a hotfix to a specific problem for a small
number of Skype users. For these hotfixes, Skype gives you the option to
automatically download, ask before downloading, or ignore updating for 
hotfixes altogether.
Report a Problem
If your Skype experience is not the way it’s supposed to be, you may want or
need to report it to Skype. Problems can span a broad spectrum of issues
ranging from general support issues to incorrect charges in your Skype account.
52
Part I: Getting Started with Skype 

When reporting a technical difficulty, you may enter a long and detailed 
message and click the Submit button, only to find that your message has not
been submitted and you are instead presented with a laundry list of possible
explanations for your problem. At the end of that list is a true Submit button.
Skype wants you to be absolutely sure that your question is not responded to
in its prepared list of responses. Do not be intimidated by this! Click Submit
to have your issue addressed by some responsible person in Skype.
About
For troubleshooting purposes, it is helpful to know the version of Skype soft-
ware you are running. Choosing Help➪About displays this information for you.
Using the Skype toolbar
Although you can access many of Skype’s features from the main menu, the
Skype toolbar displays many of these essential features on toolbar icons. The
base set of icons includes the following:
 Add Contacts.
 Search: Find registered Skype users.
 Call Phones: SkypeOut from the Dial tab.
 Conference: Start a Skype conference.
 Chat: Open a chat with the selected Skype contacts.
 Send SMS: Send an SMS text message to an SMS-enabled mobile device.
 Send File: Transfer a file to one or more Skype contacts.
 Profile: Look up the profile of a selected Skype contact.
 Hold/Resume: While you are actively talking to someone on Skype, this
Hold icon appears. Choosing Hold holds the call and the icon changes
from Hold to Resume. It continues to stay that way until you either click
Resume to resume the call or the call is ended, possibly by the other
person’s hanging up. You don’t want to keep someone waiting on hold
forever, do you?
When you are not actively on a call, the Hold and Resume toolbar icons
are hidden altogether.
 Mute/Unmute: While you are on a call, you can mute your microphone.
The icon changes from mute to unmute and stays that way until you
unmute the connection or the call is ended.
When you are not actively on a call, the Mute and Unmute toolbar icons
are hidden altogether.
53
Chapter 3: Getting Familiar with Skype’s Interface

We need to mention some other important features of the Skype toolbar, as
follows:
 If your Skype window is narrower than the space available to display the
toolbar icons, some of them are hidden. In their place on the right side
of the visible toolbar is a double-arrow icon. Click the icon to display the
hidden toolbar icons and then click the icons that you need.
 As Skype continues to evolve, the specific toolbar icons that are gener-
ally available may differ from those shown in Figure 3-8.
Status Icons: Announcing and 
Changing Your Online Status
Your online status icon broadcasts your availability to the world. Changing a
status icon from the Change Online Status menu is a piece of cake. However,
knowing what each icon means may seem obvious at first, but the settings
need explanation.
Displaying your Skype online status
Online status icons signify how you want the world to view you on Skype.
 Offline: Select this when you don’t want to take or make any calls. The
green call button for making calls is dimmed, indicating that you cannot
make calls. However, you can look up profile information about any
Skype contact while in this mode.
 Online: This is the status you have (the default setting) when you log on.
 Skype Me: This mode lets everyone else on Skype know that you are
interested in talking or chatting with other folks even if they do not know
you. By choosing this option, you temporarily disable your privacy 
Figure 3-8:
The Skype
toolbar.
54
Part I: Getting Started with Skype 

settings. In this way, someone can reach you without having to request
that you share your contact details. When you return from Skype Me
status, your privacy settings are automatically restored.
 Away or Not Available: If your computer has been idle for a while, your
status changes from Online to Away or Not Available automatically until
you do something, such as move the mouse on your screen. Then it
returns to Online status automatically.
• An Away icon (a Skype icon with a small watch next to it) appears
next to your Skype Name if there is no activity after a few minutes.
Skype sets this time to five minutes, but you can change the set-
tings to a different amount of time (see Chapter 4).
• A Not Available icon (a Skype icon with a lunar crescent — a kind
of “gone to sleep” mode) appears next to your Skype Name after
your computer is idle for a longer period of time. Skype sets the
amount to 20 minutes, but you can change the settings to a differ-
ent amount of time (see Chapter 4).
The Away or Not Available mode tells other Skype users that you have
Skype running but may have actually stepped away from the computer
and are unable to respond to a call or chat. Actually, you could be snooz-
ing at the keyboard, but nobody can tell the difference!
 Do Not Disturb: You can indicate that you don’t want to be interrupted
by choosing this status. In this mode, you won’t receive any incoming
calls or messages, but you can make outgoing calls.
 Invisible: This is sort of a stealth mode by which you can function as
you regularly do in Online mode, making and receiving calls, participat-
ing on chats, and so on. When others on Skype look at your status, it
appears that you are Offline, even though you’re not.
You can change your status anytime, with a choice of ways to do that:
 Choose File➪Change Online Status: This method makes a drop-down
list of status icons appear (see Figure 3-9).
 Click the Status icon at the bottom-right corner of the window:
Clicking this icon brings up a drop-down list with Change Status as the
first option. Click that option to open the same drop-down list that
opens by clicking File➪Change Online Status. In Figure 3-10, the Online
status icon is clicked to change the status to Away.

 Setting advanced options
W
hen you’ve started to get used to Skype, you may want to fine-tune
some of the details regarding how it works in your digital world. The
more you know about making your Skype settings suit your daily needs, the
better Skype will serve you.
These pages guide you through choosing your general settings, privacy
options, notifications and alerts, sound effects and sound devices, hotkeys,
connection options, and advanced features. We cover these option groups in
the same sequence as they appear in the menu pane of the General options
menu. (We skip the call forwarding, voicemail, and video categories here,
however, because those topics are covered in detail in Chapters 7, 9, and 10.)
Use this chapter to help you define how you interact with the Skype commu-
nity and what you will (and won’t) let the software do.
Fine-Tuning Your General Options
To get started, choose Tools➪Options to open the Skype Options menu,
which contains all the options covered in this chapter. You can see the option

groups listed in the pane on the left side of the screen. Click the top one,
General, to open the General menu (see Figure 4-1).
General options are grouped into three categories: 
 Telling Skype to start a chat or start a call when you double-click a contact
 Emoticon behavior
 Online status timeouts
To speak or not to speak
Maybe you’re a little shy when you first meet someone, or you just don’t feel
like talking sometimes. You can tell Skype that you always want to start in
chat mode (which really means writing mode) rather than audio mode when-
ever you double-click the name of a person in your Contacts list (see Chap-
ter 2 for more about contacts). To have Skype start in chat mode, click the
Start a Chat button under the When I Double-Click on Contact or Use the
Address Field option. In chat mode, you can exchange written messages with
another user, send files from your hard drive, and paste links of Internet
addresses from any Web browser. 
The alternative is to set Skype to start in audio mode by clicking the Start 
a Call button (refer to Figure 4-1). In this mode, when you double-click the
name of a contact, you hear a ringing tone just as you do when you dial a
person on a regular telephone. Assuming that your recipient is available, 
you are in a direct conversation with the person you called.
Figure 4-1:
Set your
General
settings by
choosing
Skype
Tools➪
Options.
60
Part II: As You Like It: Skype Your Way 

Regardless of whether you set your General options to start a chat or start an
audio call when you double-click a contact, you are always free to directly
call the selected contact and click the green call button. You are also free to
start a chat with that selected contact.
Express yourself
Emoticons, an array of symbols that express emotions, play an important
role in a Skype chat (see Figure 4-2). Meeting a new person over Skype by
using the chat mode means that you see only the written words, not the
person’s facial expressions. You can’t hear the eagerness, sincerity, kindness,
or humor in his or her voice. Sometimes a chat mode is an introductory
meeting, which, if all goes well, leads to a conversation, a file transfer, or
other privileges we extend to people we trust. The addition of an emoticon
can break the ice between new Skype contacts.
Although Skype emoticons are generally animated, such as a “(dance)” emoti-
con that displays an icon-sized person dancing, you can change the behavior 
of your emoticons to be static images in your chat windows. To do so, deselect
the Show Animated Emoticons option in your General options. If you want to
eliminate the graphic representation of emoticons altogether and instead show
text that represents the emoticon, deselect the Show Emoticons option. The
dancing person emoticon appears as “(dance),” with the parentheses, in your
chat window.
In addition to placing emoticons by clicking icons in the pop-up panel shown in
Figure 4-2, you can enter the text representation in your text chat window. For

In your chat window, you can display emoticons representing the flags for 
various countries. To display a flag for the United States, enter (flag:us); for
Canada, enter (flag:ca). The choice of country flags is extensive and is based on
the two-letter designation set by the International Standards Organization stan-
dard ISO-3166. You can find the full list of two-letter country abbreviations at
www.iso.org/iso/en/prods-services/iso3166ma/02iso-3166-code-lists/index.html

The other choices on the General options relate to automatic changes to
your online status — your visibility to others on the Skype network. Click the
box next to Show Me As ‘Away’ When I Am Inactive For to set how long you
want Skype to wait before automatically signifying that you’ve stepped away
from the computer. When your mouse movement halts, Skype senses this
mouse inactivity after the amount of time you set and automatically displays
an Away icon next to your contact name. You control how long Skype waits to
trigger a change in status; you may choose to have an Away sign posted after
five minutes, and a Not Available sign posted after 20 minutes. To change
these settings, choose Tools➪Options, click General, and adjust the number
of minutes listed; then, click Save.
Protecting Your Privacy
Skype gives you two mechanisms for protecting your privacy:
 Your Skype profile: Information about yourself that you allow anyone
on Skype to see. It can be jam-packed with information or contain barely
anything.
 Your Privacy setting: This setting enables you to set who can directly
call or chat with you.
In real life, anyone can find out where you live. All anyone needs to do is to
look you up in a phone book, buy a mailing list, or find you through some
publicly available information source. The fact that people happen to know
you means that they can show up at your doorstep whenever they please.
But if you live in a building with a doorman, visitors have to be announced, and
you can give instructions to the doorman as to who is allowed to visit and who
isn’t. Skype, through its profile and privacy settings, parallels this latter arrange-
ment closely. The next two sections show how you can make it easy or difficult
for people to find you based on your Skype profile, and how to assert control
over who can start a call or chat with you based on your privacy settings.

Part II: As You Like It: Skype Your Way 

Editing your Skype profile
Your Skype profile contains three kinds of information:
 Information that all Skype users can see: Includes information such as
• Your full name.
• Your vital statistics: Gender and date of birth.
• Geographic location: You can specify the Country/Region,
State/Province, and City.
• Your preferred language.
• Your telephone numbers: Can include home, office, and mobile.
• Your Home page: You may have a Web site that you want the
world to visit.
• A description about yourself: If you want to tell your life’s story,
you must do it in 200 characters or fewer.
 Information that only your Skype contacts can see: Only your Skype
buddies get the exclusive and revealing picture of you, as well as some
limited information about your Skype account.
• Your Skype picture.
• Your time: It can be your computer’s local time or a Greenwich
Mean Time (GMT).
• The number of Skype contacts you have: You can choose not to
reveal this information to anyone.
 Information known only to you: 
• Your email address: You can list more than one email address.
The information in the public portion of your profile is available literally to
any Skype user. The semi-private information is reserved for your Skype con-
tacts, and no one gets to directly view your email address.
From a privacy perspective, a few points are worth mentioning:
 Even if you don’t want to reveal much information, you’ll probably find
that listing your preferred language and country is useful. Adding identi-
fying information such as a country can be helpful to someone who
searches for your name and finds several people with the same first and
last name as yours. Additional information can help to narrow the list.
 Many people are unaware that the number of Skype contacts a person
has is listed unless they deselect this option. You may not want the
world to know that you have only three contacts, especially if you 
portray yourself as being experienced in VoIP and Skype.
63
Chapter 4: Customizing Skype Options to Suit Your Style

 You can choose to fill in all the items in your profile, or none of them.
You should have your email address in your profile so that you can take
advantage of features such as SkypeOut, SkypeIn, and Voicemail. Also, if
you ever forget your password, you’ll need your email account to reset
your password.
 Although your password is never directly displayed, a Skype user who
generally knows your email address can find you by searching Skype.
The last item may prove to be very helpful. You can use, for example, a
sales@company.com or info@company.com email address for your company.
People can then easily search for and find the right party, such as sales or
support, if your company has many Skype user accounts.
Establishing who can call or chat with you
Privacy options let you allow or deny calls and chats. You can also put some
callers in the virtual doghouse by blocking contact altogether. Be aware that
privacy is something you must choose. Skype’s default setting allows anyone
to initiate a call or chat with you. Skype calls this process “Authorization,”
meaning that when someone requests your Contact Details, you have autho-
rized him or her to know both your full Skype identity particulars (except
your email address) and your online status in real time. Authorization is usu-
ally what you want to choose in order to keep connected to your new circle
of friends. This setting is probably not your first choice, however, when it
comes to the world at large. 
The Skype community is large and growing daily. This means that possibly
thousands of people, organizations, or interest groups might want to contact
you — or you them. Although this is a welcome opportunity, you need to be
aware that you may be sharing a bit more than “hello” when you share con-
tact details or accept a call or chat.
When a person contacts you for the first time, a Skype window pops up on
your screen (see Figure 4-3). You might be tempted to hastily click OK so that
you can get back to what you were doing. Wait! Before you prematurely send
all your information, you can click the Show Options button and look over
your other choices (see Figure 4-4), as follows:
 Send Your Contact Details with This Person: Choosing this option allows
the person to freely communicate with you whenever he or she wants.
 Do Not Send Your Contact Details with This Person: Choosing this
option ignores the person’s request. That person can’t tell whether you
simply didn’t respond or actually declined his or her request.
 Block This Person from Contacting You in the Future: This option
means that you will always appear as Offline anytime that person views
you in his or her Contacts list.
64
Part II: As You Like It: Skype Your Way 

By deselecting the Add This Person to My Contacts option, you can share
your contact details with a person without adding that person to your own
list of Skype contacts.
Even if you set your privacy settings so that only authorized people can 
contact you or see when you are online, you can still receive “Hello from”
requests from new visitors.

Receiving Notifications when 
Someone Skypes You
Skype provides a number of notifications that alert you, by on-screen mes-
sages or through sound effects, when someone on your Skype Contacts list
comes online or does the following:
 Calls you
 Starts a chat with you
 Sends you a file
 Requests your contact details
 Sends you contacts
 Leaves you a Voicemail message
To choose what notifications you want Skype to provide you with, click
Notifications in the Options window to display the Notifications panel, shown
in Figure 4-5. Depending on how you like to work, any or all of these notifica-
tions can serve you well or be an annoyance. You might want to start by
enabling all the notifications (do so by clicking the box next to each option)
and then see how they work out for a while. You can go back and alter your
settings anytime.
Another type of notification setting, which appears at the bottom of the
Notifications menu, is Display Messages for Help/Tips. Enable this setting if
you want Skype to alert you to various kinds of supplementary services avail-
able from Skype such as SkypeOut, SkypeIn, or sending SMS messages, which
are fee-based services. In case you are wondering what an SMS message is,
look at Chapter 9.
Figure 4-5:
Tell Skype
what types
of communi-
cation to
alert you to.
66
Part II: As You Like It: Skype Your Way 

Skype can notify you when any of your Skype contacts come online. If you
start accumulating a lot of contacts, you may find this feature distracting and
sometimes even downright annoying. If you happen to use a wireless network
and your connection cuts in and out, then after the connection resumes, you
can get alerts displaying the contacts that appear to come online all at one
time (see Figure 4-6). Sometimes, too much of a good thing may not be so
good! For this reason, many skypers choose to keep the setting for Someone
Comes Online disabled.
As you become familiar with Skype and don’t require all the helpful hints and
suggestions, you may want to turn off Help/Tips because it, too, is distracting
by constantly suggesting and displaying links to services that have nothing to
do with what you are doing at the moment, such as SkypeOut, SkypeIn, or
sending SMS text messages.
Customizing Your Sounds 
Remember the uproar around Classic Coke? The Coca-Cola Company
changed the formula, introduced a new beverage, and suddenly everyone
became nostalgic for the old taste. Well, the designers of Skype wisely kept
its classic, familiar ringtones when they added a snazzy new group of modern
sounds for the following:
 Busy Signal
 Call on Hold
 Connecting Call
Figure 4-6:

67
Chapter 4: Customizing Skype Options to Suit Your Style

 Contact Online
 Dial Tone
 Hang Up
 Incoming Chat
 Resuming Call
 Ringtone
Skype allows you to customize your ringtones by importing WAV files pur-
chased on the Internet or even by importing your own digital recordings.
Skype further lets you manage its behavior by controlling the sound devices
on your computer. The following sections explain how to customize Skype in
this regard.
Playing with bells and whistles
A virtual cacophony of sounds awaits your selection, depending on your
mood and how much idle time you have to fool around and experiment with
what suits your fancy. You can choose from a variety of dial tones, busy sig-
nals, connecting buzzes, on-hold tones, and many others from the sounds
panel list (see Figure 4-7).
Figure 4-7:
Jazz up your

specifi-
cations.
68
Part II: As You Like It: Skype Your Way 

After you pick a sound type, you can choose the modern or classic variety. 
If you wish, you can import sound files directly from your hard drive or 
even purchase and download sound files from the Skype Web site. Choosing
Tools➪Ringtones➪Get Latest Ringtones takes you to Skype’s personalization
Web site (see Figure 4-8).
This site allows you to try different ringtones before you choose to buy them
(see Figure 4-9).
Skype can play WAV sound files. If you have an MP3 file, you can convert it 
to a WAV-formatted file by using programs such as Audacity and QuickTime
Pro. Plenty of other programs make this conversion as well. Catch the latest
posts about this and other topics on our Web site for this book, www.

Changing your Sound Devices settings
Sound Devices settings pertain to Audio In, Audio Out, and Ringing. Choices
here relate to Windows Default Sound Device and any custom Sound Cards
installed on your computer (see Figure 4-10). Unless you have some special
requirement, you should leave these options alone. If you’re not sure whether
your system has a special requirement, it probably doesn’t. 
One situation in which sound device settings may need to be adjusted is
when you wish to use a USB phone and speakers for a new HiFi system at the
same time. In such a situation, you can do the following:
1. Choose Start➪Settings➪Control Panel➪Sounds and Audio Devices.
The Sounds and Audio Devices Properties window appears.
(Depending on your operating system and how you have it configured,
you may have to navigate to the Windows Sounds and Audio Devices
control panel differently from the way described in this step.)
2. Click the Audio tab of the Sounds and Audio Devices Properties
window and then select your sound card as the Sound playback
default device.
3. Click the Voice tab and select your sound card as the Sound playback
default device. 
Click the OK button to save and close your Sounds and Audio Devices
Properties window.
4. In your Skype application, choose Tools➪Options➪Sound Devices.
The options to choose here are for Audio In and Audio Out. Choose your
USB device for each.
If your voice sounds very faint to your callers, deselect the box next to Let
Skype Adjust My Sound Device Settings; then, set your sound settings at the
Windows Sound control panel.

Customizing Hotkeys
Keyboard jockeys are in for a treat. You can easily create your own hotkey
settings to juggle your Skype tasks such as answering calls, putting someone
on hold, hanging up, and more, all at the touch of a keystroke.
The following example makes clear how to create your own hotkey.
Suppose that you want to make the Skype window appear instantly at a 
keystroke. Here’s what you can do:
1. Click the Hotkeys menu appearing in the left panel of the Options
window.
The items and buttons appearing under the Enable Global Hotkeys
check box are all grayed out. 
2. Select the Enable Global Hotkeys check box to activate the hotkeys.
3. Select Focus Skype and then click the Change Hotkey button.
The window shown on the right side of Figure 4-11 pops up.
4. Enter the letter A or any letter of your choosing in the text box and
click OK.
This step enables the Focus Skype action. 
5. Save your Hotkey settings.
Figure 4-11:
Setting a
hotkey.
71
Chapter 4: Customizing Skype Options to Suit Your Style

Now you can instantly jump to Skype from any program in Windows when-
ever you press WinKey+A. If Skype is already running, the Skype client
window comes to the foreground. If Skype is not running when you press
WinKey+A, the Skype application launches as it normally does when you start
Skype. If you don’t have Skype configured for automatic logon, you need to
sign in as you regularly do.
Connecting to the Internet when Skype
Default Settings Aren’t Enough
Connection settings relate to ports and proxy connections. Skype works over
the same connections that you use when you surf the Internet with your
browser. If you can connect to the Internet with your browser, and your
Skype contacts can, too, you should be able to carry on a conversation.
Customizing your proxy settings
Some companies require you to apply special settings to connect your Web
browser to the Internet. Generally, your Skype Connection settings should
closely match those of your browser.
Most of the time, you won’t have to tweak your settings because Skype usually
works without any fiddling.
If you require a custom connection, perform the following steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Options➪Connection from the Skype application menu.
The Connection panel appears.
72
Part II: As You Like It: Skype Your Way 
What is Focus Skype and what is the WinKey?
Your computer can “focus” on only one appli-
cation or window at a time. When you click in a
window, your computer switches its focus to
the program associated with that window.
Focus Skype is a directive that tells the com-
puter you want the main Skype window to
appear. It’s kind of like summoning the genie in
the bottle, but the genie is Skype.
On the keyboard of many Windows-based com-
puters is a special key that fires up the
Windows Start menu. The key, called the
WinKey, looks somewhat like a wavy flag.
Because the key is not generally used for any-
thing other than summoning the Windows Start
menu, it’s an ideal candidate for customized
hotkeys in your applications.

2. Set your mode for proxy detection and fill in host and port information.
A drop-down list provides for Automatic proxy detection, HTTPS, or
SOCKS. Your System or Network Administrator should be able to tell you
whether your connection is going through HTTPS or SOCKS, and he or
she should be able to give you the hostname (it may be an IP address) of
your proxy server and a port number. Fill in this information.
3. Enable proxy authentication.
You may need to select the box for Enable Proxy Authentication and pro-
vide a username and password.
Your Skype proxy and connection setting should more or less parallel your
Web browser connection setting.
Customizing your firewall settings
Remarkably, Skype works in many corporate environments without any cus-
tomized setup even when your organization’s firewall would stop other soft-
ware programs from connecting to the Internet. For the most part, if your
company’s firewall allows you to connect to the public Internet through your
Web browser, you should be able to use Skype without difficulty.
Here are some troubleshooting steps you can try if your firewall is stopping
incoming or outgoing Skype traffic:
 Run your Skype incoming connections through ports 80 and 443: If
you are having difficulty connecting to the Internet over Skype after
establishing your proxy settings, look to see that a check mark appears
next to Use Port 80 and 443 as Alternatives for Incoming Connections.
73
Chapter 4: Customizing Skype Options to Suit Your Style
Working with internal and external firewalls
A firewall watches incoming and outgoing net-
work information and acts as a kind of traffic
cop to halt or prevent anything that is not specif-
ically allowed to slip through a defined defense
perimeter. Typically, large corporations have
dedicated firewalls that create a defense
perimeter around the whole corporate network
or specific network segments. These are exter-
nal firewalls. If your company has an external
firewall that intercepts and blocks incoming or
outgoing Skype traffic, you will have to ask your
network or security administrator to open the
firewall to allow Skype traffic to move through
the company network.
Many small companies and individuals do not
have a dedicated external firewall, but instead
have an internal firewall that runs in software
on each individual computer. This kind of fire-
wall sets up the defense perimeter around your
computer.

You can find this setting by choosing Tools➪Options and clicking
Connection from the list of options in the left panel. If the Use Port 80
and 443 as Alternatives for Incoming Connections option is not checked,
select it, save your settings, and retry Skype.
 Open your external firewall: If your company is running an external
firewall, ask your network or security administrator to configure the 
firewall to allow for Skype traffic.
 Open your internal firewall: If you are running your own personal fire-
wall and have administrative rights on your computer, here are some
steps you can take:
• Run your personal firewall software.
• Check to see whether there is currently a rule that specifically 
prohibits Skype traffic. The first time you ran Skype, your personal
firewall server may have prompted you when it detected Skype
traffic and suggested that it be blocked. If you gave the OK to block
the traffic, Skype cannot communicate with the outside world.
Your solution is to find the offending rule and remove it.
If you can’t find the rule that blocks Skype, the following may work:
Uninstall Skype and re-install it. The next time Skype runs, your
personal firewall may prompt you about what to do. This time, you
can tell it to allow the Skype traffic.
Your personal firewall software may not have any rules about
Skype and may need to be explicitly told that network traffic asso-
ciated with Skype should be allowed. You must add Skype to your
firewall’s list of allowed programs.
 Find further information on the Skype Web site: Go to www.skype.
com/help/guides/firewall.html to find information about specific
Skype firewall setups including Windows XP SP2 Firewall, Norton
Personal Firewall, Zone Alarm Pro, and McAfee Firewall Pro.
Keeping Up-to-Date
Some people like having their application software always up-to-date. Others
want to be told when a new version of their software is available, whereas
others blissfully chug along without annoying reminders. Which kind of person
are you? Whatever your preference, Skype lets you set it (see Figure 4-12).
Skype lets you set your preferences for both major updates by choosing
Options➪Updates and then selecting one of the following;
 Download Automatically: This option automatically checks to see
whether a new version of Skype is available whenever Skype starts up; 
if one is, Skype automatically downloads it.
74
Part II: As You Like It: Skype Your Way 

 Ask before Downloading: This option is similar to the automatic down-
load, but it politely asks you for permission before downloading.
 Ignore: In choosing this option, you are instructing Skype to take no
action to download new versions of Skype unless you manually choose
to download Skype.
Between major releases, Skype may introduce minor releases or hotfixes. You
have the same set of options available to you for downloading hotfixes as you
do for downloading major releases of Skype. On the same screen where you set
your preference for major Skype releases, you can set your preference for hot-
fixes and select Download Automatically, Ask before Downloading, or Ignore.
Improving Your Skyping 
with Advanced Options
Advanced options are not absolutely essential to using Skype, but they can
make things smoother. The options are as follows:
 Startup: If you anticipate using Skype frequently, you may want to have
Skype start up automatically whenever you power on your computer.
 Automatically Answer Incoming Calls: Unless you have a special need
to automatically connect to whomever calls you at the very first ring,
you should leave this option disabled. There are special circumstances
when you would want to automatically answer incoming calls, however.
One of them (setting up a “NannyCam”) is covered in Chapter 7.
Figure 4-12:
Tell Skype
how you
want it to
behave
concerning
updates.
75
Chapter 4: Customizing Skype Options to Suit Your Style

 Enable Contacts List and History Quickfiltering: Choosing this option
tells Skype to quickly locate any contact in either your Contacts list or
history of chats by simply typing in any portion of a name. Only those
items that match appear. As your list of Skype contacts and chats grow,
Quickfiltering becomes an indispensable tool.
 Automatically Pause Winamp: Winamp is a freeware player that enables
you to play music and video content. Winamp has many plugins (see
www.winamp.com/plugins) that enable you to use it in conjunction
with other programs. The advanced settings in Skype (see Figure 4-13)
let you automatically pause Winamp during an incoming call.
Suppose you’re working at your desktop and enjoying some peaceful
music on your computer’s CD player. Suddenly you’re interrupted by a
Skype caller. You answer the call, but the music hasn’t stopped playing!
You’re hearing both the music and your Skype buddy at the same time.
Your buddy isn’t hearing any of your music and doesn’t know why you
sound so confused as you frantically scramble to stop the music.
Wouldn’t it be nice if the music automatically shut off when you answered
your Skype call? If your computer uses Winamp to play music, as many
computers do, you can enable the Automatically Pause Winamp During
Calls feature.
See Chapter 6 for Advanced Options settings pertaining to chats.

 Personalizing your profile with graphics
 Creating avatars
W
e all like to make our mark, stand out in a crowd, and establish a
unique identity. Broadcasting your personality to the world on 
Skype is not only fun but also may be a useful strategy if you use Skype as 
a business communication tool. Either way, you can find choices within the
Skype program as well as third-party add-ons that allow you to strut your
stuff. Personal choices include what logon name to choose, how much to say
about yourself (covered in Chapter 2), and whether to post a photo, logo, or
an avatar to show your face to the world. Decisions, decisions, decisions. It’s
up to you to make them, but it’s up to this chapter to describe your choices
and how to set them in motion.
Personalizing Your Skype 
Profile with Graphics
If you don’t select a photo or image, Skype automatically inserts a cartoon-
like “ball headed” icon for you. If you don’t have a photo or artwork, you can
use one of the ready-to-use icons that Skype provides (see Figure 5-1). When
you click the Change button in your profile, the My Pictures window appears.
If you are creating your own graphic, you can use JPG (.jpg) files or bitmap
(.bmp) files. The ready-made images installed with the Skype software use
PNG (.png) files, so PNG files are also acceptable.
When you use an image, Skype automatically scales your picture to fit inside
a 96-x-96–pixel swatch.

All the text content of your profile is stored in a centralized Skype database;
however, your picture is kept only on your local computer. If you are using
Skype both on a computer at work and at home, you need to keep your pic-
ture file on both. You also need to adjust your Skype profile on each machine
so that the same picture appears.
Having Fun with Avatars
Why limit yourself to a static picture if you don’t have to? Skype allows you
to create many ways to represent yourself visually. Among these are images
called avatars.
The Hindu God Vishnu loved to change shape and appear in the form of 
a human or an animal. These forms are also called avatars. Because the 
personality is the same but the form is different, avatar became a handy 
word to describe images representing (and being controlled by) real people
in a virtual environment.
However, computer avatars are not limited to human or animal forms. Some
avatars are cartoon characters, robots, talking trees, teapots, smiley emoti-
cons, and whatever your imagination can invent.
Figure 5-1:
Sample
swatch 
of Skype
pictures.
78
Part II: As You Like It: Skype Your Way 

Skypers have taken avatar creation to a new level by making use of various
avatar software tools. Your new Skype contact may come to you in the form
of an image that moves, talks, expresses emotion, and generally reflects, in
real time, what the “hidden” personality is saying and doing. You may find
yourself talking to a little character that has been custom built to have green
hair, violet eyes, a ten-gallon hat, and a golf club. (Sometimes our avatars say
more about us than our real looks!) You may even see a dog talking while
hearing your friend’s voice in a Skype conversation.
Oddly, the avatar concept has come full circle. You not only can appear in the
form of dog, cat, or coffee cup but also can take your own photograph —
your real image — and turn that into a talking avatar. So, the real you takes
on your own avatar form!
Creating WeeMees as avatars
A very simple and inexpensive type of avatar you can create is called a
WeeMee (see Figure 5-2).
When you click the Create My Avatar button, you are instantly whisked away
to an avatar construction factory (see Figure 5-3).

You can try your hand at building a WeeMee by following these steps:
1. Click the Build Your WeeMee Now! button.
You are presented with a WeeMee without features and holding a sign

2. Click the gender you want.
All the options for the WeeMee of that gender appear. Depending on the
options you select, you may have some animations in your avatar. For
example, the boat and clouds of the WeeMee in Figure 5-4 are moving.
(It’s hard to make out in black and white here, but the boat is to the left,
chugging down the waterway.)

Building animated avatars with CrazyTalk
Are you ready to let your creative streak run free? Animated avatars that you
can create with CrazyTalk Messenger take image interactivity to the next level.
CrazyTalk comes in two versions: a free version called CrazyTalk for Skype (go
to www.reallusion.com/crazytalk4skype) and a paid version called
CrazyTalk Messenger (go to www.reallusion.com/crazytalk). The free
version comes with a fixed selection of avatars that you can use but can’t
modify. CrazyTalk Messenger allows you to design and build avatars that you
also can use in Skype. You can use photos of yourself. And by the way, having
a photorealistic avatar of yourself on Skype may be the perfect solution for
when you’re having a bad hair day!
What do you want to make your animated avatar do? Maybe you want your
character’s mouth to lip-synch with yours as you speak on Skype, or perhaps
you’d like it to capture a mood to suit the occasion.
Building avatars with CrazyTalk Messenger is surprisingly easy. We don’t
have the space here to step you through all the features of CrazyTalk, but 
we can tell you enough to whet your appetite. The first step is to import 
an image of the character you want to work with. The image can be a photo, 
a cartoon, or a scan of a portrait, for example. As long as it is a standard
graphic such as a JPG file, that’s fine. You can find some free and mostly
copyright-friendly images at the following sites:
http://www.pics4learning.com
http://www.freephotos.se

The best topics to search for are animals, portraits, and cartoons. Although
you can find a wealth of images to choose from, be aware that some images
may have copyright notices and usage restrictions.
To import a picture into CrazyTalk, follow these steps:
1. Click the top icon on the vertical toolbar on the left side of the 
Model Page.
The Open File window opens, enabling you to browse for image files on
your hard drive. (Incidentally, CrazyTalk supports directly importing an
image of a printed photo from a scanner attached to your computer.)

Chapter 5: Getting Personal

2. Navigate to the JPEG or BMP image file you want to import, click it,
and then click the Open button.
There’s more to animating an avatar than just importing a picture. When the
avatar’s jaws move in sync with your speech and its eyes blink, you want it 
to appear natural. You also need to draw some simple contour lines so that
CrazyTalk knows how to smoothly morph the avatar’s face when it is speak-
ing or moving its head slightly.
After you import the picture, you can rotate the image so that the avatar’s
face is upright and vertical. If the face is slanted, the jaws can’t move natu-
rally. To fix the image, identify the spindle points for the lips and eyes (see
Figure 5-5), as follows:
1. Click the Auto-Fit Anchor Points toolbar icon (the fourth icon in the
vertical toolbar at the left).
The Auto-Fit Anchor Points window, shown in Figure 5-5, opens.
2. Drag the points over your imported image to match the reference
image on the right; then, click the OK button.
CrazyTalk processes the image and generates a set of contour lines.
Figure 5-5:

Part II: As You Like It: Skype Your Way 

After the image is processed, you can adjust the main contour lines for the eye-
brows, eyes, nose, mouth, and face mask (see Figure 5-6). CrazyTalk uses the
position of these points to “morph” the picture to match your speech in Skype.
You can test your avatar by having it speak. Click the triangular Play button
(see the bottom left of Figure 5-6) to start a prerecorded audio announce-
ment. There are also pause, stop, and volume controls.
As you hear the message played, the avatar’s mouth, eyes, and face move in
sync with the audio message. 
You can tweak the position of the spindle points and contour lines to get a
fairly convincing animated avatar.
Click the Advanced Facial Settings button to access features that can help
you deal with a variety of challenges. Say, for example, that you wanted to
make the Mona Lisa into an avatar. Without some modification, you might
find that making her image “speak” replaced that indelible smile with — 
gasp! — a need for dentures! Fortunately, CrazyTalk comes equipped with 
a set of virtual dentures (see Figure 5-7) and even a collection of eyes.

Chapter 5: Getting Personal

Some of the CrazyTalk facial settings include:
 Adjustments to the eyes, teeth, and mouth: You can adjust the lighting
levels inside the mouth, or even adjust ends of the lips to give the
appearance of a smile or a frown.
 Head motion: You can set the head motion to match the energy of your
character.
 Facial formatting: A nice finishing touch of this software is that you can
have the mouth automatically close when the avatar stops speaking.
CrazyTalk Messenger makes it easy to create, test, and customize your 
avatar. After the avatar is created with Messenger, you can run it in Skype
using another software product, CrazyTalk for Skype Video Lite, which is
available as a free download (go to https://share.skype.com/
directory/crazytalk_for_skype_video_lite/view and click the
Download Now link).
The Video Lite program connects your CrazyTalk avatar to Skype. CrazyTalk
uses the video channel in Skype to broadcast your avatar as though you had
a webcam.
To enliven your avatar, you can use a behavior panel with special kinds of
emotion smileys (see Figure 5-8). Despite the term smiley, you can click these
images to show your avatar laughing, crying, frowning, and looking surprised,
among other expressions.

During the course of a Skype conversation, you can nimbly switch from one
kind of avatar to another by choosing the My Avatars or Default Avatars tab
and clicking the image of the avatar you want shown.

Chapter 5: Getting Personal
Look who’s talking
One of the great joys of writing this book is that
as authors, we got to tinker and experiment with
absolutely fascinating stuff. Our experimenta-
tion knew no boundaries. One Sunday, my wife
(Susan) and I (Loren) were slaving over a couple
of chapters. After she finished her chapter, she
decided to take a short but well-deserved nap.
I, however, was not through. I decided to make
an avatar from a photo of myself.I set up Skype
on two computers, one in the study and another
on my laptop computer, which has a 17-inch
screen. I connected the two systems over
Skype and made the avatar of myself show at
full screen on the laptop. I placed the computer
two or three feet away from where my wife was
napping and went back to the study to project
my voice into the microphone, calling “Susan!
Susan!” She awoke from her nap to a life-sized
talking avatar of myself. I said, “Honey, they’ve
turned me into an avatar!” She was not expect-
ing to be awakened by a computer-generated
version of me, talking in real time and display-
ing the animated behavior of smileys. It actually
took her a beat or two to realize she was look-
ing at an avatar. Maybe the cartoon hearts float-
ing up out of my image gave it away!

Skype Is a Communication Kaleidoscope
Aside from choosing a phone color or style, making a ring louder or softer, 
or changing a message, personalizing electronic communications has been
rather limited until recently. Skype conversations, however, can take many
forms at the same time: voice, image, text, and video. Within each of these
forms, you have many opportunities to make a unique statement and project
your personal style. If you are an artist, you might choose an avatar for your-
self as an abstract painting. If you are a businessman, your image can be your
company logo. Your choice of personalization can associate you with what
you think is important, and you can change your image to reflect a mood,
point of view, or occupation whenever you want. The best part is that the
choice is yours.
Beyond actively projecting an image or avatar, you can also personalize your
Skype environment in the background by adding, or omitting, information in
your profile. If you are in business and want a high-profile presence on Skype,
the more you put in a profile, the better. If you are the quiet type, you can
skimp on the information you put in without taking yourself completely out
of the search loop. Personalizing your mode of communication is more than
decorating; it’s a powerful way to tell the world who you are.

 Understanding how chat history works
 Searching, saving, and sending your chats
C
hatting with Skype is like flying first class. Skype lets you organize, cus-
tomize, save, search, and add links to chats. You can invite chatters who
aren’t online so that they can be free to join the chat circle later. You can send
information, files, contacts, and email links in a Skype chat. You can even have
private conversations on the sly while you are chatting with a group. The
Skype chat landscape is unique, and this chapter is your guidebook.
Set ’er Up and Let ’er Rip
Starting a chat is easy. Pick someone you want to chat with (someone who is
online), and follow these steps:
1. Select a Skype contact from your Contacts list.
2. Click the blue Chat button in the toolbar (see Figure 6-1).
If you don’t see the button, open the View menu to verify that a check
mark appears next to the View Toolbar option.
After you click the Chat button, you’re ready to chat! When your chat
opens, it’s ready for you to chat with the Skype contact you selected.
A confident chat organizer can invite more than one contact simultane-
ously. To do so, select several (or all) of your contacts in the main Skype
window by pressing and holding the Shift key and clicking their names;
then, click the Chat button.

3. To chat with your contact, enter your text in the text box at the
bottom of the chat window and press Enter to post the message in 
the chat room.
A shaded separator bar that contains your name as well as the date and
the time of your message appears in the chat window. The separator
bars are color-coded so that you can easily spot your messages in the
chat, which makes finding your text in the message window easier.
Given the sometimes chaotic, free-for-all nature of chat rooms, you can
easily forget your own conversational thread — especially when you’re
chatting with more than one person at a time. Picking through the mes-
sages quickly to find your notes helps you remember the point you are
making.
To invite others to join your chat, simply drag and drop a contact from your
main window into your message window (see Figure 6-2).
Buddies in a chat room are free to invite their own friends into the chat by
dragging and dropping contacts from their own lists. When a new person is
added, an alert appears in each chat participant’s window. This alert, visible
in Figure 6-2, also identifies the user who invited the new participant as well
as the time he or she was added. No secrets here!

Part II: As You Like It: Skype Your Way 

Choosing a slew of contacts for a group chat can be useful. Maybe you want
to be sneaky. Maybe you are planning a surprise party for your best friend,
and you want to use Skype to make sure that all the people you plan to invite
are in on the chat from the beginning so that you don’t spoil the surprise. In
one chat, you can pick a time, place, gift, entertainment, and any other tidbits
crucial to a good surprise while avoiding telephone and email tag. Then you
can add your best friend to the chat, pretend that everyone is planning a
group run in the park, and have the group enter the date in their calendars.
Because your soon-to-be-surprised friend was added midway through the
chat, he or she can’t see the prior conversation. The surprise is intact and
your friend none the wiser. Isn’t that what best friends are for?

Chapter 6: The Mad Chatter
Why would you have 100 skypers 
chatting at one time?
As unbelievable as it sounds, you can invite up
to 100 other friends or colleagues to a Skype
chat. That’s a lot of people! Why so many
people? Well, here are some things as many as
100 skypers may be gathered for:
 Predicting election results from their own
congressional districts
 Celebrating the exact time the New Year
starts in their own countries and time zones
 Keeping their own minutes at a Board
Meeting
 Planning a reunion
 Performing in a poetry slam

Mastering the Chaos
Chatting with a friend is easy. When you have chats with three, four, or 
more people, the conversations quickly become lively, fun, and fast paced.
Sometimes the words are whizzing by more quickly than you can type, and 
it feels more like a video game than a conversation.
In a chat with three or more people, chatters talk past each other all the time.
Questions are asked, and before they are fully answered, more comments,
inquiries, and observations pop up in the chat window. You wonder, Who is
asking, what am I answering, how do we control this conversation? As with a
new class of school kids, it’s hard to stop everyone from talking simultaneously.
To help manage the chaos, consider designating a chat abbreviation (a word
or emoticon) to indicate the end of each complete thought. As a nod to the
past, we use the old CB radio ten codes (see the sidebar “The ‘ten’ codes”).
If you are about to launch into a long story, don’t wait until the end to post
what you’ve written in the message window. If you press Enter after each line,
your chat buddies can read your story as you type it, and maybe they’ll be
less inclined to interrupt. Just be warned that if you use too many breaks,
you may confuse your chat buddies.
90
Part II: As You Like It: Skype Your Way 
The “ten” codes
The “ten” codes are numeric abbreviations for
simple sentences developed for use in the mili-
tary, police, and emergency communications
over specific radio frequencies. Citizen’s Band
(CB) radio users, or hams, adopted the use of ten
codes to help understand other CB hams.
Problems such as too much static, voices cutting
in and cutting out, and difficulty in identifying the
speaker and when he or she was done talking
resulted in the widespread use of the ten codes.
Bringing order to a chat may lead to using some
common signals. Why not the “ten” codes?
Useful codes include:
10-3 — Stop transmitting
10-4 — Message Received; Affirmative
10-6 — Busy
10-9 — Repeat your message
10-12 — Stop
10-16 — Reply to message
10-18 — Urgent

Setting a time to chat
Anyone who chats across time zones for business communication knows that
coordinating international time zones in a group meeting can be tricky. How do
you decide when to meet if one member is in New York, another is in India, and
another is in Australia? One way is to agree to set your Skype meeting time to
one time zone so that there is never any confusion about when to meet if what
you are doing is internationally based.
To set your time zone in Skype, choose File➪Edit My Profile. Select the Show
My Time check box and choose a time from the drop-down menu (see Figure
6-3). Of course, if you agree on a time zone that is different from your local
zone, you’ll have to do a little calculating to figure out how to set your watch,
but Skype will be right on time, and you will have eliminated miscommunica-
tion and, possibly, missed meetings. It’s worth the effort.
Chatting outside the box
Skype chats are not confined to one message window. A Skype messaging
environment is more like a virtual mixer. You can speak to all the members of
a group, pair off, have one-to-one conversations, form a new group, swap files
with everyone, or share contact lists with some. You can exchange multiple
messages by opening as many chats as your desktop, and your concentra-
tion, can handle.
Whisper chats
Whisper chats are one-on-one offshoots of group chats. If you are in a group
chat and want to whisper to another participant, you can easily open a new,
private chat window. Simply follow these steps:
1. Select a user’s name for your whisper chat.
You can find a chat partner in the Chat Drawer, a window pane that lists
all the users. If you don’t see other users, click the Show Users icon in
your Skype Toolbar (Windows) or select Window➪Drawer from the
Skype menu (Mac). You can have a whisper chat with anyone in your
list, even if that person is not on your Contacts list.
Figure 6-3:
Setting your
time zone.
91
Chapter 6: The Mad Chatter

Several icons appear in the window of the person you want to contact.
2. Click the Chat button.
A new message window opens in addition to the group chat.
3. Type your message, as shown in Figure 6-4.
Be sure to separate the windows or make them different sizes. If you type a 
message in the wrong window, well, we’re sure you can fill in the consequences.
Blocking a chatter from your Contacts list
Being invited to a chat can be like going on a blind date. Although you may
know who invited you, you may not know the other personalities you are
asked to socialize with in the chat window. And as with the majority of blind
dates (we speak from experience), you may choose not to give out your
phone number — or Skype Name, in this case.
If you find a chatter who is objectionable, you can’t banish that person from
the chat but you can block him or her from your Contacts list so that he or
she can no longer have one-on-one chats with you. You can do this immedi-
ately in the Contacts window shown during your chat. Simply select the user’s
name in the Chat Drawer, right-click to bring up the pop-up menu, and click
Block This User.
When you block someone, Skype does your dirty work for you and turns
away the unwanted skyper.

Part II: As You Like It: Skype Your Way 

Passing notes around the virtual room
The Skype chat window serves as a virtual conference. As in a face-to-face
meeting, you can place a document in front of every participant of a Skype
conference — just to make sure that everyone has all the facts straight.
Skype permits the transfer of files instantly to all or only selected partici-
pants. If your chat window is too narrow to fit all the toolbar buttons, you
can click the double arrow to reveal hidden toolbar buttons and then click
the Send File to All button (see Figure 6-5). You now have access to your
directory and can open a file and deliver it. What your chatters see is an 
alert that lets them know you are sending a file.
An easy way to transfer files to members of your chat is to drag the file from
a folder in Windows Explorer, Windows desktop, or My Computer directly
into the chat window. You can even drag an image that’s visible from your
Web browser into the chat window.
Chat members have to agree to receive your file (see Figure 6-6). If you pick 
a file to send and realize it is the wrong one, you can cancel the delivery.
However, you have to do this quickly, before someone accepts the package.
You can send files only to contacts who have authorized you (they agreed to
exchange information upon first contact). So you may be in a chat with five
people, but because you have formally authorized only two contacts, you can
transmit and receive files only from those two contacts.
Another strategy for sending information in a chat environment is to paste a
Web address or an email address in the message window. These are live links
that chatters can click to access Web sites. Everyone can check out the same
Web page or email the same organization as the virtual conference takes
place. To add to the flexibility of distributing information, you can also copy
and paste prepared text into a message window, which is even faster than file
transfers if you don’t care about the document format.

the double
arrow (>>)

All button.

Chapter 6: The Mad Chatter

Not every file is meant for all eyes. Fortunately, Skype enables you to send a 
file to one person at a time by choosing the double arrow that appears when
you move the mouse into the user’s identity box (see Figure 6-7). Clicking the
double arrow opens a vertical menu that includes Send File. This menu enables
a person-to-person file transfer. Alternatively, you can send a file to a single par-
ticipant in a chat by dragging a file from your desktop or Windows Explorer
directly onto the contact name in the Chat Drawer of your chat window.

Part II: As You Like It: Skype Your Way 

Swapping contacts
File transfer is one of several actions you can carry out on an individual
basis. You can also send a list of contacts to other users. Simply choose the
Send Contacts menu item and then select the contacts you want to send. Of
course, your contacts must authorize your chat partner before he or she can
see their online activity, but this process is much more efficient than flipping
through the old Rolodex for phone numbers.
Another useful feature of a Skype chat is having each participant’s profile 
on hand. There may be members of the group you have never met. Their 
profile can contain useful information such as where they live, a Web site for
their business, and a phone contact. The old problem of trying to remember
everyone’s name and what he or she does for a living is greatly alleviated by
having access to a profile to review while you’re on the chat.
Transferring files and swapping contacts holds enormous potential for effi-
cient workflow. In writing this book, we took advantage of these capabilities,
even when we were sitting in the same room. Sometimes the files popped up
faster on our screen than we could have handed them to each other across a
table. Large files took longer, but after each file was sent and received, we
were all on the same page — literally.
95
Chapter 6: The Mad Chatter
A Room with a point of view
You can assign a topic to a chat. Just click the
portion of the chat toolbar with “pick a topic” in
quotation marks. In addition to a title, you can
add emoticons, Web links, and callto:// links
(email links) to a topic. To add Web links and
email addresses, type them into the topic text
box, as shown in the following figure. Because
these links are clickable and updateable, chat
participants can connect to a Web page con-
taining the chat guidelines, important documents
for downloading, or up-to-date information and
alerts. To add an emoticon, type its name or copy
and paste it from your chat window.

Chatting Strategically
Do you ever get a sensitive telephone call at work and find yourself whisper-
ing your way through the conversation? Or perhaps you are calling someone
on your cell phone and the signal stops. Well, the Skype environment gives
you both the opportunity to communicate privately and the choice to type 
or talk. You can receive a Skype voice call and respond in a chat window. The
half-voice, half-chat conversation is a great solution to the open office or
portable cubicle work area.
Another reason for a half microphone/half chat conversation is that some-
times you may not have a microphone available. Your sound preferences may
not be working properly, so you can’t hear the caller’s voice (or your caller
may be your 86-year-old dad who has no idea what a sound preference is or
how he would change it). Having an alternative way to respond to a call pro-
vides a simple way to overcome the personal and technical glitches that trip
us up on a daily basis.
Leaving a chat
When you want to close a chat, just click the round red button with the white
X inside in your windows heading bar. The chat window closes but the chat is
still active. To reopen the chat window, select the name of the contact you
were chatting with and click the Chat button. The same chat window with the
same text appears. You can pick up where you left off before you closed the
chat window.
Returning to former chats
Just because you left a chat doesn’t mean that the chat has disappeared. You
can log off of Skype, log back on, and continue a chat that was started previ-
ously. To find your former chats, choose Tools➪Recent Chats and pick the
chat you want. Chats are identified by Skype Name and the first line of the
chat, or by the topic name if one was chosen and entered. Click the topic 
and the chat reappears.
If your chat partner is offline when you resume the chat, you may see a gray
icon with an X inside it in the chat participant list. When your chat partner is
logged on to Skype, the icon in the participant list appears green. A white
check mark or a little clock symbol appears next to the green icon, depending
on whether the participant is available or away. You can still send a message,
or receive a chat message, whether you indicate through your status icon that
you are not to be disturbed, away, or otherwise unavailable. However, Skype —
again doing your dirty work for you — explains why you don’t answer.
Bookmarking a chat
Some chats are worth setting aside in a special place for quick access. Skype
has a bookmarking feature for these chats. You can bookmark only chats that
96
Part II: As You Like It: Skype Your Way 

have a topic, Web site, emoticon, or email in the topic bar; otherwise, the
pushpin-style icon used to mark the chat is not shown.
To set up a bookmark, click the pushpin icon in the chat topic bar. When this
icon is “pushed in,” the chat appears in a special list that you open by choos-
ing Tools➪Bookmarked Chats.
Getting your attention
With Skype, you can choose how you are notified when someone invites 
you to a chat. You can have a chat window open immediately when the chat
starts, or you can have a pop-up alert tell you that someone is waiting for
your attention. You can even decide not to have any obvious alert, although
you may still like to have the option of knowing that a chat is about to start.
Select from the following types of options:
 Show alert pop-up: Choose Tool➪Options➪Notifications and select
Display Notification, If Someone Starts a Chat with Me.
 Show chat window: Choose Tools➪Options➪Advanced and select Pop
Up a Chat Window When Someone Starts a Chat with Me. Click the Chat
alert to expand the window and type away in the text box.
If you don’t respond to an alert, your Skype window indicates that one new
event has occurred (see Figure 6-8). If you click the chat event link, your chat
window opens for business. You may hear a sound alert if you have chosen
Tools➪Options➪Sounds and selected the check box next to Play Sounds.
These options (well, two of them) are a little like call screening. You want to
know who is calling, but you want to choose your chats carefully. A highly
social person with a long contact list can easily be overwhelmed with willing,
needy, or just plain gregarious skypers. It’s nice to have some control over
your time and privacy.
Modifying Your Chat Window Dressing
Chat windows contain a lot of information. The toolbar, writing box, topic
bar, user list (filled with images, words, and icons), and emoticon and font
choice bars are all visible. You can modify your chatscape to make it easier to
see and use, and to organize your information.
Figure 6-8:

alert flag.
97
Chapter 6: The Mad Chatter

Hiding your contacts
You may want to simplify the chatscape so that you can see more of the text
window. Click the Hide Users button to eliminate the Contacts list and
expand the user text window. You still know who is chatting, and you can
bring your Contacts list back at any time by clicking the Show Users button.
Changing your text size and style
Changing the font and increasing the font size may be both decorative and
practical. Large fonts are easier to see. Fonts with serifs are more formal as
well as easier to read, but they take up more space. You can change the fonts
by selecting the Font pop-up menu just above the writing box in your chat
window (see Figure 6-9). You can experiment with each font to see which is
best for you. Note that changing fonts may replace the shaded separator bars
with outlined placeholders (which may or may not be empty), but forfeiting
shaded separator bars is a small price to pay for legibility.
Any font changes you make in your chat window are for your eyes only. Other
chatters do not see your font selections.
If you change your font size and style and are totally miserable, don’t despair;
you can restore the default font. It’s Tahoma, 8 points, Western script.

Part II: As You Like It: Skype Your Way 

Opening your windows
Skype sets the area you use to write text as the smallest box in the chat
window. It doesn’t have to stay that way, though. You can “grab” the top of
the text window and pull it up to have more space to write and see what you
have written. Enlarging the space allows you to view paragraphs of text you
are editing and are about to send to your fellow skypers, instead of being able
to view just a few lines in the text input area.
As with other Instant Message programs, you can expand the chat window to
make it a full screen.
99
Chapter 6: The Mad Chatter
An abbreviated conversation
Chats are so fast and furious that people have
created their own chat shorthand. The follow-
ing dialogue (see the figure) among three
skypers quite literally takes this conversational
grammar to an extreme because it is a conver-
sation made up entirely of abbreviations and
acronyms.
People frequently mix in chat abbreviations in
their conversations. When the same circle of
friends converse all the time, there is a ten-
dency to spontaneously evolve their own pri-
vate shorthand.
To see the conversation in full English, flip the
book upside down.

Another way to clean your window is to right-click in the body of the message
window and select Clear Messages, which wipes out all the messages in your
window. Fortunately, your neatness doesn’t clean out anyone else’s windows.
If you really want to pare down your messages to their simplest form, change
the chat style in the message window to IRC (Internet relay chat). Choose
Tools➪Options➪Advanced and select IRC-like Style from the Chat Style to
Use menu. Deselect the Show Timestamp with Chat Messages option. Your
chat window will hold more messages in a smaller space (but might be
harder to read).
Chatting in the Past, Present, and Future
Chats persist. That is, they don’t necessarily disappear when you leave 
them; they come back when you call them; and they can go on and on. In 
contrast to other instant messaging systems, Skype chats are like social
diaries. They record and remember everything you wrote and everything
written to you unless you make an effort to eliminate them by clearing win-
dows or limiting how long they are saved in history. Read on for more about
saving and deleting chats.
The never-ending chat
A Skype chat can last forever. A group of chatters, passionate about a particular
topic, can form a chat club, forum, or special interest group. If they bookmark
the chat, then each time someone writes a new comment all participants are
instantly notified in their chat taskbar, even if all the chatters have closed their
chat windows. In fact, when a new message is added, all the bookmarked chats
“wake up.” To make a chat an ongoing chat, each member of the club must leave
his or her Skype software running. The best part is those 3:00 a.m. epiphanies
when all the points you wished you’d made in the middle of the chat come to
you. Now you have an audience.
When the chat is over. . .
All chats are archived. It is a default setting in Skype to save every last bit of
chat history. You are not forced to do this, and turning off the chat history is
a privacy feature (to the extent that chatting is a private act). But the idea
that everything you write, and everything everyone writes to you, can be
saved, published to an RSS feed, added to a blog, or just printed, outrivals
the most ambitious diary ever written.

Preserving your chats “forever” is easy. Choose Tools➪Options➪Privacy and
select Forever from the pop-up menu that appears. Of course, you can also
choose No History, 2 weeks, 1 month, or 3 months, but there’s something to
be said for having the ability to save your words forever (or at least until you
get a new computer). In the same Privacy window, you can click Clear Chat
History and wipe out your entire archive. The catch is, your chats probably
exist on someone else’s computer, and maybe that person is an avid chat col-
lector. Chats are saved locally, not on any central server. All chat participants
have equal-opportunity archiving capability.
Searching, saving, and sending past chats
You are just finishing a chat that lasted for hours — a discussion among three
international offices about the state of their factory construction. Now you
have to take all the information and organize it for a presentation. Who said
what, when, in what order, and how do you find it?
Searching your chats
In a way, Skype conference chats are efficient in that they save all the informa-
tion in the exact language each person used. All the statements, re-statements,
corrections, corroborations, statistics, Web links, and even emoticons are
frozen in time. You can relive the whole experience as many times as you 
want (which we call an added benefit, for the purposes of this book).
To collect bits and pieces from this massive conversation, right-click in the
message window and click Find to open the Find dialog box. You can search
by word, time, or Skype Name. Because the chat may go on for pages and
pages, the Find utility lets you search up or down (from the end or the 
beginning of the chat).
To find a specific chat, select the Chat History tab and scroll down to pick a
topic or first sentence, date, or contact; then, double-click to reopen the chat.
Saving your chats
Transform your chats from words in a chat window to a document or presen-
tation by selecting all the messages, copying them, and then pasting them
into a text editor. These documents retain the messages, timestamps, and
author of each statement. Some skypers have turned their chats into RSS
feeds and podcasts, passed them through text-to-speech programs to make
them audible, or even used them as captions for a movie illustrating the 
chat topic.

Chapter 6: The Mad Chatter

Transcripts of chat sessions are on your hard drive. If you switch machines,
such as between home and office, the session is associated only with the
machine you were using. If you need to have the transcripts, Skype contacts,
and in fact all your files centralized in one place, you can run Skype “on a
stick” (see Chapter 9 for more information on USB Smart Drives, which are
thumb-sized drives that have enough capacity to contain the Skype program
and all your personal Skype information).
Sending your chats
Message texts can be pasted into email documents, word processors, presen-
tation tools, new Skype chat windows, or Web authoring tools. When the chat
is preserved in its new form, it can be emailed, posted on the Web, entered
into a blog, or sent in any way digital documents are shared. If you want, you
can print them and send them by snail mail.

The three rules of “chattiquette”
 Rule 1: When your Skype buddy is on the
other side of the world and you want to call
at an odd hour, use the chat window to
notify, send information, make an appoint-
ment, or otherwise alert him or her because
you know a call would be disruptive.
 Rule 2: Use a text editor, such as Notepad,
to compose long paragraphs and then copy
and paste the text all at one time. This way,
you avoid the carriage return breaks in a
chat window and make the chat more effi-
cient because you won’t make your chat
buddies wait as you type.
 Rule 3: Use chat abbreviations only when
you know they won’t baffle your chat bud-
dies. Use them liberally when everyone is
on the same chat wagon.

I
n the opening scene of the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey (produced in
1968), Dave Bowman is talking with his wife and children over a video
phone. As the movie title indicates, the story takes place in 2001. Back in
1968, we waited with bated breath for the advent of video phones. We waited
a long time: The year 2001 came and went with hardly a trace of video
phones becoming a reality. Finally, history is about to catch up with science
fiction, thanks to Skype.
This chapter walks you through choosing the right equipment and environ-
ment for setting up Skype with video. We also take you through a webcam
selection, connection, detection, and even a section about video protection.
Okay, we know when to stop, or, to quote the sportscaster Warner Wolf,
“Let’s go to the videotape” (in this case, let’s get started with Skype video). 
Enhancing Your Conversations 
with Live Video
The addition of video to a call may make the difference between touching
base and enjoying a true visit, describing an item for sale and clinching the
deal, or worrying whether someone is doing okay and seeing for yourself.
Coming together in agreement, truly communicating intentions, and clearly
describing objects are all circumstances that benefit from the ability to see
eye to eye, literally. Videoconferencing can have some unexpected bonuses:

 Webcams enable group participation: By setting up a webcam, a family
can join in on a Skype conversation without having to pass headsets
around from person to person.
 Webcams eliminate wired microphones: Good webcams have built-in
microphones, so you don’t need to use the computer’s internal micro-
phone or add an external microphone.
 Webcams may eliminate echoes: Webcams with noise cancellation 
features eliminate the voice echo your Skype partner may hear if you
don’t have a headset. This noise cancellation feature lets you speak,
unfettered, while using Skype video.
 Webcams eliminate wired headsets: A surprising advantage of connect-
ing a webcam to communicate is that a good webcam takes the place of
tethered headsets. Sound is routed through the webcam speakers instead.
If you don’t have a webcam, you can still receive a video call. Skype software
lets you see video transmitted from another user even if you don’t reciprocate.
Considering Types of Webcams
Before you use Skype video, you have to beg, borrow, or buy a webcam.
Picking a webcam can make the difference between a great videoconference
and a frustrating one. First, determine how, where, and why you are using
videoconferencing. Then pick a unit that best matches those needs. If you
make video calls at a desktop in your office, you can get a unit that is larger
and can be moved around, placed on a shelf, or mounted on an office wall. If
you are on the move and need to be totally portable, choosing a small unit
that attaches to your laptop is a better choice.
Newer computer models are beginning to include built-in webcams, such as
the Apple iMacs and MacBook Pro laptops. A built-in webcam is the most
compact way to include video. But if you don’t have that option, you’ll have
to do a little research and make a few good choices. The following section
should help you with your webcam buying spree.
Standalone webcams
The standalone webcam rests on a platform or a boom (a small pole that sup-
ports the webcam), or it nests in a stand. Standalone cams are usually larger
and some may have more features than those smaller units that clip onto a
laptop or flat screen, although high-end clip-ons are almost indistinguishable
in performance from high-end standalones. If you have a dedicated video-
conferencing area, have multiple people at your conferencing station, or want
to include a fair amount of items in your video viewing screen, then stand-
alone webcams are for you.
104
Part II: As You Like It: Skype Your Way 

Logitech’s Quickcam Orbit MP (see Figure 7-1) is an example of a feature-rich
standalone webcam. The camera is a shiny orb with a wide-angle lens that
perches on a variable-height post or small stand. Its ultra-wide-angle lens
takes in a large area around you. You may have the corner of a room, or a
curved conference display set filled with your latest widgets on floor-to-
ceiling shelves. The camera can include your widgets along with you and
your sales partner in the mix. This webcam also follows you around your
work area using a capability called Face Tracking. The Face Tracking 
webcam has some cool advantages:
 Face Tracking allows the camera to fix its lens on the dominant face in
the picture (or the most active one).
 With Face Tracking, as you move, so will the camera: Logitech’s
Quickcam Orbit MP webcam actually has a motorized lens that 
physically moves as it tracks you.
 Face Tracking accommodates both pan and tilt motion as you move
across and up and down: Some webcams move within a 189-degree field
of view and a 109-degree tilt up and down.
 Face Tracking adjusts the webcam focus as you move closer or farther
away: If you move closer, the image is tight, framing your face. If you
move back, the webcam adjusts its zoom to reveal more of the room. As
you move, the webcam changes focus dynamically. Having a camera that
makes its own zoom and pan decisions is, well, actually a little spooky!
See the section “Follow this face, or that face, or those faces!” later in this
chapter for more about Face Tracking.
Clip-on webcams
The clip-on webcam perches on the top of a flat screen and is perfect for a
portable videoconferencing setup. One of the big advantages of a clip-on
webcam is that it overcomes the common drawback of the casual videocon-
ferencer. That is, most people stare at their screen, at the video image of the
person they are talking with, rather than look into the camera. Unfortunately,
most cameras are placed in an awkward position, so it doesn’t make sense to
look into the lens. It makes much more sense to watch the person on the
screen. But then you have two people not quite making eye contact in a
medium that’s supposed to connect people face to face!
Although anchoring a clip-on at the top of a screen helps aim the lens, some
clip-on webcams pivot to allow some subtle adjustment of the lens. You pivot
and aim the webcam at your face while you test the software settings for your
clip-on. After it’s set, you don’t have to worry about the awkward stare into
the computer.
105
Chapter 7: Skyping Eye to Eye: Skype with Video

Some clip-on webcams, such as the Logitech QuickCam for Notebooks Pro
(see Figure 7-2), have a digital Face Tracking feature (rather than a motorized
lens tracker, as described previously) that keeps you in focus as you move
toward or away from the lens. The camera doesn’t move, but the software
Figure 7-1:
The

106
Part II: As You Like It: Skype Your Way 

detects faces and makes adjustments to keep them front and center. If you are
talking and suddenly lean back in your chair, the image zooms out to show
you and the room around you. When you lean forward, the software tries to
keep you in the viewing area by zooming in and eliminating the background.

Chapter 7: Skyping Eye to Eye: Skype with Video

If you don’t want to use a wired headset and microphone, you can take
advantage of your webcam’s microphone and noise cancellation feature 
without having the webcam active (heaven forbid you have a bad hair day).
In this mode, the webcam’s microphone can continue to work even if the
webcam settings in Skype are not enabled.
Specialty webcams
The most common use for a webcam is to see the person you are calling. But
there are other webcams that have more specialized missions. Our favorite is
the ProScope USB microscope (see Figure 7-3), available for both PC and Mac
platforms. After you download and install the proper drivers that come with
this device, it works just like a webcam, with a little twist. The microscope
can, of course, take extreme close-ups of objects and materials. Some micro-
scopes come with a variety of lenses to increase the power of the “macro”
photographic image. There is even a high-res version of the scope (find out
more at www.proscopehr.com/index.html).

Part II: As You Like It: Skype Your Way 

Why would you want to use a USB microscope? Perhaps you are a coin collec-
tor (see Figure 7-4) and would like to make some trades, purchases, or sales
within your Skype coin club. Connect the microscope, turn on videoconfer-
encing, and put your wares on display. The same can be done for other col-
lections; obsidian arrowheads, cameo jewelry, scrimshaw art, and postage
stamps are just a sample of collectibles you can show in detail over Skype
using a USB microscope.
Another use for a USB microscope is the transmission of live video streaming
in field research. If you are a biology teacher, equip your students with a
laptop, a USB microscope, and an assignment to capture images of moss 
samples from a local park. The USB microscope has a built-in light source
that will illuminate a bit of moss on a rock or tree bark. Students in other
schools anywhere in the world can receive the video of local flora and add 
it to a database of moss samples for research projects.
Transmitting live video from the field is not only inspiring for students and
teachers alike but also arms the students of today with tools for thinking 
about how to design the laboratories of tomorrow. Skype videoconferencing
combined with USB microscopy makes it possible to routinely use field micro-
scopes in disciplines such as forensics, and teams of people spread over thou-
sands of miles can collaboratively engage in problem solving in real time.

Chapter 7: Skyping Eye to Eye: Skype with Video

Understanding Webcam Features
Image size, automatic and manual pan and tilt control, and autofocus are all
important features of a good webcam. To help you decide which webcam to
use, here are some things to consider.
Sharpening those pixels
The images rendered by most inexpensive webcams have a classic security
camera look — jumpy black-and-white images that have more in common
with Charlie Chaplin movies than Paramount Pictures. However, the newest
webcams have made tremendous improvements in transmission, color ren-
dering, and image resolution. Some give you a choice of image quality or size.
If you pick one with a better quality image, though, you may run into some
transmission problems. Better pictures contain more information that must
be pushed through those Internet cables to reach your Skype buddy. The
general rule is to pick a size and resolution that’s not too large and not too
small, but just right. Experiment with your equipment to figure out which size
works best. If transmission is choppy, reduce the picture size in your webcam
software preferences. To change your video image size, open the software
installed with your specific webcam. You cannot change the image size within
Skype software. It is important to explore your webcam software before you
make a video call on Skype so that you can be prepared to troubleshoot if
there is a problem.
If you are on a Skype video call and you don’t see yourself in your video
window, reduce the pixel resolution of your webcam software in the video
settings preferences. Chances are, you’ll reappear!
110
Part II: As You Like It: Skype Your Way 
“MicroSkype”
There are many ways to use Skype and a USB
microscope. Here are some kinds of activities
you may want to try.
 Show close-up images of the mint mark of
coins for sale.
 Video the undersides of house plant leaves so
that the local botanical garden can identify
the mites eating your precious rhododendron.
 Show the engraved image on a collectible
stamp.
 Focus on the artist’s signature on the
bottom of a porcelain figurine.
 Transmit the carat marking on a piece of
gold jewelry you are showcasing.

Follow this face, or that face, 
or those faces!
Motorized and “intelligent” Face Tracking is a feature that frees you from end-
lessly adjusting your webcam to keep your face in the viewfinder. The digital
or motorized face tracker enables you choose to track one person or detect
several people at a time (see Figure 7-5). When a group is in the picture, the
motorized face tracker adjusts to try to try to keep everyone in the frame,
even if everyone is moving in different directions. Logitech’s Quickcam for
Notebooks Pro software lets you choose Face Tracking for a single user or
multiple users to follow an individual or a group.
Face Tracking doesn’t just make webcams easier to use with Skype. Software
that tracks facial features has the potential to perform other kinds of func-
tions as well; for example, you may be able to have the software recognize 
a face, remember a face from a former videoconference, or look up and match
a face from a library or photo album. Facial recognition is a handy feature for
those of you who never forget a face but never remember a name. You may
also be able to analyze the facial expressions and head motions of individuals
in different cultures (great for businessmen and diplomats), follow an individ-
ual’s eye movements, or even have the software read lips. All these high-tech
features are in the works and will eventually add power to our Skype video
communication.

Toggling into focus
If you are a little hesitant to let your camera follow you around, you 
can always activate the manual pan and zoom option. To do so, follow 
these steps:
1. From the Skype menu, choose Tools➪Options➪Video➪Test Webcam➪
Webcam Settings.
2. Select the Off radio button to stop Face Tracking.
Click the arrows in the Webcam Settings window that appear above the 
Face Tracking radio button choices to move the camera lens in any of four
directions as well as to zoom in and zoom out (see Figure 7-6). Disabling 
Face Tracking in the Webcam Setting window is preferable when you want 
the camera to stay focused on an object that you are describing, or if you
want to control who is displayed in the video as you speak. If your mom 
were sitting beside you in front of a webcam as you spoke to your niece, 
you would probably want the camera on your mom’s reaction when she 
finds out that a great-grandchild is on the way. Use the manual pan toggle 
to make sure that the camera is exactly where you want it . . . on your 
mom’s broad smile!

Part II: As You Like It: Skype Your Way 

Shopping for Webcams
While you’re webcam shopping, it’s a good idea to review the list of features
published for each webcam you’re considering. Compare that list with the 
following items to get the most flexibility out of videoconferencing with Skype:
 Wide field of view
 Microphone included with camera
 Microphone contains noise cancellation capability
 Minimum lens distortion
 Low light boost
 Manual pan and zoom control
 Face Tracking software
 Avatar creation software included
 USB 2 enabled for fast transmission
 Wide-angle lens
The less you have to fiddle with your webcam, the smoother your video 
conversation will be. A webcam with a fixed focus nails you to the chair. You
can’t move out of range, reach for a book, or lean back in your chair without
slipping out of camera range. A webcam with a wide field of view that tracks
your movement, keeps your features on-screen even in dim light, and doesn’t
distort your features makes video chats a more natural activity.
Webcams with built-in microphones, especially noise cancellation micro-
phones, give you a definite advantage. Microphone webcams eliminate an
extra piece of hardware with extra wires that take up precious USB ports 
on your computer. If making a video call forces you to plug in a webcam, a
microphone, and headphones as well as deal with the tangle of wires, plugs,
and devices, you may just decide to forego the whole experience. One good
webcam combines all these devices, simplifying the setup and letting you
concentrate on what you want to say, not what you need to plug in to say it.
Often, you can take advantage of your webcam’s noise cancellation micro-
phone even if you don’t enable video. You can choose your webcam as the
sound input device in your computer’s sound control panel and not even
have to set up a separate microphone! To do so, follow these steps:
1. Choose Start➪My Computer➪Control Panels➪
Sounds and Audio Devices➪Audio.
2. In the Sound Recording section of the Audio window, click the 
drop-down list and select your webcam.

Installing and Setting Up Video 
for Skype (On Windows)
Now it’s time to roll up your sleeves and plug in that camera. You need to install
some software and then configure it before you launch your on-screen debut.
Installing your video driver
Your webcam should come with its own installation software. Although each
brand is different, all involve some common steps to install the software 
drivers. Following are some tips to consider.
Turn off your anti-virus and anti-adware software before installing new video
drivers. You can turn them back on after the video installation.
The webcam you may be using may not have the most up-to-date video
driver for your computer and operating system. Check for updates from the
manufacturer on its Web site. (Hint: Look at the support and download pages
for updated drivers.)
Don’t plug in your webcam before you install the video driver. In almost
every webcam installation, you need to wait until the software prompts you
to plug in your device (see Figure 7-7).
If you are encountering technical difficulties with your video, go to Appendix
B of this book; you may find some help there. If the installation did not work,
simply uninstall the video software and start over with the proper sequence.

Setting Skype video options
To configure your Skype video options, choose Tools➪Options➪Video 
(see the left side of Figure 7-8).
Video options require that you have a video device, either a webcam or soft-
ware such as CrazyTalk (which animates a character’s mouth and mimics
your lip movements as you speak). To use video, you have to select Enable
Skype Video before continuing. You should deselect the When I’m in a Call:
Start My Video Automatically option. You probably should also set the
Automatically Receive Video From option to People in My Contact List. 
Here’s a list of Skype options you may want to set:

Chapter 7: Skyping Eye to Eye: Skype with Video

Checking your sound settings
You’ll want to make sure that you’re actually piping in sound through your
webcam and that the volume level is adequate. Many webcams have visual
sound meters that light up as you speak so that you get feedback concerning
your volume. One reason to check your webcam’s sound is that you may have
more than one sound input device attached to your computer. If you’re unsure
of which one is active, just tap the microphone — you’ll find out soon enough!
To adjust your volume:
1. Choose Start➪Settings➪Control Panels➪Sounds and Audio Devices.
The Sounds and Audio Devices window appears.
2. Click the Audio tab to open the Sound Recording window; there, click
the Volume button.
In the window that appears, you see a virtual sound mixer with four
volume sliders. Among the sliders are two choices for audio input, Line
In and Microphone. Select the check box beneath the volume slider
labeled Microphone
3. Using your mouse, move the slider up or down to raise or lower the
volume.
Making a video call on your PC
Now you’d better comb your hair because you’re ready (we hope) to become
a video star. Glance in the mirror to check your smile, clear your throat,
adjust the camera, and take a deep breath; you’re about to go live on Skype!
To make a video call on your PC, follow these steps:
1. Select a contact from your list in the main Skype window.
2. Click the green call button.
3. When your contact answers, click the little video icon located at the
bottom of the Skype call window.
That’s all there is to it! You’re on the air in your very own show with your very
own fans (even if those are just Mom, your kids, or Dennis from the office). 
It’s a good idea to test your webcam before you start your video call. From
your Skype menu, choose Tools➪Options➪Video. In the Video Options
window, click the Test Webcam button. Your video window will appear with a
live image. If you don’t see anything, make sure that you have selected the
Enable Skype Video check box and your cables are all plugged in!

Installing and Setting Up Video 
For Skype (On the Macintosh)
Some Macintosh computer models, such as the iMacs, have cameras built 
in, so there is no need to install a separate webcam and special drivers.
Macintosh laptops and towers can accept firewire webcams (webcams that
connect with a special firewire cable for fast video data transmission), such
as the iSight camera, also without any additional software installation. Skype
works seamlessly with the Macintosh video drivers to detect iSight as well as
built-in cameras.
Not all webcams work with Macintosh or PC computers. Make sure that you
read the system requirements on the webcam package before you buy it for
your Skype video setup.
Setting up Skype video on the Macintosh is simple. The following steps use
iSight as an example, but the steps should be similar for others.
1. Choose Skype➪Preferences➪Video.
The video configuration window opens (see Figure 7-9). If you don’t have
a built-in camera, plug your iSight webcam into a firewire port and turn
it on by opening the lens.
2. From the Camera drop-down list, select your camera if it is not
already detected.
3. Select the Enable Skype Video check box.
4. Choose your video options by selecting the check boxes or radio 
buttons (as the case may be) next to each choice, as follows:
• When I Am in a Call: It’s best not to check the option to start your
video automatically. Give yourself a chance to compose yourself
before appearing on camera.
• Automatically Receive Video From: You can be super cautious
and choose no one, or you can allow video only from people on
your Contacts list.
• Show That I Have Video To: You can choose to keep your video
capability a secret and choose no one, or reveal it only to people
on your Contacts list.
5. Click the red gel radio button on the far-left corner of the window
title bar to close your Preferences window.

Chapter 7: Skyping Eye to Eye: Skype with Video

There you have it! You’re all set to make a video call using your Macintosh,
and you can communicate both with other Macintosh and PC users with this
video capability. To make a video call on your Macintosh:
1. Select a contact from your Contacts list in the main Skype window.
2. Click the green call button next to your contact’s name.
3. When your contact answers, click the little video icon (see Figure
7-10) located at the bottom of the Skype call window.
Your video will be transmitted to your contact. When video is live, your
video icon turns an aqua blue.
Skype doesn’t automatically broadcast your image, even if you enable video
in your options. The default setting in Skype is protective: Nobody has to see
you in your pajamas when you’re making or receiving a Skype call. To make
yourself visible, you have to click the blue video icon when a call comes in
(see Figure 7-10).

Skype “Webcammandments”
We’ve all seen the caption rolling across our
blank TV screens: “Please pardon the interrup-
tion. We are experiencing technical difficul-
ties.” Skype video is your show, and a little
attention to lights, sound, connections, and
camera placement helps your viewers enjoy it
more. Use the following “commandments” to
help you keep your show on the air:
 Plug in your camera.
 Plug in your camera before launching Skype.
 Plug in your microphone before using Skype
(unless your video camera has a built-in
microphone).
 Point the camera the right way.
 Turn on a light and let it shine on you!
 Turn up the sound. Make sure that your
sound setting isn’t on mute.
 Make sure that your image resolution is not
set too high; otherwise, you might see funky
pixels and colors. You can change your
image resolution within the specific video
software installed with your webcam. Not
all webcam software offers a choice of res-
olutions, so you may not have to worry
about changing this. But if you have a
choice, a video image that is 640 by 480
pixels and millions of colors may be a little
rich for transmission bandwidth.
 If you don’t see or hear anything, close
Skype, plug in all your devices, and start
Skype again.

 Select an all-purpose background: The simplest set is a solid-colored
background. Quiet backdrops such as curtains or undecorated walls
actually make transmitting video a little easier because there is less
visual information to send. However, with high-speed lines and more 
efficient webcam software, you can add more interesting backgrounds
without degrading the video signal too much.
 Create a mood: A good backdrop for your video setting might be a
library wall. Another is your collection of photos or artwork on display.
On the other hand, if you’re teaching online and need to demonstrate a
lesson — perhaps you are teaching a Sign Language class, for example —
then a simple, blank backdrop will prevent distractions for your viewers.
 Lighting your set: Having a well-lighted area keeps you from being lost
in the shadows. Lighting brings out color and detail of objects and indi-
viduals. Sensitive webcams can boost low light, but they need to have at
least some light to boost.
You can move a lamp stand close to your “broadcast station” if you
don’t have enough natural light. Arrange your light source to illuminate
your face. Fluorescent lights, usually mounted on the ceiling, cast a
greenish glow (not very flattering), whereas tungsten lights, such as the
ones usually used in table lamps, warm your skin tones.
Although natural light is best, it’s available only during the day, of
course. If you do have a source of natural light, take advantage of it,
because you still need a little more light than whatever your computer
screen provides.
During the day, you can set up a laptop and portable webcam near a
window, but be careful not to aim the camera at the window unless you
want to appear in silhouette. Shift your chair, or move the angle of your
laptop or desktop to take advantage of a light source such as a window
behind a desk.
 Control background sound: Another consideration for an effective
video set is background sound. If you live near a road or highway, you
might want to move away from the window to eliminate all that motor
noise. If you are near a construction site, calling in the evening, after
workers go home, is a better choice.
 Choose a set outside your home: With wireless Internet access in public
parks, cafes, or even libraries, you can have a video chat from your
favorite hangout. Keep the location consistent, though. Every time you
pick a new place to set up your webcam, you need to find a wireless con-
nection, adjust your position to take advantage of the light, and accommo-
date background noise. Showing up at the same place at the same time
shortens setup time. If you pick a venue with a lively, noisy background,
dedicated headsets are required so that you can hear and be heard.
120
Part II: As You Like It: Skype Your Way 

A picture is worth a thousand words, but you need to hear the words as well
as see the picture; otherwise, videoconferencing isn’t much fun. Visual “noise”
can be as disruptive as any other brand of noise. On the other hand, all that
background activity may be just what you want your caller to see. There’s no
rule that videoconferencing needs to be just face to face. Determining the view
your webcam shows makes you a director, of sorts, so be creative as you
express yourself. Take advantage of the capability. A few preparations can
make a big difference in your experience.
Your videoconferencing environment is a balanced combination of backdrop,
light availability, and camera model. Some more expensive webcams are
much more sensitive to low light and transmit significantly better at night.
Video in Action
One fun aspect of using Skype video is that it doesn’t have to be an isolated
tool. Combining Skype video with other Skype features opens even more 
possibilities.
Video with chat
You might think that having a chat window open during a video session
would be redundant. After all, you can see and talk — why would you want 
to write, too? Here are several great reasons:
 Exchange paragraphs of text: If you are collaborating on a presentation
and you want to extract a paragraph from an existing document, you can
copy and paste your work into the chat window as you are talking with
your partner; this way, you can show the information.
 Pass a Web link: You can give someone a Web link by just pasting the
URL into the chat. Sometimes there’s no substitute for connecting
straight into a site. Doing so clarifies the conversation because showing
a Web site, image, or paragraph is easier than describing it.
 Assist in conversations with multiple languages: If you are conferencing
with someone who speaks a different language, the chat window can serve
as an instant caption to clarify, translate, or define confusing phrases.
You can find out much more about using Skype chat features in Chapter 6.

Chapter 7: Skyping Eye to Eye: Skype with Video

Video with file transfer
Video lets you see your fellow skyper, so it’s natural for both of you to want
to see what you are both talking about. Unfortunately, holding up an article,
letter, or any printed text in front of a webcam is likely to produce a slightly
shaky, slightly fuzzy image that is more than slightly illegible. Instead of hold-
ing up a paper, transfer that file (see Chapter 6) if you have it in digital form.
If you don’t have a digital file, you can scan the article in advance of your
video call and then transfer it. You don’t have to open your email to send the
file, nor does your recipient have to open his or her email to download an
attachment containing the file. We’ve found that transferring a file while we
are connected through Skype video does not slow down the transfer rate.
Mention it, send it, and show it. It’s almost like being in the same room!
Creative Uses of Skype Video
After your get your video gear ready, you can find many ways to use it
beyond a cozy video chat with Grandma. Following are a few video scenarios
to consider.
Setting up a “NannyCam” 
or SurveillanceCam
With Skype, you can set up a “NannyCam” to make sure that your kids at
home are fast asleep by 8:00 p.m. Here are some quick and easy ways to set
up a surveillance camera at home:
 Create a special Skype Name for your NannyCam: Be sure to set to set
your Skype Sign In settings to Sign Me in When Skype Starts and Start
Skype When the Computer Starts. This way, if your computer reboots,
your NannyCam starts up automatically.
If you are already logged in to Skype, you can change these settings by
choosing File➪Sign Out from the Skype menu. A login page appears
where you can set these options.
 After you sign in with your NannyCam Skype Name, add your regular
Skype Name to your Contacts list: The Contacts list for the NannyCam
consists of only one person, namely, you. Of course, you may want to
include your spouse’s Skype Name alongside yours. Whatever the case,
the list is very short.
 In your NannyCam’s privacy options, be sure to set the Allow Calls
From option to Only People from My Contacts: Setting this option
ensures that only you and your spouse can connect to the NannyCam.
122
Part II: As You Like It: Skype Your Way 

 Enable video and set it to start automatically: In your Skype Video
Options window, select Enable Video and then select the check box next
to Start My Video Automatically. In the Advanced Options, set the Call
option to Automatically Answer Incoming Calls.
Test your NannyCam by connecting to it over Skype from one of the other
computers in your home, or even from work.
Be sure to adjust your webcam to point to the specific area of the room you’re
watching, and make sure that the lighting level is adequate. Remember, most
webcams give some visual signal that they are transmitting, such as an LED
that lights up. You can adjust the audio volume levels for the computer speak-
ers next to the NannyCam so that you have a little PA system, or you can turn
off sound altogether.
This kind of setup can give you some peace of mind when you are traveling and
want to make sure that everything at home is safe and sound. Best of all, this is
a simple and very affordable home security solution for homeowners. Get your-
self an inexpensive webcam and dust off that out-of-date computer taking up
space in your closet. You won’t have to worry about whether it has enough
power; the webcam and Skype are the only applications you need it to run.
Using video in the field
Video with Skype does not always have to entail having two people who are
visually connected, one on each end of a live conversation. A USB micro-
scope attached to your portable laptop and Skype on a Wi-Fi network can
give you a close-up view of the world. There are plenty of practical uses of
Skype and video that aren’t limited to headshots of people talking to one
another. Read on for a few ideas.
Getting the scoop, and then some
Field reporting using a laptop that connects to the Internet from one of the
phone company’s PCMCIA cards, equipped with Skype and a small video
camera, can be a powerful tool for journalists. Whether a reporter writes for
a newspaper, magazine, e-zine, podcast, or blog, the combination of laptops,
webcams, and Skype is the equivalent of a TV studio on a shoestring budget.
Transmitting live pictures, sound, and text from the middle of an event elimi-
nates any time lapse between what happens in the world and how quickly
people hear about it. Television has long been able to bring immediate news
to a broadcast medium. Skype video, audio, chat, and file transfer put this
same power into the hands of individuals. An enterprising Skype reporter can
take his or her live feed and make it into a podcast, or even a “vodcast” (a
video podcast) for large-scale distribution. Reporters can even connect to a
newsroom with a live Skype video call and have their transmission broadcast
on television.
123
Chapter 7: Skyping Eye to Eye: Skype with Video

Searching for answers with Skype and a scope
Researchers can use Skype video to deploy a group of biologists (or budding
student biologists) to collect data, information, and images in the field.
Connect a USB microscope to each field laptop and transmit pictures of soil,
water, moss, and lichen samples over Skype video. The research group can
coordinate field research efforts to their best advantage and send images to
remote laboratories, schools, and colleges.
Any field-based research benefits from video transmission tools. You can be
digging for arrowheads, pottery shards, or other archeological artifacts with
a live webcam or USB microscope serving as a research tool. You can enable
a remote expert on the receiving end of the video stream to perform an
instant analysis. The scientific tasks can be distributed among field, lab, and
academic sites. More researchers can be involved, with less disruption to
their own schedules. The research efforts can even be multinational.
Skype is currently limited to two video partners at a time, but with some
third-party software programs (check out Festoon at www.festooninc.
com), video conferencing among more than two people at a time is possible,
which multiplies the collaboration efforts of any field-based projects.
Tuning into the business of Skype video
Use Skype video to sell your wares, collaborate on developing a product, or
inspect a custom-made prototype before shipping it out to the manufacturer.
In business relationships, seeing the person you’re doing business with is
helpful, but seeing a product is crucial. Skype video is a quick way to make
business communications more efficient and speed the workflow and produc-
tion environment.
On a small scale, you can set up a jewelry cam to transmit pictures of items,
such as rings and earrings, to potential customers. Use a USB microscope to
take a closer look at the engraved markings on various items as you talk
about each piece. A static picture is helpful to a buyer, but video is dynamic.
You can respond to a request to focus on a stone or a setting, thereby satisfy-
ing a buyer’s curiosity and overcoming any reluctance on the part of your
customer to make a purchase.

and SkypeOut

I
f people the world over were glued to their PCs, talking over Skype would
be a cinch. However, people are constantly moving about and are often
closer to a cell phone or a regular landline than to a computer with access to
the Internet. Skype offers two kinds of services, SkypeIn and SkypeOut, to
extend Skype’s reach to ordinary phones. This chapter is your guide that
explains what these services are, how to set them up, and how to use them.
Connecting Skype with 
Regular Phone Lines
The point of SkypeOut and SkypeIn is to give you seamless connectivity to all
your contacts, associates, friends, and relatives, regardless of whether they
are using the Internet or are using regular phone lines. These services have
nice features. It is easy to dial out, and you get a record of your SkypeOut
calls. SkypeIn comes with a complimentary Voicemail service, eliminating the
need to be tethered to your computer. Skype Voicemail can be used for any
incoming Skype calls, not just the SkypeIn ones.
You’re not required to use SkypeOut or SkypeIn. When you do need to use it,
though, you can have it running in a matter of minutes and at very low cost.

Understanding SkypeOut
The central concept of SkypeOut is simple. If you’re on Skype, you should
have the ability to speak to anyone, whether the person is on a computer
attached to the Internet, or on a landline or mobile phone. Also, the process
of connecting to someone on a telephone should be just as simple as skyping
to a person on another computer. SkypeOut is the service that seamlessly
bridges Skype users on the Internet to regular phones.
Be aware that Skype is not set up to make emergency calls such as 911. 
Skype is not a replacement for your ordinary phone and cannot be used 
for emergency calling.
SkypeOut pricing
A PC-to-PC connection over Skype is always free. A PC-to-phone connection
entails an extra service (SkypeOut) and may entail a fee for its use. As of this
writing, SkypeOut calls made from locations in North America to phones in
North America were free from May 15th through December 31st, 2006. You
can check the Skype Web site to see whether the free period has been
extended. By the way, there is absolutely no registration or signup for the 
free service. Just get on Skype and use it!
When a fee is attached to a call, you are told what the per-minute charges 
are before you make the call. To make a call, you must first buy Skype credit.
Prepayments are made in $10 increments. The next section explains how to
set up your SkypeOut credit.
Setting up SkypeOut
To buy Skype credit, you need to have two important things in place:
 A Skype password.
 A valid email account: The email account that you supply is the one
associated with your Skype Name (see Chapter 2 for details about 
establishing your Skype Name).
Without these items, you cannot buy Skype credit or make use of services
such as SkypeIn or Voicemail.
126
Part II: As You Like It: Skype Your Way 

You can purchase SkypeOut credit while running your Skype application or
by going to the Skype Web site (www.skype.com) from your browser. Here,
we show you how to do it from your Skype program. Although the process is
entirely equivalent, the screens for purchasing credit directly through the
Skype application differ from the way they appear if you go directly to the
Web site from your browser to purchase credit.
Purchasing credit through your Skype application
When you click the My Account panel of the main Skype window (see 
Figure 8-1), it expands to reveal various links, one of which is Buy Skype
Credit. Depending on what Skype services you already have in place, you
may see other links, including Voicemail and SkypeIn. To buy Skype credit,
follow these steps:
1. Click the Buy Skype Credit link.
You should momentarily see a padlock display (see Figure 8-2), signifying
that you are securely connecting to the Skype site.
2. Fill in the requested billing information.
You are asked to fill out some basic information (see Figure 8-3) and
method of payment (which can be PayPal, Visa, MasterCard, or other
forms of payments, such as a wire transfer).

Chapter 8: The Ins and Outs of SkypeIn and SkypeOut
Skype user profile: Christel
Christel, a young woman living and 
working in the French Alps, loves to 
travel around the world on her vaca-
tions. She visits the United States regularly and
has made many friends all over the country (one
of this book’s authors is one of them). She tries to
keep up with everyone through email, but prefers
direct contact. She also wants to improve her
English. She has become a veteran skyper, chat-
ting and conferencing with all her new friends.
Many of the people she has befriended during
her travels have not quite moved into the infor-
mation age and are still using plain old tele-
phones, or maybe a cell phone.
Christel decides to purchase some SkypeOut
minutes. The cost of a SkypeOut call from
France to the United States, to a landline tele-
phone, is about two cents a minute. Calling to a
mobile phone is more — about 20 cents a
minute. However, using SkypeOut gives Christel
some advantages. For example, if she’s calling
someone in a mountainous area, cell phone
service may be nonexistent or filled with “dead”
zones, but the SkypeOut service works fine.
Internet telephony has a consistently better
voice quality than cell phones. Skyping out to a
regular telephone is both inexpensive and clear
sounding. It gives Christel flexibility because
she can call out from any computer connected
to the Internet.
Another advantage to Christel is that she can buy
ten dollars’ worth of SkypeOut minutes at a time.
Because this is all you can buy until you use some
of those minutes, Christel can easily budget her
international calls so that she doesn’t incur end-
less charges; she just uses up her “calling cur-
rency” and then decides whether to purchase
more immediately or hold off for a while.

• Respond to security confirmation: As a security protection, Skype
emails a confirmation code and asks you to insert this code in a
confirmation email screen (see Figure 8-4).
• Receive feedback for your order: Skype displays a notification
that your order is being processed (see Figure 8-5) and sends you a
confirmation by email.

The price is right
SkypeOut calls vary in price. From at least May
15 through the end of December 2006, SkypeOut
calls originating in the U.S. and Canada made to
phones in the U.S. and Canada were completely
free. As of this writing, we’re hoping that this
deal will be extended. Besides this campaign,
Skype keeps running other SkypeOut cam-
paigns for different countries, such as Skype
Gift Days and others.
Always check Skype.com for current details;
there may be a campaign running just for your
destination.
When Skype does charge for international calls,
the cost is based on a per-minute fee. The most
popular destinations have one unified rate,
often referred to as the “SkypeOut Global Rate.”
As this book was written, the per-minute charge
was € 0.017 (euros), which is approximately the
same as U.S. $0.021 or £0.012 (pounds).
The countries included in the SkypeOut Global
Rate are as follows: Argentina (Buenos Aires),
Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Canada
(mobiles), Chile, China (Beijing, Guanzhou,
Shanghai, 
Shenzhen), 
China 
(mobiles),
Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece,
Hong Kong, Hong Kong (mobiles), Ireland, Italy,
Mexico (Mexico City, Monterrey), Netherlands,
New Zealand, Norway, Poland (Poland, Gdansk,
Warsaw), Portugal, Russia (Moscow, St.
Petersburg), Singapore, Singapore (mobiles),
South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland,
Taiwan (Taipei), the United Kingdom, the United
States (except Alaska and Hawaii) and the
United States (for mobile phones).
Countries with “mobiles” in the SkypeOut Global
Rate are charged the same 2.1 cents a minute
that it costs to make a SkypeOut call to a land-
line.
Calls to other countries have different individual
rates. You can find these rates on the Skype
Web site (www.skype.com). We also post a
quick link to the Skype page on our book Web
site (www.skype4dummies.com).
If your billing address is in the European Union,
a value-added tax surcharge may be applied
when you buy Skype credit.

Chapter 8: The Ins and Outs of SkypeIn and SkypeOut

As mentioned earlier in this chapter, you can buy Skype credit only in incre-
ments of $10 at a time and you cannot buy additional Skype credit immedi-
ately after a purchase without actually using some of your Skype credit. This
limitation is a fraud-protection mechanism designed to prevent computers or
hackers from artificially racking up free minutes. After you’ve established
yourself as a proper user, you get more power on the system.

Using SkypeOut
Using SkypeOut is truly simple. Just enter the phone number along with area
code into the input text line near the bottom of your main Skype window; then,
press Enter or click the green call button to start the call.
When you enter a phone number, SkypeOut doesn’t mind whether you use
hyphens or spaces. It even handles parentheses around the area code.
Dialing international calls
To make an international call, precede the phone number with a plus sign (+)
followed by the country code and the area code and local number. To find the
country code, use the SkypeOut Dialing Wizard. On the Windows platform,
you open this wizard by choosing Tools➪Call Forwarding and then clicking
the Get Help Entering Phone Numbers link (see Figure 8-6).
On the Macintosh platform, you may have to add a plus (+) symbol, followed
by the country code, the area code, and then the seven-digit phone number
(even for local numbers). In the United States, the country code is 1. So, for
example, to call toll-free information, you enter +1 800 555 1212.
The link for the SkypeOut Dialing Wizard does not appear until you have
bought SkypeOut credit.
When you click this link, you are taken to a Web page (see Figure 8-7) that lets
you choose which country you want and assists you in entering the number
correctly.
Figure 8-6:

131
Chapter 8: The Ins and Outs of SkypeIn and SkypeOut

Macintosh users have a slick feature called a Widget that enables Skype users
with Skype credit to make SkypeOut calls. It incorporates the long-distance
calling wizard, so you don’t even need to go to a Web page to construct the
phone number.
At the time you make your SkypeOut call, you know immediately what rate
you are being charged. Skype alerts you to the calling rate by displaying a
little caption that might say “United Kingdom 0.0253 $ per minute” (see
Figure 8-8). Very handy if you are watching your budget.
The number used in this example is a purely fictitious number. If you use a
number that doesn’t exist or is invalid, Skype warns you (see Figure 8-9).
As a particularly nice feature of SkypeOut, when you make SkypeOut calls,
Skype stores or caches the numbers even if they are not part of your Skype
Contacts list. The next time you start dialing a SkypeOut number, the portion
of the number you dial is matched against your Skype contacts and previ-
ously called SkypeOut numbers from the current session. For example, if you
start typing the 212 area code, all your 212 numbers pop up to the top of the
Contacts list. If you see your SkypeOut number in the displayed list, you can
click it and call the number. This is great if you frequently make international
calls to the same number. It is a time saver, and you won’t risk making errors
when you try to dial a long number.

Navigating touch-tone and voicemail systems
Some of the SkypeOut calls you make may be to automated services that
require you to press the touch-tone keypads of your phone. Because you’re
calling from a computer, what do you do when the automated voice says,
“Press 1 for Yes and 2 for No”? No problem! Skype provides you with a virtual
keypad called a dial pad (see Figure 8-10) found on the Dial tab. If your Dial
tab is not visible in the main Skype window, choose View➪View Dial from the
Skype main menu.

133
Chapter 8: The Ins and Outs of SkypeIn and SkypeOut

To make dialing on a SkypeOut call even easier, you can copy a phone
number residing in any document, such as an email, and paste it directly into
the Skype Dial tab. Sometimes phone numbers have parentheses surrounding
the area code. These will not cause you any problems. 
SkypeOut lets you call vanity numbers, which are phone numbers that have a
matching word or acronym on the dial pad of a touchtone phone. For example,
to order tax forms from the Internal Revenue Service, you can call 1-800-TAX-
FORM (1-800-829-3676). On the Skype Dial tab, you can enter 1-800-TAX-FORM
and click the green call button. Skype then places a SkypeOut call to the phone
number 1-800-829-3676. The next time you need a tax form, you know whom 
to call!
Keeping track of your SkypeOut accounting information
Another nice feature of SkypeOut is that you can easily review all your
SkypeOut calls in a clearly organized Web-based table (see Figure 8-11).
The steps involved in retrieving your accounting information are as follows:
1. Go to www.skype.com and click the Sign In link.
You should see this link at the top of the page.
2. In the text input field, enter your Skype Name and password and click
Secure Sign In.
Your Account Overview page appears.

3. Click the Calls & SMS history link.
You can view a list of your latest calls and SMS messages (see Figure 8-11).
You should be aware that SkypeOut credit needs to be kept “alive.” If no
SkypeOut activity occurs for 180 days, any of your remaining credit is wiped
out. This does not mean that you must be using up your credit; it just means
that you need to have some level of activity during any 180-day interval.
Staying in Touch Through SkypeIn
SkypeIn is unique tool that makes it easier, and cheaper, for customers and
relatives to contact you because
 Calls to a SkypeIn number can be made from any landline or cell phone.
 SkypeIn numbers are based in any locality around the world.
 You can travel anywhere and be reached through your SkypeIn number.
 SkypeIn puts computer-phobic relatives and friends at ease. They can
use an ordinary telephone to skype you (and they don’t even know how
technically proficient they are!).
Figure 8-11:

135
Chapter 8: The Ins and Outs of SkypeIn and SkypeOut

Understanding SkypeIn
With SkypeIn, people in a given region or country can call you by dialing into
a local phone number that you set up through Skype. It is just a local call for
them, but they can reach you anytime and anywhere in the world you are, as
long as you are logged onto Skype. When you get SkypeIn, you also get free
Skype Voicemail, so if you’re not connected to Skype when people try to
reach you, you can receive messages.
When people call you using SkypeIn, they don’t pay for anything other than the
normal charges for calling your local SkypeIn number. If you set up a SkypeIn
number that is based in London (with an area code of 207 and country code
+44), anyone in London can dial the local number you give them. They pay only
the cost of a local call. You can then be anywhere in the world — Madrid, Paris,
Nashville, and so on. Anyone can call you from a regular telephone and can talk
for hours, and all the caller pays is the cost of the local call in the London. The
telephone companies are happy because they get to charge for a call. Skype is
happy because you just rented a SkypeIn number for the year. Your caller is
happy to talk as long as he or she wants, very inexpensively.
Now if your friend Ian from Edinburgh, Scotland, tries to reach you using your
SkypeIn number based in London, he pays whatever it costs to place a call
from Edinburgh to London. The cost from Edinburgh to London is not a local
call, but if you are currently visiting Melbourne, Australia, it’s certainly much
less expensive than calling to Australia.

Skype user profile: Lindie
Lindie, a young entrepreneur, travels 
nonstop giving workshops for her edu-
cational software company based in
California. Because she’s a moving target, her
customers sometimes have difficulty reaching
her when they have a question. Giving out her
cell phone number is one option, but calls may
be costly for teachers on a tight budget, and
likewise for Lindie, who is trying to build a busi-
ness in a competitive world.
To give her company a competitive edge, Lindie
set up a SkypeIn account in her busiest location,
California. Now teachers and school administra-
tors throughout California can contact her wher-
ever she is working. For some it requires a local
call; others incur a toll charge, but it’s still
cheaper for them to call within the state than out-
side it. Because Lindie is almost always in front
of, in the vicinity of, or toting a computer, SkypeIn
is an easy choice. She also needs to be in front
of a computer to answer the many technical,
logistic, and curriculum-based questions that
she fields. Leveraging Internet telephony to
create a more valuable resource for customers
and at a lower cost is the strategy Lindie put in
place, and it’s paying off.

It’s really that simple.
SkypeIn phone numbers can be acquired for Australia, Brazil, China, Denmark,
Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong S.A.R., Japan, Poland, Sweden,
Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and United States. This list of countries is
expanding, as are individual area codes with the countries, so check www.
skype.com from time to time for updates.
Buying SkypeIn
The process of buying SkypeIn works much the same way as buying
SkypeOut credit:
1. Go to www.skype.com and click the Sign In link.
You should see this link at the top of the page.
2. In the text input field, enter your Skype Name and password and click
Secure Sign In.
The My Skype Account Overview page opens, which allows you to buy
all the different Skype services: SkypeIn, SkypeOut, and Skype Voicemail.
This page also provides account information settings that you may have,
including details on your SkypeOut calls.
3. Directly under the topic SkypeIn, within the Skype and Ordinary
Phones section, click the Buy Now button.
There are several Buy Now buttons. Make sure that you click the correct
one immediately underneath SkypeIn!
In the Payments section of your My Skype Account Overview page, you
can choose a form of currency. If the currency is set to euros and your
currency should be U.S. dollars, you can change it by clicking the Change
link, choosing the currency type, selecting the appropriate radio button,
and then clicking the Change Currency button.
You can buy SkypeIn credit with any of about 15 different currencies.
The My Skype Account Overview page is divided into various sections:
Call Phones within the U.S. and Canada for Free; Skype and Ordinary
Phones; Account Settings; and Payments. Within the Payments section,
you can set your preferred currency. Make this choice before you buy
SkypeIn credit or any other Skype credit, because if you change your
currency, you will incur an exchange fee on your available Skype credit.
You set the currency by clicking the Change link in the Payments section.
4. Select the country from which your Skype phone originates.
You can pick from at least 14 countries: Australia, Brazil, Denmark,
Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong S.A.R. China, Japan,
Poland, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

Clicking the country flag or name takes you to a new page.
5. Select the area code and choose a local phone number from a list of
available numbers within the area code.
Depending on the country you choose, you may or may not be prompted
to select an area code (some countries have only one area code for the
whole country). Skype generates a list of available numbers for you to
pick from.
Although Skype provides you with a computer-generated list of num-
bers, you can pick a pattern, and Skype sees whether it is available. 
The pattern can include letters and the asterisk (*) wildcard character.
As a pattern, you can enter ***Mary and you might get numbers like
367-6279, 123-679, or 333-6279.
When you buy SkypeIn, Voicemail is included at no extra charge with
your SkypeIn subscription.
6. Click Buy Selected Number.
An invoicing page appears, and you can choose between a 3- or 12-month
subscription. You’re also prompted to provide billing information, includ-
ing your name and address.
7. Select your payment method.
Payment options include PayPal, MasterCard, Visa, regular bank transfer,
Moneybookers, and JCB.
8. Verify the accuracy of your order, complete your payment information,
and click Submit.
If you are charging your SkypeIn credit to a credit card, you need to
enter your credit card number and expiration date. Some countries may
require you to pay a Value Added Tax, or VAT.
When payment is complete, you see a confirmation page with your 
order number and order details. It’s always a good idea to print this 
confirmation page.
For each SkypeIn phone number you get, you pay a set fee for either a three-
month period or a full year. You can have multiple SkypeIn numbers but you’re
currently limited to 10 such numbers. Suppose you work for an aerospace firm
with offices in San Jose, California, and Denver, Colorado. You may be doing a
lot of work in Washington, D.C. You can get SkypeIn numbers for the area
codes 408, 303, and 202. This way, your associates in those same area codes
can reach you without incurring charges no matter where you are.You might
be attending a conference in Toronto, Canada, or visiting family in North
Carolina.
SkypeIn is a practical service to have. If you have a small business and want
to establish an international presence, SkypeIn is a great way to leverage
your resources.
138
Part II: As You Like It: Skype Your Way 

When you list your SkypeIn number on your business card or company letter-
head, you can identify it as a tie-line number (that is, a phone number that
you set up through Skype), but be sure to indicate the time zone people are
calling into. Otherwise, you may be getting calls many hours earlier or later
than you are prepared to receive them!
Redeeming Skype Credit from a Voucher
Many third-party products (for example, most of the Skype-certified phones
and audio-related devices described in Chapter 11) include vouchers for
services such as SkypeIn, SkypeOut, or Voicemail. If you have a voucher, you
can redeem it by following these steps. 
1. Go to the following Skype Web page (see Figure 8-12):
https://secure.skype.com/store/voucher/redeem.html
Enter your Skype Name and password. If you are already signed in (you
may have recently looked at your My Skype Account Overview page,
which requires that you sign in), your Skype Name automatically
appears in the form and you are not asked to provide a password. 
No sense in logging in when you’re already logged in!
The Skype Web site is constantly undergoing changes, so the URL for this
page may change. Check this book’s Web site (www.skype4dummies.
com) from time to time for updates.
2. Enter your voucher number in the Enter Voucher Details text input box.
You don’t have to specify the kind of Skype credit you are redeeming.
From your voucher number, Skype can automatically tell whether you
are redeeming SkypeIn credit, SkypeOut credit, Skype Voicemail, or any
other type of Skype-related service or product.
3. Select the I Agree to the Skype Terms of Service check box and then
click the Redeem Voucher button.
Depending on what you are redeeming, you can get an instant confirmation
(such as for Voicemail or SkypeOut, or to extend existing SkypeIn service)
that your voucher was successfully redeemed (see Figure 8-13). Other types
of services may require additional processing. For example, you may be 
purchasing SkypeIn for the first time. In this case, you need to specify the
country code, area code, and so on. Rather than pay with a credit card or
something similar, you can use your voucher.

Managing Your Messages
In This Chapter
 Getting the most from basic Skype messaging
 Doing the math: Skype + Outlook = Skylook
 Checking out Pamela; she’s not just another pretty voice
S
kype can follow you just about anywhere on the planet. Suppose you’re
flying on a jet with an airline that has Internet access, or perhaps you’re
hiking up a trail on Mt. Everest and have a wireless connection to the Internet.
Even in these far reaches, anyone around the world (anyone appropriately
equipped) can reach you. You simply pack a U3 Smart Drive or a Wi-Fi phone
and tap into the Internet wherever it’s available.
Having this connection on hand doesn’t mean that you’re available or that
you actually want to answer every call, all the time. But having voicemail and
even video mail allows other people to connect to you without requiring your
physical presence to take every incoming call.
In this chapter, we tell you about various methods for handling the Skype calls
that you can’t answer in the traditional way. Skype services do include some
basic voicemail, call forwarding, and text messaging. You can also add on to or
integrate other software with Skype to accept voice messages, record contact-
specific personal greetings and conversations, and even schedule Skype calls
with your contacts. In particular, we describe how to make Skype collaborate
with Microsoft Outlook to organize and store voice messages, as well as how
to use Pamela, one of the earliest Skype add-on programs for voice messaging.
Staying Connected via Skype
Voicemail is nothing new, and Skype comes with basic voicemail capabilities
as an optional feature that you can choose to purchase. If you decide to buy
the SkypeIn service (see Chapter 8 for information), your voicemail costs
change from fee to free! That’s because Skype Voicemail is bundled in as a
free service when you get a SkypeIn number.

Skype offers two other familiar features for helping you manage your mes-
sages: call forwarding and SMS (Short Message System) messaging, which is 
a standard used for text messaging. You may incur associated fees if you for-
ward calls to a landline or cell phone, and fees for sending text messages
depend on the message length and the number of recipients.
But the best part about these three messaging features is that they’re easy to
use. The next sections show you how.
Taking messages with Skype Voicemail
Skype supports an easy-to-use voicemail system. One convenient benefit of
using Skype Voicemail is that your audio messages — both your greeting and
the incoming messages people leave you — are not stored on your computer
but instead are stored remotely on Skype’s central servers. As a result, you
don’t have to worry about missing calls when you turn off your computer.
Before you can use Skype Voicemail, you have a bit of setup to do. The follow-
ing steps show you how to start your setup and record the Voicemail greeting
that your callers will hear:
1. Start Skype and choose Tools➪Options from the main menu.
The Skype Options dialog box appears.
2. In the list on the left side of the Options dialog box, click Call
Forwarding & Voicemail, as shown in Figure 9-1.
The right portion of the Options dialog box changes to show the settings
related to these two services.
3. In the Voicemail section on the right, select the Send Unanswered
Calls to Skype Voicemail check box to activate your voicemail.
Below the Voicemail section of the dialog box, you find the Welcome
Message section containing the three buttons you’ll use to record and
play back your Voicemail greeting.
4. In the Welcome Message section of the dialog box, click the Record
button (the button with the triangle) and speak the Voicemail greeting
you want callers to hear (see Figure 9-1).
Your greeting or welcome message may be up to 60 seconds in length. If
you have a SkypeIn number, don’t forget to use part of that time in your
welcome message to tell your callers to leave their phone number.
5. Click the Stop button (the button with the dot) when you’re finished
recording.
144
Part III: Calling All Seasoned Skypers 

6. Click the Replay button (the button with the arrow) to listen to the
message you just recorded.
If you don’t like what you hear, you can return to Step 4 and re-record
your greeting.
7. When you’re satisfied that you recorded the perfect message, click Save.
Skype Voicemail has an advanced setting that you can use to avoid being inter-
rupted by additional calls if you’re already speaking on a call. To select this set-
ting, click the Advanced Settings link in the Voicemail section of the Options
dialog box (refer to Figure 9-1) and select the I Am Already in a Call check box
in the resulting Advanced Voicemail Settings dialog box (see Figure 9-2).

Chapter 9: Managing Your Messages

You also find settings for other situations in which calls are sent to your
Voicemail, as follows:
 When you don’t answer: In the appropriate text box, enter a number (of
seconds) that tells Skype how long to wait for you to answer the phone.
 When you reject an incoming call: Select the appropriately named
check box if you want to send rejected calls to Voicemail.
You can easily sign up for or renew your Voicemail service by going to your
Skype account log-in page and clicking the Buy Now button under Skype
Voicemail. If you are already using the Skype Voicemail service, you should
see an Extend button instead of Buy Now. The URL for reaching your login
page is generally https://secure.skype.com/store/myaccount/
overview.html.
Forwarding calls when you can’t answer
Skype’s call forwarding feature is very simple to set up and operate. It works
like this: If someone calls you on Skype and you’re not able to answer, the call
is routed to the first Skype ID or SkypeOut number in your call-forward list. If
the call receives no answer there, it is routed to the next number on your
call-forward list.
You can call forward to as many as three Skype IDs or SkypeOut numbers.
Skype-to-Skype forwarding is always free. Forwarding to a landline or to a cell
phone incurs the regular SkypeOut charges and requires that your account
have SkypeOut credit. The account that does the skyping out pays for the
call, which makes sense. Suppose you’re in the United States and, from your
PC, you skype someone located in France. If that person has enabled call for-
warding to his or her cell phone, then he or she (and not you) incurs the
SkypeOut charges.
For basic call forwarding, follow these steps:
1. Start Skype and choose Tools➪Options from the main menu.
The Skype Options dialog box appears.
2. Click Call Forwarding & Voicemail.
3. Select (check) the Forward Calls When I Am Not on Skype check box,
enter the Skype name you want your calls forwarded to in the Enter
Phone Number combo box, and click Save.
146
Part III: Calling All Seasoned Skypers 

For call forwarding to more than one Skype name or SkypeOut number, follow
these steps:
1. Start Skype and choose Tools➪Options from the main menu.
The Skype Options dialog box appears.
2. Click Call Forwarding & Voicemail.
3. Click the Advanced Settings link, select (check) the Forward Calls
When I Am Not on Skype check box, and enter the Skype names you
want your calls forwarded to in the Enter Phone Number combo box.
4. Enter the additional Skype names or SkypeOut numbers (see Figure
9-3) as appropriate in the remaining Enter Phone Number combo
boxes and click Save.
If you are uncertain how to enter a SkypeOut number, click the Get Help
Entering Phone Numbers link, which takes you to the Web page at www.
skype.com/products/skypeout/rates/dialing.html. This page
provides assistance on correctly entering SkypeOut numbers, including
looking up the appropriate country codes.
You must have Skype credit to forward a call to a SkypeOut number (see
Chapter 8 for information about Skype credit).
Interestingly, Skype Voicemail does not record forwarded messages. Systems
such as Pamela (described later in the chapter) do, and they add some other
very cool features. Skype Voicemail and call forwarding offer basic functional-
ity, but other messaging features in Skype (such as SMS messaging) and add-on
products that work with Skype (such as Skylook and Pamela) offer you more.

Chapter 9: Managing Your Messages

Making it short and sweet 
with SMS messaging
The blossoming of technologies for communication shows that people crave
constant contact with each other. Nowhere is this trend more evident than in
the popularity of text messaging, which is a communication method that
teenagers use frequently because it’s fun, easy, and (perhaps) even addictive.
Many people find that text messaging is practical, even though it has these
two drawbacks:
 Limited screen size for message viewing: Any text message sent must
be viewable from a tiny cell phone screen.
 Tedious and time-consuming creation: Typing a message — beyond a
short sentence or two — takes more patience and time than most
people (especially teenagers) are willing to invest.
To help work around these text messaging limitations, a communications
standard — the Short Message System, or SMS messaging — exists for a vari-
ety of mobile phones and other devices such as Pocket PCs and GSM (Global
System for Mobile Communications) phones. And when you’re running
Skype, the circle of devices offering SMS text messaging capability even
includes your desktop computer.
Sending SMS messages via Skype involves these simple steps:
1. In your Skype menu, choose Tools➪Send SMS Message.
A window pops up, prompting you to select the recipients you want to
receive your message. Recipients need not be Skype Names. You can
also enter phone numbers.
2. Add the Skype Names or phone numbers of your message recipients
and click OK.
An SMS message window appears.
3. Enter your text message in the Skype SMS window (see Figure 9-4) and
click the Send SMS button.
The Skype Names or phone numbers of the recipient(s) appear in the
title bar of the Skype SMS window.
That’s all there is to sending the text message with Skype, but here are some
points to keep in mind about this service:
 SMS messaging has a cost attached: When you use SMS messaging, you
pay a small fee that’s based on two things: the length of your message
and the number of recipients getting the message.
148
Part III: Calling All Seasoned Skypers 

 Charges apply only to messages delivered within 24 hours: When you
send a message, you are charged only if the message reaches the person
within 24 hours. If the recipient’s GSM phone battery is dead or his or
her phone is off, you get a refund.
 Watching your message length is a good idea: The maximum size for
any SMS message is 160 characters. So if you send a message with 167
characters, it is split into two SMS messages with 160 characters in the
first and 7 in the second. In this situation, you are sending two messages
instead of one and you’ll be charged accordingly. (It pays to study up on
the chat abbreviations presented in Chapter 6!)
Bridging Skype with Your 
Outlook Contacts
Skype is all about connecting with people. And when you use SkypeOut (see
Chapter 8), you are only a click away from making that connection. But here’s
a problem: All the information about the people you want to connect with
(your contacts) may live on a separate island known as Outlook.
Wouldn’t it be nice if Skype could just take a peek at your Outlook contacts,
see their phone numbers, and skype out to them by clicking on their phone
numbers from within Skype? Starting with Skype version 2.5 and later, you
can make this happen by following two simple steps:
Figure 9-4:
Sending
your SMS
recipients 
a text

149
Chapter 9: Managing Your Messages

1. Open both your Microsoft Outlook program and Skype (on Windows)
so that the two programs are running at the same time.
2. Choose View➪View Outlook Contacts from the Skype menu.
Don’t confuse the Outlook program with Outlook Express. Skype and Outlook
work together very happily, but you won’t get Outlook Express to share infor-
mation with Skype.
What do you get when you 
cross Skype with Outlook?
Skype is a communications engine that enables you to talk, write, watch video
images, listen, and chat instantly with a variety of contacts. When you use
Skype, you can reach skypers, nonskypers, and text messagers, all from one
program. Outlook is also a communications engine that helps you manage com-
munications with your contacts as well as information about your activities
and your schedule. With Outlook, you compose, receive, and archive emails,
make appointments, schedule your time, and share your calendars and folders.
Both Skype and Outlook are amazing programs that offer access to a broad
circle of friends, associates, and family. So it stands to reason that both pro-
grams work with much of the same information (contact information, that is).
Consider the following strengths of each program:
 Skype lets you connect with your contacts by exchanging information
through the Web and extends that outreach with sound (voice calls),
sight (video), live text messaging, and file transfer.
 Outlook connects you with your contacts by moving information
around through various networks, extends its reach to organizing and
scheduling your activities, and even gives you a way to send information
to hundreds (or thousands) of people at one time.
Without any integration between the contact information stored in Skype and
Outlook, you can quickly get caught up in switching back and forth between
the two programs to replicate and update the same information in each one.
This inefficient jockeying is the quintessential example of electronic pencil
pushing at its worst. So to alleviate the annoying repetition and duplication,
Skylook (a software plugin used with Outlook) was born.
Plugging in and setting up Skylook
You can get the Skylook plugin to use with your Outlook program by doing
the following:
150
Part III: Calling All Seasoned Skypers 

1. Install Skype 1.2 or later, and install Outlook 2000 or later.
Skylook is not an independent program; it is a plugin. You need to have
both Skype and Outlook properly installed before downloading and
installing Skylook.
2. Quit Outlook.
Outlook must be closed in order for Skylook to be installed. Skype can
remain open.
3. On the Internet, navigate to www.skylook.biz.
4. Click Download.
You are prompted to choose a place to save the Skylook installer file.
Click Save to place the file in a default folder on your hard drive. You 
can choose any location, as long as you can locate the file on a program
such as the Windows Explorer. Jot down the path to the folder where
you save the Skylook installer file.
The basic Skylook account is free. Additional features require a small
incremental fee.
5. Launch the Skylook install wizard by choosing Start➪All Programs➪
Accessories➪Windows Explorer; then, navigate to the installer file
you just saved and double-click the file.
6. To install Skylook, you must accept the terms of the End User License
Agreement. Click I Accept the Terms in the License Agreement and
then click Next.
Before proceeding with the installation, make sure that you close the
Microsoft Outlook application if it is running. The Skylook installer pro-
gram does some behind-the-scenes hocus pocus so that the next time
you open Outlook, Skylook kicks into action and prompts you with a
series of setup questions.
7. When you finish the Skylook installation, launch Outlook.
Magically, Skylook is integrated into Outlook, but it still needs some con-
figuration. The Skype security screen (shown in Figure 9-5) appears on
your desktop. This same screen appears when any program that wants
to use Skype opens. To continue, you must officially introduce the two
programs and agree to let Skylook and Skype work together.
8. If you use Outlook all the time, select the Allow This Program to Use
Skype option and click OK.
Choosing this option eliminates the security reminder every time you
launch Outlook, which is a good idea if you’re a daily Outlook user.
151
Chapter 9: Managing Your Messages

9. The Skylook setup wizard opens automatically.
Follow the prompts to configure Skylook and get a feel for how Skylook
works at the same time.
You may be asked to answer questions relating to the following:
• Whether to synchronize your Outlook contacts with your Skype
contacts. We show you how to do so in the next section.
• Whether you want Skylook to record your conversation (either one
or both sides).
• Whether you want Skylook to act as your answering machine. 
If you do, you can record a personalized greeting, set Skylook 
to automatically answer when the Skype status is Away, Not
Available, or Do Not Disturb, and specify how many seconds to
wait before answering.
You have the option to change any of these settings after the program is
fully installed.
To use the call recording feature of Skylook, you need to have Windows Media
Player 9 or later installed. Download Media Player at www.microsoft.com/
downloads.
Skylook binds Skype and Outlook tightly together. You don’t sense that two
separate programs are running at the same time. You see one interface, one
program to open, and one environment in which to store and send messages.
But Skype and Outlook are, in fact, two separate pieces of software. To truly
have them work together, you need to give them a little help connecting.

Toolbar too crowded?
If you can’t find your orange Skylook icon, you
have too many words on your Skylook toolbar.
Here’s how to get rid of them.
1. Move your mouse to the far right end of the
toolbar where you see a small, triangular
notch; click the notch to open your toolbar
options.
2. Choose Tools➪Options.
A Skylook Options window opens.
3. Click the Toolbar tab and select the first
check box, Hide Captions.
4. For the Show Contact Presence Buttons in
the Toolbar option, set the number to 3 (see
the following figure).

Getting Skype and Outlook in sync
Skylook has some slick synchronization tools to pull Skype contacts into
Outlook and to roam through Outlook contacts to find Skype users. At 
times, Skylook walks you through individual connections, as it does when
you create a new appointment. Veteran Outlook users make (and have made)
hundreds of appointments in Outlook. When you add Skylook to Outlook, the
appointment screen takes on a new Skylook toolbar, on which you can conve-
niently make calls on the spot and then schedule your Outlook appointments
all from a single window. 
Before you can initiate a Skype call within Outlook, you must synchronize
your Outlook contacts with your Skype contacts. Follow these steps to 
synchronize contacts manually:
1. Find the small, triangular notch to the right of the orange Skylook
Tools icon on the Skylook toolbar.
When you click this “notch,” the Skylook Options and Other Functions
menu appears.
2. Select SkySync (Synchronize/Import Contacts) to open the SkySync
Wizard.
The SkySync Wizard opens a SkySync Summary window.
3. Select Review Matches and/or Link Contacts Manually.
You also have the choice to let SkySync search the entire global Skype
network to find matches between your Skype contacts and Outlook con-
tacts. It takes a few minutes to perform this search.
4. SkySync Wizard asks whether you want to update Outlook contact
information from Skype profiles. Click Yes; then click Next.
Skype profiles sometimes have extra contact information such as phone
numbers that can be added to an Outlook account.
5. Select an Outlook Contact from the list that the SkySync Wizard 
generates.
The Review SkySync Recommendations window offers several choices:
• Link: Connects a particular Skype contact with the Outlook con-
tact selected.
• Unlink: Severs Skype from the selected contact.
• View Diffs (differences): Lets you see the profile details of each
account.
• Update: Updates your Outlook account with the latest profile details.
• Don’t Update: Leaves each profile unchanged. Sometimes Skype
profiles are deliberately different from Outlook profiles. One may
be business related; the other may be personal.
154
Part III: Calling All Seasoned Skypers 

6. Click Link.
When you click the Link button, a window opens and the SkySync Wizard
asks you to enter the Skype User ID (Skype refers to this as your Skype
Name; Skylook calls it your Skype User ID) of your Outlook contact in the
box. If you don’t know the ID, Skylook searches for it when you click Next.
7. Select a name from your list of Skype Contacts generated by SkySync.
8. If you still don’t see your Skype contact, click Next.
A search screen opens. You can add some search details, including:
• Full Name
• Email Address: Skype Profiles never reveal email addresses, but
you can still search for a contact if you already know the email
address and it is included in your friend’s Skype profile.
• Skype User ID: You can enter a portion of the Skype User ID if you
don’t remember the entire name.
Click Next and select the Skype User ID from the list the SkySync
Wizard generates.
9. Click Finish.
Your Outlook contact is in sync with Skype.
Synchronizing contacts manually through the SkySync Wizard lets you scroll
through contacts and decide whether to sync each one individually. However,
if you want to synchronize a specific Outlook contact on the fly, here is a little
shortcut:
1. Select a name in your Outlook Contacts list.
The selected name appears in your Skylook toolbar between the Skype
Phone Call button and the Help button.
2. Click the arrow next to the Outlook contact that now appears in the
Skylook toolbar and choose Link This Outlook Contact to a Skype
Contact from the drop-down menu, as shown in Figure 9-6.
3. Follow the screen prompts (as in Steps 5–8 in the prior step list) to syn-
chronize the contact with the list of Skype contacts (see Figure 9-7).
4. Click Finish.
Skylook can expedite contact linking between Skype and Outlook with its
SkySync feature. Rather than connect one user at a time, SkySync searches
through your Outlook address book and maps it to your Skype Contacts list
by linking any matches that it finds. You can even use the SkySync Wizard,
shown in Figure 9-8, to run a thorough search of the global Skype network.
155
Chapter 9: Managing Your Messages

Suppose that your company has several thousand active Outlook accounts.
Synching up one contact at a time would be out of the question, but using the
SkySync Wizard makes this contact mapping possible. SkySync launches
automatically during the Skylook setup, but if you want to update your con-
tact links subsequently, choose Tools➪SkySync to open the SkySync Wizard
and select Search the Global Skype Network for More Matching Skype Users.
SkySync goes through all your Outlook contacts and searches for possible
matches on the Skype network. Skylook presents possible matches. For each
potential match, Skylook asks you whether you want them linked. Suddenly

you see that good old Bob has a Skype account, and SkySync links it to Bob’s
contact information in your Outlook program.
After your Outlook Contacts link up with Skype, simply select Bob from your
contacts in Outlook and skype him via the Skylook plugin. To start a new
Skype conversation with Bob, follow these simple steps:
1. Select your Outlook Contact name.
2. Click Skype Voice Call in the Skylook toolbar.
Skylook double-checks your intentions and asks whether you really want
to call your contact.
3. If you really want to have a Skype conversation, click OK.
4. Start talking!
Handling Voice Messaging with Skylook
A powerful feature of the Skylook plugin adds the capabilities for voice
recording and messaging from within Outlook. These communication meth-
ods are not native to Outlook, whose strength is the organization of email,
asynchronous messaging, and scheduling.
Including VoIP functionality (offered through Skype) in your Outlook program
suddenly catapults messaging to a new level. You can not only email your con-
tacts and invite them to a meeting but also conduct that meeting within the
same program. Business collaboration becomes a live event, bringing all the
parties together synchronously. When you add Skylook to Outlook, callers can
now reach you directly through the messaging system you use most often.

Chapter 9: Managing Your Messages

Please leave a message . . .
Outlook users tend to keep their Inbox open all the time, expecting little alert
beeps when emails come in. A system that is always open like this needs to
also handle messages delivered when the intended recipient is away from the
desk. Outlook archives and organizes email messages, but it has limited
capacity to respond automatically. Usually, the only option is a general auto-
mated email reply that answers for you when you’re on vacation or at a con-
ference. But because Skype adds voice capabilities to the mix, Skylook adds
voicemail through the Skylook Answering Machine.
The Skylook Answering Machine records calls and stores voicemail messages
in your Inbox, handling them just like Outlook handles emails. You control
when the answering machine responds according to your choice of availabil-
ity options that you find in your Skype program.
Following are some options you have for controlling the Skylook Answering
Machine:
 When and how to answer: If you choose, the answering machine acti-
vates when your Skype status displays Away, Not Available, or Do not
Disturb. You can also choose how long to let the Skype caller ring before
the answering machine picks up, even if your Web status shows you are
available.
 See who’s calling before you answer: Sometimes you just don’t feel like
talking. Of course, because it’s a Skype call, you can see who is calling,
glance at the caller’s profile, do a quick search for archived messages,
and then decide whether you want to pick up.
 Listen (or not) to messages coming in: If you decide not to pick up a
call, you can hear the message as it’s being recorded, or you can mute
the sound if you don’t want to be disturbed.
 Work in conjunction with Skype Voicemail: Skylook Answering Machine
works even if you have Skype Voicemail service (see the section “Taking
messages with Skype Voicemail,” earlier in this chapter). The two don’t
fight each other to answer calls. Whichever picks up first takes the mes-
sage. Whether a call comes in from Skype Voicemail or through Skylook,
all incoming messages are stored in the Outlook Inbox if the program is
open. If Skylook is not active, Skype Voicemail takes the messages.
 Record a personal greeting for callers to hear: Skylook has a built-in
voice recorder, so a simple wizard screen offers the choice to record a
personalized greeting.
158
Part III: Calling All Seasoned Skypers 

On the surface, the Skylook voicemail system works just like ordinary voice-
mail. Someone calls, hears a greeting, and leaves a message. But because
these messages are digital and show up in the Outlook Inbox, you can sort,
save, and even email them. And voice messages aren’t the only kind saved;
Skylook will also store missed text chat messages in your Inbox.
Using Outlook with the Skylook plugin gives your clients, friends, and family
even more ways to communicate with you. Direct calls, emails, text chats,
and voice messages are all available — and you are no longer unreachable.
Making WAVs or, better yet, MP3s
Another new productivity tool Skylook brings to Outlook is conversation
recording and archiving. Suppose that you set up an Outlook appointment to
skype Bob and discuss the details of an upcoming workshop. Rather than
take notes during your conversation, you can use Skylook’s tools to record,
preserve, and store the conversation.
To the right of the orange Skylook Tools icon on the Skylook toolbar is a
small triangular “notch” for Skylook Options and Other Functions. Clicking
this icon opens a menu. Select Options and click the Recording tab; from
there, you can set the recording conversations features with the following
choices (see Figure 9-9):
 To automatically record all calls. When automatic recording is active,
the recording starts as soon as you make or receive a Skype call.
 To record only your side or both sides of the conversation. Select
either Record My Voice Only or Record All Voices. You can set this
option to apply separately to Skype-to-Skype calls or to SkypeIn and
SkypeOut calls.
Recording the voices of other parties may be subject to legal limitations in
some jurisdictions. These limitations may require you to notify the other
party that the conversation is being recorded. In some cases, recording the
other party, even with notice, may not be legal. Please verify the limitations
for your jurisdiction. Even though you may be recording a conversation for
your own internal use, it is always good to be considerate and courteous and
inform the other party that you are recording the conversation.
The Skype Call Monitor is a floating window — shown in Figure 9-10 — that
pops up to let you know a call is being recorded. When you expand the Skype
Call Monitor, it becomes a larger window that displays real-time information
about the recording in progress. The information that is monitored includes
159
Chapter 9: Managing Your Messages

the length of the recording (in minutes and seconds) as it happens and the
size of the recorded file (in KB) as it grows. If you capture every Skype con-
versation, you may need a lot more hard drive space (and tons of free time to
listen to all those conversations again).
Suppose that you schedule a meeting (that is, a Skype conversation) with
your good friend Bob in Outlook. When the meeting is about to start, a screen
pops up as a reminder to make your Skype call. Click the reminder icon to
open your appointment window. You then select Bob’s name in the Contacts
box, click the Skype Voice Call button, and you are connected over Skype to
good old Bob. If you have call recording enabled, the conversation is auto-
matically recorded and saved as an MP3 file when you log off the call. Skylook
then parks the MP3 file in a Skylook Conversations folder.
Voice call recording is a full-productivity-mode feature of Skylook. This 
feature is available in the business, home, or academic versions of Skylook.
Basic Skylook, which is free, does not offer any recording tools.
In addition to recording conversations, this full productivity mode adds 
contacts to your Skylook Toolbar, saves your voicemail messages to your
Outlook Inbox, and creates a Skype Conversations folder to gather and 
organize Skype conversations.

Part III: Calling All Seasoned Skypers 

When you have full-productivity mode enabled, Skylook presents you with
choices in the Skylook Recorded the Conversation For You dialog box (see
Figure 9-11). For example, you have the option of emailing the MP3 of your
just-recorded conversation to Bob. This handy option saves you from rum-
maging around trying to find the recording. Simply click the Email a Copy To
button, and the recording is on its way.
If you don’t want to record a call, just click the Stop button in the Call
Monitor toolbar. If you stop a recording during a Skylook call, the entire
recording is deleted. If you want a portion of a conversation preserved, hang
up and then reconnect to finish the part you don’t want recorded. The MP3
file of your recorded portion will be tucked away in the Skylook
Conversations folder.
Try using Skylook’s recording feature to produce podcasts or online presen-
tations. You can set Skylook options to make sure that you record both sides
of the conversation for interviews or conferences. And if you use Skylook
calling to coach, mentor, or present to a group, you can choose to record
only your lecture so that you avoid capturing any noise from the others on
the call.
Organizing messages
When you install the Skylook plugin, the program automatically creates a
Skylook Conversations folder (see Figure 9-12) that you can access within
Outlook. The Skylook Conversations folder functions just like the folders 
that store your email, but it contains voicemail, chats, and recorded sessions,
as well.

Chapter 9: Managing Your Messages

Consider these ideas for keeping the contents of your Skylook Conversations
folder organized:
 Treat the files as though they were emails. Move conversations to
another folder, flag them, mark them as unread, or delete them.
 Organize your archived conversations by date, category, from, for, size,
subject, type, flag, email, importance, and even by conversation.
 Review all communication in a particular thread, or with a particular
individual, to get a snapshot of an ongoing project. Go through your
messages by listening, reading, and printing chats.
 Share your messages by forwarding them to friends and colleagues
through email or by collecting and putting them in a public folder.
When your messages are properly sorted, you can follow up on each one more
easily. You can return a Skype call, send a reply to that chat, or listen once
again to a voice message or recorded conversation. You know which contacts
are online because the Skype status system (the feature that shows your
online Skype availability) works within Skylook. If someone’s status is Online,
Available, or better yet, in Skype Me mode, by all means, make that call!

Pamela Is Not Just Another Pretty Voice
Named after the Skype alias of a Skype marketer’s girlfriend, Pamela is one 
of the first add-on programs available for Skype. Not only is Pamela (like her
namesake) elegant, she’s also well designed and feature rich. Pamela comes in
various editions (distinguished by varying levels of functionality) and is a handy
tool for managing your Skype messages. (Check out www.pamelasystems.com
for how-to information on getting Pamela.) The sidebar “Getting to know
Pamela” gives you a peek at Pamela’s background, and the features illustrated
in this chapter come from the Professional Edition.
Rather than bore you with a list of features that you can find on numerous prod-
uct data sheets online, we think it is more interesting, revealing, and in keeping
with the spirit of playfulness to introduce you to the real personality of Pamela.
So what can we say about Pamela? Well, Pamela is alert; she doesn’t forget
anything (unless you tell her to). She is very attentive. This gal has real Web
savvy and she always knows whom she’s talking to. Pamela is appropriately
polite and punctual. But of course, she wouldn’t be very interesting if she
didn’t have her moods.
Pamela is alert
When you work with Skype, you’ll discover a tendency to start accumulating
Skype contacts. You may also discover a tendency to overlook some of the
information that’s floating around in your Skype database, but Pamela helps
you realize just how much info you have.
163
Chapter 9: Managing Your Messages
Getting to know Pamela
The seeds for Pamela were first sown during
the infancy of Skype. With only 10,000 Skype
users on the whole planet at that time, Skype
was like a diamond in the rough. This situation
offered a splendid combination of high poten-
tial, the ability to accommodate improvements,
and the longing for someone to take and
enhance the product. That someone was Dick
Schiferli, the head of Pamela Systems. Over the
last two years, both Skype and Pamela have
evolved and continued to incorporate user-
requested features.
Pamela is a well-thought-out tool for managing
your messages. You’ll find different levels of
functionality depending on which edition of the
product that you use. There’s a Basic Edition that
you can download for free. But rather than
encourage you to go wading in that kiddy pool,
we think you probably want to know (and put to
use) a set of features found in the higher-end edi-
tions of Pamela. Go check out the Professional
Edition; you’ll be glad you did.

For example, we like to experiment and tinker, so we decided to launch Pamela
with a reasonable number of Skype contacts just to see how it operates. To our
surprise, while Pamela loaded, it reminded us that our friend Hannes’ birthday
was that day (see Figure 9-13) and prompted us to make contact. We didn’t
expect this kind of volunteered information, but we certainly welcomed it!
Conveniently, Pamela scours your contacts list to see whose birthday is
around the corner. She can also help you send out birthday greetings with
the options shown in Figure 9-14.
Pamela has a great memory recall
Pamela records voicemail messages while you are away, and she can also
record any conversation as you’re making or receiving calls. With the
Professional Edition of Pamela, the number of messages you can record is
limited only by the amount of available disk space. Pamela is configured to
record conversations using uncompressed WAV files.

And although having large amounts of hard disk space at your disposal is get-
ting less expensive these days, you may still feel the need to conserve. If you
want to cut down the disk space used by a factor of 12 or so, you can install
a couple of special files that make Pamela save sound recordings as MP3
files. You can find the instructions for making this change at www.pamela-
systems.com/download/mp3.php.
As download links or URLs listed in this book change, we will post updated
links on our Web site www.skype4dummies.com.
A couple of items about Pamela’s message recording features are worth
pointing out:
 Pamela can automatically record all Skype conversations as you have
them. Auto recording all conversations, as well as voicemail messages,
imposes two burdens on you. First, your hard drive could fill up very
quickly, and second, you have to figure out how to manage all those
recordings (and then do it!). Alternatively, Pamela can prompt you each
time you make or receive a call over Skype and ask you then whether
you want it recorded.
If you ignore the recording prompt for 10 seconds, Pamela assumes that
you are not interested (in having the conversation recorded, that is) and
closes the prompt.
 Pamela can help keep your recordings legal. To help keep you in com-
pliance with legal rules in various countries and geographic regions,
Pamela can display an alert to let people know that the conversation is
being recorded.
If you want, you can set up Pamela to record calls in stereo. That is, your
voice is recorded on the left channel or speaker, and the person or people on
the other end of the call are recorded on the right. This type of recording is
great for podcasting because editing for clarity becomes easier. For example,
you can safely eliminate discernable background noise on an interviewer’s
side of the call while preserving the sound on the interviewee’s side.
Pamela is attentive
Imagine that during the first week of using Pamela, you record a half-dozen
conversations — each about a half-hour long — with the same party. Other
than by listening through each of the conversations one-by-one, how will you
remember the key points and which conversation they belong to? Fear not;
Pamela to the rescue!
Pamela’s note-taking function (shown in Figure 9-15) allows you to record the
date, time, and identity of the person you are speaking to, and to type in what-
ever notes you want. These notes are appended to the sound recordings so
165
Chapter 9: Managing Your Messages

that, at a glance, important details and quick, on-the-spot summaries are at your
fingertips. Joe Friday would be pleased with this software. Just the facts, ma’am!
Pamela knows whom she’s talking to
Want something really cool and way over the top? Try making personalized
greetings for any Skype contact. That’s right! You can record a different 
greeting message for your husband, your boss, your favorite niece, and that
annoying neighbor who feels obligated to gossip about everyone on the local
school board. Figure 9-16 shows the Personal Options dialog box with Enable
Personalized Voice Mail for This User selected (in this example, the user is
NewbieSkyper).
If you think that personalization alone is cool, wait until you combine person-
alization with brains. We discuss call forwarding earlier in this chapter (see
the section “Forwarding calls when you can’t answer”). So what happens if
NewbieSkyper calls SeasonedSkyper, who has call forwarding turned on, and
the call is punted over to TheProfessionalSkyper running Pamela? Happily,
Pamela is smart enough to know who is actually doing the calling and applies
the personalized greeting for NewbieSkyper.
Figure 9-15:
Getting your
conversation
facts in
order.
166
Part III: Calling All Seasoned Skypers 

The personalization feature may be cool, but it is also practical. Suppose you
are traveling and have access only to email. During your travels, Pamela may
have logged plenty of messages on your home base. But also suppose that
you’re expecting a very important message from one of the people calling.
Wouldn’t it be nice if recorded audio message files from only that person
could be forwarded to your email address? Pamela lets you set up this email
notification in either of two ways: without forwarding the audio file, or with
the audio file bundled with the notification.
Pamela is Web savvy
If you can forward email notifications and slip in a sound file, then what’s to
stop you from creating an alternate Skype ID, calling Pamela, and having the
message sent to some Internet server where it can be blogged or podcasted?
Rather than code some geeky stuff such as XML or RSS, you can get the same
results with Pamela’s built-in capabilities.
So don’t worry about the geeky stuff. Pamela has specific features that make
blogging and PamCasting (Pamela’s version of podcasting) easy.
Pamela is very punctual
Skype gives your customers, clients, and associates easy access to you from
anywhere around the globe. However, anywhere around the globe can mean
Figure 9-16:
Record a
personal
greeting for
Newbie
Skyper.
167
Chapter 9: Managing Your Messages

that people halfway around the world could try to reach you during the
middle of their day — while it happens to be 1 a.m. your time. To help manage
your presence and interaction with the broader global community, Pamela has
the Time Scheduling function shown in Figure 9-17. In this way, Pamela keeps
you in touch with others while also making sure that you get your rest.
Pamela is polite
It often happens: You are away from your computer and someone sends you a
chat message. A polite reply to a single chatter is, “I’m away from my computer.
My personal assistant, Pam, is responding with this automated message.”
This type of response is good for letting single chatters know that you’re not
currently available. But in a multi-chat situation in which many people may be
available to chat, this kind of automated reply can be downright rude. Pamela
avoids the potential faux pas by discerning the difference between a single chat
and a multi-person chat, and behaving the way you want in each situation.
Pamela is moody
As your list of Skype contacts grows, you may notice that mood messages for
some of the more Skype-savvy contacts change regularly. You might see that
some of these say, “I’m busy right now. Call me when I’m off the phone.” A
few minutes later, the mood message might read, “Okay, I’m available to take
your call.” Skypers can change their mood messages as they please, but you
can have Pamela automatically change mood messages for you as you
answer and hang up calls.

Chapter 10
Partying On — On the 
Conference Line!
In This Chapter
 Starting and running a Skype conference
 Going beyond the basic conferencing facilities
 Moving files and sending links
 Viewing screens and using applications
T
alking one on one with your friend or colleague is a type of communication
that Skype facilitates very effectively. You may also spend a lot of time in
the company of others. When you’re communicating in a group setting, you’re
probably accustomed to exchanging ideas, opening a dialog, debating, and
even bantering. In short, you probably like to collaborate.
So, you’re in luck! Skype conferencing makes collaborating with a group easy,
and this chapter is your guide to doing so. In this chapter, we share some
basic conference-calling techniques, show you how to use the conferencing
capabilities that are native to Skype, and illustrate how third-party hardware
or software can expand your conferencing capabilities. The combination of
Skype and Web conferencing enables you to share files, show what’s on your
computer screen, allow others to remotely access other applications, send
chat messages, and discuss ideas in a group setting. With these capabilities,
you can do anything from running online classes to holding press confer-
ences to strategizing a new product launch in your company.
The Benefits of Conference Calling
When a group of people gets together — with a specific purpose or function
in mind — the group selects a corresponding venue to fit the occasion.
Coming together in a Skype conference call is no different. The approach to

conferencing with Skype is not a one-size-fits-all solution; instead, you can
conference with others using Skype in three ways:
 By calling multiple people at the same time: This is the simplest form
of conferencing with Skype — right out of the box. There’s no additional
software to download or special procedure to follow. All you’re doing is
connecting a group of people over Skype.
 By adding Web conferencing and third-party tools to the mix: For
example, GoToMeeting and Unyte are third-party tools that extend your
Skype-conferencing reach by handing over control of your computer
screen and giving others on the conference access to your keyboard 
and mouse. Web conferencing transforms your conference calls into vir-
tual meeting rooms. Quite literally, there is very little you can do in a
face-to-face meeting that you can’t do with Web conferencing and Skype
together. If you’ve not investigated any tools like these, I predict that (as
soon as you find out what you can do with them) you’ll want to start
using them . . . immediately . . . ASAP. Really, you won’t want to wait.
 By catering to a large crowd: When you want to gather a large crowd —
perhaps to hold a press conference, run a shareholder’s meeting, or
organize a relief effort in the aftermath of a hurricane — you can resort 
to facilities such as Skypecasting (see Chapter 14) and High Speed
Conferencing (see Chapter 12). Skypecasting can accommodate up to
100 people at a time, and High Speed Conferencing can accommodate 
up to 500 people. Both of these services are free to Skype users.
The remarkable fact is that conferencing with Skype in all three venues has
an astonishingly low barrier to entry, and the type of conferencing you can
do for little or no cost is amazing.
What you can do with conference calls
The ability to make VoIP calls, be it PC to PC, or to a landline or mobile phone
is great, but having conference-calling capabilities is really the icing on the
cake. Conferencing opens up a world of possibilities. For example, suppose
you bought a software product, only to find that it doesn’t work properly. The
software company claims that your computer is not configured correctly; the
computer manufacturer claims the software company doesn’t know what it’s
talking about. Everybody wants to point fingers, but nobody wants to take
responsibility. No problem. Catch them off guard with a conference call and
let ’em duke it out. We predict that your troubleshooting problem will be
solved in no time at all!
170
Part III: Calling All Seasoned Skypers 

Here are some other things you can do with conference calling:
 Plan a surprise party
 Have a telephone visit with someone in the hospital
 Hold a book club dialogue
 Podcast a panel discussion
 Conduct a language class
 Hold weekly status meetings
 Help real estate agents schedule a closing with all the lawyers, bankers,
and other parties
 Connect doctors at multiple locations to confer about a patient
We encourage you to make your own list of ideas for conferencing via Skype.
Just use it!
Applying good conferencing practices
A traditional way to conduct a conference is to bring participants together
physically (say, in a conference room) and talk face to face. Years ago, that
was the only way to hold a conference. A technology such as Skype changes
the ground rules for conferencing, but with new capabilities and opportuni-
ties come new challenges.
Communicating by Skype conference call with several people at one time can
quickly get complicated. For example, intended conference participants may
be located in different time zones, or they may look at the scheduled confer-
ence call as a chance to run through a long list of unrelated topics. Here are
some simple suggestions for applying good conferencing practices to your
Skype conference calls:
 Plan ahead for time-zone differences: The people you want to bring
together in a conference call can be located halfway around the globe
from you or each other. A call you initiate at noon in Denver occurs at 
3 a.m. in Hong Kong. Of course, if you regularly keep in touch with the
various parties for your conference call, you can easily arrange to
accommodate time-zone differences. You can imagine the potential for
embarrassment when you schedule a conference call with people over-
seas and you call an hour later than planned because of a mix-up over
Daylight Saving Time.
171
Chapter 10: Partying On — On the Conference Line!

Avoid calling at the wrong time by chatting over Skype or sending an
email in advance of the call. Use this message to confirm the call’s date
and time in each time zone — your local time zone and the local time
zones of each participant — as well as the time in GMT (Greenwich
Mean Time; see the sidebar “DST, GMT, UTC, and so on” for more on
time zones). If you ask participants to check their local time against
GMT time, you minimize the potential for missing conference calls
because of the complexities of time zone differences.
If you use Outlook to schedule your meetings and have it integrated with
Skylook (see Chapter 9) and your participants have Outlook, then the
time zone differences are automatically reconciled in each person’s
Outlook schedule.
172
Part III: Calling All Seasoned Skypers 
DST, GMT, UTC, and so on
Nope, the title of this sidebar doesn’t contain
acronyms for industrial compounds and chem-
icals or insecticides. GMT and UTC signify time
zones (Greenwich Mean Time and Coordinated
Universal Time, respectively), and DST stands
for Daylight Saving Time, though just about
everybody we know calls it Daylight “Savings”
Time. Here are some fun facts about these time
notations:
 DST: Benjamin Franklin published a pro-
posal for Daylight Saving in the Journal de
Paris in April 26, 1784. Actually, when ol’
Ben proposed it, he suggested that people
adjust their schedules and not their clocks.
By Franklin’s calculation, the good people of
Paris could save 8 million pounds of candle
wax each night if they moved their sched-
ules around by an hour. Well over a century
would pass by before the idea of Daylight
Saving would take hold and we would adopt
the whole ball of wax.
 GMT: Refers to the local time at the Royal
Observatory in Greenwich, England. The
reason people standardize on a time zone
based in England is not to make telling 
time convenient for scientists local to that
observatory or to cater to the elite. Instead,
this location lies diametrically opposite the
International Date Line, an imaginary line on
the globe between one day of the week and
the next. (You can travel a short distance to
cross International Date Line and jump 24
hours ahead or behind, depending on the
direction you’re traveling. The International
Date Line is positioned so that the date
change occurs over the ocean, where it
causes minimal disruption.)
Because of this position, the local time in
the GMT time zone is high noon at the same
instant the clock strikes midnight at the
International Date Line.
 UTC: For practical purposes, the same as
GMT, except that UTC time is synchronized
to atomic clocks. Do you think it’s a bit odd
that UTC stands for Coordinated Universal
Time? If you’re into trivia, you can find lots
of information on the Internet about why the
acronym is UTC instead of CUT.
Here’s the bottom line: Don’t get confused if you
see someone using GMT while others are using
UTC. You can treat them as one and the same.

 Establish a Plan B for your conference call: The kind of people who
regularly participate in conference calls tend to be busy people on the
go. Their time is valuable, and in their hectic real world, not everything
goes as planned. Suppose you lose your wireless or Internet connection
right before the call is to occur. Or perhaps one of the participants has a
last-minute change of schedule. Whatever the cause, you would do well
to have a backup plan. It pays to set up an alternate date/time for the
conference call. This is especially relevant if you are trying to pitch a
new project to a prospective client, or some similar situation in which
the people you’re talking with don’t know you very well or are not regu-
larly in contact with you.
 Avoid conference-call drift: If you are holding a formal conference 
call on Skype, you’ll want to keep the conference call focused. The 
simplest method for maintaining focus is to provide call participants
with an agenda. Simply open a chat window to all the conference 
participants before beginning the audio conference; then, copy the
agenda from your Word document and paste it into the chat window. 
Or even better than pasting text, paste a link to a Web page that holds
the agenda into your chat.
What if someone takes the conference call via phone and has no Internet
access? You can explore a multitude of services (many of which are free
or at least have free trial periods) that allow you to send faxes from the
Internet. If a participant has no fax machine available, just read the
agenda at the start of the meeting and refer back to it as the meeting
progresses.
Native Skype Conferencing
Skype conference calling doesn’t require any additional software. If you have
Skype on your Windows PC or Mac, the conferencing capability is already
built in. The people you conference with don’t have to use the same kind of
computer platform as you do. They can use a wireless mobile Skype device,
such as a Pocket PC or Windows Mobile, and because you can conference
with anyone reachable using SkypeOut, participants can even take a confer-
ence call on their landlines and mobile phones.
Right out of the box, Skype allows you to connect groups of users, which is
the essence of conference calling. Exactly how many people can you connect
this way? Skype by itself allows five people to be speaking together at one
time, but if you have enhanced hardware (such as a dual-core processor),
Skype allows you to take advantage of this and double that number to 10. 
But effective use of Skype conferencing doesn’t require you to rush out and
buy a brand-new, top-of-the-line computer with a dual-core processor (it’s a
nice excuse, though).
173
Chapter 10: Partying On — On the Conference Line!

A difference between Skype conference calling and the more traditional con-
ference call systems is worth pointing out. With Skype, you conference call
out to reach all the parties, rather than have them call in to you.
Starting a conference call
The mindset with Skype conference calling is simple and less structured than
with traditional conference calling systems. When you set up a traditional
conference call, you first reserve the availability of a dial-in number for a spe-
cific date and time, call or email each participant with the information, and
then have everyone call the dial-in number at the scheduled time. But Skype’s
technology makes this level of prearranging unnecessary. Whenever you feel
like it (and your intended participants are available), you can reach all the
parties over Skype in one step and just start talking.
Follow these steps to making an easy Skype conference call:
1. In your Skype client window, Ctrl+click the Skype contacts you want
to include in your conference.
As you select multiple contacts, the green handset button you use 
to start Skype calls changes appearance to indicate that you’re in 
conference mode (see Figure 10-1).
2. Click the Conference button, and Skype calls the selected contacts.
That’s all there is to it!
Figure 10-1:

button, 
and the

174
Part III: Calling All Seasoned Skypers 

Skype gives you alternative ways to start a conference. You can start a 
conference call from the Skype menu by following these steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Create a Conference Call.
The Start a Conference Call window opens.
2. Type the title in the Conference topic text box if you want something
other than Skype Rocks.
3. Choose your conference participants.
You can select individual Skype contacts in the All Contacts pane and
click the Add button (see Figure 10-2). Alternatively, you can click and
drag a Skype contact into the Conference Participants panel.
4. After you select the participants for your conference, click the OK
button.
As the conference organizer, you can use this same method (click a contact
name in the All Contacts list and then click Add) to add people to an ongoing
conference call. Of course, you can add callers only up to Skype’s limit on the
number of participants allowed.
You can include SkypeOut contacts, as well as Skype-equipped contacts, in
your conference calls. Before making the call, just add a SkypeOut contact and
supply a regular phone number in the contact information. Once that contact is
added, you can immediately include the SkypeOut contact in any conference
call you initiate. Of course, if there is a charge for the SkypeOut service (which
depends on where you are calling), you will incur those regular charges.

Chapter 10: Partying On — On the Conference Line!

Care to hold a conference call while you’re on the go? Specifically, we mean
when you’re on the road moving at 55+ miles per hour. For a small monthly
fee, your phone company may provide you with a device to connect your
laptop to the Internet wherever you find a reasonably strong cell phone
signal. This feature, along with Skype, gives you a roving conference center.
Of course, you’ll be conferencing from the back seat while someone else is
driving. Safety comes first!
Reconnecting a dropped caller
Conference calling on Skype is a no-brainer. Not only is setting up a call super
easy (see the preceding section), but staying connected is also quite conve-
nient. During a conference call, connections can be dropped unexpectedly.
For example, suppose that a conference call participant is talking on a cell
phone, drives through a tunnel, and then loses the connection (in some juris-
dictions, it is unlawful to drive and talk on a cell phone at the same time).
When you use Skype, you can reestablish the dropped connection without
having to restart the conference call, as follows:
1. Click the Contacts tab to go to your Skype client’s contact list.
In your contact list, all the call participants should be already selected.
2. Ctrl+click the dropped contact and click the green call button on the
Skype client window.
The dropped contact gets added back into the call, and you don’t have
to close the current connections.
Seeing who’s doing the talking 
(Or what he or she is saying)
Now that you can conference call easily with Skype, you may get adventurous
and hold your power meetings with participants overseas. A potential challenge
is this: The participants you’re speaking with may have foreign accents that
make them all sound alike to your untrained ear and leave you scratching
your head trying to figure out who said what.
A welcome feature in Skype lets you see who is talking. The feature shows up
differently on the Windows and Mac platforms. On Windows, a glowing halo
surrounds the icon of the person currently speaking. On a Mac, the sound
meter level for the speaking participant increases. Figure 10-3 shows this fea-
ture on both platforms. Now you can really “see” who is doing the talking in
your conference calls (it’s seasonedskyper in both examples).
176
Part III: Calling All Seasoned Skypers 

If your participants are chatterboxes, you may see more than one halo glow-
ing at the same time. In this case, you needn’t worry about who’s saying what
because you’re unlikely to understand what they’re saying, anyway.
Skype conference calls are handier when the participants can share a
common chat window to type in text messages and provide live URL links
during the conference call. Here is the easy way to start a simul-chat:
1. In the Contacts tab of your Skype client, Ctrl+click the participants for
your simul-chat and conference call.
2. Start a chat.
With your participants selected, right-click and select Start Chat from
the resulting menu. A chat window opens. You may want to start the
chat with a message like “I am about to start the conference call.”
3. Start the conference call.
On the Skype client window, your chart participants are selected. As more
than one contact is selected, the large green button should display the con-
ference call symbol. Simply click the button to start the conference call.
When you start a chat with your conference callers, you get these advantages:
 You can keep a written record of the conference call: The text chat can
persist long after the conference call itself is concluded. Additionally,
you can retain the text content of the chat as a summary and record of
information exchanged during the conference call.
Figure 10-3:

halos and

177
Chapter 10: Partying On — On the Conference Line!

 You can ask just one participant a question without bothering every-
one: If you need to, you can quietly conduct a separate whisper chat
(where you can send a private comment to one of the participants with-
out having all the others aware of the side discussion; see Chapter 6)
while the conference is in session.
 You can display discussion material: It’s easy to paste several paragraphs
of text into a chat window or give your participants links to click while
still carrying on your conference. You can even transfer files to the con-
ference participants.
Transferring files while conferencing
While conference calling with Skype, you can transfer files to the connected
participants. Obviously, you won’t be able to transfer a file to any participant
connected over SkypeOut. The last time we checked, conventional phones
don’t have the capability to send or receive files. Also, as of this writing,
mobile devices running Skype (such as PDAs), don’t have the capability to
send and receive files over Skype. (But we won’t be surprised if this feature 
is added in the future.)
When you’re on a Skype conference call, you can transfer files to regular
skypers by following these steps:
1. Make sure that you have a chat window open to your conference 
participants.
2. Locate the file you want to send.
3. Drag the file into the chat window.
Dragging the file to the area you would regularly be typing in messages
sends the file to all the people on the chat who are capable of receiving
files. Users on mobile devices who can participate on chats may not be
able to receive files.
File transfers during a Skype conference call occur in the background while
everyone’s speaking in the foreground. Because keeping the high-grade qual-
ity of the voice line is important, the file transfer may run a little slowly. Slow
transfer is noticeable if the file is several megabytes in size. You may be able
to speed up the file transfer if you first place the conference on hold (by
choosing Call➪Hold➪Conference Call) and then do the transfer. This tech-
nique of speeding up file transfers also works on Skype calls to individual
Skype contacts. Simply place your party on hold before transferring the file.
178
Part III: Calling All Seasoned Skypers 

Conferencing with Skype Plus Third-
Party Web Conferencing Tools
Skype conference calling is convenient and practical. You can convene a
group people to talk and exchange ideas, send paragraphs of text, and even
transfer files. The richness of the conferencing experience and benefits get
multiplied when you add Web conferencing into the mix.
Web conferencing in conjunction with Skype provides a number of advantages
that you cannot get using Skype alone. You can:
 Present a stunning visual presentation in a group setting: Here’s your
chance to win over a group of people in a virtual boardroom setting. Not
only can you run through your PowerPoint presentation, you can also
“hand off” your presentation to another presenter midstream, showing
what’s on somebody else’s computer. That’s not all. You can create an
interactive presentation that allows your conference participants to run
and control the application on your screen from their computers.
 Record your presentation or online session: Web conferencing can pro-
vide for features such as creating an audio or audio plus video recording
of your online meeting. You can use this recording for your own per-
sonal records, for rebroadcast over the Web, or for DVD distribution as
an instructional video.
When you record a conversation or meeting, be sure to adhere to any
legal requirements in your jurisdiction about notifying parties that you
are recording the online meeting.
 Create the stunning visual presentation in collaboration with your col-
leagues: Displaying your screen and applications in a collaboration
mode is a very effective way to work. In this manner, you can build very
effective presentations with the help of your colleagues but without
requiring their physical presence.
 Web conferencing tools can have some administrative aids: If you plan
to use Web conferencing and your line of work is professional services
related, you may appreciate the fact that a number of Web conferencing
services can log dates, times, and participants of online meetings.
Capturing this information in the form of a spreadsheet, Web page, or
text file may come in very handy. 
When you tally the number of hours spent online, and the number of hours
you save your clients (not to mention the reduction of travel expenses), you
will find that dollar for dollar, next to Skype, which is effectively free, the
added dollars you spend on Web conferencing is some of the best spent
money in your budget.
179
Chapter 10: Partying On — On the Conference Line!

Adding Web conferencing to Skype is easy to do. All you really need is
Internet access (which you already have if you’re using Skype) and to sign up
with a service that provides Web conferencing. In this chapter, we describe
two Web conferencing tools: GoToMeeting, a product of Citrix Online, and
Unyte, a product of WebDialogs. There are plenty of others to pick from.
To help you understand how Skype and Web conferencing work together, we
take a closer look at each of these Web conferencing products.
Web conferencing with GoToMeeting 
and Skype
Skype and GoToMeeting work very well together. To get started, you need the
following:
 Skype and an Internet connection: You need a broadband Internet con-
nection; a dial-up connection is not fast enough and cannot support
both Skype and GoToMeeting at the same time.
 A computer running Windows: To host an online meeting with
GoToMeeting, you must be using the Windows operating system. Intel-
based Macs that run Windows also work. 
 GoToMeeting: To get GoToMeeting, go to www.gotomeeting.com and
set up a GoToMeeting account. You have these options for your
GoToMeeting account:
• Standard Account: You can pay for the service a month at a time or
sign up for a year for a discounted fee. A standard account allows
you to have up to 10 participants + 1 for the host. You can explore
the features of GoToMeeting by setting up a free trial account.
• Corporate Account: Gives you multiple user accounts but enlarges
the number of participants to 25. Additional licensing options
expand the number of participants to 200.
The features that we show in this chapter are based on using the standard
edition of GoToMeeting.
There’s a point worth mentioning about using Skype and GoToMeeting
together. Depending on your Skype configuration, when you host a Skype
conference call, you may have a limit of one host + four participants, or one
host + nine participants. The standard version of GoToMeeting supports one
host + ten participants. If you need to hold a combined Skype/GoToMeeting
conference that exceeds a total of five people, you need to make sure that
you are using the appropriate hardware such as a dual-core processor so that
Skype can take advantage of it.
180
Part III: Calling All Seasoned Skypers 

The number of users permitted on a Skype conference call is dependent only
on the configuration of the computer used to host the call. You do not need
to concern yourself with the kind of computers your conference participants
use; only the one you are using to host the conference matters.
Here are some things you can do with GoToMeeting and Skype:
 Hold a private online meeting: A key advantage of using Skype in con-
junction with GoToMeeting is that all the information exchanged can be
100 percent encrypted, including the information showing on the pre-
senter’s screen, the keyboard and mouse movements, chats, exchange 
of files, and the Skype audio conferencing. Because the Skype voice and
chats are secure, you can even transmit the GoToMeeting password
securely over Skype!
 Hold an online interactive class: Now you can run a virtual classroom
in cyberspace and all your students can be anywhere in the world. You
can teach them how to run a piece of software and give them turns at
taking over the mouse and keyboard. You can give them a class assign-
ment and later file-transfer the solution. Because you can switch presen-
ters at any time, you can team-teach the class, and individual students
can be made presenters. This is unlike anything the Show and Tell that
we used to know in grade school!
For whatever it’s worth, GoToMeeting gives you the ability to make
audio and video recordings of your Web conference.
 Solve a problem for a client: If you happen to be a consultant and your
client has a problem on one or more of their computers (it could, for
instance, be a problem with some formulas in a spreadsheet), you have
the ability to connect in over Skype and GoToMeeting and collabora-
tively work on the problem with the client. Skype makes it easy to trans-
fer files, such as a spreadsheet, or software drivers, or whatever is
needed at the moment. To clients, there are two other tangible benefits:
• Security: Clients may want to give you temporary access to their
private data to fix a problem but not allow you to take custody
over the data.
• Software licensing: Clients may be running some special software
that has a per-seat software license fee or might be difficult to
install on your computer. Accordingly, Web conferencing à la Skype
lets you circumnavigate these issues altogether.
 Team programming: The idea is not so far-fetched. As you are developing
some code for an application, you can use Skype and Web conferencing to
develop an application jointly with a colleague who can be hundreds or
thousands of miles away. Both of you can type and edit the programming
code, and run the code on the spot. As you need to, you can transfer files
back and forth using Skype. Having high-quality sound in Skype makes it
seem as though your colleague is sitting in the room next to you. In this
mode, you can work productively for hours at a time.
181
Chapter 10: Partying On — On the Conference Line!

A chief benefit of this kind of team programming is the fact that you can
improve the quality of your work product while shaving hours off of
development, testing, and validation.
Setting up your GoToMeeting account
During the process of creating a GoToMeeting account, you provide some
basic information including a your email address and password. After you are
signed up, you can immediately start hosting online meetings. To do so, go to
www.gotomeeting.com and click the button that says Host a Meeting. You
are prompted for your email address and password, which is information you
provided when you set up your account.
The first time you host a meeting, GoToMeeting automatically downloads and
installs all the necessary files on your computer. Thereafter, you can host or
schedule a meeting by right-clicking the GoToMeeting icon in your system
tray and choosing either Meet Now or Schedule a Meeting.
Conducting meetings
After you establish an account and set up GoToMeeting, you can use it as much
as you want. GoToMeeting puts no limitation or restriction on the amount of
time you spend on meetings. GoToMeeting can also provide (at no charge) a
dial-up phone number for the audio portion of your meeting. The dial-up
number you are given is not a toll-free number. If you elect to use this service,
all the participants who call would have to pay the toll charges. Fortunately,
because you and all your participants can be using Skype, you can eliminate
the need for a separate phone number and just use Skype instead. Setting up
and using Skype as opposed to conventional phone service is simpler, works
better, and has zero cost for Skype to Skype communications.
GoToMeeting works the following way:
 GoToMeeting gives you a meeting ID: When you set up a meeting, you
receive a URL that you must disseminate to your participants. Although
you can email this information, the easy way to invite participants is to
send the link over a Skype chat. Participants join simply by clicking the
link in their chat window.
When the participants click the link, their Web browser opens a new
Web page associated with the meeting. If they never used GoToMeeting
before, a special Java applet is automatically downloaded and launched.
It may be necessary for them to signify that they “trust” the applet and
agree to let it download and launch. Participants are prompted to sign in
and supply their name and email address. If you establish a password
for your meeting, they are also prompted to supply that password. The
whole process is automated and is a lot easier than it sounds.
 Meetings can be prescheduled or on the spot: You can set up online
meetings that are scheduled in advance for a particular date and time,
182
Part III: Calling All Seasoned Skypers 

are recurring, or are impromptu. In a scheduled meeting, you can specify
the meeting subject. 
 Meetings are kept private: All the transmissions over GoToMeeting take
place over encrypted channels. For extra security, you can require users
to provide a meeting password. Additionally, if you use Skype for the
audio portion of your meeting, for text messaging, and for file transfers,
you can hold a complete online meeting that is 100 percent encrypted.
To start a meeting with Skype and GoToMeeting, follow these steps:
1. Right-click the GoToMeeting icon in your system tray and choose Meet
Now from the resulting menu.
2. Enter your email address and password when prompted. 
You can tell GoToMeeting to store this identification information on your
computer and avoid having to provide it every time you host a meeting.
A GoToMeeting panel opens and displays a variety of controls for your
meeting. You can optionally change the meeting subject by choosing
File➪Edit Meeting Subject in the GoToMeeting panel.
3. If you haven’t already done so, start your Skype chat and conference
and get your participants online.
If you are unsure how to start a Skype conference, refer to the section
“Starting a conference call,” earlier in this chapter.
4. In the Invite People (or Invite Others) section of the GoToMeeting
panel, click the Copy/Paste tab and then click the Copy button. 
The information about how to join the meeting is now in your clipboard.
5. Click the input region of your Skype chat window (where you normally
type messages) and press Ctrl+V to paste the meeting information for
your participants.
Before pressing the Enter key, you can edit the meeting information.
GoToMeeting automatically gives a dial-in number. Because you are
already using Skype, you don’t need to include this number, unless you
want it as a backup to your Skype call.
As a host or meeting organizer, that’s all you need to do.
Participating in meetings
If you are the recipient who is invited to a meeting over Skype, here is what
happens:
1. The host opens a Skype conference and chat with you and the other
participants.
2. The host posts a link to the meeting on your chat window, and you
click it.
183
Chapter 10: Partying On — On the Conference Line!

When you click the link, your Web browser launches (if it is not 
already open) and goes to a page to see whether you already have 
the GoToMeeting Java applet on your computer. If you don’t, it is 
downloaded for you and you are asked to trust it. Say Yes to trust it. 
You have the choice of selecting Trust Always or Trust for Just This
Session. If you select Trust Always, you won’t be asked this question
every time you start a GoToMeeting session. Either choice is fine.
3. When prompted, supply your name, email address, and, if necessary,
password.
After the Java applet is downloaded, it prompts you for your name and
email address. If the meeting host requires a password, you will have to
supply this as well before you can enter the meeting.
When you enter the meeting, you may see a welcome screen or the presenter’s
computer screen (see Figure 10-4). The presenter is in control of the meeting.
He or she can control what you are allowed to see. The presenter can choose
to give you access to his or her mouse and keyboard. The conference organizer
can change presenters at any time and can even make you the presenter.
Taking over the GoToMeeting reins
If the conference organizer transfers meeting control to you and makes you
the presenter, a window pops up on your screen that announces as much.
This window also asks that — before showing the contents of your screen —
you close any confidential window and then click the Show My Screen
button. Nobody sees what is on your screen until you say it is okay by 
clicking this Show My Screen button (see Figure 10-5). 
If you need to opt out of being the presenter, simply click the Close (X)
button in the top-right corner of the pop-up window.
184
Part III: Calling All Seasoned Skypers 
GoToMeeting’s Mac support is limited
GoToMeeting version 3.0 and later has limited
support for the Macintosh. Mac users who are
running OS X 10.3.9 or later and who are not run-
ning Windows can join a hosted GoToMeeting
session, but in a “read only” mode. Mac users can
view a presenter’s screen but cannot be given
control of the presenter’s mouse and keyboard. 
Additionally, the Mac user cannot be made a
presenter. If the Mac user is running Windows
on one of the Intel-based Macs, then the user’s
Macintosh in Windows mode has all the privi-
leges and features available to Windows users,
including the ability to be given mouse and key-
board control, as well as being made a presenter.

Whether you’re the conference organizer or one of the participants, the
GoToMeeting panel takes up a good deal of screen space. Click the “-->>>”
icon at the top-left corner of the panel to collapse it.
“Unyting” Skype with visual 
communications
Unyte, appropriately named, brings together Skype and Web conferencing.
The Unyte software integrates tightly with Skype and comes in two varieties,
Figure 10-5:

185
Chapter 10: Partying On — On the Conference Line!

which you can download from www.unyte.net. Unyte Basic — the free 
version — allows you to display your screen to one other conference partici-
pant. The Unyte+ version allows you to share your screen and applications
with multiple participants in a session. Unyte+ is fee based, and the fee
depends on how many users you need to connect at one time. You can start
with five users (which matches the low-end configuration of Skype) or, for a
higher fee, you can have up to 25 users on a Web conference. Pricing is also
based the duration of your subscription.
If you need to hold a Web conference that goes beyond the five-or-ten-
participants limit of Skype, you will need an alternative source to handle 
the audio portion. The recommended source is High Speed Conferencing
(www.highspeedconferencing.com), a free audio conferencing service 
for Skype users that can support conferences of up to 500 people. You can
find out more about High Speed Conferencing in Chapter 12.
You can host an online meeting on Unyte or Unyte+ only on a Windows-based
system. If you’re on a Mac, you will need to be running Windows on Boot
Camp or a virtualization software that allows you to run Windows.
When you host a Web conference on Unyte+, you have to specify a number 
of options:
 What applications and desktop resources to share: You have the ability
to specify what participants will see when they connect to your com-
puter (see Figure 10-6). For instance, you may be showing a PowerPoint
presentation but, behind the scenes, running an Excel pricing spread-
sheet that you don’t want your viewers to see.
 Allowing remote control: When you make your desktop visible, you
have the option to allow remote control from other computers. At any
time during your online meeting, you can turn remote control on or off.
When you allow remote control, all the participants in the online meet-
ing can control your computer. Participants using Macs can remotely
control your computer as easily as those using PCs.
 Skype contacts and invitations: Unyte gives you the option of selecting
from your list of Skype contacts to invite to your online meeting (see
Figure 10-7).
After you invite the participants, a new Skype chat window opens with a
message from you that says something like this:
I’m inviting you to view my desktop applications. Click this link to start: 
https://skype2.unyte.net/skype?s=268269141&k=29089&l=en-US
186
Part III: Calling All Seasoned Skypers 

Web conferences are connected through Java applets running from 
participants’ Web browsers, so it is not necessary for the invitees to be
running Skype. It is not necessary for you to limit your invitees to only
Skype contacts. You can also send invitations by email, copying and
pasting the meeting URL into an instant message, or simply by reading
instructions to other people over the phone.
When you invite non-Skype participants, you will have to resort to a 
separate audio system to accommodate your invitees. The one system
that can handle this for both Skype and non-Skype users is High Speed
Conferencing (see Chapter 12). This system is free to set up and use.
Skype users get to call for free. Non-Skype users calling from regular
landlines and cell phones incur whatever it normally costs to make a 
call to an assigned phone number for the call, which is based on the
country the caller is dialing in from.
In addition to displaying screens and using applications, Unyte conference
participants can draw or highlight relevant items on-screen, or use an arrow
pointer to draw attention to important information (see Figure 10-8).

Spicing Things Up with Great
Gadgets and Add-Ons
In This Chapter
 Understanding Skype as a many-platformed thing
 Adding flexibility with a Skype phone
 Bolstering privacy and clarity with accessories
 Going wireless with Bluetooth
 Getting add-ons that listen, record, transcribe, animate, talk to you, and on and on
S
kype comes in four flavors: Windows, Macintosh, Linux, and Mobile. After
you choose a flavor (or two), you can serve up Skype in any number of
ways. Instead of a cup or a cone, you use devices such as laptops, desktops,
wireless phones, mobile computers, or memory sticks to hold your chosen
flavor(s). Then you can go for the toppings! Why not try adding microphones,
webcams, wired or wireless headsets, or Bluetooth transmitters to your Skype
sundae? You can also add software programs that record conversations, follow
you with video as you move, or transform your image into a talking dinosaur.
With so many flavors and toppings (that is, platforms and add-ons) to choose
from, we suggest matching your selections with how you use Skype for work
or play. Here are some ideas:
 For the frequent traveler: If you need to take Skype with you wherever
you go, try Skype on a laptop (or other mobile device) with a headset.
 For the collaborator: Suppose you need to keep track of ideas shared 
on Skype conference calls; try using audio recording software and tran-
scribing software to capture every idea perfectly.
 For the integrator: If you find it handy to connect calls from other
people’s computers, try loading Skype — with your call list, chat history,
bookmarks, and so on — onto a USB drive.
 For the too-busy-to-sit-down entrepreneur: If you find it difficult to stay
tethered to a computer, try a Bluetooth headset and speech commands
to manage your Skype communication.

 For the frequent business caller: Suppose you could make all your land-
line calls and Skype calls from the same device by just pressing a button.
You might want to plug in a dual-duty phone that handles both kinds of
calls seamlessly.
No matter which devices, operating systems, add-ons, or software packages
you use, one element remains the same: How you bring all these tools
together can help you connect with others, work more productively, save
money, and just have fun.
Giving Skype a Mobile Platform
Your desktop or laptop computer isn’t the only platform you can use to run
Skype. You have other fun options — for example, Skype-enabled phones and
PDAs — that free you to take Skype wherever you go. One of these mobile
platforms, plus an Internet connection, is all you need to hook up with your
Skype contacts.
Skyping from your thumbtop
The notion of tucking away an entire communication and productivity center
on a stick is pretty outrageous. But it’s also true. Devices such as the U3
Smart Drive from SanDisk (shown in Figure 11-1) let you take your data and
your programs with you. You can explore the current variety of U3-compliant
software at the U3 Software Download Center (http://software.u3.com),
which features device-ready programs for download and purchase. In what
seems to be the blink of an eye, computing environments have moved from
desktops to laptops to palmtops, and now we’re into thumbtops. We can’t
help imagining that using such devices gives us access to one big information
network where — like the Borg of “Star Trek” — we tap into the global mind
(without the sinister overtones, of course).
We tried the U3 Smart Drive, which comes preloaded with Skype. This small
device, in addition to backing up files, allows you to run programs directly
from the smart drive without having to touch files from the computer’s hard
disk. With Skype preloaded, all you do is plug the drive into a USB port on an
Internet-connected computer, start Skype, and log on to your account.
Running Skype from a U3 Smart Drive or other removable drive offers you
portability as well as the following:
 An increased level of privacy: All your Skype-related information — chat
history, bookmarks, notifications, and SkypeOut/SkypeIn numbers —
remains on your portable drive. When you remove your portable drive,
you remove your information from the host computer.
190
Part III: Calling All Seasoned Skypers 

 Freedom from downloading and installing Skype: You aren’t in the
uncomfortable position of asking to download software onto someone
else’s computer in order to run Skype. A technology has got to be good
when it makes you a better guest!
 Added portability: Pocket your data along with your programs in one
tiny space. Everything is ready for transmission over Skype, just when
you need it.
 Generate confidence: Knowing that your programs and data are acces-
sible in another complete package and location — that is, tucked away
on your smart drive — reduces the techno-jitters before a presentation.
 Backup your peace of mind: Even if you bring a fully configured laptop
along, having a smart drive waiting in the wings as a perfectly rehearsed
understudy reduces the worry that your show won’t go on.
The programs loaded onto a U3 Smart Drive have to be prepared to retain all
the information that accompanies the software. If you feel squeezed for space
and decide to upgrade your drive from a 1GB to a 2GB or 4GB unit, you can
just drag the contents onto the new drive.

Turning a handheld computer 
into a Skype phone
When you use Skype on a Pocket PC device, you can call, chat, look up a pro-
file, change your Web presence, make SkypeOut calls, receive Voicemail mes-
sages, and participate in a conference. During an active call, you can even see
the photos or images that skypers uploaded to their profiles.

But here are a few things you can’t do (well, not yet, anyway). You can’t:
 Send or receive a file through Skype

Never fear. . . USB is here!
A group of business associates — still jet-
lagged from the five-hour plane ride — gather
in a wood-paneled conference room. They plug
the laptop into a projector ready to knock the
socks off of their client with an eye-popping
presentation. As the laptop boots up and the
image sharpens on the screen, the first associ-
ate pales. The second grows paler still, and the
third is downright ghostly.
The program needed to run the presentation is
missing, and the crucial spreadsheet showing
the latest quarterly numbers is nowhere to be
found. The fourth associate calmly reaches into
her pocket, pulls out a USB drive, and plugs it
into the laptop. She fires up the program they
need, which is fully functional from the USB
drive. Then she starts Skype (also fully func-
tional from her thumb drive), taps into the local
Wi-Fi, and scrolls through her Contacts list. She
fires up a call, transfers the crucial spreadsheet
file through Skype, and has the presentation up
and running just as the CEO enters.
The heroine of this story is using a new tech-
nology and a new approach to the information
age mantra “Back up, back up, back up!” In this
case, what you back up is not just data; it’s the
whole software environment and the peace of
mind that goes with it. Keeping a loaded USB
drive on hand is better than popping an antacid
tablet when it comes to calming nerves before
a meeting.

Skype is already installed on the hw6900, so you won’t have to figure out how
to download a program as the first mobile thing you do. (You can save that
tutorial for a Skype upgrade later.) However, a little fiddling is needed to con-
nect to a Wi-Fi network. (Wi-Fi is the popular name describing the underlying
technology of wireless local area networks [WLANs] based on the IEEE 802.11
specifications.) If you use a wireless computing device, you need a wireless
network that’s set up to access the Skype peer-to-peer network.
The iPAQ hw6900 rides on top of the Wi-Fi signal to provide Skype service.
Your mobile unit will search for a signal; when you see your network name
among the choices, press the network name with your stylus for one or two
seconds until a context menu pops up, and then select Connect. If you don’t
see the Wi-Fi search screen, tap on Start➪Settings➪Connections➪Network
Cards. Sometimes finding the wireless access is instant, and sometimes you
do a considerable amount of tapping. But after you’re connected, you can
give yourself a wi-five and start skyping.
Before you can make the iPAQ hw6900 into a working cell phone, you must
activate an account with a service provider and sign up for a fee-based plan.
Then with Skype and Wi-Fi, you can make SkypeOut calls.

Skype looks almost the same (just smaller) on a mobile device as on a laptop.
Figures 11-3 and 11-4 show various Skype screens on a Pocket PC platform.
When you get to the program, you’ll recognize all the icons. And you’ll be
skyping around town in no time if you follow these steps:
1. Charge your iPAQ hw6900 (or other Pocket PC unit) and press the
power button to turn it on.
The Today Screen — the little mobile desktop screen for those of us not
in the Windows mobile universe — appears.
2. Choose Start➪Programs➪Skype.
3. Tap the Tap Here to Sign In button on the Opening Screen (as shown
at the top right in Figure 11-4) and choose an option on the sign-in
screen, as follows:
• Create a new Skype account.
• Log on to your own account.
4. Enter your Skype ID (your Skype Name) and password where
prompted and click OK.
Skype looks for a signal and logs in to your account (if you have a wire-
less network available). After you’re connected, look through your
Contacts list and check the Web status buttons that indicate your con-
tacts’ presence online. See Chapter 3 for information on verifying that a
contact is on the Web.
5. Select a contact from your list, tap the call or chat button, and 
skype away.
Tap twice on the screen for skyping options during an active call. Large call
function icons appear on the screen and let you check a profile, mute your
voice, add the caller to your contacts, start a chat, or hang up.

If you use the on-screen keyboard, it obscures the password field, so you may
want to use the standard built-in QWERTY-style keyboard.
The iPAQ hw6900 comes with a clear cover that swivels up to reveal the
touchscreen display. One of the authors (we won’t say which one) spent an
embarrassing amount of time trying to troubleshoot the unit, which wouldn’t
open any programs until we pointed out that the clear plastic cover was
down, so that lovely touchscreen was not actually being touched. No amount
of stylus tapping would start that puppy. After we figured out the lift-up-the-
clear-cover hack — similar to the take-off-the-lens-cap hack — everything
worked like a charm.
Skyping from your Wi-Fi phone: 
Netgear SPH 101 Wi-Fi
Those of you craving a truly portable Skype phone (but who don’t need the
turbocharged iPAQ) may want to look at the Netgear SPH101, shown in Figure
11-5. Weighing in at just a few ounces, this phone is extremely portable and
fits comfortably inside your shirt pocket. Separately available is a cradle to
keep the unit perpetually charged. Because of the phone’s small size, the LCD
panel is also small, but it is extremely crisp and the colors are bright, which
makes the screen easy to read.
This nifty device taps into wireless networks and allows you to send and
receive calls over Skype. Just imagine having no calling plans and no monthly
fees. You simply find a public wireless network or connect into your own 
private wireless network and begin calling.

If you get a Wi-Fi phone, also get a SkypeIn number (with free Voicemail). This
way, anyone can call you from a regular landline or cell phone as easily as
people reach you on Skype from a PC.

Replacing Your Bulky Computer Phone
We’ve come full circle. Telephones started out bulky and wired; then they
trimmed down and became wireless. Now we make calls over the Internet on
computers, which are even bulkier and have more wires. Not to worry! More
and more companies are producing Internet telephony devices that are
smaller, wireless, and look just like . . . telephones!
Skyping around the house, 
and even in the yard
The Linksys CIT200 Internet Telephony Kit is a Skype phone for PCs (see Figure
11-6). The device consists of a handset with a dial pad and a color display that
works just like a telephone. After you’ve synchronized your Skype information
with the phone, you can scroll through your Contacts list on the display and
press the button with the green telephone icon to dial out. There are no major
lessons to learn, but there are major advantages to gain, as follows:
 Finding available Skype contacts is quick and easy. To the left of each
contact name is a status icon that tells you who is online and who doesn’t
want to be disturbed. Push the toggle button up or down to scroll
through your contacts. If you have a really long list, you can jump to a
section quickly. Find the first letter of your contact’s name on the dial
pad. If you are looking for Loren, press the JKL button. Hold that key
down for about two seconds, and the first name that starts with J is
highlighted. Hold the key down again to jump to K names, and hold it a
third time for L names.
 Contacts’ profiles are at your fingertips. You can see some of a con-
tact’s profile information (other than a photo) if that contact has made it
available. Pressing the button under the word DETAILS on your display
shows a contact’s language, age, and gender. Press the button under
MORE to find telephone, fax, mobile phone, and home phone informa-
tion. If your contact has not put this information into his or her profile,
you won’t see it in your Skype phone.
 The Skype phone offers familiar phone operations. To make a call, 
just select a contact and push the button with the green telephone on 
it. Push the red telephone button to end a call. You can put your caller
on hold by pressing the green call button (you’ll hear a dial tone). Press
the Skype button at the bottom of the phone to see your contacts list.
Choose a contact and press the button below the word DETAILS. Then,
when the phone number information appears on the screen, press the
same button (this time it will be below the word DIAL) and start another
call. However, it won’t be a conference call. If you’re invited to a confer-
ence call, you can participate, but you can’t start one.
197
Chapter 11: Spicing Things Up with Great Gadgets and Add-Ons

 Letting others know that you’re online and available to call is a snap.
You can indicate your status to your Skype contacts through the Linksys
handset by choosing Menu➪OK➪User Status to get the status choices.
Select a status choice, and the rest of the world will know whether they
can reach you on Skype.
Setting up the Linksys Skype phone is easy. But watch for the one hold-up:
You can’t plug it in right out of the box because it needs an overnight charge
before the first use. After that, if the phone needs a charge, it will emit a little
beep to let you know to put it back in its cradle.

Installing the phone’s drivers
The Linksys CIT200 phone piggybacks on your computer’s Internet connection
and Skype program. A base station acts as the go-between. So, you need to
install some software drivers to get all the pieces communicating. Linksys pro-
vides an install CD, so you don’t have to search for the drivers over the Internet.
However, you must install Skype and activate a Skype account prior to hooking
up the Linksys phone. With that done, the installation process is simple:
1. Plug the phone’s base station into a USB port on your PC.
Figure 11-6:
The Linksys
CIT200
Internet
Telephony
Kit.
198
Part III: Calling All Seasoned Skypers 

2. Put the Linksys phone in its charger cradle (after putting the two
NiMH AAA batteries in the charger).
Make sure that you charge the unit for 14 hours before its first use.
3. Insert the installation CD and run the setup.exe installer file (which
should begin automatically).
4. Press the button on the base station (there is only one) to make sure
that the base sees the phone handset.
If all is well, the handset will play a little music to let you know it’s 
connected.
5. Log on to your Skype account on your computer.
6. When the Skype API Security Screen appears, click the button that
allows the Linksys CIT200 program to use Skype.
Your phone is now skypified and ready for the acid test. Press the Skype
button at the bottom of the phone, and if all goes well, your contacts will
appear in the display.
Operating the phone: Details, details
The Linksys CIT200 phone is for Skype voice calling. You can’t chat, start a
conference, or send a file, but you can retrieve your Skype Voicemail if you
have an account. This device has mute and speakerphone features, as well 
as a headset jack for earphones. You can connect up to four handsets to one
base station, and if you have multiple computers in different rooms, you can
connect one handset to four base stations. Choose a base station to connect
to, and the Skype ID for that computer comes up on your phone. To connect
to a base station:
1. Select Menu (push the button below the word Menu in the LCD display).
2. Press the circular navigation button left or right to navigate to the
SYSTEM menu.
3. Press the button under the word OK.
4. Press the circular navigation button up or down to select BASE
SELECT. Click OK.
5. Navigate through the list of bases. 
By default, they are named BASE 1, BASE 2, and so on. Click OK. Your
phone displays the word SUCCESSFUL if you’ve made contact. You now
have access to the Contacts list on that computer’s Skype program.
199
Chapter 11: Spicing Things Up with Great Gadgets and Add-Ons

Following are some points we found helpful to know when operating our
Linksys Skype phone:
 Press and hold 0 to get a + sign in your phone number: When skyping
out, your number, a plus sign (+), and the country code precedes the
telephone number.
 Keeping your Skype phone in range of your base station: If you wander
beyond the range of the Linksys Skype phone, it beeps in complaint.
Simply move closer to the base station to pick up a signal.
 Managing your audio devices: The Linksys phone becomes the default
audio device when you plug in the base station. Because your other
audio does not play through the phone, you won’t be able to hear any
audio (other than a Skype call) unless you unplug it.
These phones are small enough to hide themselves under pillows and
beneath papers. Ours buried itself under a mounting pile of chapter drafts. 
So we just pressed the magic pager button on the base station, and our
Linksys Skype phone started singing up a storm. We followed the music 
right to the unit. (If only everything else we lose would do the same thing,
we’d probably have a lot more free time.)
Getting the best of both worlds: 
Your phones are one!
The Philips VoIP321 Skype phone for Windows 2000 or XP actually does
double duty. It is an Internet phone and a regular phone in the same handset
(see Figure 11-7). A base station connects to both a phone jack and a USB
port at the same time. You can switch back and forth between services by
pressing a button: specifically, a Skype button for making Skype calls and a
Call button to get a dial tone. Calling couldn’t be more convenient.
The Philips VoIP321 has all the standard features of a wireless telephone,
including a mute feature, speakerphone, and headset jack. When you use the
Skype features, you can make voice calls, but you can’t see video or pictures
and you can’t chat, transfer files, or send SMS (text) messages. Although the
phone’s display is not in color, the backlighting and large, clear letters make
for easy reading. And you won’t need a magnifying glass to read this phone
panel. So whether you’re using a landline or a Skype line, this phone gives
you the same solid experience.
Installation for the Philips VoIP321 is a snap. The Setup Wizard does all the
work and puts a shortcut icon on your desktop after installation. Here’s just
one hint: When the installer asks you to press HERE to set the audio prefer-
ence, it literally means the word HERE on the installer screen, and not the
Next button. The audio preference is set to recognize the phone by default.
200

After installation, follow these instructions to activate the phone and make 
a call:
1. Click the shortcut icon (which looks like a white handset on a blue
background, with the words Philips USB along the edge) to activate
the VoIP321, if it isn’t already started. 
A small icon appears on your desktop tray when VoIP321 is active, so
you’ll know whether you need to launch it.
2. Start your Skype program.
The Skype Security API makes its appearance and asks whether it’s okay
to let the Philips Phone work with the Skype software.
3. Select the radio button next to Allow This Program to Use Skype. Click
OK if you plan to use the phone all the time.
Otherwise, you can decide every time you power up Skype by choosing
the Allow This Application to Use Skype, But Ask Again in the Future
option.
4. To make a Skype call, press the easy-to-see red S button on the handset.
You see your contacts displayed along with their online status.
Figure 11-7:

Chapter 11: Spicing Things Up with Great Gadgets and Add-Ons

5. Press the scroll key up or down to a contact’s name and press the Call
button (the one with the little green telephone on it) or the red Skype
button; either one will connect you to your buddy.
You can make a SkypeOut call as well, but you still have to put in the
country code by pressing and holding 0 (zero) on the dial pad to get the
plus sign (+) before the country code. Then press the red Skype button
to call.
6. To make a telephone call the old-fashioned way, dial the number,
press the Call button (the button with a green handset on it), and talk.
On this phone, you can also press the Call button, and then dial, and
then talk. You’re not penalized for getting the steps mixed up.
Basic calling seems pretty straightforward, but the following operations make
using this phone system a bit more interesting:
 Call waiting: Suppose you are on a Skype call and someone tries to
reach you on your regular line. Not a problem. A special call-waiting tone
is played. When you hear it, you can end the Skype call and still take the
landline call.
 Conference calling: You can use your VoIP321 with your Skype service
to conference with two other skypers. Dialing one skyper, press the Call
button (which becomes a Hold button when you have a Skype call in
progress), dial the other skyper, and then press the Conference button
to join the three callers. This experience is more of a traditional tele-
phone conference, but within the Skype service.
 Multiple handsets: Because the Philips VoIP321 works with up to four
handsets, you can have multiple Skype calls going at the same time on
different handsets. But you can’t have multiple handsets making differ-
ent calls on the same landline simultaneously. The handsets are treated
as extensions by the landline and as separate phones by Skype.
Getting Clearer Communications
You can operate Skype just fine from your desktop computer with its built-in
speakers and microphone. But you may want to improve on the sound qual-
ity, ensure privacy, or otherwise free yourself from the basic setup’s limita-
tions. Headsets (both wired and wireless) can help you keep the noise down
and bolster privacy, whereas adding a speakerphone can produce a clearer
voice transmission on both ends.
202
Part III: Calling All Seasoned Skypers 

And don’t worry that adding extra gadgets will tie you down to your com-
puter. Fortunately, you don’t have to give up the habit of wandering from
desk to refrigerator and back again while on a Skype call. You can simply clip
on a wireless Bluetooth headset, voice activate your calls, or plug in a noise
cancellation speaker phone while you’re getting yet another piece of that
coconut cream pie necessary to fuel all those Skype conversations.
Okay, we’ve made the process of adding accessories to your Skype operation
seem effortless, and in many ways, it is. But some USB (Universal Serial Bus)
devices should not be connected during installation until the software install
program directs you to plug them into the computer. Make sure that you
check installation instructions before you begin. The device you’re hooking up
may not work properly if you don’t complete the steps in the correct order.
We’d also like to point out the following helpful tips for avoiding potential
problems when hooking up headsets or other accessories:
 Install device drivers before plugging in the USB device: After device
drivers are installed, plug in your USB headset first, before you launch
Skype. Otherwise, your audio input and output may not come through
the headphones properly.
 On Apple Macintosh, use a USB headset/microphone: Apple computers
have mini-plug headphone jacks, but external audio input is either digi-
tal or USB based, so the USB headset/microphone combinations work
best. All Macintosh computers have built-in microphones, so you can
get away with using the computer mic and your iPod earplugs in a pinch.
Hearing better: Ready, headset, go!
Headsets help keep your conversations private because only the headset
wearer (you) can hear what the caller is saying. And having a headset with a
mute button adds an additional measure of privacy because you can push it
to speak freely with someone in the same room without your Skype partner
hearing what you say.
Voice echoing is another potential problem that can occur if one party 
doesn’t use a headset while on Skype. Echoes happen when the computer’s
built-in microphone picks up the voice coming out of the computer’s speaker.
The caller hears his or her own voice projected back into the computer
microphone. It’s hard to talk when you keep hearing yourself repeating some-
thing a second later. Headsets and microphones help eliminate this feedback
loop by putting a little barrier between the microphone and speaker.
203
Chapter 11: Spicing Things Up with Great Gadgets and Add-Ons

Some headsets to consider adding to your Skype setup include the following:
 The Premium Headset 350 from Logitech (see Figure 11-8): This head-
set connects to your computer through a USB port. Besides volume and
mute controls, the headset features noise cancellation and a microphone
that pivots out of the way if you just want to listen to music or play a
computer game.
 The Internet Chat Headset (see Figure 11-9): Also from Logitech, the
Internet Chat Headset is among the variety of headsets that use mini-
plug input into the microphone and headphone jacks in the computer.
Some of these models also have volume control.
 The Lightweight Computer Headset Model 33-1187 from RadioShack
(see Figure 11-10): This headset doesn’t have any bells and whistles. It
uses mini-plugs and is an inexpensive but dependable choice.

Improving voice quality 
with a speakerphone
If you’re on the go, wedded to your laptop, and wedded to Skype, then you’re
bound to get hooked on the Polycom Communicator C100S speakerphone for
Skype, as shown in Figure 11-11. The most common first comments we hear
from people who use this device is “If I closed my eyes, I would swear you’re
in the room standing next to me.”
This is a speakerphone that you don’t have to hover over, and you don’t have
to worry about a hiss or crackle during the conversation. You can carry on a
Skype conversation easily from across the living room. The person you are
speaking to would admit that the volume drops a little but that he or she still
can hear you very clearly.
Many of us have endured speakerphones that handle noise cancellation by
silencing the person who is not doing the talking and thereby eliminating the
echo feedback looping from the speakers to the microphone. This noise can-
cellation method prevents two people from talking at the same time, which
can prove frustrating to a caller trying to get a word in edgewise when the
other person launches into motor-mouth mode.
The Polycom speakerphone handles echo cancellation flawlessly and lets
both parties talk at the same time without being cancelled out.
206

Saved by the headset
Imagine this scenario: Jack plugs in his head-
phones into the computer’s USB port, positions
them over his ears, and takes a deep breath. He
launches Skype, selects Jill from the Skype
Contacts list, and clicks the call button. His
heart skips a beat as he hears her voice, a voice
so soft that he raises the volume to maximum on
his headset soft volume control. Nervously, he
asks her to the prom. 
Just as she starts to speak, Jack’s Mom calls
loudly for Jack to help set the table for dinner.
Jack blushes and quickly hits the mute button
on his headset. Now he can hear Jill’s reply
without letting Jill hear all that noise. After all,
asking someone to the prom is tough enough
without being embarrassed by Mom’s yelling in
the background.
In this case, adding new technology to a Skype
operation can be kind to nervous teenage boys
summoning all their courage to ask a girl out.

The C100S is simple to operate. After the initial software installation, just plug
it into the USB port. The Communicator should automatically become the
default audio device (mic and speaker) for your system and it works with just
five buttons:
 The Pick-up/Hang-up button: Pressing the Pick-up/Hang-up button (on
the right) lets you answer an incoming Skype call or hang-up a call in
progress. Additionally, you can use this button to launch a call with
whichever Skype buddy you have highlighted on your list.
 The large center microphone mute button: This appears as a micro-
phone with a slash running through it; see Figure 11-11. Pressing this
button lights up a bright-red LED to let you (and anyone glancing at the
unit) know that you can speak privately.
 The two volume buttons at the top and bottom: Look for buttons with
speaker icons in loud and soft mode; see Figure 11-11). These buttons on
the speakerphone panel allow you to adjust the speaker volume up or
down while keeping the microphone volume constant.
 The blue Skype button (the S on the left): This button enables you to
launch Skype with just a push when the phone is plugged into a com-
puter running Windows XP. If Skype is already running, pushing the
button brings the Skype window to the foreground.

Chapter 11: Spicing Things Up with Great Gadgets and Add-Ons

At the time of this writing, no software is available for the Mac OS X
(although Polycom plans to add Mac driver support in the very near future).
Absent Mac OS X drivers, if you plug the device in without loading any soft-
ware or drivers, the Mac operating system does recognize the speakerphone
as a standard USB audio device (mics and speaker). Therefore, the volume
controls are functional, as are the mute button and the red LED indicator
light. If you have an Intel-Mac with Boot Camp (which allows you to run
Windows XP) installed, the speakerphone behaves exactly as it does on any
Windows-based PC.
The unit has built-in left and right microphones. Whether the family is gather-
ing on Sunday to sing “Happy Birthday” to your grandfather a thousand miles
away, or you’re joined by half a dozen business associates spread around a
conference table, no one will feel alienated from the conversation.
Everything about the Polycom speakerphone is well thought out, and here
are some features worth noting:
 The phone has a 3.5mm mini-plug jack: This lets you carry on a private
conversation using the ear buds from your iPod or any other stereo
headphone without disturbing your associates in the office cubicles 
next to yours.
 The speakerphone comes with a diagnostic software application: This
allows you to verify the operation of all buttons (plus the green and red
LED lights), test the sound input from each of the left and right micro-
phones, and generate a set of test sounds from the speaker.
 The USB cable tucks neatly under the flip-open back panel used to
angle the speakerphone: A little opening in the side of the panel enables
you to close the panel and lay the unit flat on a table top, without pinch-
ing the USB cable as it is connected to your computer.
Adding Bluetooth for 
Wireless Connections
You may love the privacy and clarity that headsets provide, but you may also
hate that feeling of confinement you get from their wired connection. One
way to cut the cord from the computer to your ear is to use a Bluetooth-
enabled headset. Bluetooth is a specification (IEEE 802.15.1) for wireless per-
sonal area networks using an unlicensed radio frequency. (See the sidebar
“What is Bluetooth and how did it get that odd name?” for just a little more
208
Part III: Calling All Seasoned Skypers 

info on this technology.) Bluetooth-enabled headsets look something like the
odd implement jutting out of Lieutenant Uhura’s ear on the original “Star
Trek” series. In fact, the name Uhura means freedom in Swahili, so it’s clear
that she took her wireless communication seriously!
Look Ma, no wires
Bluetooth allows devices to communicate over a short range (usually easily
covering the important desk-to-refrigerator distance) of about 30 feet. Some
computers have Bluetooth built in, but you can add this feature externally if
your computer doesn’t. When you add it externally, you go through some
software setup and a little bit of configuring to get the Bluetooth gadgets to
link together. But after they do, it’s wire-free sailing.
Motorola produces a number of wireless devices built into glasses, hats, 
jackets, helmets, and headsets. The device Motorola manufactures to use
with Skype is the Wireless Internet Calling Kit Headset and Bluetooth USB 
PC Adapter, shown in Figure 11-12. The headset is a little over-the-ear clip-on
unit for use with a PC. The clip part swivels out so that you can easily put it
on and tuck the speaker part in close against your ear canal. The more com-
plicated part is installing and syncing the Bluetooth USB Adapter.

To assist you with loading drivers for Bluetooth communication, Motorola
provides one of those mini-CDs with its tiny headset (seems to be a theme
here). If you’re afraid to load this little CD in your computer, you can make a
duplicate on a full-sized CD, and it works perfectly. We tend to do this (make
a full-sized duplicate) when we’re loading software onto an Intel-based Mac
running Windows. We’re afraid we’ll lose the little disks into the slot-loading
CD player.
Follow the steps to Bluetooth liberation
When you install the drivers from the Motorola CD, the Initial Bluetooth
Configuration Wizard walks you through the process, but you still have to
make some entries and choices:
1. When prompted, select Headset from the list of devices you want to
connect wirelessly to your computer and click Next.
If you use your wireless headset continuously, make sure that you check
the box to start it automatically. Otherwise, you’ll have to go through a
synchronization procedure.
2. In the same dialog box, choose to have a secure connection and 
click OK.
The Bluetooth activates and searches for a connected device. If you are
using the Motorola headset, an icon with the model number appears in 
a list of connectable devices.
3. Choose your headset from the list of devices and click Next.
4. When prompted, enter the code that comes with your device in the
PIN Code text box to pair up the computer and headset (as shown in
Figure 11-13) and click Initiate Pairing.
This is a crucial step to activate the headset-to-computer connection.
After you complete the installation of the Motorola H500, you need to press 
a button on the unit and hold for a few seconds to have it connect to the
Bluetooth Adapter. A lovely circular blue light on the headset shines continu-
ously after the computer discovers the device and the two shake hands.
While the connection is active, the Bluetooth earpiece enables you to hear
any sounds coming from your computer: all the alerts, any music you play,
and, of course, your Skype conversations. A teensy, but effective, microphone
picks up your voice and minimal background noise, which is a very nice fea-
ture if your office, like ours, is in the pathway of four hospital emergency
rooms, a police academy, a fire station, and rush-hour traffic.

Bluetooth “Mac”inations!
If you want a wireless, over-the-ear headset that is fit for double duty — good
for both Macintosh computers and cellular phones — you might try the
Plantronics Explorer 320 Bluetooth Headset. This unit is designed for use
with cellular phones equipped with Bluetooth, but it is surprisingly easy to
connect to a Macintosh if you want to make hands-free Skype calls. Of course,
your Macintosh must come with Bluetooth installed because this wireless
device does not come with a USB transmitter (and doesn’t need one).
Bluetooth is a fairly standard feature on current Macintosh models, so if you
have recently made a purchase, you should be good to go!
To connect the Plantronics Explorer 320 to a Mac, follow these steps:
1. Click the blue apple in the upper-left corner of your desktop.
Choose System Preferences from the drop-down list.
2. Double-click the Bluetooth icon.
The icon is blue and has a white, geometric “B” figure. If you don’t know
what the Bluetooth icon looks like, look at the geometric icon appearing
near the top-right corner of Figure 11-13.
3. Take your well-charged Plantronics 320 and press the power button
for six to ten seconds (there is only one button).
The headset will start flashing red and blue.
4. Choose 320 Plantronics from the list of devices; then, click the Set Up
New Device Button.
The Bluetooth Setup Assistant opens.

5. Click Continue.
6. From the list provided, select the radio button next to the word
Headset and click Continue (again).
The Setup Assistant will search for your Headset.
7. When the device name appears in the window, click Continue 
(yes, again).
On the next screen, the computer makes contact and gathers information
about your headset.
8. When the computer finishes, the Continue button becomes active;
click Continue.
9. Enter a passkey to pair with your headset as prompted and click
Continue.
The passkey information comes with each headset’s documentation.
The computer contacts your headset, and you are ready to make your
wireless calls.
10. Click Quit to close the Bluetooth Setup Assistant.
Expanding Your Options 
with Software Add-Ons
Skype comes with many options, but you can greatly expand its native func-
tions by using additional software. You may already have some software that
you can use in conjunction with Skype. For example, Macintosh computers
come with speech recognition software that you can train to work with Skype
commands. And some programs that record audio for podcasting can also
record your Skype conversations and voice messages.
212
Part III: Calling All Seasoned Skypers 
What is Bluetooth and how did it get that odd name?
Bluetooth refers to short-range (about 30 feet)
wireless technology. You can wirelessly con-
nect a headset, mouse, and keyboard to a com-
puter, link two laptops to each other, or pair a
PDA (personal digital assistant) with a computer
and other PDAs.
Bluetooth technology was developed by the
Ericsson organization in the 1990s. Because of
this company’s Scandinavian heritage, the name
Bluetooth is particularly significant. Bluetooth is
the English translation of the name of a tenth
century Danish King, Harald Blatand, known for
unifying Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. So, if
King Bluetooth connected countries, connect-
ing devices should be a piece of cake.

Your voice is my command! Getting your
Macintosh computer to listen and obey
Macintosh computers have built-in speech-recognition software installed on
every machine. Speech recognition is yet another liberating technology that
frees you from your keyboard by replacing keystrokes with vocal commands.
When you turn on this feature, you have access to a long list of speakable
items (words that your computer recognizes as input), including commands
that let you open and quit applications, request the date and time informa-
tion, switch applications, and shut down your machine. You can make some
commands application specific, and you can make others work no matter
what program you’re running.
Activating your Mac’s speech recognition
You can pair the Macintosh speech recognition feature with Skype by down-
loading and installing a set of commands (Speakables for Skype) that are
scripted just for Skype. But before you install Speakables for Skype, or any
other speech-recognition scripts, you must activate the speech-recognition
feature on your Mac. To do so, follow these steps:
1. Select the blue apple icon in the upperleft corner of your screen.
From the drop-down list, choose System Preferences.
The System Preferences window appears. This window displays all the
system preferences as icons. Notice the microphone icon labeled Speech.
2. Click the Speech icon (the microphone).
The Speech dialog box pops up.
3. Select On to activate Speakable Items, as shown in Figure 11-14.
4. With your microphone of choice showing in the Microphone drop-
down menu, click the Calibrate button.
5. Calibrate your voice by speaking the provided phrases into the
chosen microphone when prompted.
Each phrase, when recognized, will flicker in acknowledgment. You can
adjust a volume slider if the computer is not recognizing your speech. 
6. Select an option next to Listening Method.
You can activate speech recognition continuously or when a key is
pressed. Letting the computer listen to everything — especially in a noisy
environment — is probably not a good idea. You never know what sound
will trigger a command, so we recommend that you keep the default set-
ting where the computer listens only while the Esc key is pressed.
213
Chapter 11: Spicing Things Up with Great Gadgets and Add-Ons

After speech recognition is up and running, you can test it. Press the Esc key
and say one of the built-in commands out loud. For example, try “What time
is it?”, “Tell me a joke,” or “Open iTunes.” If you’re not sure of what com-
mands are available, you can:
 Click the arrow at the bottom of the floating microphone icon that
appears when you activate speech recognition: The floating icon is
round and displays a microphone image, the name of the key you have
to push to activate Speakable Items, and an arrow for additional speech
commands.
 Find more commands: Open the Speech preferences, choose
Commands, and then click the Open Speakable Items Folder button.
 Find all existing items the computer should recognize: If speech recog-
nition is working properly, just press the Esc key and say, “Show me
what to say.” This command brings up the window with all the existing
items that the computer should recognize, and you don’t have to hunt
for the right folder with the right commands.
 Try some of the listed items: After you’ve found the Speakable Items list
in the Speech folder, try some of the listed items.
Sometimes you need to say items a couple of times to get the recognition
started, but after it works, using voice commands can be addictive. Watching
someone tell a computer what to do is rather baffling to casual observers, but
if you’re used to walking down a crowded street speaking into an ear-mounted
cell phone, those strange looks shouldn’t bother you a bit.

Adding Skype’s speakable items
With speech recognition active, tested, and working, you are ready to down-
load and install Speakables for Skype scripts. These scripts are available at
www.speakables.com/. Follow the directions on this Web site to download
and then follow these steps to make the connection to Skype:
1. Click the Speakables for Skype shortcut icon installed on your desktop.
A Speakables for Skype dialog box containing a table for adding contacts
and commands opens, as shown in Figure 11-15, and Skype launches.
2. Click OK in the security screen that pops up to tell you that another
application wants to use Skype.
3. In the Speakables for Skype main menu, choose File➪Refresh Contacts
and then click Save to save your changes.
All your contacts are now imported into a drop-down list in the
Speakables for Skype program.
4. Select a contact and type a voice command.
In the Speakables for Skype window, note that you have two columns:
Skype Contact on the left and Commands on the right. Select a contact
from the Skype Contact list on the left and, under Command Phrase on
the right, enter the voice command you want to say when you make a
Skype call (see Figure 11-15).
Your calling command can be anything from the mundane “Call Vincent”
to the edgier “Yo! Vinnie.”
5. Press Enter when your command is finished; then, start telling Skype
what to do.
After all, it’s nice to know someone is listening to you.

Chapter 11: Spicing Things Up with Great Gadgets and Add-Ons

You can make any phrase a speakable item in a snap. Activate speech recog-
nition on your Mac by pressing the Esc key (after turning on speech recogni-
tion in your System Preferences). Then, select a file or document name, or
even a URL, and say, “Make this speakable.” A dialog box appears, inviting
you to add a command.
Try this:
1. Highlight the URL www.skype.com.
2. Press the Esc key and say, “Make this item speakable.”
A dialog box appears, saying, Go to “www.skype.com” When I say
(fill in the speech prompt in the text field).
3. Enter the word or phrase you want to say to go to this Web site in the
text box provided.
For example, enter the word skype.
4. Press the Esc key to activate voice recognition.
5. Hold down the Esc key and say “skype.”
Your browser opens up to that Web site.
Congratulations, you’ve just added another voice command!
Bluetooth headsets do not work with speakable items on the Macintosh. The
alternative wireless solution is a Plantronics CS50-USB headset, which uses a
different wireless technology and has a range of up to 200 feet.
Speakables for Skype has recently released a version of its software for
Windows. Instructions and a free demo are available at www.speakables.
com/Skype_Windows.htm.
Recording your hits(or just 
a few memory joggers)
You never know when you may replay a conversation in your mind — trying
to remember all the details you forgot to write down, all the jokes you wish
you could repeat, and all the family stories from your grandmother you want
to capture. Instead of relying solely on your memory, you can find a number
of ways to record Skype conversations using software, hardware, and a com-
bination of both. We’ve included a small sampling of the possibilities here,
but the Web is filled with tempting demos that are worth exploring. 
216
Part III: Calling All Seasoned Skypers 

For example, we suggest checking out the following Web sites for starters:
www.hotrecorder.com
www.podproducer.net/en/index.html
www.applian.com/freecorder/index.php
www.scodor.com
To get the latest scoop on recording applications, Skype has its own section
for current programs (both tried and untried) at:
http://share.skype.com/directory/messaging/
If you’re lucky enough to have a robust Skype Contacts list filled with fasci-
nating, informative, clever, and scintillating conversationalists, you may want
to install voice-recording software to preserve the witty repartee. Of course,
remember that you should record conversations only with permission from
your contacts. Recording conversations without all parties knowing may be
illegal and is certainly impolite.
The following list outlines a few voice-recording products:
 Call Recorder: This product — an inexpensive add-on you can down-
load from Ecamm Network at www.ecamm.com/mac/callrecorder —
is designed for the Macintosh platform and makes your Skype calls into
QuickTime movies. After you install Call Recorder, a Recording dialog
box (shown in Figure 11-16) shows up right in the Skype application, so
you don’t have to open a second program. Call Recorder is simple to
operate and gives you handy options:
• You can choose to record automatically, which is nice if you 
tend to forget to activate the record button, or you can start the
session manually. You can have the recording controls visible all
the time so that capturing important conversations on the fly is
easy. Also, the quality of the recording can be set at high, medium,
or low.
• Call Recorder creates QuickTime files and records separate 
audio tracks for incoming and outgoing voices. If you want to 
work with this file in an audio-editing program, you have a little
more control than with one-track recording solutions. If you have
the QuickTime Pro software, you can quickly get each track indi-
vidually from the movie file using the extract button in the movie
properties window. You can also use QuickTime Pro to export the
file to another format.
217
Chapter 11: Spicing Things Up with Great Gadgets and Add-Ons

 HotRecorder for VoIP: This recording software for Windows 
computers works with Skype as well as other applications to 
capture audio. You can find and purchase this program at www.
hotrecorder.com. The files created by this program are .epl files,
which is a proprietary format used only with HotRecorder. In order 
to replay those files in other programs, you must convert them.
HotRecorder provides a utility that you can use to save these audio 
files as MP3s, OGG, or WAV files.
 SAM (short for Skype Answering Machine): This is a Skype 
recording plugin for the Windows platform available at http://
kishkish.com/sam. SAM not only records conversations but also
stores and organizes the recordings by time or participant. You can 
configure SAM as a regular answering machine that greets your Skype
callers in the same way that a landline answering machine does.
With SAM, all your messages are stored digitally with names, date, 
time, and length of call for each contact. You can respond to these 
messages with Skype’s callback feature right from the Message pane.
This program offers a cost-effective way to build in a simple message
center for a small business.
For larger businesses in need of recording, tracking, voicemail, and confer-
ence calling and Skypecast recording, the two major programs of choice are
Pamela and Skylook, both of which we cover in Chapter 9.

Part III: Calling All Seasoned Skypers 

Podcasting your Skype personality 
to the world
Skype is a rich environment for producing podcast content. As a step up 
from casually recording a Skype conversation (to help recall meeting details),
some ambitious skypers are producing programs for broadcast (for step-by-
step instructions, see Chapter 14). You can create podcasts of interviews,
poetry readings, performances, news reports, and conferences over Skype.
Skypecasts, the large-scale audio conferences posted on the Skype Web site,
can be captured, edited, and converted into podcasts as well (see Chapter 14
for much more about Skypecasts).
Software programs such as Call Recorder, HotRecorder, Audio Hijack, SAM,
Pamela, and Skylook are all capable of providing audio content for a podcast.
However, some veterans of the podosphere prefer more rigorous recording
equipment, and podcast studios can get pretty geeky. Getting truly clean
audio is a tricky business, especially when your environment is virtual.
Podcasting For Dummies (also from Wiley Publishing) is a good resource for
information about scores of gadgets and techniques for producing podcasts.
This book even has an overview of equipment and editing software that’s
useful for getting the best audio production from Skype.
Transcribing your Skype recordings
So, you’re busy recording anyone who will let you capture a conversation and
you’re filling up folders with MP3s of interviews, meetings, stories, and plans
on every subject. Some of those audio files may be a great source of informa-
tion to have in written form. For example, much of the research we did while
writing this book exists as audio files of recorded Skype calls. As much as we
would like to play our audio recordings for you, the practical requirement is
that these recordings become paper and ink. To make this transformation, we
had to convert what we recorded to what you’re reading.
Listening to hours of Skype recordings while typing out a transcript was a
huge job made easier by the wonderful software program Transcriber, shown
in Figure 11-17 and available at no cost from http://trans.sourceforge.
net/en/presentation.php.
219
Chapter 11: Spicing Things Up with Great Gadgets and Add-Ons

This program’s transcription features allow you to
 Import MP3 files: Think about all those Skype conversations you’ve
been recording. You can export your transcriptions to files as text or
HTML.
 Create labels: Labels can be based on the names of individual speakers.
These names are incorporated into the timeline.
 Create new sections: You can segment audio portions and sync them
with written files.
 Zoom and telescope the timeline: This feature enables you to jump to
any part of a long recording very quickly and easily.
Transcriber shaves hours off the task of transcribing long audio sessions,
organizing text by topic and speaker, and publishing the transcript in print 
or on the Web (for more information, see Chapter 14).
Video and animation add-ons
Third-party developers are tapping into Skype videoconferencing and forever
changing the way we look at ourselves. Literally. Avatar animation products —
for example, Talking Headz, Festoon, and Logitech’s Quickcam Fusion — walk

220
Part III: Calling All Seasoned Skypers 

us through the process of becoming dinosaurs, pumped-up soccer players,
femme fatales, emotional emoticons, and, our favorite, a hairy eyeball with an
attitude. Each of these software packages helps you create your cartoon soul
mate and show your silly side to the world.
Avatars are Web-based animated characters; virtual stand-ins for you, me, 
or anyone who wants to create an online personality ready to mix it up with
other available avatars (see Chapter 5 for more about avatars). The idea
behind using avatars with Skype is to play with video conversations, add
character to instant messages, and just have fun in a new way on a new play-
ground. These software packages work closely with Skype video messaging
and launch at the same time you start up Skype.
The avatar animations are cleverly developed. When you speak or record a
message, the avatar mouths your words quite convincingly. Some avatars
respond to mouse tracking, with their eyes and heads following the cursor as
it moves. Some have added personality routines, sighs, sneezes, and rolling
eyes designed to elicit a response from a viewer. The following three avatar
animation programs have unique offerings, so we recommend investigating
each one:
 Gizmoz Talking Headz (www.gizmoz.com): Encourages you to build
your avatar image from scratch and makes no pretense about keeping 
it serious. The characters, gags, jokes, sounds, and animations are 
indescribable, so visit this avatar farm and see for yourself.
 Festoon (www.festooninc.com): Provides for video conferencing with
up to five people (a very practical side of this product) each transmit-
ting from their own webcam. Festoon also provides video cutouts called
Eye Candy, which are still pictures with gaps where the faces should be
so that you can insert your own image.
 Logitech QuickCam Fusion’s Video Effects software
(www.logitech.com): Maps a still picture of your face to your chosen
avatar to coordinate speech, or if you want, you can become a talking
shark. As does Festoon, QuickCam Fusion sometimes uses webcams.
Guess Who’s Calling? Customizing 
Caller ID
Just because you can talk to the whole world for free doesn’t mean that you
want to answer every Skype call. Sometimes you just don’t want to talk to
your lovable but endlessly chatty friend. So, a little call screening is in order.
221
Chapter 11: Spicing Things Up with Great Gadgets and Add-Ons

Of course, Skype has a built-in caller ID. You can see the user name and pic-
ture (if one is posted), of each caller. But our eyes are not always on the com-
puter screen, and it seems a little retro to have to run across the room to
answer a Skype call just as we do for landlines (remember those?). Luckily, for
every problem, no matter how small, there is an enterprising and fun solution.
Know who’s calling (and no peeking!)
You can customize caller announcements with a software product plugin for
Skype running on Windows called Wizztones (www.wizztones.com). With
Wizztones, each contact can have a different ringtone (see Figure 11-18). You
can keep any of the Skype ringtones, record your own, pick from a list, or
even have a custom ringtone messages synthesized. To synthesize a custom
ringtone, you upload a message (in text) and Wizztones will digitize it and
add it to your messages list instantly, without leaving the Wizztones software
interface! Wizztones also provides standard phrases (in addition to ring-
tones) to announce each caller — just in case you can’t come up with a
snappy phrase to announce that Uncle Ralph is calling!
If you want to use Wizztones to change a ringtone, follow these steps:
1. Click the Wizztones icon (which looks like a blue planet with two big
white Z’s inside) in your Windows task menu bar.
The Wizztones options window opens (see Figure 11-18).
2. Select a contact in the Skype contacts list.
3. Select the Other Available Ringtones option from the ringtones
window.
4. Select the ringtone you want to associate with your chosen contact.
If the contact is your mom, you can select Your Mom Is Calling from the
ringtone list. Of course, you can also choose The Boss Is Calling as her
ringtone. (But beware, ringtones can be very revealing.)
Figure 11-18:

222
Part III: Calling All Seasoned Skypers 

If you want to create your own ringtone phrases, you can do that, too. Select
the Synthesize a New Wizztone option, enter the text to be synthesized in the
text field when prompted, and click the little recording button to change the
text to speech. Just sync the phrase with your contact, and when Mom calls,
Skype announces, “Uh-oh, this is a call I can’t refuse,” or whatever phrase you
choose to let you know what you’re in for.
Creating your own caller announcements
without downloading a thing!
Skyping on a Macintosh computer gives you a few cool built-in features for
customizing sound input and output. One that works beautifully with Skype
pulls in your contact user name information and transforms text to speech,
with no typing on your part. Just accessing Skype preferences taps into this
Mac utility, and you can use it to create personalized caller announcements
(see Figure 11-19).
Getting Skype to announce a caller with a unique phrase of your choosing is
simple. All you need to do is follow these steps:
1. Launch Skype.
2. In the Skype menu, choose Skype➪Preferences➪Notifications.
3. From the Events pop-up list, choose Incoming Call.
4. Click to activate the Speak Text field.
The default phrase “You have an incoming call from “@”!” appears in the
window. There is no need to enter a name. When you get a call from the
chosen contact, somehow, magically, the “@” symbol is replaced with
your contact’s name.
5. If you want, type over the text in the Speak Text field (just be careful
not to type over or replace the “@”! portion of the text).
So, instead of hearing only “You have an incoming call from Loren,” you
can add to it, making it “You have an incoming call from Loren. That’s
the best news I’ve had all day!”
When you edit this incoming caller message text, the announcement changes
for all your contacts, so it’s wise not to be too specific when crafting the per-
fect announcement.
223
Chapter 11: Spicing Things Up with Great Gadgets and Add-Ons

You can add this feature to all your contacts at the same time. In a busy
office, or when you are facing a deadline, you may want to be notified imme-
diately if your client is available, is calling, or is sending you a file. The basic
ringtone only gives you the information that someone wants your attention.
When you hear a name, you have a heads-up on what to say. These kinds of
personalized announcements can skyrocket your productivity.
The following announcements are among those that can be customized in
Macintosh events:
 Your contact “@” is available.
 You have an incoming call from “@”!
 Message from “@”.
 You have an instant message from “@”!
 You have received an authorization request from “@”!
 You have received a list of contacts from “@”!
 You have received a file from “@”!
 File transfer with “@” is completed.
 File transfer with “@” has failed.
Finding codes with the 
long-distance widget
Widgets are handy Macintosh computer shortcuts to scores of applications.
Click the widget icon and a widget dashboard appears. You can add, move,
rearrange, and download widgets of all sorts. Calendar widgets, stock market
widgets, webcam widgets, newsfeed widgets — there’s a widget for every
inclination, personality, and taste. So, appropriately for a Skype book, there is
a Skype Widget, as shown in Figure 11-20.
Figure 11-19:

ments on a

224
Part III: Calling All Seasoned Skypers 

The Skype Widget has a field to put in a SkypeOut number. If you are not sure
of how to dial a long-distance number, the widget is very helpful. Say that you
want to call Brazil. You know the main number but not the country code. The
Skype Widget lets you pick a country from a list and then provides the right
symbol and code for that call. After you put in the country, the calling rate
appears to let you know how much this call costs. Click the phone to dial the
number and activate Skype. Your Skype software opens and places the call.
Shopping at the One-Stop Skype Shop
Combing the Internet for gadgets is an awful lot of fun. But if you want an 
efficient way to deck out your personal Skype Center, you can log on to
Skype.com and click the Shop button. An online catalogue features phones,
webcams, headsets, speakerphones, and other Skype accessories. Skype
tests the products listed on the Web site and certifies that they work prop-
erly with Skype. Those products that are officially approved have a Skype
Certified seal of approval.
Skype also posts a developers forum, http://share.skype.com/
directory, where you can find loads of accessories, software, services,
video and animation add-ons, enterprise software, messaging solutions, 
plugins, and even an entire section on everything for Skype from Japan. 
Many of the software and plugin offerings are free downloads, and each 
product is followed by a lively forum of product reviews.
You’ll find a wonderful sense of playfulness within this section of the Skype
site. Most of the products are not officially Skype Certified, so you’re on your
own here, but these products extend Skype in some of the most unusual,
adventurous, and productive ways. It’s worth combing through the descrip-
tions and reviews, and even to take a chance and download some plugins.
There are some very cool surprises here.
We are on the constant lookout for new and interesting gadgets, doodads,
plug-ins, and services you may want to explore. Have a look at our updates

Alice in Skypeland
While writing this chapter, we three authors felt
as though we’d fallen down the rabbit hole and
landed in the secret world of Skype gadgets.
The boxes full of wondrous goodies just kept on
coming — piling up in the corner of the living
room, spilling over with wires, manuals, batter-
ies, cradles, shipping peanuts, and excitement.
Every box was an adventure waiting to happen.
We opened each one, rolled up our sleeves, fur-
rowed our brows, plugged, configured, wired,
synced, called, pinged, paged, launched, saved,
sweated, and laughed. As we took yet another
item off our leaning Tower of Skype toys, we
called vendors (over Skype, of course) to ask
endless questions and received endlessly
patient answers. Our laptops lay on the break-
fast bar, the dining room table, the couch, and
the window seat as we moved from product to
product. We groaned when we were baffled
and whooped when we figured something out.
The living room has not quite recovered from

all that and skype in your pajamas — but just remember
to get dressed before that videoconference! This part
points you toward some of the myriad ways in which you
can put Skype to work for your business, saving money
while increasing productivity. We show you how Skype
can, for example, help you hold down travel costs, make
customer service easier and more responsive, and hold
videoconferences with one or even 500 people — the
latter at no extra cost beyond your Internet service.

eeping a business alive and thriving is no easy task. Aside from manag-
ing people, you have to control costs, think fast, and be equipped to
outperform your competitors. So what does this have to do with Skype, and
why might you want to consider “skypifying” your business? Although we
cover the features mentioned in this chapter in more depth elsewhere in the
book, we offer this chapter to concentrate on ways that Skype can assist you
in your day-to-day business tasks. Using Skype in your business amounts to
much more than just calling a person from one PC to another over the
Internet.
Also, if you do decide to seriously entertain the thought of “skypifying” 
your business, you need to be aware of the security concerns (unfounded!)
associated with Skype. This chapter also includes some general information
about how you can allay these fears from an IT (Information Technology) 
perspective. 
Skype in Your Business
If an important part of your business is communicating with other people,
whether for purchasing, connecting to your customers, or other ways, the
chances are pretty good that someone in your company is already using
Skype. According to the creators of Skype, roughly 30 percent of all Skype
users regularly use Skype in their business. No matter how you slice it, this
amounts to millions of people having adopted Skype as a standard business
tool. It behooves you to know a little more about what Skype can do for your
business, as well as how to control any risk or downside associated with
adopting the technology.

Be aware, however, that Skype is not intended to be a replacement for your
phone system. Here are some reasons:
 No emergency call capabilities: Skype cannot be used to call emergency
numbers such as 911.
 SkypeOut and SkypeIn calls don’t carry the same high fidelity experi-
enced with Skype-to-Skype calls: Although the sound quality of both
SkypeOut and SkypeIn keeps getting better with each new version of
Skype, these services still have a ways to go before catching up with 
regular Skype calls.
 Microphone-headsets or speakerphones are needed with Skype: Not
everybody is comfortable wearing headsets or using speakerphones.
There are dualphones that can send and receive regular phone calls and
Skype calls. They work well, but not everybody knows they exist.
 Answering an incoming call on Skype requires that a device be
turned on: Many people are in the habit of shutting off their computer 
at the close of a business day. This means that Voicemail needs to be
enabled. The good news is that when you sign up for SkypeIn, you auto-
matically get Skype Voicemail for free.
The passage of time and new Skype and VoIP technology are sure to over-
come these limitations.
Meanwhile, however, because you can’t replace your entire phone system
with Skype, why bother adopting it? Here are some reasons to consider:
 It’s not an either/or proposition: Skype enriches the communication
process by allowing you to do things not generally available on a tele-
phone. You can use Mood Messages (see Chapter 3). You can transfer
files (as explained in Chapter 6). You can combine audio conferencing
and text chats. You have video. All this points to a feature-rich system
that is remarkably inexpensive.
 Skype can save your business money: Many businesses that are service
oriented, such as consulting, can eliminate large portions of travel
expenses through the use of Skype and Web conferencing. The benefit
can amount to saving thousands of dollars per employee who travels.
 Thirty percent of all Skype users regularly use Skype in their busi-
ness: You don’t want to be left out in the cold when other businesses 
are using an effectively free technology to get ahead.

Part IV: The Professional Skyper 

Meeting Core Business Needs with Skype
All businesses have similar, although not identical, core needs. Among these
core needs are sharing documents, preserving privacy, controlling costs, and
marketing.
Sharing documents
Everybody is used to moving files around. We do it all the time as attach-
ments to emails. Whether sending files by email, file transfer protocol (FTP),
or some alternative means, the process is sometimes fraught with obstacles:
file size limitations, encrypted or executable files, and so on. Skype offers a
quick and expedient way to leap-frog over these challenges when you have to
get things done quickly.
Three aspects in particular are worth noting about file transfer on Skype:
 Ease and convenience: From an open chat window (see Chapter 6), you
can just drag one or more files from your desktop and drop them onto
the chat window.
 Security: With regular email, unless you specifically go through some
setup in advance, the files you transfer and receive over email are unen-
crypted. Many popular email systems won’t even let you send encrypted
ZIP files. Skype allows you by default to send files securely.
 No predetermined file size limit when transferring files: Although
Skype is not a speed demon with file transfer, it doesn’t complain about
file size. By comparison, many business email servers complain if
attachments are more than a couple of megabytes and prevent such
large files from being transferred.
Skype enables you to carry on a conversation while you are transferring
files over Skype. Keep in mind that you have multiple services (voice
and video versus file transfer) competing for a limited resource (your
network bandwidth). Skype audio trumps the Skype file transfer service.
To speed the file transfer, try hanging up temporarily so that your voice
and video transmissions don’t compete with file transfer. You don’t need
to close a Skype chat, though — it’s not a resource-intensive service. 
Preserving privacy
In a world in which hackers and competitors would love to unscrupulously
exploit your communications, protecting your business is imperative. With
Skype, you can conduct the audio and video portions of a Skype conversation,
231
Chapter 12: “Skypifying” Your Business

as well as text chats and file transfers, as encrypted sessions. This means 
that when you are carrying on a conversation in the middle of, say, Chicago’s
O’Hare International Airport on a conference call, your competitors can’t pry
into your information no matter how hard they sniff the packets. They can’t get
into your voice communications, file transfers, or chats. With regular phones,
however — both wireless and landline — privacy is not even an option!
If you are using SkypeOut, whether for a one-to-one conversation or on a
Skype conference call, or someone uses SkypeIn to reach you, the portion of
the communication going to and from the telephone is not encrypted.
A little padlock icon appears on the lower left portion of your Skype window
during the call, signifying that your call is being securely transmitted.
Managing costs
These days, who isn’t on a budget and trying to shave off a few dollars? At
the same time, it would be nice to expand your business communications
options. Because just about everybody is connected to the Internet, you can
use Skype in addition to your phone system as a communications platform
for a no-cost or low-cost solution.
To help you manage costs, Skype offers a service called Skype Business
Groups, which allows you to purchase Skype credit in bulk and apportion it 
to members of your business or even selected customers. Rather than tie up
large amounts of capital for specific resources for specific people, you can
allocate it where you need it, when you need it. To get started with it, go to the
Web site at https://secure.skype.com/groups and follow these steps.
1. Sign in using your Skype Name and password.
A Control Panel – Business Development Web page appears that allows
you to create groups, add users to those groups, and purchase Skype
credit for those groups.
2. Click the Create New Sub-Group link.
On the page that appears, enter a descriptive name for your group, such
as Sales Team, in the text input field and click the Create button.
3. Click the Add Users link.
A page opens on which you can add users to any of your groups.
4. Enter the Skype Names you want to add to a group and choose from
any of the groups you have created; then, click the Verify and Invite
Skype User Names button.
The Skype User Adding Results page appears and you receive a notice
such as the following: “You successfully invited Skype Name to your Skype
232
Part IV: The Professional Skyper 

Groups. Skype Name will shortly receive an email containing the invitation
details. They will need to accept the invitation by logging into My Account
(link provided in email) and accept or reject the invitation there.”
Of course, the Skype Name that appears in the message corresponds to
the one you enter. The invitees receive an email message inviting them
to join a Skype Group. To join, they follow the link on the indicated Web
page in the email, supplying their Skype Name and password to log in.
5. Purchase Skype Credit for the Group.
You have the option to add Skype credit manually for a group or use
what Skype calls the Auto Top-Up feature, which prevents Skype credit
for the members of your group from dipping below a dollar balance that
you set.
The principal advantage of Skype Groups is that you can centralize and 
more easily manage the purchase and use of Skype credits on an organization-
wide basis.
You don’t need to restrict your purchase of Skype credits to SkypeOut,
SkypeIn, and Skype Voicemail. Other services are available to your Skype
Group. For example, Skype offers a translation service on call 24 hours a day
so that you can conduct your business with your overseas business partners,
and you need Skype credit to use this service. If you have a team of people
negotiating a contract or supporting business operations, it’s more cost effi-
cient make the translation service available to everyone on your team than to
buy it separately for each individual.

business.
Marketing
One of the strongest revenue drivers in marketing is to be in touch with your
customers, both to speak to and listen to your target audience. Whether your
goal is social networking, broadcasting a message, or contacting individual
customers, Skype can help you to achieve your marketing objectives. The fol-
lowing sections describe some possibilities. (Also check out Chapter 16 for
ideas about using Skype to promote your business.) 
Hold a no-cost community gathering online
Reach a large audience by holding a Skypecast or conducting High Speed
Conferencing. (See Chapter 14 for more about Skypecasts; High Speed
Conferencing is described later in this chapter.)
233
Chapter 12: “Skypifying” Your Business

Here’s an example of what you can do through a Skypecast or High Speed
Conferencing. Pharmaceutical companies and health care providers often
engage in programs such as Direct to Consumer communications. These
organizations can use online audio conferencing as a catalyst for the public
to seek more in-depth information, including active dialogue with health care
providers about the benefits and risks of a prescription medicine or a new
clinical trial.
Stay connected with your customers and business associates
Skype equips you with an electronic way to hand out a business card: the
SkypeWeb button. This button creates a live link that you can post on a Web
site or include with an email signature block. A unique aspect of this link is
that it shows your “presence,” the Skype word for availability — which you
can tell Skype to change automatically. Imagine handing someone a business
card that changes its information when you are on vacation, out to lunch, or
in the office. SkypeWeb buttons are clever and useful marketing devices.
They can also be picked up by search engines because they are written in
HTML code, the language of the Internet.
The SkypeWeb button just looks like your Skype online status button as it
would appear on anyone’s Skype window who happens to have you listed as
a contact (see Figure 12-1). Also, the SkypeWeb button can be viewed and
used by anyone who has Web access and cares to reach you.
Figure 12-1:
A
SkypeWeb
button with
a “Skype
Me!” status.
234
Part IV: The Professional Skyper 

All you need to do is copy and paste a small piece of HTML code to Web
pages you post. After the page is placed on the Web and viewed by anyone,
the button is rendered to display your availability — for example, “Call me!”;
“Add me to Skype”; “Chat with me”; “View my profile”; “Leave me voicemail”;
or “Send me a file.” It’s a little magical. Sit at your desk, log on to Skype, and
anyone can cruise your Web site and catch you in the office.
To create your SkypeWeb button, go to www.skype.com/share/buttons/.
Have a global presence from your desktop
Using a Skype Mood Message (see Chapter 6), you can send out instant global
alerts to your Skype contacts. Simply post a short message next to your
name in your Skype window, and all your Skype contacts who have you on
their Contacts list will automatically see your message displayed next to your
name in their Skype Contacts window. When you change the message on your
machine, it changes on theirs. Neat, huh?
Maintain customer access at your fingertips with Skype
Your Skype Contacts list is not an island. It is easily bridged with your 
contacts in Microsoft Outlook. To find, and skype, anyone in your Outlook
contacts list, simply have both programs running at the same time. In Skype,
choose View➪View Outlook Contacts. All your Outlook contacts are instantly
accessible from within your Skype Contact window. You can perform a quick
search by entering a portion of a person’s name in the text entry area for
entering a Skype Name or phone number. As you enter the name, your list 
of contacts is filtered to show only those names, including your Outlook 
contacts, that match. If your Outlook contacts contain phone numbers, you
can easily SkypeOut to them. It is an extraordinary timesaver, organizer, and
therefore potential money saver.
Support your customer base with Skype
Many companies are beginning to discover the advantage of providing help-
center call-in services via Skype. USRobotics, a major manufacturer of
Internet and IT hardware, has adopted this model by placing a Skype contact
link on its Web site (see Figure 12-2).
Figure 12-2:
USRobotics

235
Chapter 12: “Skypifying” Your Business

You can take this use a step further. For an organization with a traditional call
center, adding Skype provides another access channel of support available at
low or no cost to the customer as well as the company. Operators standing
by can receive calls either by phone or by Skype.
Because you need only one Skype Name, you can have multiple operators on
separate computers. When a call comes in over Skype, all the computers will
ring and any of the operators can answer. The remaining operators are free to
pick up the next inbound call. You can have as many operators as you need
answering incoming calls, all on the same Skype Name.
Offer payment services
Integration between Skype and PayPal is in the works and expected within
months of this writing. Your company operators can then not only answer
callers but also securely receive payments for product support.
Mega Conferencing at Warp Speed
Sometimes you need some extra-large communication muscle to reach a super-
sized audience. High Speed Conferencing (www.highspeedconferencing.
com) is an application created by a company called VAPPS that works with
Skype to reach your mega audience. As many as 500 people can connect to 
a conference using Skype or a regular telephone. The cost to you to host the
conference is zero, nada, zip. If any of your attendees decide to call in from a
landline or cell phone, they pay whatever they would be paying for a call on
their particular phone plan. There are no supplemental or hidden charges of
any kind.
Want to hold an audio press conference, stockholder meeting, or a special
event for several hundred people? From your Web browser, go to www.
highspeedconferencing.com and then follow these steps:
1. Select Create Account from the menu options.
A new page appears in which to enter information for creating your
account.
2. Enter your Skype Name and email address associated with your 
Skype account in the entry fields of your Web page; then, click the
Register link.
You receive a dedicated conference “room” number — that is, a virtual
meeting place in cyberspace. For your conference room, you also
receive a pair of personal identification numbers, or PINs, to log in as
236
Part IV: The Professional Skyper 

Conference Moderator or as a Participant. Fortunately, you don’t have to
remember these numbers; this information is emailed to you when your
account setup is complete.
High Speed Conferencing creates Web buttons (see Figure 12-3) that are
similar to SkypeWeb buttons (described in the previous section of this
chapter).
3. Enter the names and email addresses for each of your conference 
invitees (see Figure 12-4).
The lists are designed to be used on a recurring basis, such as for
monthly sales status meetings, because the invitee list is retained 
for further use. There are third-party applications that integrate with 
the High Speed Conferencing service and can construct conference invi-
tation lists on the fly. One such application is a Customer Relationship
Management (CRM) application called Salesforce (find it at www.
appexchange.com).
When your invitees receive their invitations by email, the message 
contains the Web buttons that they can click to automatically join the
appropriate conference (see Figure 12-5).

Staying One Step Ahead by 
Being One Click Away
You and others in your business may spend a great deal of time performing
searches on the Internet. When you find some key information such as a sup-
port hotline or technical support number, you want to pounce on it, call the
contact, and save that number.
An assortment of Skype toolbars enable you to skype a person or contact
directly from an application external to Skype, such as your Firefox browser
or Office application, by directly clicking a phone number. You don’t need to
manually copy the number from the application and paste it into Skype to
make a call. This feature means that your employees can work more produc-
tively and effectively, thereby reducing some of your operating costs.
Skype has specific toolbars for specific programs. These include separate
downloadable toolbars for the Mozilla Firefox Web browser, Outlook, Outlook
Express 6, Thunderbird (the Mozilla email program), and Microsoft Office.
The toolbar that Skype provides for the Firefox browser combines two facili-
ties: a search panel to help you locate information with possible phone num-
bers, and a Highlight Numbers button that transforms phone numbers on a
Web page into “skypeable” links (see Figure 12-6). To call, just click the green
highlighted phone number or right-click the phone number and select one of
the options on the drop-down list options for immediately starting a call,
sending an SMS message, adding a number to your Contacts list, or just 
copying the number to your clipboard.
To download and set up the toolbar, go to www.skype.com and follow these
steps:
1. Click the Download button that appears near the top of the Home page.
The general Skype Download page appears with a list of downloadable
items at the left.
2. Click Skype Web Toolbar to display an expanded list of items immedi-
ately below it.
The expanded list contains the following:
• About Skype Web Toolbar
• Get It Now
• Getting Help
• Skype Web Toolbar Change Log
239
Chapter 12: “Skypifying” Your Business

3. Click the Get It Now link and then click the Download button in the
middle of the Web page to get the Skype Toolbar for Mozilla Firefox
installer file.
Save the file to your hard drive.
4. Double-click the file you just saved to open it.
If you have the Firefox browser running when you launch the installer,
you are alerted that all Firefox windows will have to be closed before
installation. When asked whether you want to close all Firefox windows
now, click Yes.
5. Choose the I Accept the Terms of the License Agreement option, click
the Next button, and then click the Install button.
(If you want to change the default location for where you save the Skype
Toolbar Firefox application on your hard drive, you must click the
Options button instead of the Install button. Clicking the Options button
enables you to change the save location before clicking Install.)

After you click the Install button, Firefox launches and a Software
Installation window opens with the message A Web site is
requesting permission to install the following item:
“SkypeToolbarForFirefox.”
6. Click the Install Now button to install the Firefox extension.
When the installation is complete, a window displaying your Firefox
extensions is displayed along with the following notice: The Skype
toolbar for Firefox will be installed when Firefox is
restarted.
7. Quit and restart Firefox to complete the installation.
Phone numbers on your Web pages will now appear as buttons that you click
to make SkypeOut calls (refer to Figure 12-6).
If your Skype program is not running when you click the button to call that
number, it automatically launches. After you sign in, Skype immediately 
proceeds to dial the number as a SkypeOut call.
To fully understand the toolbar, you need to know the following:
 Your Firefox browser needs to have the toolbar in an “on” mode (see
Figure 12-7) to make phone numbers on the Web pages skypeable: The
toolbar acts as a toggle switch. Depending on its current state, clicking
the toolbar icon once toggles it from an “on” state to an “off” state, or
vice versa. When the toolbar icon is in the “on” position, phone numbers
on all the pages you surf are immediately skypeable.
 Overseas numbers sometimes appear without the country code, and
you may need to set it: The phone number provided on a Web page may
contain a country code, but then again it may not. For example, a phone
number may be listed by area code and phone number, without any
country code. If the area code is 207, the phone number listed could be
in the state of Maine, but it could just as easily be a phone number in
London.
Unless you provide some information, there is no way Skype can know
what country to dial when placing the call. If no country code prefix
appears next to the area code and phone number, click the flag icon
appearing to the immediate right of the skypeable link. Clicking this icon
enables you to select a country (see Figure 12-8) and have the corre-
sponding country code returned.
241
Chapter 12: “Skypifying” Your Business

You can use the toolbar without actually making calls in Skype. Simply right-
click the phone number and select Add as a SkypeOut Contact in the drop-
down list. As you accumulate contacts, you can then use a program such as
Skylook (see Chapter 9) to transfer your contacts to Microsoft Outlook.
You can get plenty of value from Skype without having to spend money on
SkypeOut minutes. You can perform Internet searches on toll-free numbers
(using SkypeOut to call a toll-free number is free). For example, you can
create a search term such as phone number IBM 1-800 to find a listing 
of various toll-free numbers at IBM.
A variety of Internet search engines and Web sites enable you to locate toll-
free numbers.

Addressing IT Security Concerns
Skype was originally designed to be a consumer-oriented product, but
because of its secure transmission of audio, video, text, and files, it has
quickly gained traction in the business world. These very benefits can also
raise the hackles of Information Technology (IT) departments. To allay and
address these concerns, Skype is incorporating features to make it IT
friendly. Specifically, an IT department can deploy Skype in an organization
while maintaining the ability to
 Prohibit Skype altogether: If you have a highly secure IT environment, it
may be critical that absolutely no external communication with sources
outside your network segment take place. In such cases, prohibiting the
use of Skype in any form would be prudent.
 Disable file transfer capability of Skype: Skype file transfers are secure
and encrypted. This means that a person who has access to the public
Internet and to sensitive files can securely transfer those files to an
external third party. The only way to control the situation is to disable
the file transfer capability of Skype. You do so by making changes to the
Windows registry of the computer running Skype and preventing unau-
thorized users from changing registry settings. This task is beyond the
scope of this book.
 Restrict Skype to route its content through a specific firewall or proxy
server: In a networked environment, the issue may not be so much the
security of sensitive documents or files. It is easily possible for a person
to securely upload a sensitive file to an external source from a Web
browser. You don’t need Skype for that. What you may need is the ability
to scan an incoming file that is transferred from Skype and that may con-
tain a virus signature. One way to assure the scanning is to route all
Skype network traffic through a specific firewall or proxy server.
 Disable all Skype APIs: Even if Skype works in a manner that is accept-
able to the practices and policies of your organization, you may be wary
of other programs that can tap into the features of Skype through the
Application Programming Interface, or API. In that case, you can disable
the Skype API so that other programs cannot interface with Skype.
Restricting features within Skype is not simply a matter of selecting some
item from a menu and voilà, it’s done. Correctly configuring security entails
much more than making changes to Skype itself. If you disable a feature such
as the ability to transfer files, you also have to restrict the end user’s access
to administrative features of the computer. Otherwise, your end users can
simply undo the settings.
In short, making changes to just Skype alone is not enough. You must secure
the whole computing infrastructure of your organization.

N
ot even Gulliver in his travels could hold bragging rights over the vari-
ety of scenes, pursuits, opportunities, and enterprises populating the
new Skype landscape. Every existing endeavor, as well as every endeavor
made possible by the Skype peer-to-peer technology, appears redesigned as a
Skype community. The speed at which new connections are made between
people of like minds and interests is astonishing. As fast as you can read this
chapter is as fast as Skype communities assemble. This chapter opens the
door, just a crack, to an array of social, education, commerce, and special
interest communities for you to explore.
The people we meet, do business with, socialize with, and learn with are no
longer limited to random acts of luck (or misfortune). We can pick communi-
ties to join, leave communities we dislike, and start our own communities if
there are none out there representing our obscure passion for playing the
Hawaiian nose flute. In this chapter, you find out how to take a class or join 
a book club using Skype, where to find a Skype partner to learn a new lan-
guage, how to use Skype to kindle new friendships (and romances), and what
hot new Web communities are adopting Skype at their core so that their
members can start to talk to one another.
Finding Your Perfect Skype Venue
As Skype becomes a more common way to connect, more Web communities are
adding it to their menu of choices. The Skype contribution, instant voice mes-
saging, adds immense value to existing tools such as emails, discussion threads,
and text messaging. Listening and speaking are, after all, our most natural way

to get to know each other. You can hear someone’s personality in his or her
voice as much as reveal your own. No wonder Skype is becoming a mainstay 
of some of the most active online social settings, such as the following:
 Social forums: Web-based search and communication tools designed 
to let you find other people with common interests for friendship,
romance, conversation, or business.
 Online classes: Web-based groups led by instructors involving a formal
sign-up process, or small study groups organized through search tools
and having no formal teacher or registration.
 Virtual conferences: Web-based conferences for large groups (100 
participants) led by one or more people on any topic imaginable.
Looking for love with a 
little help from Skype
Online dating is not new, but online dating with an instant, private way to
speak with a potential date is a welcome addition to the experience. Skype
changes the nature and experience of Web romance in some significant ways:
 Talk to a prospective date: Skype voice and chat tools let people hear
each other before giving out phone numbers and addresses. The biggest
benefit in using Skype to socialize is that you can create a direct and
immediate contact with a potential friend.
 Connect using cutting edge online tools: Sites such as www.
someonenew.com feature Skype as the primary incentive to use their
portals (see Figure 13-1). Another online dating site, www.verbdate.
com, advertises itself as the place “Where People Speak before They
Meet.” Unlike other sites built around those in the know about Skype,
www.verbdate.com registration screens include a Skype flash tutorial,
an explanation of the technology, and a link to www.skype.com to
download the software.
 Skype from within each online community: On the site www.
someonenew.com, the primary way you connect to another member is
by clicking his or her Skype Name featured in an online profile. The link
is active, causing Skype to open and begin a direct call to your potential
new friend. If that “someone new” is online and willing to accept your
call, just speak up!
246
Part IV: The Professional Skyper 

 Take the guesswork out of calling: Making contact with a new friend,
and possibly a new romantic friend, can be scary. When you call with
cell phones or landlines, you have no idea whether anyone will pick 
up or how you will be received. Skype lets you — and your new dating 
partner — broadcast your availability to receive calls through online
status icons, giving you a little time to build up your courage.
 Connect privately and safely: You don’t need to give out a phone
number in order to receive, or make, a direct call. You can skype from
your computer to another computer or to a regular phone without reveal-
ing any personal information. Your Skype profile shows only the informa-
tion that you choose to make public. So you can really begin to know
someone before trading addresses and phone numbers, and you can do
so without feeling uncomfortable about keeping that information secret.

Beboppin’ with Bebo
Bebo (www.bebo.com) is a Web site whose sole purpose is to create commu-
nity and connect people. Its eye-popping profile pages, filled with the latest
multimedia and interactive ingredients, let members show their personalities.
After you see, hear, and interact with a Bebo profile page, you probably soon
know whether you have found a friend to talk to over Skype. On their profile
page, Bebo users can
 Share playlists: Bebo users can post favorite music clips on profile
pages. These clips open in a colorful MP3 player, and you can listen to
them on the spot. Click a link to automatically copy the playlist to your
own Bebo profile if you like the selection.
 Post a gallery of friends: A section of your Bebo profile page displays
Bebo friends you’ve added. Rather than a barebones text buddy list, you
see all the photos your online friends uploaded to their own Bebo home
page. Each photo has a link to each individual. You can easily begin to
develop a large circle of friends with common interests. We searched for
Bebo users who play the fiddle and use Skype. Bebo returned a long list,
and each of those skyping fiddlers had galleries of friends. The potential
for building a vibrant, personal community is built into the Bebo profile
interface.
 Grow a fan base for your favorite band: Another section of the per-
sonal profile page is devoted to posting pictures of musical groups. Each
picture is linked to a separate Bebo Band page listing information about
the band, comments about the band members, tour dates, songs,
albums, a gallery of fans, and the band’s home page.
 Show a movie: Bebo allows you to upload a short movie clip onto your
Bebo home page. Many Bebo movies are homemade; some are commer-
cial clips. You can also click the Add To My Homepage link to put a Bebo
movie you like onto your own profile page. Bebo’s interactivity is all
about sharing.
 Draw a reply to a whiteboard message: Bebo has a section on each pro-
file page for drawing or writing on a blank whiteboard. It’s an unusual
area because each whiteboard drawing becomes a posted message to
which other Bebo users can respond. In place of traditional conversa-
tion threads, whiteboards supply colorful, imaginative image threads.
Mostly they are just another way to have fun at this online party.
 Create a quiz: Bebo has a quiz wizard for instant, original, and personal
quizzes. These quizzes are often used to see how much your friends
know about you.
248
Part IV: The Professional Skyper 

 Poll your friends: Bebo also has a poll wizard to help you create multi-
ple-choice questions. As people respond to the poll by selecting an
answer, the results of the poll appear. Poll takers know immediately 
how much in or out of sync they are with your personal community.
 Upload multiple photo albums: Many online communities let you post a
picture, but Bebo lets you post scores of images. Each album on a Bebo
profile page is represented by a thumbnail photo linked to a larger
album.
 Create a blog: Bebo has a section for ongoing online diaries called blogs
(short for web logs) with links to the blogger’s profile as well as a link to
reply directly to the blogger.
To integrate Skype into its Web community, Bebo adds a field in the registra-
tion page for a Skype Name when you join. If you want to contact someone on
Bebo, you can email, post comments, or skype directly from each profile page.
Skype status icons are posted alongside on the Bebo user’s profile page, so
you know who is online and available to talk (see Figure 13-2). Of course, if
your new friend decides not to authorize you to make this Skype connection,
you’ll just have to keep looking for another willing Bebo companion.

Close encounters of the Skype kind
The Skype Journal (www.skypejournal.com) is a community “newspaper”
with a difference. The community this resource attracts (namely, skypers)
has a direct pipeline to the journalists who write for the publication. Each
writer has a byline with a Skype status icon next to his or her name. In fact,
writers’ names are direct links to a Web page with clickable icons for Skype
calls, text messaging, Skype Voicemail, and even an old-fashioned phone
number (suitable for a SkypeOut call).
The Skype Journal posts formal articles on all things Skype. Topics include
gadgets, Web sites, software, controversies, anecdotes, and interviews. Each
article is filled with hyperlinks (clickable connections to more information), 
a Listen to This Article link to a spoken version (as a QuickTime movie), and
a TrackBack link that connects to previously published articles on a similar
topic. In addition, every article has an Add Your Comments link for instant
feedback on the article or comments on the topic. The Skype Journal archives
the latest 200 posted reactions, which are accessible on any page of its Web
site by clicking the “Skype Journal comment river.” Wading through the “com-
ment river” yields links to blogs, Web sites, and Skype Names and provides a
handy link back to the referenced article. 
Whereas the Skype Journal is a topical gathering place, the Skype Forum
(forum.skype.com/) consists of a lively collection of discussion threads
hosted by Skype itself. The Skype Forum publishes comments, questions, and
stories related to personal, professional, imaginative, sentimental, economic,
and technical issues. Everyone who signs into the Skype Forum can add a
Skype Name (as well as an AOL, Yahoo!, or MSN username) to a profile, so it’s
possible to make direct contact with a kindred spirit around a hot Skype topic. 
Joining Education Communities
Learning online, within a vibrant multilanguage, multi-age, and multicultural
community that crosses time zones, political affiliations and geography,
forces a change in educational habits. Joining a learning community means
that the students have to “construct” their own learning by participating in
live video debates, posting PowerPoint resources, contributing to threaded
discussions, and honing written language skills by chatting with other stu-
dents who may be speaking other languages. A new way of learning is emerg-
ing, shaped by the need for online learning collaboration and demanding
written, spoken, visual, synchronous, and asynchronous participation by
both teachers and students as a group and as individuals.
250
Part IV: The Professional Skyper 

The addition of Skype to online learning has opened a powerful, live, face-to-
face, and chat-to-chat arena with the following advantages:
 Authentic conversations: When you can learn a language by connecting
to a native speaker, chances are you won’t want to return to memorizing
dialogues from books. The same applies to a conversation with an
author or an expert in your field of study. The opportunity to meet,
interview, and respond by including Skype in an online course connects
the facts to real people in a very compelling, personal way.
 Nontraditional feedback: Traditional feedback, such as tests, grades,
and marked papers often define how students learn in a classroom.
Students study, take a test, and then wait for feedback in the form of a
grade. New kinds of feedback experiences in forums, chat rooms, and
live conferences provide an immediate response to students. Students
not only react to ideas but also demand reactions from others, and they
don’t have to wait until the end of the term to figure out whether they’ve
learned anything.
 Unexpected collaboration: School is sometimes a lonely, solitary pur-
suit. Students spend endless hours on the Internet doing research, read-
ing texts, and completing homework. Online classes can exaggerate that
isolation. Adding Skype conferencing, video connections, file transfer,
and chats invites collaboration and academic give-and-take because
Skype, by design, is a social place.
In the Moodle for learning
Many people take neighborhood continuing-education classes to meet kin-
dred spirits. Now that our neighborhoods are online and have virtually no
boundaries, no one has to settle for a class in word processing when
Conversational Spanish would be preferable. In a brick–and-mortar school,
the menu of classes is often limited. In a virtual school, the offerings can be
almost endless. One of the most active online learning communities to fully
integrate Skype is called Moodle, found at www.moodle.org. Moodle is a
free, online course-creation software that provides quiz construction, grad-
ing, surveys, open forums, threaded discussion, and wikis (which are online
references created, edited, and updated by the Web community). Anyone can
download Moodle, host it on a server, load it with curricular materials, and
run an online school. (For the curious, the word moodle derives from the
acronym for Modular Object-Oriented Dynamic Learning Environment, which
is useful mostly to programmers and education theorists. It’s also a verb that
describes the process of lazily meandering through something, doing things
as it occurs to you to do them — an enjoyable tinkering that often leads to
insight and creativity.)
251
Chapter 13: Exploring Skype Communities

On Moodle, you can register and enroll in online courses. During registration,
Moodle users can add their Skype Name to their profile, along with a list of
various methods of communicating (see Figure 13-3). A dynamic combination
of learner-initiated activities guarantees that nobody will fall asleep in the
back of the virtual room. Take a quiz; give a quiz. Answer a poll; create your
own survey. Make a movie and post it in Moodle class resources. When the
mediator/teacher asks a question, Moodle users can now skype their answers
through file transfer, or just speak up in class, if the instructor chooses to
conduct class with Skype as the central communication tool.
252
Part IV: The Professional Skyper 
World Class Schools
At one time, the PA (public address) system
defined cutting-edge school communication.
Now, of course, thousands of schools have high-
speed Internet connections and the potential 
to communicate with the rest of the world
through every available type of media. One orga-
nization, started by Michael Cunningham, a
former principal who returned to a Texas class-
room, reaches around the world with a Skype-
based learning network run by teachers and stu-
dents. Schools are connected through the World
Class Schools portal (worldclassschools.
00politics.com) and are invited to join in
formal debates, poetry slams, and ongoing for-
eign language exchanges. Some of the
recorded video Skype sessions are posted on
the Web site as QuickTime files along with
scores of photos from the other areas of the
world.
There is no cost beyond maintaining an Internet
connection, which is often already installed in
schools. Organizing school-to-school projects
is easily arranged because the participants can
talk to each other. Debate topics are posted and
scheduled, and students prepare their topics
according to rules sent out through Skype file
transfer or email. Computer rooms are changed
into living language labs as English-speaking
students in Texas sharpen their Italian,
Portuguese, or Swedish with their counterparts
in Italy, Brazil, and Sweden. One extraordinary
event paired students in the United States,
Turkey, and Uzbekistan through Skype-enabled
parliamentary debates.
World Class Schools takes advantage of avail-
able Skype tools to foster an active community.
In a conference with a new school wanting to
participate in one of these exciting programs, a
veteran member can instantaneously send all
his or her Skype contacts through file transfer.
The result is an instant network of tech-savvy
educators ready to launch student-to-student
projects. The new list of contacts comes
packed with information on location, interests,
pictures, Web sites, and anything else an edu-
cator wants to share in a profile. All a teacher
needs to do is click a Skype contact to begin to
launch an international community event. Of
course, all Skype contacts need to be autho-
rized and your contacts must coordinate time
zones, class compatibility, technical setups, and
other organizational issues. But these are
issues easily overcome, and the payoff in
expanding the community of learners for your
students is well worth the effort.

It’s no surprise that Moodle has embraced Skype technology in its arsenal of
learning tools. With Skype, a Moodle course enables students to
 Connect to similar classes across the globe and share ideas in a real-time
mini-conference.
 Confer with the lecturer directly rather than through email or threaded
discussions. You don’t have to wait for a response when you can simply
engage in a conversation.
 Exchange work on the fly through file transfer. Skype is ideal for educa-
tional collaboration.
 Form study groups “after class” by skyping your classmates.
Parlez-Vous Skype?
Language isolates communities from one another; studying languages con-
nects them. The excitement of speaking another language goes a long way
toward bringing extremely diverse cultures together. Probably the most nat-
ural use of Skype in education is to link students of foreign languages. After
all, the best way to acquire a language is to speak it. The best way to speak 
a foreign language is with a native speaker, and Skype lets you speak with
anyone around the world. As Skype technology takes hold, more and more
language learning sites are emerging around the ease of using Voice over
Internet Telephony, or VoIP. You can use Skype to acquire a new language 
on the following Web sites:

The Mixxer
Dickinson College created this site at www.language-exchanges.org as 
a free language exchange site. The Mixxer provides a search tool for finding
language partners who use Skype. To join The Mixxer, register with an email
address (which serves as your login name) and a password. Fill out a profile
screen with your Skype Name, time zone, your native language, and the 
language you want to study. Your picture, age, and interests are optional 
information.
To let your Mixxer language partners know when you are available on Skype,
you have to change your Skype privacy settings. To do so in Windows, follow
these steps:
1. Choose Start➪All Programs➪Skype to launch Skype.
2. Choose Tools➪Options➪Privacy and then select Allow My Status to Be
Shown on the Web.
To change your privacy settings on the Macintosh, follow these steps:
1. Click the Skype icon in your dock to launch Skype.
2. Choose Skype➪Preferences➪Privacy and select Allow My Status to Be
Shown on the Web.
On Mixxer, you can explore the site and search for possible language partners
Mixxer finds. For each prospective partner, Mixxer posts a name, a Skype
Name, language, location, and local time. Mixxer also provides links to a user’s
Skype Profile and text chats, and posts Skype presence icons so that you know
when someone you want to contact is online.
xLingo
xLingo (www.xlingo.com) is another free site promoting language exchange
using a host of online tools including Skype. After joining xLingo using a stan-
dard sign-up screen to enter a username, email address, password, location,
and language preference, you find numerous options for picking up a new lan-
guage. Among them is to search for and connect to language partners through
Skype. You don’t need to search for any Skype contact information; instead,
select a partner from the search list and click the name to pull up an xLingo
profile. Each profile connects directly to Skype.
My Language Exchange
My Language Exchange (www.mylanguageexchange.com) is free, allows a
partner search, and recommends using Skype to take advantage of its
resources, although Skype is not integrated directly into the online software.
My Language Exchange is a formal language-learning site with very specific
254
Part IV: The Professional Skyper 

methods. It promotes the Cormier method of language exchange, developed
at the Club d’échange linguistique de Montréal (C.E.L.M. language school) in
combination with Skype audio conferencing. With the Cormier method, you
do the following:
 Form small groups: Gather no more than four people so that everyone
gets a chance to speak. The ideal group contains equal numbers of
speakers of each language (two English and two French, for example).
 Find conversation partners who understand 40 percent to 70 percent
of a conversation: This is harder with a larger group but perfect for a
Skype conference.
 Speak one language half the time and then switch and speak the
second language half the time.
 Use a timer to keep the group rotating languages: Every Skype call
window has a built-in timer, perfect for keeping the language flow.

Chapter 13: Exploring Skype Communities
eBay and commerce communities
Social networking is exploding in the world of e-
commerce. As more and more people turn to the
Web to buy, sell, swap, trade, and market goods,
new mechanisms keep the Web economy
responding to the power of a large community.
One of the biggest and busiest e-commerce sites,
eBay, is an old hand at developing strategies to
keep the community engaged and therefore keep
businesses honest and competitive. eBay estab-
lished rating systems to judge the quality of ser-
vice offered by any firm or individual. The
self-policing community establishes the reputa-
tion and identity of a business by voting on satis-
faction. In this system, advertisements are less of
a factor than the comments of fellow customers.
The bid system is, in itself a group activity, estab-
lishing the worth of an item by the community of
buyers rather than a cartel of sellers.
Community forums have grown up around sales
items. Disneyana, comics, shoes, and a long list
of item categories make a place for groups to
discuss specific products and otherwise get to
know fellow eBay members. An area for gen-
eral discussion has names reflecting actual
community social spots: the Front Porch, the
Homestead, the Park, the eBay Town Square,
and the Soapbox.
The acquisition of Skype by eBay extends the
well-established culture of community. With this
addition, three powerful programs work together.
eBay is the commerce engine, Skype is the
communications engine, and PayPal is the pay-
ment vehicle for this community. Skype enables
buyers and sellers to communicate directly with
each other. Imagine if you were looking for an
antique and found one you liked on eBay. With
Skype integrated into eBay, you can instantly
have a chat with the seller, and because the
item is expensive, you want to know everything
about it. You may even want to pay through
Skype as well. Talking over Skype is personal
enough to get specific information from the
person you are buying from and yet private
enough for the buyer to feel a bit anonymous. A
touch of anonymity takes the pressure off the
buyer and gives him or her a little thinking
space.
Skype and eBay are joining e-commerce and
social networking to build a huge, interwoven
and powerful community.

Skype is incorporated in this method by providing a simple, immediate,
global way to speak online. In addition, you can use the Skype chat window
to do the following: clarify new words and terms; use the Skype file transfer
tool to share lesson plans (available on the My Language.com Web site); and
use the Skype online status icon to let your study buddies know when you
are online and ready to start class.
Skyping in All the Right Places
There may be thousands of people intrigued by the same hobbies you are,
passionate about the same causes you embrace, or fascinated by the same
collectibles you cherish. The Internet has a long history of bulletin boards,
newsgroups, and so on, but Skype enables these communities, both large and
small, to connect in a new way, invigorating and empowering each interest
group with tools formerly too complicated or too expensive to implement.
Forming communities around 
special interests
Any interest group, club, or society can benefit from spreading Skype around,
plugging in those microphones and talking to each other on a regular basis.
Here are some types of groups already skyping away happily:
 People with disabilities: Individuals with mobility problems can join a
group over Skype. For people with limited mobility, an online visit elimi-
nates the difficulty of finding transportation, calling a paratransit bus, or
getting into an adapted vehicle. Skype software can also be installed on
computers with touch screens and special switches to enable alternative
mouse access for individuals with limited physical movement.
 People who communicate in sign language: Individuals with hearing
challenges can use the Skype chat window and file transfer as well as
videoconferencing to communicate in sign language.
 Musicians: Musicians are beginning to experiment with Skype as a tool
for remote jamming, collaborative composing, and performing.
 Collectors: All collectibles — stamps, shells, vintage toys —are a rallying
point for a Skype group. Collectors love to talk, trade, and just bond with
other collectors. Collectors can transfer Contact lists through Skype to
share with fellow enthusiasts. You can even enjoy an active group if you
256
Part IV: The Professional Skyper 

live in a small town that is unlikely to have another passionate rock 
tumbler living in the neighborhood.
 Gamers: Gamers are used to online communities, which tend to be imag-
inary realms with richly costumed avatars. Some players are combining
gaming with Skype, so you can converse with your opponent, discussing
strategy and making a few friends outside the virtual arena.
 Family Communities: Families are reconnecting over the Web.
Grandparents receive digital photo albums and email greetings, and 
they can view elaborate Web sites created for newborns. Most of this
happens asynchronously, that is, not everyone is in the same virtual
room at the same time. Skype can change that. With an easy conference
call, Susan can conference in Mom and Dad in Florida, her sister in
Flemington, and her brother in Newburgh. Everyone can talk, enter 
comments in the chat window, and turn on those video cameras for a
real family gathering.
Skyping for a common cause
People always bond together to help others in need. Charities, victim ser-
vices, outreach, and disaster relief all find representation on blogs and Web
sites in addition to physical gatherings. Three key questions that organiza-
tions that ask are, How quickly can we help, How efficiently can we plan joint
efforts, and Do we have the funds to get things done? Skype technology goes
a long way toward helping in these areas in the following ways:
 Cost savings: Skype enables a significant reduction in long-distance tele-
phone costs. If you skype through your computer, no cost is associated
with that call.
 Time savings: Another great expense for relief organizations is time
spent on personnel and travel. Eliminating even some air, rail, or rental
car costs puts more in the coffers for those in need.
 Planning and organizing that save lives: One organization devoted to
building shelters and housing for refuge and disaster victims has posted
a Web-based Skype Me button for instant access to the central office. Of
course, bringing all the members of a group into a common environment
for Skype collaboration takes time, but after it is established, an enor-
mous amount of coordination can take place in record time. With voice,
chat, and file transfer available, many of the elements of a dynamic,
timely, successful relief effort are in place. Planning is spent on how to
help, not how to get to a meeting in order to talk about how to help.

T
own Hall. These two words evoke a home-town scene, a designated place
for members of a local community to gather, to speak up, and to raise
issues. Holding meetings in a Town Hall is a particularly effective forum for
people to come together and exchange ideas. Skype has its own Town Hall.
Its designated place is cyberspace, and its home-grown community is made
up of skypers. This Skype Town Hall is called Skypecasting.
This chapter shows you the ins and outs of Skypecasting, and you see how
Skypecasting offers so much more than a traditional Town Hall.
Skypecasting: More than Just 
an Online Town Hall
Skypecasts are a way for people in groups of up to 100 at a time to congregate
over Skype. Accommodating 100 people is a pretty nice leap from the Skype
conferences of five or ten people that are covered in Chapter 10. The follow-
ing sections give you just a taste of the full potential of Skypecasting.
As with a conventional Skype conference call, a Skypecast is totally free.
Skypecasting works a little differently than a regular Skype conference call.
The key differences are the following:
 Participants join Skypecasts. The conference host or organizer doesn’t
choose and call participants; instead, the participants choose a meeting
on their own.

 Skypecasts are public. Skypecasts are listed on the Web and in a 
searchable directory within Skype. Anyone with a Skype Name can 
join a Skypecast.
 Skypecasts can accommodate a crowd. Skypecasts can be as small 
as one or two people and as large as 100.
 You can join Skypecasts only on the Internet. You cannot join a 
meeting by calling in from a regular telephone.
 Skypecast hosts have special controls. Participants in a Skypecast 
can request the microphone so that all the participants can hear what
she or he has got to say. The host can individually mute or unmute the
microphone of any participant.
The current cutoff for audience size in Skypecasting is 100 participants. If you
want to give people the choice of connecting into a large conference either
through Skype or calling from a regular phone, look at High Speed Conferencing
(see Chapter 12). With this option, you can convene up to 500 people.
Skypecasting of the people, 
for the people, by the people
Skypecasts are for anybody. Anybody can join a Skypecast. Anybody can
start a Skypecast. In contrast to members of other conferences, Skypecast
members don’t have to be dues-paying participants. They don’t have to join 
a club. They are free to participate with no restraint except good manners.
The model for a Skypecast doesn’t have to be a town hall. Often it is a soap-
box. It can be whatever you want it to be. You can
 Start a club.
 Give a lecture or even a series of lectures.
 Create a story circle.
 Lead a guided meditation.
 Give a music lesson.
 Organize an impromptu class. Combine your Skypecast with Webinar (a
Web seminar) software to deliver a PowerPoint or any other presentation.
 Get on a virtual soapbox and start talking. Anyone can join you. If you
are compelling, interesting, or just plain unusual, people will stick
around and listen.
260
Part IV: The Professional Skyper 

The authors of this book set out to Skypecast a discussion on the basic setup
and inner workings of Skype. Such a discussion brought together a small
community of people with an interest in meeting other skypers, meeting the
authors of a book, getting some of their questions answered, and having a
soapbox for suggestions. The authors, on the other hand, wanted to meet the
community of readers of books on technology, or the community of early
adopters of new technologies.
You can initiate a Skypecast from any location. You can be lounging at home,
working at the office, or enjoying your beachfront property (assuming that
you have a broadband Internet connection). Skype connections have been
made in remote places such as Mount Everest, so if you wanted to climb that
mountain and Skypecast the tale of your journey, go right ahead. Most of us,
however, have things to share from locations less exotic than Mount Everest.
Finding a Skypecast
With so many topics available, you may think that finding the Skypecast you
want to join would be difficult. Fortunately, you can find Skypecasts in a few
different ways:
 Go to the Skypecast Preview Directory. Go to the Skypecast home page
(https://skypecasts.skype.com/skypecasts/home). On this
page, you can find
• Featured Skypecasts
• Skypecasts scheduled over the next four weeks
• Skypecasts about to start
• Skypecasts already in progress
You don’t need to run Skype when you view these listings; they are regu-
lar Web pages. You do need to have Skype installed on your computer to
join a Skypecast, however.
 From your SkypeLive page on your Skype client, view a list of
Skypecasts already in progress or that are about to start. If you are
using Windows and have Skype 2.6 or later, you have a feature called
SkypeLive (see Figure 14-1).
 Find out about Skypecasts posted on a blog or Web site. Blogs and Web
sites that post links to Skypecasts on specific topics can be kept up-to-
date as Skypecasts are added and revised.
 Find out about Skypecasts listed on RSS feeds. Web pages commonly
have RSS links.
261
Chapter 14: Skypecasting

Aside from browsing these lists, you can search for a Skypecast by topic or
keyword (sometimes referred to as a tag), by the Skypecast title, or by the
Skype Name of the Skypecast organizer. You enter the search term and then
click the Search button in Find a Skypecast on the Skypecast Home page
(https://skypecasts.skype.com/skypecasts/home).
Joining a Skypecast
If this is your first time to join a Skypecast or a similar type of online forum
that allows you to speak up and be heard, then you’re sure to have fun. The
steps involved in joining a Skypecast are easy:
1. Make sure that you have the most recent version of Skype.
Make sure that you have Skype software (version 2.5 or later for
Windows and 1.4 or later for the Mac). New Skypecast features continue
to be introduced. For instance, the Skype Live feature, which displays
current Skypecasts directly within Skype, can be found on version 2.6 or
later for Windows, but version 2.5 does not include the feature. To take
better advantage of new Skypecast features, get the latest version of
Skype for your platform.
2. Find a Skypecast at https://skypecasts.skype.com/skypecasts/home.
Note the date and time that the Skypecast is scheduled to start.
3. When it’s time to join the Skypecast, browse the list of Skypecasts
posted on the Skypecast home page (see Figure 14-2) and click the
Sign in to Join link for the Skypecast of your choice.

4. When prompted, enter your Skype Name and password.
With Skype 2.5 for Windows and 1.4 for Mac, a separate program is
launched to connect to the Skypecast. Later versions of Skype may inte-
grate Skypecasting directly in the Skype program instead of launching a
separate program.
Organizing a Skypecast

4. Enter a short one or two paragraph description.
The description is also a required item.
5. Select the primary language that is to be spoken.
6. Enter the time and date for your Skypecast.
This item is required. You can have your Skypecast start immediately
without any advance scheduling, but most skypers schedule their
Skypecasts in advance. You can schedule the Skypecast for any day up
to four weeks out into the future. You need to specify the time of day in
terms of a 24-hour clock cycle (as opposed to a 12-hour cycle).

Part IV: The Professional Skyper 

Remember, Skypecasts are global. Pick a time that’s not only convenient
to your local community but also accommodates a time zone that con-
tains your likely audience. If you have a Skypecast at noon in Boston,
you can expect some Californians to join in at 9 a.m., some Londoners 
to join in at 5 p.m., and a resident of Moscow to join at 9 p.m.
7. Select the duration.
During this time, anyone will be able to join your Skypecast from the
directory. You have a choice of setting the duration from 15 minutes up 
to 5 hours.
If you don’t want late stragglers coming into your Skypecast, select a
shorter period of time such as 15 minutes or a half hour. Keep in mind,
though, that if a person who joins a Skypecast has a problem with his or
her computer, that person may be forced to leave the Skypecast and
can’t rejoin the Skypecast after the allotted duration expires.
8. Enter keywords for your Skypecast.
You can enter up to five keywords, or tags. Entering keywords is
optional, but we recommend adding them because they help people 
find your Skypecast more easily and better understand the topic of 
your Skypecast.
Try to vary the keywords rather than restrict them to the same topic.
• Browse the picture themes to find a picture that quickly communi-
cates your topic. The picture themes are as follows:
• Arts, Movies, Music
• Business, Meetings, Finance
• Flirt, Love, Romance
• Gaming
• Health, Fitness
• Holidays, Vacations, Travel
• Internet Chat
• Mothers, Parenting, Family
• Science, Technology, Ideas
• Society, People
• Sports
9. Preview the listing, review and accept the Skypecast Community
Guidelines, and click the Agree button.
After you agree, the Skypecast is scheduled.
265
Chapter 14: Skypecasting

Between the time you schedule a Skypecast and the time it runs, you can 
edit the conference description. For example, you can reschedule and set it
to an earlier or later date, or you can revise the Skypecast description. If 
necessary, you can cancel the Skypecast.
As an added bonus of hosting Skypecasts, you can take the description of a
Skypecast you recently organized and reuse its description for additional
Skypecasts.
Choosing a topic for your Skypecast
Choosing a subject for your Skypecast is easy. Pick something you are inter-
ested in, from collecting baseball cards to baking the ultimate chocolate chip
cookies; from brushing up on your Japanese to watching the Super Bowl. If
you are an expert in all these areas, feel free to make each one a Skypecast.
You can host as many Skypecasts as you want, and it’s totally free.
266
Part IV: The Professional Skyper 
Building a fan base
Building a community, or a fan base, begins with
finding a good topic or set of topics for your
Skypecast that inspires you and your audience
to meet online. Here’s a cross-section of ideas
to help you get started:
 Create a daily Skypecast to get on your
soapbox in an election.
 Skypecast your latest musical compositions
to create a fan base.
 Gather to watch the Super Bowl over an
open Skypecast with a community of fans
rooting for both sides.
 Host Skypecast sessions of a public confer-
ence. Invite attendees to create Skypecasts
to develop the ideas raised at the conference.
 Interview a popular author and Skypecast
the event. Follow up with a regular Skypecast
book club.
 Host a regular movie discussion group.
 Create a forum for parents of children with
disabilities to discuss, share stories, and
support in a nonthreatening, information-
rich arena.
 Start a technology users discussion group
for a common software program such as
Excel, Skype, Photoshop, or Final Cut Pro.

When you create and host a Skypecast:
 Choose a title that sells itself. Creating your Skypecast listing is an
opportunity to let your prospective audience know what they are in for.
A good title explains why someone should join your Skypecast and what
you’ll be talking about. Some examples of existing Skypecast titles that
give you a hint as to the topic and type of discussion:
• I’m a Brazilian, Learning English
• Poker School Online Training Tournament
• Creative Real Estate Investing
• Survival Strategies of the Selfish DNA Programs
 Think carefully about the keywords. Keywords, or tags, are words or
phrases that you add to help users to find your Skypecast by searching
the directory. You have an opportunity to add keywords in a special 
field when you create a Skypecast. You can also add keywords after the
Skypecast is posted. Keywords for a Skypecast titled “Financial Markets”
are “dollar, euro, actions, stock, finance.” These keywords also deter-
mine on which syndicated listings your Skypecast appears. Keywords
help users find your Skypecast and ensure that your Skypecast gets the
best possible promotion.
 Promote your Skypecast. Send the Skypecast link to your friends, 
family, and co-workers in an email. You can also add a simple HTML
snippet to your blog or email signature block to remind your fan club 
(or future fan club).
 Don’t leave your audience in the lurch. Note the time and day you 
are to host a Skypecast and be ready and waiting for your audience. 
A skyper entering an empty Skypecast will turn around and leave.
Decide what kind of host you want to be and what kind of Skypecast
you want to run. You may want an open discussion or a one-way broad-
cast with questions at the end.
Use Skypecast microphone tools strategically. After your Skypecast
begins, as a host, you can mute or unmute the microphones of some 
or all of your participants (be careful; this may become habit forming).
Muting participants’ microphones actually increases call quality for
everyone in the Skypecast, so keep that in mind when voices begin to
crackle. Participants can request the microphone by clicking a button
available to them. The host assigns a speaker, passes the microphone
around, and keeps the quality and flow of the Skypecast high.
Don’t hesitate to be a bouncer! If you have an unruly member bent on
mayhem, toss that person out! Skypecast controls allow you to remove
uncooperative participants.

Chapter 14: Skypecasting

Getting the Word Out
Your conference is automatically posted in a directory of current and upcom-
ing Skypecasts at https://skypecasts.skype.com/skypecasts/all
(see Figure 14-4).
There are several ways for people to learn about your Skypecast:
 Scheduled Skypecasts are listed in the Skypecast directory on the Skype
Web site. Current and ongoing Skypecasts are also displayed on the Live
page of Skype applications starting with version 2.6 for Windows. Both
the Web listing and listing in the client are automatic and don’t require
action on your part.
 Listings can be posted to a blog using TypePad.
 Listings can be posted on any Web site.
 Listings can be posted on RSS Feeds.

268
Part IV: The Professional Skyper 

Automatic directory listings
Skypecasts are listed in the order they take place. Because accommodating
the various time zones complicates listing the time that each Skypecast will
start, the directory posts a notice such as Starts in 4 hours and 55 minutes.
This way, whatever time zone you are in, you know when to log on and join in.
Placing a Skypecast Widget on a blog
Another way to get the word out about your Skypecast is to add a Skypecast
Widget on a blog. One company, TypePad (www.typepad.com), has part-
nered with Skype to connect the world of blogging with the world of
Skypecasts. As a TypePad blogger, you can create a Skypecast and then add
a special Widget to your blog. People reading your daily blog can click the
Widget to join your Skypecast directly from inside TypePad. Your community
of blog readers is a likely audience for your Skypecast adventure, so embed-
ding a link in your blog is the best way to let them know when you will make
your broadcasting debut.
To add a Widget to your TypePad blog:
1. Log onto https://skypecasts.skype.com/skypecasts/skypecast/
widget.html.
2. Select a radio button for a featured Skypecast, your own Skypecast, 
or a tagged Skypecast.
3. Click Install Widget on TypePad.
If you select a tagged Skypecast or your own Skypecast, you will be
directed to type your Skype Name in the field provided. Skype searches
for the Skypecast you want to promote.
4. Click the Install Widget on TypePad button.
The TypePad login page appears.
5. If you have an account, enter your name and password.
6. Select the blog on which you want the Widget to appear.
7. Preview your Widget.
8. Confirm your choice.

Chapter 14: Skypecasting

Placing a link to your Skypecast 
on your Web site
After you schedule a Skypecast, you can find its meeting ID number and place
a link to it on your Web site. The link takes the form of the following:
https://skypecasts.skype.com/skypecasts/skypecast/detailed.html?id_talk=15783
The only portion of the link that differs from Skypecast to Skypecast is the
id_talk number appearing at the end of the link. You can place this on your
Web site by inserting the following snippet of HTML code into your Web page.
<a href=”https://skypecasts.skype.com/skypecasts/
skypecast/detailed.html?id_talk=15783”
target=”_blank”>My Skypecast Title</a>
The target=”_blank” portion tells the browser to open a new Web page
when clicking the link.
To find out the id_talk number of your Skypecast, go to the general
Skypecast directory listing and find your Skypecast. Click the link for your
Skypecast. When the browser opens to your Skypecast details, look at the
URL displayed in your browser. The digits appearing at the end of the URL is
your id_talk number.
There are ways to insert into your Web site a listing of all the Skypecasts for a
particular kind of search, such as all Skypecasts hosted by a specific Skype ID.
This is technical and involves JavaScript. By the time you read this, someone,
possibly Skype, may already have an HTML code snippet maker that automati-
cally constructs all this geeky HTML and JavaScript code. Look to our site
www.skype4dummies.com for up-to-date information on this. In addition, you
can add an RSS feed to your Web site without any complicated coding.
Adding a Skypecast RSS feed
Placing a hardwired link to the Skypecast details on your Web site is easy
enough, but if you hold multiple Skypecasts, it would sure be nice to list
every Skypecast in which you are the host.
Nowadays, people are starting to use RSS feeds to tap into information that
gets regularly updated. You can place an RSS link on your Web site. The RSS
link appears as follows:
http://feedsskypecasts.skype.com/skypecasts/webservice/fee
d.html?user=seasonedskyper
270
Part IV: The Professional Skyper 

In your link, change the name seasonedskyper to your Skype ID.
If you want to show the listing of all Skypecasts having business as one of the
keywords or tags, you can create a link like the following:
http://feedsskypecasts.skype.com/skypecasts/webservice/fee
d.html?tag=business
If you want to show all currently featured Skypecasts, you can include a link
to the following:

Moderating Your Skypecast
The day is here. Your Skypecast is due to start in five minutes. What do you do?
1. Sign on to join the Skypecast as you would if you were a participant.
The Skypecast conference window appears. Your name is on the top,
listed as the host. As people join in, Skype Names appear in a list. A little
timer is ticking away, letting everyone know how long the conference
has been on the air.
2. Introduce yourself and your topic. Start talking!
3. Invite participants to speak.
As the host, you are in control of the microphone. You can mute every-
one and give out the microphone only as members request it, or you can

What is an RSS feed?
It can be tiring to constantly check for changes
and additions to a Web site. To help keep up-to-
date and follow a particular topic, you can use
an RSS feed. RSS has many aliases. One of
them that is easy to remember is Really Simple
Syndication.
RSS is a sort of news feed that makes it easy to
get regular updates on a given topic. RSS is not
a product or software. Rather, it is a way to pub-
lish information in a format that many different
kinds of computer programs can read. People
who are making information available for distrib-
ution on the Internet don’t have to worry about
how the information is presented on every piece
of hardware and operating system on the planet.
Some Web browsers can automatically read the
content of an RSS feed. Other Web browsers let
you choose an RSS Reader extension to add to
your browser.

unmute everyone and have a free-for-all (see Figure 14-5). If you are host-
ing a sing-a-long or cheering a soccer team, you might want to open the
mikes up full throttle.
If anyone gets too rowdy, you always have the power to eject a person
from the Skypecast. After all, every community, even a virtual one, needs
a few rules.
Your new community is launched. You can follow up with other Skypecasts,
start a related forum on an existing Web site, or just maintain contact with
some new Skype buddies. Skypecasting will change as new features are
added and conferences become more tightly integrated into your regular
Skype client. Your Skypecasts may become
 Private events
 Invitational events
 Charity fundraisers
 Political caucuses
 High school reunions

Part IV: The Professional Skyper 

If you are an astronomer with an active stargazing site, you may soon be able
to post a direct link to a Skypecast from your Web site. The addition of video
into the Skypecast mix is a logical next step and, if developed, would multiply
opportunities for a rich forum available at little or no cost to everyone. It is a
remarkable tool for connecting people, and, although the look and feel of the
interface may not be the same a month from now, the basic utility of
Skypecasts as a community builder will remain the same.
Making Your Skypecast Everlasting
Skypecasts are live events. When they’re over, they’re over. However, some-
times you want to preserve the event. Some of the ways, and reasons, to save
a Skypecast are as follows:
 Transcribe your Skypecast:
• Extract quotes for an article or research paper.
• Generate captions for a video presentation of your Skypecast topic.
• Create a transcript for reference. This is a good technique for, say,
marketing research, developing a troubleshooting guide for software,
and harvesting unique phrases, idioms and terms for a short story.
 Save the Skypecast discussion by recording the audio:
• Extract audio quotes for a PowerPoint presentation.
• Import the audio track into a video-editing program to use as an
informational soundtrack.
• Create a podcast.
Tools for preserving your Skypecast
You can save Skypecasts as audio files or text documents by using a variety
of software and hardware tools. We’ve included some specific tool sugges-
tions. This is nowhere near an exhaustive list; but it’s a start.
Depending on the jurisdiction of where you are recording the Skypecast,
there may be legal requirements you need to adhere to that require you to
inform your participants that the session is being recorded. Please be certain
to inform the participants of your Skypecast that you are recording the event.
It is both courteous to your guests and it may be legally required!
273
Chapter 14: Skypecasting

Saving your audio by using hardware tools
To save the audio of a Skypecast with hardware tools, do the following:
1. Plug a USB speakerphone into your computer.
A speakerphone such as the Polycom unit described in Chapter 11
serves the need well.
2. Set up a traditional tape recorder, a mini-disc recorder, or a flash-
based recording unit to capture the audio.
If your recording is digital, you should be able to transfer your audio
recording directly to your computer. The way you move the file may differ
depending on your recording device and the manufacturer’s instructions.
If your recording device is not digital, we recommend that you consider
acquiring a digital recorder; they are rapidly becoming more affordable. 
Some digital recorders come equipped with a “T-bar” stereo micro-
phone. This type of microphone enables you to position the microphone
between yourself and the speakerphone so that a stereo recording of the
Skypecast has good sound separation.
Saving your audio by using an analog device
If you have a recording on a nondigital (analog) device such as a cassette
recorder, you can:
1. Attach a cable from the audio-out line of your recorder to the audio-in
line of your computer.
2. Select the Record button of your Windows XP Sound Recorder (choose
Start➪Programs➪Accessories➪Entertainment on your computer).
3. Click the Stop button upon reaching the end of the audio playback.
Note that files are saved as WAV files, which are much larger than MP3 files.
An hour’s recording may consume close to a gigabyte of disk space.
Saving your audio by using software tools
To save the audio of a Skypecast with software tools, use the following:
 Pamela or Skylook recording software for PC (see Chapter 9)
 Call Recorder for the Mac (see Chapter 11)
Transcribing Your Skypecast Recordings
So, you’re busy recording anyone who will let you capture a conversation,
and a folder is filling up with MP3s of interviews, meetings, stories, and plans
274
Part IV: The Professional Skyper 

on every subject. Some of those audio files are a great source of information
to have in written form. For example, much of the research done for this book
exists as recorded Skype calls preserved as audio files. But, as much as we
would like to play our audio recordings for you, we have a few practical
requirements. We are limited to paper and ink. That means that we have to
convert what we hear to what you read.
Listening to hours of Skype recordings while typing a transcript is a huge 
job made easier by a wonderful software program, Transcriber (see Figure
14-6), available at no cost from http://trans.sourceforge.net/en/
presentation.php. This software is available for download for Windows,
Mac, and Linux.
Transcriber’s features allow you to
 Import MP3 files.
 Create labels with the names of individual speakers.
 Create new sections when there is a change of topic.
 Segment audio portions and sync them with written files.
 Zoom and telescope the timeline.
 Incorporate the names of speakers in the timeline.
 Export transcription files as text or XML (getting not only the text but
also the time codes).
Figure 14-6:
The
Transcriber
program.
275
Chapter 14: Skypecasting

Transcriber shaves hours off the task of transcribing long audio sessions,
organizing text by topic and speaker, and publishing the transcript in print or
on the Web.
Getting started with Transcriber
Transcriber has many fancy features. But just a straight transcription, in
many cases, gets the job done. Here is the two-minute tutorial to get you
quickly up to speed:
1. Launch the software.
You are prompted to locate your digital recording (typically, an MP3 file). 
2. Open the sound file.
3. Begin transcribing by pressing the Tab key and typing what you hear.
To stop the playback, press the Tab key again.
Repeatedly pressing the Tab key starts and stops the playback. As you
get acclimated to transcribing, you will find that you often press the Tab
key at the start of a word or phrase, type the word or phrase, and press
the Tab key as you are about to resume listening and transcribing. In
this manner, you can just about do nonstop typing while slowing the
audio track to keep pace with your rate of typing.
Familiarizing yourself with Transcriber’s
bells and whistles
Transcriber has a ton of bells and whistles, including the ability to mark your
transcript with annotations on background noise, include music, identify dif-
ferent speakers, and even overlap speakers for any segment of your record-
ing. Here are some tips for using the more advanced features of Transcriber:
 To rewind the audio playback a few moments, press Alt+←. This feature
is useful when you are trying to transcribe something difficult to hear or
when the person is talking at 90 miles an hour. 
 To advance the playback to a later point in the timeline, press Alt+→.
There are bound to be moments where there is a pause or natural break.
Press the Enter key and continue typing. 
 Every time you press the Enter key, you insert a new segment in the
timeline, and the text window where you are transcribing inserts a new
line, starting with a bullet point. Your timeline at the bottom of the
window has dividing lines between segments. To move back and forth
276
Part IV: The Professional Skyper 

between segments, press the up arrow or down arrow key. In this
manner, you can swiftly move to just about any portion of a long record-
ing and rework the text for a particular segment.
 If you want to split a segment into two smaller ones, position your
cursor in the text at the place you want to make the split and then press
the Tab key to begin the audio playback for the segment. When you get
to the moment in the audio playback when the segment should be made,
press the Enter key to insert the segment.
 To join two segments into one, press Ctrl+backspace. Every now and
then, save your file. The file that gets saved has not only a text transcrip-
tion but also a time coding for each of the segments. This information
makes it easy to create captions for audio and video recordings.
 If you have a long recording such as an hour in length, want a word-for-
word transcription, and need to have all this done quickly, make three
copies of your audio file and distribute them to three people. Have one
person transcribe the first 20 minutes of the recording, another person
transcribe the second 20 minutes, and a third person do the remaining
portion. The three transcriptions can easily be merged.
 As a practical matter, if you need to do a word-for-word transcription
and are reasonably comfortable with the software and the typing, plan
on spending two-and-a-half to four times the audio recording time for
creating the actual transcription.
This software has tons of features. Just following the steps here will get you
off to a good start. Happy transcribing!
Podcasting Your Skypecast
You can preserve your Skypecasts and promote your ideas by hosting a
Skypecast, recording it, and turning it into a podcast. Podcasts make your
Skypecast ideas portable. Post your podcast on the Web, and anyone with a
portable player can download and play your newly transformed Skypecasts.
The word podcast is a combination of iPod and broadcast. Podcasts are audio
and video files published on the Web and downloadable onto iPod players
through the Apple iTunes software. Podcasts are becoming a popular way to
create personal “radio” programs. You can podcast on a regular basis, create
a fan base, and even have listeners subscribe to your show to automatically
download to iTunes as soon as you go on the air.
You can turn the MP3s of your Skypecast into a podcast in two ways. One
way is to make an RSS feed that points to the MP3 file. This is the quick-and-
dirty way. Everything in your unedited MP3 recording gets converted into
your podcast, including long stretches of silence, background noise, and
277
Chapter 14: Skypecasting

people fumbling around with their microphones and saying “Hello, can you
hear me now?” You can’t create lead-in music, include photos that get dis-
played on your browser, or make your iPod capable of displaying pictures.
Fortunately, taking the leap from the rudimentary transfer of it all to a mini-pro-
duction system complete with studio-style music lead-ins, sound effects, visual
effects, and captioning is easily done and inexpensive. Better yet, the tools for
the mini-production studio are intuitive and anything but geeky. The tools we
have in mind and recommend are found in the Apple iLife suite of software.
Creating a basic podcast 
on Windows or Mac
Skypecasts are great sources of content for new podcasts. In broad strokes,
to turn a Skypecast into a podcast, you must do the following:
 Record the Skypecast: Use Call Recorder for the Mac, Pamela Pro for 
the PC, or Audio HiJack for either platform to capture the audio.
 Edit your audio: Editing programs such as Audacity for Mac or PC, or
GarageBand on the Mac, enable you to cut, paste, and arrange your
audio files for your “show.”
 Create an RSS feed: RSS stands for Really Simple Syndication. When 
you create an RSS feed for your audio file, you are making your podcast
available for subscribing and downloading from a Web page. A variety 
of sources, such as Blogger (www.blogger.com) and FeedBurner
(www.feedburner.com), can create the RSS feeds for you.
 Add your podcast to your blog or Web site: To publicize your
Skypecast-turned-podcast, you can submit the RSS feed page to Apple
through iTunes. If the content is acceptable for posting, iTunes puts it
into its podcast directory. Your Skypecast is available for downloading.
Using FeedBurner to create a podcast
To use a tool such as FeedBurner, you need to have a blog or Web site set up
and available, so you have to flex your geek muscles a bit before using this
tool. If you are computing on a Macintosh, you can skip directly to the pod-
casting with iLife steps later in this chapter. To create an RSS feed with
FeedBurner, follow these steps:
1. Set up an account (you can start with a free account).
• Enter a username, password, and email address.
• Optionally, you can enter a secret question and answer, which is
useful in case you forget your password or require some funda-
mental change to your account.
• Click the Sign In button.
278
Part IV: The Professional Skyper 

2. In the screen labeled My Feeds, enter the URL of your blog or feed page.
This URL needs to be the actual page you are using for your podcast
(see Figure 14-7).
Also, select the I Am a Podcaster option. This option instructs
FeedBurner to use SmartCast, which makes your feed podcast ready.
3. Click Next.
A Welcome page opens (see Figure 14-8), in which you can enter your
feed title and feed address.
4. Give your feed its title and feedburner.com address.
FeedBurner guesses your feed title from your blog and allows you to set
the feed address (see Figure 14-8), which always starts with http://
feeds.feedburner.com/ and is followed by an editable word based
on your podcast title or podcast theme. An example is Skypecasting 
to Podcasting for the title and SkypecastingToPodcasting for the
feed address portion. The resulting URL becomes http://feeds.
feedburner.com/SkypecastingToPodcasting.
5. Click the Activate Feed button.
FeedBurner posts your feed, which is now live for anybody to view and
subscribe to as the RSS feed.

Chapter 14: Skypecasting

Using iLife to create a podcast using a Mac
Using Apple’s iLife ’06 suite of software and the .Mac portal, you can publish
the audio file of your Skypecast quickly. These tools work together:
 GarageBand. This is the iLife sound editing software. GarageBand has a
special track to add chapter markers, bookmarks, and graphics files to
an audio file for podcasting.
 iTunes. This is the iLife music library. Store your recorded Skypecast
files here by simply clicking the MP3 file to open it. The default player is
iTunes. After being opened in iTunes, it is stored in the iTunes library,
which makes it handy for you to retrieve the Skypecast MP3 file later.
 iPhoto. This is the iLife photo and image library. If you want to put any
artwork or photos in your podcast, park them in iPhoto by simply drag-
ging the images onto the iPhoto icon. If you are importing photos for
your podcast, your digital camera will automatically open iPhoto when
attached. Click Import to bring the photos into your library.
 iWeb. The iLife Web page editor automates the creation of an RSS feed.
This is major. RSS feeds are complicated even if you are a geek!
 .Mac Account. The Apple email and Web page services are completely
integrated with iLife. Publishing a Web page with a podcast is simply a
matter of pressing a few buttons.

Podcasting your recorded Skypecast is fairly straightforward, unless you
want to get fancy and add artwork, jingles, and sound effects. Be aware that
all your media-sound files, images, and photos must be stored in iLife soft-
ware so that you can access them easily. The basic steps are as follows:
1. Click the GarageBand guitar icon in your applications dock to launch
GarageBand (see Figure 14-9).
Click New Podcast Episode from the list of new project types.
2. Title your GarageBand podcast and click Save.
It’s a good idea to make a separate folder for your podcasts, especially if
you plan to do a series and save all the episodes in one place.
GarageBand opens (see Figure 14-9). Review the three main areas on the
screen:
• Tracks are located in the upper-left pane.
• Podcast artwork and chapters are in the lower-left pane.
• The Media Browser is on the right. Along the top of the Media
Browser, you see three tabs for Audio, Photos, and Movies.
3. Click the Audio tab in the media browser and select the MP3 file 
you want to podcast from the iTunes library displayed within the
GarageBand media browser.
4. Drag the MP3 file into a GarageBand audio track. 
You can change the name of any track by selecting the text and entering
a new name. You don’t have to add audio to every track. GarageBand
provides five tracks, labeled as follows:

Podcasting your Skype personality 
to the world
Skype is a rich environment for podcast content. Some ambitious skypers are
producing programs, which is a step up from casually recording a Skype con-
versation to help you recall the details of a meeting. You can create podcasts
of interviews, poetry readings, performances, news reports, and conferences
over Skype. Skypecasts, the large-scale audio conferences posted on the
Skype Web site, can be captured, edited, and converted into podcasts as well.
Call Recorder, HotRecorder, Audio Hijack, SAM, Pamela, and Skylook can all
be used to provide audio content for a podcast. However, some veterans of
the podosphere prefer more rigorous recording equipment, and podcast stu-
dios can get pretty geeky. Getting truly clean audio is a tricky business, espe-
cially when your environment is virtual. A good book that covers scores of
gadgets and techniques for producing podcasts is Podcasting For Dummies. It
even has an overview of equipment and editing software to get the best audio
production from Skype.

W
e all like to make lists, and here are a few of ours.
In this part, we offer ten ways to entice your mom
and other family members to hang out together more
often no matter how far apart you may be — and for free!
We also describe ways to promote your business to the
world with Web “presence” tools and local phone num-
bers on the other side of the globe. And finally, here are
ten ways for teachers to use Skype-to-Skype calling for
debates, book clubs, discussions, and research between
classrooms across town or across the world.

Chapter 15
Ten Reasons Your Mom (and Other
Family) Will Love Skype
O
ur friend Jessica contacted us over Skype while we were writing this
book. She lives in London, where Skype is wildly popular, and she joined
in on the fun. When we asked her how she used Skype, she replied the same
way virtually everyone responds: “ I use it to talk to my mom.”
Skype Is Free
The number one reason Mom would love Skype is that it is free. A free call
through Skype means that you can stay on longer. It also means that Mom
can leave the conversation to answer the door, baste the roast, or answer a
business colleague’s call without worrying about cost. With phones, time is
money; words have a price on their head. Skype makes having long-distance
conversations more like chatting in the same room.
Skype Is Easy
One of the authors of this book has a mom who is 84 years old. She hardly
ever touches the computer except to look over her husband’s shoulder (he’s
92). But when Skype was installed and the startup was automated by having
Remember My Password selected, Mom didn’t hesitate to grab the mouse by
its tail and click. The blue desktop icon with the big S in the middle is all
Mom has to know to connect.

Relive Mom’s Home Cooking from 
a Thousand Miles Away
Do special occasions always make you hungry for some mouth-watering child-
hood dish? (Perhaps you can still taste that strawberry shortcake your mom
baked for your birthdays.) Sadly, you may have totally forgotten, mistakenly
trashed, or never recorded Mom’s recipes. You’d have to call Mom, crush the
phone to your shoulder, and have her dictate the recipe (while spending as
much money on the call as you would on the ingredients). Now, with Skype,
Mom can tell you exactly how to make her Lemon Chicken, mix up her low-
cholesterol Cocoa Cake, and much more while you’re cooking. You can leave
Skype on and ask questions (or get spontaneous tips). In the process, Mom
can send you the recipe for good measure at the same time. Having a personal
cooking coach makes life in the kitchen that much easier. Besides, Mom may
use the “on air” practice to start a cooking show franchise on cable TV!
No-Sweat Party Planning
Organizing a family gathering can be a logistical nightmare, even if all the 
participants are local. Coordinating pickups, arrivals, and who is bringing the
dessert can be handled by a conference call or conference chat. Even if Mom
is not initiating the conference call, which requires more than one click 
(but not much more), she can still use this feature to connect with Paul in
Newburgh, Leah in Flemington, and Susan in Brooklyn. If the plans are made
with the message board, they persist, meaning that even after you quit the
program, when you start up again the transcript of the last chat remains. You
can even save all your planning chats with bookmarks (see Chapter 6). This
is a very handy feature to help keep the planning straight if your pen runs out
of ink or your calendar page runs out of writing room.
No-Sweat Messaging
Mom may or may not have been born to compute, but she’s sure to want to
take advantage of all its perks. A common family scenario is sharing travel
plans. This used to be simple (“Mom, I’m coming in on Flight 123 on Blue
Sky Airlines flying into YourCity terminal”). Now, parents, grandparents, 
and other interested parties want to know where you are every moment
you’re in the air. Doing so might require that you read a complicated URL 
or Web address over the phone so that family members can connect to a
flight-tracking Web site. Dictating a URL with endless letters, numbers, 
292
Part V: The Part of Tens 

underscores, slashes, and so on might require more time and patience than 
is at hand. The alternative, copying and pasting a URL into an email, may be
equally frustrating because some email programs don’t automatically trans-
late Web addresses into live links. Using Skype messaging enables you to
send Mom your itinerary with a live link to the airline to track your flight. If
there is some confusion, you can simply talk about it and explain what to do
on the spot. If Mom can hear it, and Mom can see it, Mom can do it (and that
goes for the rest of us).
Keeping Track
Most of us lead busy lives, and moms are among the busiest. In Skype, mes-
sages are more than a passing thought. They can be kept indefinitely. Skypers
can even go back in time. By choosing the History Tab in your main Skype
window, you can see a long list of Skype activities, including past text chats.
Click a chat item in your History list and you can reread the entire text con-
versation (see Chapter 6). In fact, you can even use the cute pushpin icon to
bookmark a specific conversation. It’s a great way for Mom to refresh her
memory, refresh your memory, and keep track of details.
The History view looks like a script for a play, and you don’t have subheadings
and attachment files to wade through to get a snapshot of a conversation.
Guilt-Free Interruptions
Calling Mom or other family members at their jobs is a bit of a nail-biter for
many people. Using a landline or cell phone, you never really know whether
you are calling at a bad time. On Skype, the status icons that announce your
availability alleviate the worry.
Chapter 3 tells you all about setting your online status icons.
Guilt-Free Reminders
Using the chat window as a just-in-time memory jogger in the background is 
a great way for Mom to be in contact when she needs to let you in on some
news. The neat thing about Skype is that even though you or your mom may
have posted the Offline status icon, you can still send each other a message.
On the Mac platform, Skype will even let each of you know, ever so politely,
that you “may not respond.”
293
Chapter 15: Ten Reasons Your Mom (and Other Family) Will Love Skype

Doing so doesn’t stop the message from getting through. This method sure
beats writing down that fleeting thought on a scrap of paper that disappears
among all the other scraps of paper and leads to the “There was something I
wanted to tell you” conversation. Mom can simply send a message before it
slips her mind (and vice versa), even while she’s waiting to board a plane for
a business trip. Juggling families and careers can be made just that much
easier with Skype.
Stamp-Free Announcements
Although receiving an invitation in the mail is lovely, there are just some
events that most of us can’t wait to tell the world. Besides, not all announce-
ments are “stamp worthy”; you’re not likely to send an “I bowled 300!” card.
Using “Mood Messages” (see Chapter 3), you can add a comment that
appears next to your Skype Name and is visible to all your contacts. It’s like
having a virtual public address system. Although Skype calls this a Mood
Message, meant to announce your state of mind to the world, there’s nothing
to stop you or Mom from using it for more practical things. She can post a
“hold the date” message for upcoming celebrations, let everyone know her
travel schedule, or even announce, ‘“I’m running the Boston Marathon on
Sunday.” The possibilities are endless!
Keep in Touch and Stay in Sight
With Skype, busy moms can see as well as hear their children, which is 
especially nice if their work takes them out of town. It is probably one of the
best reasons for parents, who often live far away from grown children, to use
Skype. Setup is easy and the payoff is huge. Moms can see how their children
are doing. Older moms can visit with grown children and see their grandchil-
dren. Younger moms may have school-age children at home with a nanny
while they’re at work. The video camera lets a mom traveling on business see
whether homework is done and school forms are filled out. Video contact
gives mom a feeling of well-being because she can check in — and see for 
herself — that everything is okay.
Families need a common arena. They may be scattered many miles or coun-
tries apart. Discovering a free forum that enables a very flexible method of
communicating (voice, written messages, video, announcements) can make
it easier for families to get closer. Phone calls lead to phone tag. Emails are
handy, but they are limited and out of sync with a casual conversation. Skype
helps families to see, hear, write, and archive messages with one another at
no cost beyond their Internet service bill.

Chapter 16
(Almost) Ten Ways to Promote
Your Business Using Skype
H
ere are ten cost-free ways to hypercharge your business and make it
both global and personal at the same time. Promoting your business is
not limited to an ad in the paper.
Notify Your Customers 
of Important News
Businesses can easily spend between 5 to 30 percent of their budget on
advertising. For a small business, advertising is a make-or-break expenditure.
For a large business, the choice is to spend the money or don’t be large any-
more. Skype has a sweet little utility that can grab the attention of customers
at the cost of, well, nothing. Called Mood Messages, these are comments that
you can post beside your Skype Name in a Contact list. They were originally
designed to indicate your mood to the world (“I’m on top of the world”; “I’m
in the zone today”; “The world is my oyster”) so that your contacts would
know your state of mind before calling.
For businesses, this feature is like having a PA system broadcasting to the
world. A business can use these messages to announce events, special sales,
and press releases, and the announcement appears in the Contacts window
of every person on your Contacts list. A subtle benefit is that your customers
feel more closely connected to your company even when you don’t have the
time and bandwidth to reach everyone personally. 
Here are some ideas for Mood Messages to promote your business:
 Fifty percent off sale starts today!
 Earnings and profits tripled over the last year!
 A shipment of 20 million vaccine doses delivered.

 We’re now open Thursday evenings till 10:00.
 Register your birthday and get a free dinner!
 Stockholders approve merger.
You can create a Mood Message in the Skype main window. Click your Skype
Name (see Figure 16-1) and enter your message.
Use SkypeWeb Alerts to Get Customers
What do sales people, actors, models, photojournalists, babysitters, and dog
groomers have in common? They all need to announce their availability to
customers. Using the SkypeWeb alert lets the world know you are ready for
business the minute you log on to Skype and choose your Skype Me option
(see Chapter 2). The SkypeWeb alert is a status button that signals your avail-
ability and a direct contact link to you. You can post a SkypeWeb alert on
your home page, a blog, an email signature block, and basically any Web page
that gives you an opportunity to post contact information. The SkypeWeb
button not only automates this process but also puts you literally one click
away from anyone who needs to reach you from the Web. See Chapter 12 for
details about getting and using the SkypeWeb button.
Make Your Business “Local” Anywhere
You live in Kansas, busily manufacturing ruby slippers that have suddenly
become all the rage in London and Sydney as well as in your hometown. You
want to build up the buzz around your product and make it easy for your cus-
tomers to purchase the popular ruby slippers with a local phone call. After
all, a great portion of sales comes from people buying either out of conve-
nience or on impulse.
Figure 16-1:
Setting your
Mood
Message.
296
Part V: The Part of Tens 

In a jiffy, you can establish SkypeIn phone numbers (see Chapter 8) that give
you a local presence in London, or Sydney, in addition to your physical pres-
ence in Kansas — and you can do it for less than $100 per year. Customers
now have a local and convenient phone number for product orders and cus-
tomer service, with customers from each continent on a different time zone.
Businesses that respond to the market quickly by promoting their products
can more ably compete, survive, and flourish. When you can establish a local
business presence across multiple continents for less than $100, you know
you’re not in Kansas anymore!
Conduct a Global Town Hall Meeting
A powerful way to promote your business is by simultaneously promoting a
good relationship with the community you serve. Skypecasting (see Chapter
14) provides a convenient and inexpensive venue for accomplishing these
goals. A local health clinic, for instance, may Skypecast an information ses-
sion on controlling cholesterol or providing support information for cancer
survivors and their family.
The community feels connected to that institution or company because they
are able to get quality information and answer questions directly. This kind of
Skypecast engenders trust, and trust translates to a larger customer base.
Informational Skypecasts can work for real estate firms explaining tax abate-
ment programs; pension consultants providing workshops on retirement 
benefits and strategies; law firms providing guidance on estate planning;
accounting firms explaining the implications of new financial reporting 
and disclosure procedure; product safety associations providing consumer
information; and financial consultants and accountants offering valuable tips
on how you can protect yourself from fraud and identity theft. In short, just
about any business with a need to provide consumer information outside the
sales cycle can greatly benefit from Skypecasting.
Mentoring and Training
Visiting your client’s office for one-to-one personal training and mentoring
helps to build a healthy customer relationship. Having that physical pres-
ence, especially when that client is a 1,000-plus miles away, is costly for both
you and the client. Why travel? The advent of video conferencing,Web-based
collaboration, and the ability to have both you and the client interactively
taking turns driving the mouse and keyboard, result in an alluring medium for
one-on-one mentoring, all with zero travel time and cost.
297
Chapter 16: (Almost) Ten Ways to Promote Your Business Using Skype

Here’s how to do it. Start with some Web conferencing software (see the links
on our Web site at www.skype4dummies.com). Set up your client on Skype.
Call your client over Skype and post a link to your private Web conferencing
and mentoring session. The client clicks the link, and within minutes, both of
you are actively engaged working together on a spreadsheet, a requirements
document, or whatever else fits the occasion. You can stop the session and
resume at any time, transfer files, post links on a Skype chat, and add others
to the Web mentoring session. This venue is sure to be a hit with your clients.
(See Chapter 10 for more about Web conferencing.)
Skype on a Business Card
These days, a business card typically contains your phone, email address,
and perhaps a Web site. So, why add your Skype ID? Well, during the late
1980s, people were beginning to place their email address on their business
cards, even though it raised a few eyebrows. In 1995, people started including
their Web address on their business cards before it became popular. Now it’s
commonplace — in fact, often required — to add email addresses and Home
page URLs to contact information. No one questions why. Soon, a Skype
Name may be as ubiquitous.
People value the ability to see around corners for that next big thing. Placing
your Skype Name signals that you’re onto something — and, more important,
somewhere during your career, you’re likely to find that having that Skype
connection will land you a contract, engagement, or a new job.
Large-Scale Online Conferencing
Imagine trying to set up an audio conference call to accommodate the 500 or
so shareholders in your public company as you review quarterly earnings. If
you provide a toll-free number, the call can cost you something like ten cents a
minute per caller. This amounts to $50 per minute, or $3,000 per hour. Ouch!
An alternative approach is to use a Skype-related service that allows Skype
users to dial in from their Skype software to the audio conference at no cost.
This free service can accommodate up to 500 attendees at a time.
To take advantage of this service, sign up for a free account at (www.
highspeedconferencing.com) and begin using your dedicated con-
ference calling number right away (see Chapter 12).
298
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Promotionals and Giveaways
We’ve all come across a pen that has a company name and logo inscribed 
in gold or silver lettering. This sort of advertising is a large industry that
manufactures thousands of give-away items such as address books, balloons,
business card holders, bags or totes, and many more. Rather than give your
customers a free calendar or tote bag, how about two hours of SkypeOut
credit? Who wouldn’t love to have a slick speakerphone with loads of
SkypeOut minutes included in the purchase price? Your customers will rave
about the benefits of buying from your business, and this may pave the way
for some well-deserved sales.
Promotionals with Skype are bound to expand. It may be only a matter of
time before the airlines are trading travel miles for Skype minutes. The same
is true with credit card companies for purchases, and banks for opening
accounts.
Improve Customer Service 
with Skype Call Transfer
If you’re a business user seeking to set up call center functionality or a software
developer creating Customer Relationship Management–like applications, then
you’re in luck. Skype can provide you with the means of dynamically routing
and transferring incoming calls from one Skype user to another. Here’s one sce-
nario: Your customer makes a free call using Skype. The call center recognizes
the Skype Name of the customer and routes the call to the appropriate party.
No need for an operator or extension numbers. Instead of passing the buck,
you’re passing the benefits of decreased customer servicing expenses with
higher satisfaction — a win-win combination.

Ten Ways to Use Skype at School
S
chools have outgrown inkwells, slates, and typewriters. Email, instant
messaging, and the Internet have opened the classroom to the world.
Skype empowers students and teachers even further by adding features for
collaboration, live video, and instant file sharing. This chapter offers some
ways to energize school and learning with Skype.
Connect to the World on 
a Teacher’s Budget
Telephones are a scarce commodity in classrooms. Telephones with interna-
tional calling plans . . . well, we haven’t seen one of those yet in a classroom
(unless it’s a teacher’s personal cell phone). The impact and benefit of stu-
dents speaking with students across the globe brings an authenticity to edu-
cation that adds immeasurably to both textbooks and Web references. Skype
makes it easy to connect to other people, other cultures, and other countries.
Classrooms may not have telephones, but they are often wired for the
Internet. Skype is a service that teachers and students can access using 
the hardware they already have in their rooms. It’s common knowledge that
teachers spend, on average, $500 out of their own pockets to stock their
classrooms. Skype fits into a teacher’s budget. It’s free.
Master a Foreign Language 
(Or Practice a Phrase)
The old pen-pal model takes on a new approach when the pen is a mouse 
and a microphone and the paper is virtual. Having students speak to each
other over Skype benefits each language group simultaneously. Of course, 
the knotty question is, how do you find safe, viable, dynamic forums for
second-language practice?

A Web-savvy teacher with a desktop and a high-speed line can create a gath-
ering place to reach language learners. Schools from Italy, the United States,
Turkey, Sweden, England, and more have connected with each other over
Skype to help students master foreign languages through educator-mediated
Web forums (see Chapter 13). The schools control their projects and connec-
tivity. A main Web site functions like a town square, a place to find kindred
spirits and post Skype contact names. Schools sign up educators, contact
each other, and arrange student conversations. Teachers are in charge and
students have a blast.
Have School Beyond the Classroom Door
Ten years ago, one of the authors (Susan) attended an educational confer-
ence in London. One of the presenters, a teacher from Buffalo, New York,
revealed that although she was in London, her English writing class was 
still on schedule. At the time, Susan was astonished to discover a use for the
brand-new technology, email, in education. Students couldn’t skip their writ-
ing assignments and couldn’t blame the dog, the spilled soup, or the late bus.
Their teacher, on the other hand, couldn’t even suspend class because she
was across the ocean.
That teacher-across-the-ocean model is even easier with Skype. Students 
can still transfer over their assignments, but not as attachments that may be
garbled by email protocols, or as pasted text that loses all its formatting. A
quick file transfer, in mid-chat or mid-conversation, brings the assignment
from student to teacher in record time. In addition, teachers can use the
Mood Message option to post a note next to his or her Skype Name to let 
students know what topic is on the agenda, when an assignment is due, or
just that they are doing great work. Remote teachers can encourage students
with similar interests to work together, encourage older students to mentor
younger ones, or simply hold class with the Skype conference facility.
Provide Professional Development
Skype brings professional development to the teacher, coach, or mentor
when and where they need it. The common model of improving teaching
skills gathers teachers in one place for a one-size-fits-all workshop. With
Skype, teacher mentors can deliver personalized training directly to the
classroom on subjects teachers need. Whether the interaction occurs one on
one, through a mini-conference, or on an as-needed advice line, using Skype
skips the expense, the travel, and the time out of the classroom for teachers.
302
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Here’s a real-world example: A staff developer in the New York City school
system is charged with supporting the instructional technology for students
who are blind. The teachers he works with often have questions about voice
output technology and other assistive software installed on students’ desk-
top computers. The Skype environment provides needed guidance “on-site,”
on the very computer that students need to use (and that teachers need to
configure).
Encourage Student Collaboration
Skype is a natural environment for student collaboration. In one software
setup, students can talk with each other and send drafts of files to everyone
in the group to review and interject with text comments. Archives of Skype
text messaging conversations can bring fellow students up-to-date if they
miss a meeting. Students can work on school newspapers, use video to prac-
tice a senior play, try debate strategies, and even organize school events.
Host Poetry Slams, Debates, 
and Book Clubs
Organizing a competition, performance, or club involves much decision-
making beyond picking a time and place to host these activities. But if the
time and the place were virtual, most of the effort would involve the educa-
tional content of the activity rather than endless logistical planning. Children
in different schools, counties, and even countries could gather at arranged
times to discuss books, deliver a book report, or read their own stories. A
Skype voice and videoconference can, and does, serve as an exciting interna-
tional locale for poetry performance or “slams” (competitions). Each class
that participates projects the Skype conference and video windows with an
LCD projector so that everyone can see the action.
Five to ten classes (or venues) can conference an event. Student poets or
debaters can face their counterparts anywhere in the state, the country, or
even the world. The students can rate one another’s performance, offer com-
ments, expand viewpoints, or simply post an emoticon in a simultaneous
chat window to provide another layer of participation.
303
Chapter 17: Ten Ways to Use Skype at School

In an increasingly virtual environment, it is not just fun but also necessary for
students to hone presentation skills for a virtual audience. Making a speech 
is scary. We all know what it’s like (butterflies in the stomach, sweaty palms,
weak knees) to face a class and deliver a research paper or argument (or even
make a toast at a wedding). The same dread happens with online presenta-
tions, and developing an online comfort level when facing virtual audiences is
an important skill. The opportunity to start practicing in a safe place — the
classroom — and in a cost-free environment — Skype — is a great beginning.
Record a Group Thought Process
Students get together to prepare material, study for exams, or work on after-
school club activities. But sometimes a student who is busy hatching a great
idea may not be listening to the other great ideas being put forth by his or
her student collaborators. Here’s where voice recording comes in handy: You
can use third-party software to make a sound file of a Skype call or confer-
ence. Play it back to hear all the nuances you missed or to find all the facts
you didn’t have time to jot down (see Chapters 9, 11, and 14). Record a dra-
matic dialogue, foreign language pronunciation, debate arguments, or an oral
presentation as it’s happening for instant feedback to provide students with
help on making improvements.
Use Skype as a Homework Helper
Although some large cities have extensive Web sites with live homework
helpers ready to guide a youngster through a difficult assignment, smaller
towns may not have the means to set up an after-school resource center.
Skype can double as a quick connection to a teacher, librarian, or even a 
traveling parent for a child in the midst of a homework crisis.
Conduct Read-Alouds
One of the most important ways to inspire children to read is by reading aloud
to them. Schools can arrange to have an author read a story over Skype so that
the entire class can enjoy a favorite book and then ask questions for an author
study. Other remote readers might be local business owners, elected officials,
athletes, or other local leaders. Some local theater groups get involved in liter-
acy education by offering read-alouds in classrooms. They can expand their
service by adding a Skype call to the classroom read-aloud. It would be like the
old radio shows that used to broadcast to the world while performing in front
of a live audience.

But Skype storytelling is not limited to school hours or even schools. A
nightly Skype story delivered by a working or traveling parent can continue a
valuable routine that job responsibilities might interrupt. A creative grand-
mother can read stories to all her grandchildren at one time in an organized
conference.
Support Special-Needs Students
Children with special needs often have unique problems that make the
school experience difficult. Some children with developmental delays,
autism, or speech and language problems cannot easily describe their day
when they return home after school. Teachers write notes, phone when they
can, and try to make up for the lack of communication during open school
night. With Skype, teachers can send a description of the day over a chat or
file transfer, and offer Skype conference hours after school or during adminis-
trative periods during the school day. Teachers can also help direct a parent
with a struggling learner by modeling teaching techniques. The parent and
child are at home and the teacher coaches through Skype. The natural setting
and the convenient, supportive, communication change the very nature of
the parent/teacher conference!
Skype can also offer a unique combination of accessible modes of language.
Children who are blind can join in an audio Skype conference. Children who
are hearing impaired can engage in a written chat. Children who use sign 
language can use the video mode as well as the chat for maximum flexibility.
Children who are homebound can actually join in a school-based classroom
without expensive teleconferencing equipment. Skype connects the special-
needs student with new opportunities for learning.

 Editing Skype menu items
D
o you speak French, Swedish, or Turkish and want to set your Skype
window menus in those languages? Skype supports 27 different languages
and enables you not only to load any one of them but also edit individual menu
items. You can add an entirely new language to your Skype window, or just
make small changes. 
Changing Skype to Your 
Language of Choice
Setting your language of choice is easy. With the Skype main window open,
choose Tools➪Change Language and pick a language from the list that
appears (see Figure A-1). Your Skype menus are instantly changed.
You can easily edit and alter all the menu items and text labels that appear in
Skype to suit your own needs. Here’s how:
1. Choose Tools➪Change Language➪Edit Skype Language File.
You see a table with 2,600 editable Skype menu items (see Figure A-2). 
2. To edit an item, select it by clicking in a field in the Current column.
For example, click the status alert Do Not Disturb. Change the text a
little to Do Not Disturb Please. Click Apply so that Skype knows to apply
your changes. Repeat this step for every Skype term you want to edit.

3. Click Save As and adjust the language filename, which is saved as a
.lang file (see Figure A-3). 
Saving your customized language file allows you to load these applied
changes to other computers on which you may be using Skype. This file
can be emailed, archived to a CD-ROM or flash drive, or even transferred
to other Skype users through Skype’s file transfer facility (see Chapter 6).
