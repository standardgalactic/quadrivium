Signals and Systems
This textbook provides a solid foundation in system modelling, system analysis, and deterministic 
and random signals and systems, enabling students to develop an instinctive grasp of the 
fundamentals. The book begins with the basics of analog signals and introduces the concept of 
DT signals. It then covers the sampling processes in detail and discusses signals and operation 
on signals for both CT and DT signals. It includes Fourier transform and Laplace transform with 
adequate theory and numerical problems. With an emphasis on the advanced techniques used for 
signal processing, especially for speech and image processing, the properties of continuous time and 
discrete time signals are explained with many numerical problems. Real-life examples are provided 
to discuss the physical significance of different properties. Besides each concept is presented with 
MATLAB programs, output plots and simulation examples to help students execute simulations 
and verify their outputs. The book would interest students of electrical and communication 
engineering and computer science. This is an exceptional resource for anyone looking to develop 
their understanding of signals and systems.

It gives me immense satisfaction in presenting this book to my students who 
have been eagerly waiting to see it. The difficulties encountered by students in 
understanding the physical significance of different concepts inspired me to 
write a student-friendly book, rich in technical content. The subject Signals 
and Systems is essential for undergraduate students of Electronics Engineering, 
Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, and Instrumentation Engineering 
disciplines. The subject has a diverse range of applications. A thorough 
knowledge of different transforms studied in Mathematics is essential for an 
understanding of the subject.
 The subject involves a number of complex algorithms which require in-
depth domain knowledge. If a concept is explained with concrete examples 
and programs, the reader will definitely take interest in the field. The 
reader will experience great joy when she observes tangible outcomes of an 
experiment on her computer screen. A number of signals occurring in nature 
like speech, ECG, EEG etc. have some random components. Research in this 
field is somewhat difficult. Despite significant progress in an understanding 
of the subject, there remain many things which are not well grasped. There 
is room for explaining the basic concepts of signals and systems, in a better 
manner. Different concepts are illustrated here using MATLAB programs. 
The outputs of the MATLAB programs are given in the form of graphs. With 
extensive experience in signals and systems research, I observed, that people 
require significant amount of time before they can begin grasping the subject. 
However with proper guidance, a person can acquire considerable knowledge 
in this field. The motivation behind this book has been, that a new comer be 
provided information about where and how to start and how to proceed.
There was a request from my students as well as from well wishers that I 
write a book on signals and systems. It was also suggested that the book include 
the theory of random signals. Several concrete examples have been given to 
illustrate the concepts pertaining to random signals. For better understanding, 
we have included output from many MATLAB programs. Interpretations of 
the results are also explained, which will not only help the reader but also 
enable instructors to incorporate the examples into their classroom teaching. 
The book seeks to rigorously examine the subject of Deterministic and 
Random Signals and Systems. It will provide a solid foundation for specialized 
Preface

courses in signal processing at both the undergraduate and postgraduate levels 
and will serve as a basic practical guide for PhD students.
I have enjoyed whatever little work I have done in signals and systems. 
Although I have stated that I undertook this project for new comers to the 
field, it was also done with a desire to further my own knowledge. 
 
 
Acknowledgments
I am thankful for the encouragement that my late husband, Dinkar gave 
me. I have few words to describe my gratitude for his inspiration. I am also 
grateful for the inspiration provided by my students from Walchand College 
of Engineering, Sangli and from Rajarshi Shahu College of Engineering, Pune. 
I sincerely thank all the students who worked under my guidance for their 
undergraduate, postgraduate or PhD projects. Their painstaking efforts and 
sincerity encouraged me to seek newer challenges. We carried out lots of 
experiments in Signal Processing, which besides enriching the knowledge of 
my students also improved my understanding of the subject. The curiosity of 
the students to understand the physical significance of each concept prompted 
me to undertake this project after completion of projects titled “Digital Signal 
Processing”, “Speech and Audio Processing” and “Advance Digital Signal 
Processing”. The constant demand by my students that I write a book on 
“Signal and Systems” accelerated my work. 
I got a lot of help and inspiration from my family members especially from 
my late husband Dinkar, my son Anand, daughter-in-law Aditi, daughter 
Amita and son-in-law Prasad. I thank my colleagues Bhalke and Tirmare for 
giving me useful suggestions; my student Prashul for helping me type some of 
the examples; the reviewers from different countries for reviewing and giving 
me concrete suggestions. 
The idea of publishing the book materialized when Manish Choudhary from 
Cambridge University Press accepted the proposal for this book. I am grateful 
to him. I also express my gratitude to the team at Cambridge University Press 
for the cooperation and strong support during the review and proofreading 
stages. 
Finally, I wish to thank all who helped me directly and indirectly for their 
support during the long process of producing this book.
I look forward to feedback on this book at:  sdapte@rediffmail.com

Introduction to Signals
1
We discuss the basic definitions of analog/continuous time (CT) and discrete 
time (DT) signals in this chapter. We need to understand the basics of 
discrete time signals, i.e., the sampled signals. The theory of sampled signals 
is introduced in this chapter. The analog signal is first interfaced to a digital 
computer via analog to digital converter (ADC). ADC consists of a sampler 
and a quantizer. We will mainly discuss the sampler in this chapter. The analog 
signal, when sampled, gets converted to discrete time (DT) signal. Here, the 
time axis is digitized with a constant sampling interval T. The inverse of T is 
the sampling frequency. The sampling frequency must be properly selected for 
faithful reconstruction of the analog signal.
  1.1 
Introduction to Signals
Any physical quantity that carries some information can be called a signal. 
The physical quantities like temperature, pressure, humidity, etc. are 

Signals and Systems

continuously monitored in a process. Usually, the information carried by 
a signal is a function of some independent variable, for example, time. The 
actual value of the signal at any instant of time is called its amplitude. These 
signals are normally plotted as amplitude vs. time graph. This graph is termed 
as the waveform of the signal. The signal can be a function of one or more 
independent variables. Let us now define a signal.
Definition of a signal A signal can be defined as any physical quantity that 
varies with one or more independent variables.
Let us consider temperature measurement in a plant. The measured value of 
temperature will be its amplitude. This temperature changes from one instant 
of time to another. Hence, it is a function of time, which is an independent 
variable, as it does not depend on anything else. Temperature can be measured 
at two different locations in a plant. The values of temperature at two different 
locations may be different. Hence, the temperature measured depends on 
the time instant and also on the location. We can say that temperature is a 
function of two independent variables, namely time and location in a plant. 
This temperature can take on any continuous value, like 30.1, 30.001, 31.3212, 
etc. The time axis is also continuous i.e. the temperature is noted at each 
time value. The signal is then called continuous time continuous amplitude 
(CTCA) signal.
Definition of a CTCA/Analog signal When the signal values are continuous 
and are noted at each continuous time instant (the independent variable) the 
signal is said to be a CTCA signal. Analog signal is shown in Fig. 1.1.
Fig. 1.1 Plot of the analog signal
If we now decide to note the temperature after one second, for instance, we 
will get continuous values of temperature at discrete instants. We will now 
define Discrete Time Continuous Amplitude (DTCA) signal.
Definition of a DTCA/DT signal When the signal values are continuous 
and are noted at each discrete time instant, namely the independent variable, 
the signal is said to be a DTCA signal. This DT signal is shown in Fig. 1.2.
Definition of a DTDA or Digital signal A digital signal, also called as 
DTDA signal, is obtained when amplitude axis is also discretized.

  1.2 Sampling Theorem
When any signal is to be sampled, one must have some prior knowledge 
about the signal, namely, its frequency contents. This information is generally 
known to us. For example, a telephone grade speech signal contains useful 
information only up to 3.4 kHz. The signal may then be filtered to remove the 
frequency contents, if any, above 3.4 kHz to ensure that the signal bandwidth 
is within 3.4 kHz. We will now define Sampling Theorem. Consider any 
band-limited signal of bandwidth W. 
Theorem
When any energy signal that is band-limited with a bandwidth 
W is sampled using a sampling frequency ≥ 2W, it is possible to reconstruct 
signal from signal samples. 
The sampling rate of 2W is called Nyquist rate. The sampling frequency 
selected is denoted as FS. We will denote the Nyquist frequency FS /2 as FN. 
When an analog signal is sampled, the most important factor is the selection 
of the sampling frequency. In simple words, Sampling Theorem may be stated 
as, “Sampling frequency is appropriate when one can recover the analog signal 
back from the signal samples.” If the signal cannot be faithfully recovered, 
then the sampling frequency needs correction. Let FS denote the sampling 
frequency. We will consider two different cases to understand the meaning of 
proper sampling. 
Concept Check
• What is sampling theorem in time domain?
• How do we find the Nyquist rate?
  1.3 Sampling of Analog Signals (Case I)
Consider a signal with a bandwidth of 10 Hz. We sample it using FS = 100 Hz. 
That is
Fs > 2W(2 × 10Hz) Hz

Signals and Systems
4
We will concentrate on the highest frequency component of the signal, namely, 
F = 10 Hz. There will be 10 samples obtained per cycle of the waveform.
To get a deeper insight into the sampling process, we introduce the 
theoretical concept of an impulse train. In the time domain, the sampled signal 
is obtained by multiplying the sinusoidal waveform with a train of impulse 
with separation of TS = 1/FS = 1/100, as shown in Fig. 1.3.
Fig. 1.3 Samples of the wave obtained by multiplication of the wave 
  
 
   with an impulse train
Multiplication of two signals in time domain is equivalent to convolution 
of their transforms in the frequency domain. (This is discussed in detail 
in Chapter 5.) When the signal is sampled using a sampling frequency of

Introduction to Signals
5
10F = 10*10 = 100 Hz, the signal of frequency F gets multiplied by a train 
of impulses with a separation interval of T = 1/FS, that is, 1/100. In the 
frequency domain, the Fourier Transform (FT) of the signal and FT of 
the impulse train will convolve with each other. The FT of a sinusoid 
with a 10 Hz frequency is a spectral line at 10 Hz, that is, at 0.1FS. The FT 
of an impulse train is again the impulse train with a separation interval of 
1/TS, that is, FS (100 Hz). Hence, the convolution of two transforms results in 
a signal spectrum replicated around zero frequency and frequencies that are 
multiples of 100 Hz, as shown in Fig. 1.4.

     impulse train)

Concept Check
• What must be the sampling frequency if the signal bandwidth is 50 Hz?
• What is the Fourier transform of the impulse train?
• What is the Fourier transform of a sinusoid with frequency of 40 Hz?
  1.4 
Recovery of Analog Signals (Case I)
The convolved spectrum in Fig. 1.5 shows replicated copies of the signal 
spectrum around zero frequency and multiples of the sampling frequency. The 
replicas are well separated, that is, there is no mixing of adjacent replicas. The 
signal spectrum around zero frequency can be easily isolated if the convolved 
spectrum is passed via a rectangular window between –50 Hz and 50 Hz (–FN
to +FN), as shown in Fig. 1.5. The resulting isolated signal spectrum is then 
inverse Fourier transformed to recover the original signal of 10 Hz.
Fig. 1.5 Isolation of signal spectrum by passing the convolved 
  
 
     spectrum via a rectangular window

Introduction to Signals
7
There is a multiplication of convolved spectrum and a rectangular window 
in Fourier domain, as shown in Fig. 1.3. This is equivalently a convolution of 
the signal samples with the impulse response of the ideal (brick wall) low-pass

The reconstruction process is complicated involving the infinite weighted 
sum of the function g(t) and its shifted versions. The reconstruction formula is 
only of theoretical interest. Practically, the signal is just low-pass filtered with 
the cut-off frequency of the signal bandwidth to recover the signal.

  1.5 Sampling of Analog Signals (Case II)
Now, let us consider the 90 Hz signal component present in a signal with a 
bandwidth of 90 Hz. Let it be sampled using a sampling frequency of 100 Hz. 
The sampling frequency FS is below the Nyquist rate (2 × bandwidth = 180 
Hz). We will get 10 samples per 9 cycles of the waveform, as shown in Fig. 1.7. 
The sampled signal is obtained as a multiplication of the 90 Hz signal with a 
train of impulse with a period of 0.01 s. 
In the transform domain, there will be convolution of the transform of the 
90 Hz signal, that is, a spectral line at 90 Hz and the transform of the impulse 
train, that is, an impulse again with the period of FS (100 Hz), as shown in Fig. 
1.8. We can notice from the figure that the replicated spectral lines overlap or 
cross each other in the convolved spectrum.

Note The signal that will be reconstructed from these samples is a 10 Hz signal  
              with a 180° phase shift.
1.6
Recovery of Analog Signals (Case II)
The convolved spectrum in Fig. 1.6 shows replicated copies of the signal 
spectrum around zero frequency and multiples of the sampling frequency, 
that is, 100 Hz. The replicas are not well separated and there is mixing of 
adjacent replicas. The signal spectrum around zero frequency has 90 Hz and 
–90 Hz components, whereas the replica around 100 Hz has 10 Hz and 190 
Hz components and the replica around –100 Hz has –190 Hz and –10 Hz 
components. The replica of 90 Hz around 100 Hz appears as a 10 Hz signal. 
We say that 90 Hz is aliased as 10 Hz. The overlapping of the spectrum does 
not allow the isolation of the 90 Hz signal. We can use a low-pass filter of 50 
Hz, that is, FN to filter the spectrum and it will then pass 10 Hz, which is an 
aliased version of 90 Hz. 
The phenomenon of high-frequency components in the spectrum of the 
original signal taking the identity of low-frequency in the spectrum of its 
sampled version is called aliasing effect. The high frequencies are aliased as 
low frequencies.

   the replica of 90 Hz around 0 Hz (dashed lines). The 90 Hz 
                                     signal is aliased as a 10 Hz signal when the spectrum is passed 
via a 50 Hz window (50 Hz being Nyquist frequency)

When the signal is sampled, time will be digitized with a sampling interval 
of T. Every next sample is obtained after time T. So, the nth sample will be 
obtained at t = n × T. Substituting t = n × T in Eq. (1.3) we get

Now, put T = 1/FS, that is, 1/100 Hz. T is normally dropped in the representation 
of X as T is a constant.

Here f represents the digital frequency given by f = F/FS where F is the analog

Now comparing Eqs (1.6) and (1.7), we find that f = 1/10 will recover the 
10 Hz signal from its sampled version.

Comparing Eqs (1.13) and (1.7), we get f = –1/10. This will recover the 10 Hz 
signal from its sampled version with a phase shift of 180° (refer to the note in 
Fig. 1.6). We find that sinusoids up to 50 Hz frequency (Nyquist frequency) 
are properly recovered. Sinusoids between 50 Hz and 100 Hz, that is, between 
Nyquist frequencies and the sampling frequency are shifted in phase and are 
aliased as (100 – the original frequency). Here, 90 Hz gets aliased as 10 Hz with 
180° phase shift. The analog and the corresponding digital frequencies with 
phase can be represented in a graph form, as shown in Fig. 1.9. 
We can now conclude that the analog frequencies above 0.5FS are always 
aliased and take the value between 0 and 0.5FS. The frequency 0.5FS is called 
the folding frequency. Undersampling, that is sampling below the Nyquist 
rate, not only changes the frequency of the original signal but also changes the 
phase. Only two phase values are possible, 0° and 180°. If the frequency of the 
analog signal is between 0 and FS/2, the phase is zero. If the analog frequency 
is between FS/2 and FS, the phase value is 180°, as shown in Fig. 1.9.

Solution
The signal contains three frequencies, namely, 25 Hz, 150 Hz and 50 Hz. The 
highest frequency is 150 Hz. The recommended rate of sampling is 300 Hz 
(2 × 150 Hz).
If the signal is a sampling frequency of 200 Hz, substituting t = n × TS = n/FS

Now, the signal has three digital frequencies, namely, f = 1/8, f = –1/4, f = 1/4. 
Equation (1.19) represents the DT signal obtained after sampling.
The recovered signal frequencies are f = 1/8, that is, F = 25 Hz; f = –1/4, that 
is, F = 50 Hz with a phase shift of 180°; f = ¼, that is F = 50 Hz. We see that the 
150 Hz signal is aliased as 200 – 150 Hz, that is, 50 Hz with 180° phase shift. 
The recovered signal contains only two frequencies, namely, 25 Hz and 50 Hz, 
whereas the original signal had three frequencies 25 Hz, 150 Hz and 50 Hz.

Anti-Aliasing Filter
It is clear from the above examples that when the signal is sampled with a 
sampling frequency of FS, the frequencies above FS/2 are aliased. The signal 
bandwidth is known; however, the signal may contain some spurious noise 
above FS/2. The noise frequencies above FS/2 will then be aliased and will 
affect the original signal frequencies. To ensure that the spurious noise does 
not affect the signal components, it is recommended that the signal is passed 
via a low-pass filter of a cut-off frequency FS/2 prior to sampling. The low-pass 
filter is termed as anti-aliasing filter. This confirms that the signal bandwidth 
is really FS/2.

We find that the signal contains frequencies as 40 Hz, 50 Hz and 75 Hz. So the

Anti-aliasing filter must have a cut-off frequency of 75 Hz.

Summary
In this chapter, we have described and explained the following important 
concepts. 
• 
We have started with the statement of sampling theorem in time domain. 
When a time domain signal is sampled, the sampling frequency must be 
such that it must be possible to recover the signal from the signal samples. 
The theorem says that the sampling frequency must be selected as greater 
than or equal to twice the maximum frequency present in the signal, that 
is, the bandwidth of the signal. This indicates that only band-limited 
signals can be sampled.
• 
Sampling is explained using the concept of impulse train. When a signal 
is sampled, it is multiplied by the impulse train. In Fourier domain, there 
will be convolution of the spectrum of the signal with Fourier Transform 
(FT) of impulse train, which is again the impulse train. To recover 
the signal from signal samples, we multiply the convolved spectrum 
with a rectangular window between –FN and FN. In time domain, there 
will be convolution of signal samples with a sync function (inverse 
Fourier transform of rectangular window). The sync function acts as an 
interpolation function and the signal can be reconstructed provided the 
adjacent replicated spectra do not overlap, that is, the sampling frequency  
FS > 2 × Bandwidth. When the sampling frequency is smaller than 2 × 
bandwidth, the spectrum passed via a rectangular window between –FN
and FN is for the aliased frequency. The high frequencies are aliased as 
low frequencies. The phase reversal occurring when the analog frequency 
is greater than FN and less than FS was explained using the analytical 
treatment. The aliased frequency is then FS-analog frequency. 
• 
The need for anti-aliasing filter is emphasized. When the signal is passed 
via a low-pass filter with a cut-off frequency equal to the bandwidth,

the high-frequency components are eliminated to ensure the signal 
bandwidth. This eliminates the possibility of aliasing.

This chapter aims to introduce basic concepts related to CT and DT signals and 
operations on the signals such as translation, scaling, addition, multiplication, 
etc. 
Natural signals like speech, seismic signal, Electro Cardio Gram (ECG) 
and Electro Encephalogram (EEG) signals are processed using sophisticated 
digital systems. All these information-carrying signals are functions of the 
independent variables, namely, time and space. We first deal with basic 
definition and classification of signals.
  2.1 Signals
We have gone through the basics of signals in chapter 1. We will go through it 
in detail in this chapter. Let us first define a signal. 

Signals and Operations on Signals
25
Definition of a signal A signal is defined as a single valued function of an 
independent variable, namely, time that conveys some information. At every 
instant of time there is a unique value of the function. The unique value may 
be real or complex. 
A signal X is represented as X = F(t), where F is some function and t 
represents time, the independent variable. Here, time is a continuous variable 
and X also takes on continuous values. X is then termed as continuous time, 
continuous amplitude (CTCA) signal that is the analog signal. When a signal 
is written as some mathematical equation, it is deterministic in the sense 
that the signal value at any time t can be determined using the mathematical 
equation. A signal is called scalar-valued if its value is unique for every 
instant of time. Most of the naturally occurring signals are scalar-valued, real, 
analog and random in nature. Speech signal is an example of such naturally 
occurring random signals. Speech signal is generated when a person utters a 
word. Researchers are still trying to generate a model for speech signal and 
exact mathematical equation cannot be written for a speech signal. It has a 
random signal component of some strength. It is called as random signal. If 
a signal has multiple values at any instant of time, it is called vector-valued. 
For example, color images, where at every pixel there is a three-dimensional 
vector representing RGB color components. In this chapter we will refer to 
scalar-valued and deterministic signals only. Hence, the signals will always be 
represented in the form of an equation.
Example 2.1
Consider the equation given by x(t) = cos(2p ft) where f is a frequency of a 
cosine wave. Is x(t) a signal? Is it a scalar signal?
Solution
Here, time t is an independent variable. x is some function of an independent 
variable namely time. So x(t) represents a signal. The signal x is real valued 
and is a scalar signal, as x has a unique value given by cos(2p ft) at every time 
instant t. The plot of the signal is represented in Fig. 2.1.
Example 2.2
Consider the equation given by x(t) = t + jt. Is x(t) a signal ? Is it a scalar signal? 
Solution
Here, time t is an independent variable. x is some function an independent 
variable namely time. So x(t) represents a signal. The signal x is complex 
valued and is a scalar signal, as x has a unique value given by t + jt at every 
time instant t. The plot of the signal is represented in Fig. 2.2. A separate plot 
for magnitude and angle is plotted because the signal values are complex.

is a vector signal.

  2.2 Graph Terminology and Domains
Consider a simple example of a signal, for example, a speech signal. A speech 
signal is recorded using a microphone. Output voltage of a microphone 
changes with time, in accordance with the speech signal. We may represent 
this signal in the form of a graph as voltage versus time. Voltage is a dependent 
variable and time is an independent variable. The independent variable is 
plotted on X-axis and is called as the domain. 
Example 2.4
Consider a speech signal represented as a function of time, it is in time domain. 
Plot the signal as a CT signal and a DT signal.
Solution 
The plot of the signal is shown in Fig. 2.3. A MATLAB program given below 
opens a file containing speech and plots it. When we use a command plot, we 
get a continuous time graph, as shown in Fig. 2.3. When we use a command 
stem, we get a discrete time graph, as shown in Fig. 2.4. When the speech signal 
is passed via A/D converter and interfaced to a digital computer, it is first 
sampled at a regular fixed time interval of T. We say that we have digitized the 
time axis and it now becomes discrete time (DT) signal. It will be represented 
as a variation of voltage with respect to discrete time. X-axis is now discrete 
and it is said to be represented in the DT domain, as shown in Fig. 2.4. A 
MATLAB program to read and plot a speech file is given below.

Another commonly used domain for representing signals is a frequency 
domain. Here, the signal will be represented in the form of magnitude against 
frequency, that is, the resulting graphical representation will have a frequency 
on X-axis. This represents the amplitudes of different frequencies present in 
the signal. The frequency is now the independent variable and the domain 
is the frequency domain. The frequency domain is used when we take FT of 
a signal.

respectively, as shown in Fig. 2.5. We will discuss the use of this domain in 
chapter 5 on Fourier series representation and chapter 6 on Fourier transform 
representation of the signals in detail. A MATLAB program is given below for

Consider image as a signal. See how it is represented in the graph form. It 
is a three-dimensional (3D) representation with two independent variables, 
namely, distance along X direction and distance along Y direction. When 
the independent variable is spatial distance, the domain is named “spatial 
domain”. The image signal is represented as a variation of magnitude versus 
spatial distance along two directions. It is said to be represented in spatial 
domain and is a two-dimensional signal.

Solution
The image is a gray scale image, which means that the intensity value of each 
pixel is represented as a gray scale value from 0 to 255. The two dimensions are 
the x coordinate value and y coordinate value. The intensity value of each pixel 
is represented as a third-dimensional value namely gray scale value ranging 
from 0 to 255.

  2.3 Applications of Signals and Systems
Let us understand the significance of signals and the significance of the 
study of signals. We will discuss different applications of signals in fields 
of communication, control systems, etc., which are the subjects for further 
study in engineering. We would like to understand the need for the course 
on signals and systems. You will come across the signals in the medical field: 
for example Electro Cardio Gram (ECG), Electro Encephalon Gram (EEG), 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), X-rays, etc. To extract the information 
from these signals, they are required to be further processed. The doctors can 
draw certain conclusions only after getting results of certain processing on 
these signals. You are acquainted with multimedia communication, mobile 
communication, satellite communication, RADAR communication, Radio 
communication, TV, etc. These communication systems involve signals like 
speech, music, images, videos, etc. The signals are processed to extract some 
meaningful information. We will define a system. 
Definition of a system The blocks that operate on signals as input and 
produce some meaningful output again in the form of signal are termed as 
signal-processing blocks or systems. 
Let us introduce the communication systems in general form. 
2.3.1 
Basic communication system
The communication system will consist of a transmitter, a channel and a 
receiver, as shown in Fig. 2.8. Each of this unit can be called as a system. Let us 
understand the functioning of each block. 
Fig. 2.8 Basic communication system
We will first consider basic analog communication system, for example, radio 
broadcasting. Here, the signal is the music or the speech recorded in the studio. 
1. Transmitter These signals are processed in the transmitter. The analog 
signal is filtered to remove noise. The signal is then modulated using 
modulation like amplitude modulation (AM) or frequency modulation

(FM). Modulation will allow the signal to reach a longer distance using 
transmitting antenna. In case of amplitude modulation or frequency 
modulation, the message signal changes the amplitude or the frequency, 
respectively, of the carrier signal which is a high-frequency sinusoidal 
signal. 
2. Channel The signal transmitted from the antenna is then passed over 
the channel. The channel can be free space or wire. When it is transmitted 
over free space in case of radio transmission, TV, satellite and mobile 
communication, etc it is often broadcasting. Wired communication is 
used for telephones. This is usually point-to-point communication. 
3. Receiver The receiver will consist of the demodulator for AM or FM 
signal. 
We will now consider the digital communication system.
1. Transmitter In case of digital communication, the transmitter will 
consist of a sampler, quantizer and coder. The raw signal like speech, 
video is always analog signal. The analog signal is first sampled using the 
sampling frequency decided by the sampling theorem. The reader may 
refer to chapter 1 on sampling for further details. The sampled signal 
is called as a DT signal. This is then quantized and converted to digital 
signal. It is further coded using lossless or lossy coding techniques. The 
reader will understand these coding techniques in the course on Digital 
communication. The coded signal is in the form of voltage levels like in 
case of Pulse code modulation used in telecommunication. 
2. Channel The transmitted signal then passes over the channel. The band 
width of the channel is always limited. Hence, the channel functions as a 
low-pass filter. The signal gets distorted when it passes over the channel. 
The external noise also gets added in the signal. The channel equalizers are 
used to overcome the problem of the band limitation of the channel. The 
equalizers are used at the receiver end. The channel coding will include 
the techniques like error-correcting codes such as the inclusion of cyclic 
redundancy check characters (CRC). 
3. Receiver The receiver will have a channel equalizer at the start to correct 
for channel errors. The receiver for analog communication will consist of 
demodulators and decoders. The receiver for digital system will include 
a use CRC to correct the received bits. Then it will decode the bits using 
PCM demodulator and use a low-pass filter to recover the analog signal. 
The quantization cannot be undone. Hence, the received signal will 
always include quantization noise. We can keep quantization noise to its 
minimum by adaptively selecting the step size. The reader will understand 
these concepts in detail in the course on digital communication. 
Another broad class of systems is control systems, which find applications in 
the small, medium and large-scale industries. We will now discuss the basics 
of control systems.

2.3.2 Basic control system
The basic analog signal control system may be depicted, as shown in Fig. 2.9. 
Fig. 2.9 Basic process control system
Functions of different blocks can be described as follows. Consider a process 
control system that is used for controlling the parameters like temperature, 
pressure, humidity, etc, for example, in some plant or some green house or the 
agricultural area. Here, the raw signal is the output of the transducers used for 
the measurement of temperature, pressure and humidity. There will be some 
set points decided for each parameter and if the value of the parameter goes 
above or below the threshold or the set point, then the control action is taken. 
The control system will find the error between the actual parameter value 
and the set point and will calculate the controller output using, for example, 
the on-off type of controller or the proportional controller that generates the 
output proportional to the error. The control action may consist of switching 
of the heater, for example, for temperature and so on. It may be a closed loop 
system that gives the output of the controller to some actuator that acts on the 
actual controlling part, for example, the heater in this case. In case of digital 
control system, only the controller either on-off or proportional controller 
will be implemented digitally. The error signal is digitized and given to the 
controller. The output of the controller is converted back to analog signal and 
given to actuator control. When actuator acts on the process the control loop 
is closed and it is termed as a closed loop control system.

  2.4 Classification of Signals
Basically, the signals are of three types. Signals can be classified as analog, 
Discrete Time (DT), or Digital signals. 
  2.4.1 Analog signals
As we have discussed, all naturally occurring signals are analog in nature. 
Analog signals are continuous amplitude and continuous time (CTCA) 
signals. Analog signals arise when any physical signal is converted to the 
electrical signal using a transducer such as temperature sensor, pressure cells, 
photovoltaic cells, etc. An analog signal can take any real value from zero to 
infinity. Let us consider some examples of analog signals. 
Example 2.10 
(Analog signal) Consider a signal given by 
π

Ft where F is the 
frequency of the signal equal to 5 Hz. Plot a signal.
Solution 
The signal exists for all t. This is an analog signal. The signal is plotted in 
Fig. 2.10, which is the result of the output of a MATLAB program. The signal 
exists for all continuous values of time and takes on any continuous value of 
amplitude. The plot is shown only for some finite duration.
Let us do it practically. We will use MATLAB to generate and plot this 
analog signal. A MATLAB program is given below. We will generate a vector 
of time values with sampling interval of 0.001 seconds. Using a plot command, 
it joins all successive time values to get the appearance of a continuous signal.

a vector of time values with sampling interval of 0.01 seconds. Using a plot

plot can be represented, as shown in Fig. 2.12.

Let us write the program to generate this signal. We will again generate a 
vector of time values with a sampling interval of 0.01 seconds. Using a plot 
command, it joins all successive x values to get the appearance of a continuous 
signal. The output of the program is plotted in Fig. 2.13. Here, the signal values 
are discontinuous. This makes the program difficult to write in discrete time 
domain. To generate an index as an integer in MATLAB, time values are 
multiplied by 10.

Consider a simple sinusoidal signal in Example 2.8. The signal has a frequency 
of 5 Hz. Two analog sinusoids of different frequencies are always distinct. The 

Signals and Systems
40
frequency of a sinusoid is purely determined by the number of oscillations per 
second. 
Concept of negative frequency
The frequency as determined by number of oscillations per second is 
definitely a positive quantity. We need to introduce negative frequencies for 
mathematical convenience. The sinusoid of angular frequency Ω with peak 
amplitude A may be represented as 
Ω

The co-sinusoid is formed using two constant amplitude complex conjugate 
exponential signals or unit phasors rotating in opposite directions, as is 
indicated by Eq. (2.1) shown in Figs 1.14 and 1.15, respectively. When two 
phasors are added, the real parts will add up and the imaginary parts will 
cancel each other to get only the cosine term in Eq. (2.1). The amplitude of 
phasors is unity as

A phasor rotating in counter-clockwise direction is said to have a positive 
frequency and the one rotating in clockwise direction is said to have a 
negative frequency. The mathematical calculations can be simplified if we use 
exponential signal representation as against the sinusoidal representation. 
With the introduction of negative frequency, we will now consider the range 
of analog frequencies between –∞ and +∞. The analog sinusoidal signal can 
have any continuous value of frequency from zero to infinity. We will denote 
the analog frequency and the analog angular frequency by capital letters such 
as F and Ω, respectively.

Fourier series and Fourier Transform.
2.4.2
Discrete time signals (DT signals) 
Let us introduce the concept of DT signals. The natural signal is interfaced 
to a digital computer via the analog-to-digital (A/D) converter. The A/D 
converter is a sampler followed by a quantizer. A set of samples collected 
from a sequence of signal values at discrete time values is called a discrete 
time signal or a DT signal. The sample values are still continuous. A DT signal 
is a discrete time, continuous amplitude (DTCA) signal. When the time axis 
is digitized, the signals are called discrete time (DT) signals. The X-axis in 
the graph-form representation is named as sample number. Generally, the 
sampling interval is constant, that is it is uniform sampling. When the X-axis 
is the sample number, the signal representation is normally in time domain. 
Let the signal X(t) be sampled. The samples are collected at t = 0, t = T, t = 2T 
and so on. The samples are represented as X[0], X[1T], X[2T], ... and so on. 
As T is constant, it is dropped in the representation and the signal samples are 
written as X[0], X[1], X[2], ... . The nth sample will be represented as X(n). The 
signal then consists of signal samples, namely, {X[0], X[1], X[2], ...}. This set of 
signal samples is also called as a sequence x[n]. 
Let us go through some examples of DT signals.
Example 2.13 
Let us represent the sampling frequency as fs then T = 1/f s, where T = sampling 
interval. The signal can be written as 
π
=
[ ]
sin(2
)
x n
fnT . Plot the signal. The 
digital domain frequency is represented by a small letter f and angular frequency 
by ω.
Solution
The sampled signal represented as x[n] exists for discrete time values i.e., at 
t = 0, 1 * T, 2* t, etc. The nth sample is represented as x[n]. Hence, it is termed as 

Signals and Systems
42
a discrete time signal or DT signal. It does not mean that the signal has a zero 
value at all other values of time. The signal is simply not defined for values of 
time other than t = 0, 1 * T, 2 * T, etc. Fig. 2.16 shows a plot of a signal.

Let us write the program to generate this signal. A MATLAB program to 
generate a signal is given below. The plot of the signal is shown in Fig. 2.17.

other values of n. The signal plot is shown in Fig. 2.18.

MATLAB does not use the index as zero. So, we have to do a trick. Generate 
the s variable from 0 to 6 and plot the values of x against s.

other values of n. The signal plot is shown in Fig. 2.20.

2.4.3 Digital signals 
When the amplitudes of the DT signal samples are further quantized, the 
signal so formed is a digital or discrete time, discrete amplitude signal. 
Example 2.16 
Digital signal: In case of a DT signal the time axis is digitized; however, the 
amplitude axis is continuous. For a digital signal, the amplitude is quantized 
and is represented using, for example, a 4-bit with most significant bit as a sign 
bit. Let the signal be represented as X = {0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.25, 0.75}

Signals and Systems
46
Solution
The digital signal X will be represented as
X = {0.000, 0.010, 0.100, 0.010, 0.110} 
(2.3)
Consider 4-bit signed coding. The range of values between –1 and +1 is 
divided in 16 levels. The quantization step size is 0.125. The centre level 0.000 
is representing a zero. Each level is indicating a value of 0.125. So, the second 
level i.e., if third bit is 1, i.e., 0.010 will represent a value 0.25. Level 3 i.e., if the 
second bit is 1, i.e., 0.100 will represent a value of 0.75, as shown in Table 2.1 
for quantization levels.

  2.5 Elementary Signals used for Testing of Systems
The communication system or any control system is designed using pen and 
paper. This theoretically designed system is tested using simulated standard 
signals. The response of the system to standard inputs is tested. The standard 
signals are selected so that the system is tested for all worst-case conditions 
and adverse situations. The sudden spike change in the input is tested using 
impulse. Sudden rise in input is tested using unit step and rectangular pulse. 
The smooth change in input is tested using a ramp signal and so on. If the 
system performance is satisfactory, then the system is actually implemented. 
This saves the cost, as the system response for standard input prompts the 
designer to change the parameters of the system for giving required output. 
The system is also tested for stability. Let us study standard analog and DT 
signals used for testing of a system. Many times, the complex signals are 
represented in terms of the standard signals to simplify the representation 
and analysis. Hence, standard signals are useful for the analysis of complex 
input signals. Let us first understand the reasons for using particular inputs as 
standard input. 
2.5.1 
Reasons for using test or standard inputs
In time-domain analysis, the dynamic response of the system is tested in 
response to various inputs. The system response is analyzed at different 
intervals of time after the input signal is applied. In practice, the input signals 
appearing at the input of a measurement system are not known a priori. Many 
times, the actual input signals vary randomly with respect to time. These 
cannot be mathematically defined due to random nature. However, for the 
purpose of analysis and design, designers assume some basic types of input 
signals that can be easily defined mathematically, so that the performance of 
a system can be analyzed with these standard signals. The actual input signal 
can be represented as a combination of these standard inputs. Hence, once the 
system is tested for the standard inputs, the system is ready for implementation.
In the time-domain analysis, the following standard test signals are used. 
We will discuss the reason for using some of the standard inputs. 
1. Consider the step input signal. It represents the sudden application of the 
input at specified time. In some mechanical system, there may be a shaft 
and the step input will represent the sudden rotation of the shaft. If the 
electrical supply is suddenly switched on, or a valve is suddenly opened or 
closed, it will resemble the step input. 
2. If the input signal is changing at a constant rate, it resembles ramp input.

Signals and Systems
48
3. Sudden shocks for example sudden high voltage due to lightning or short 
circuit will represent the impulse as input.
4. For testing the system for non-linear inputs, a parabolic signal is used.
Steady state errors will decide the accuracy of the system. Measurement of 
steady state error is an important performance measure of the system. These 
errors arise due to the nature of inputs and due to non-linearities of the system 
components. Steady state errors can be estimated by judging the steady state 
errors in response to step, ramp and parabolic inputs.
 2.5.2 
Standard analog signals
The standard analog signals used for the testing of analog systems are listed below. 
1. CT Impulse signal
 
The unit impulse signal is denoted by δ( )t  and is also called as Dirac delta 
function or simply delta function. It represents a very sudden change in the 
input signal for testing of a system. It is defined as follows.

It is very difficult to visualize the delta function. Imagine the rectangular 
pulse with a very small width of e. The height of the rectangle is now 1/e 
as the area enclosed by the rectangle is 1. Now we allow the width of the 
rectangle to shrink and increase the height such that the area enclosed 
remains 1. When e tends to zero, 1/e will tend to infinity and still area 
enclosed will be 1. This visualization is depicted in Fig. 2.22. We can visualize 
it as a very tall-and-thin spike having unit area at the origin, as shown in  
Fig. 2.22. The impulse function may also be visualized as an exponential 
pulse, Gaussian pulse or even the triangular pulse. A delta function is 
defined by small width tending to zero and keeping the area at unity. The 
shape of the pulse is not important.

                                pulse of almost zero width and infinite height) 

Signals and Operations on Signals
49
Usually, people try to find the impulse response of the system and it is 
used for characterization of the system. The input signal is decomposed in 
terms of scaled and translated unit impulses. The response of the system to 
any input is then found by convolving the input with the impulse response 
of the system. This is possible due to superposition principle. The reader 
will study the details of the system response in further chapters 3 and 4.
 
 Let us study properties of CT delta function.

            δ

( )
(
)

(2.5)
 
 
 
 
This means that the delta function is symmetrical with respect to the  
y axis i.e., amplitude axis.  
 
 
 
2. The second property is related to the evaluation of the signal at 
different time values using a delta function. The delta function exists 
at t = 0. If we want to evaluate the value of the signal at t = 0, we will 
use the first equation out of 2.6 stated below. To find the value of 
the signal at any time t = t0, we will use the shifted delta function at  
t = t0 second equation in 2.6. The equation says that the delta function 
samples or shifts out the value of the function at t = t0. This is called 
as the sampling or shifting property of delta function. This defines 
the delta function in the generalized format. We do not say anything 
about what the impulse function looks like, instead we specify its 
effect on the test function. The delta function has the mathematical 
meaning only when it appears as the integrand inside the integral.

3. The third property is related to the time scaling of the delta function. 
If we represent the delta function as the rectangular pulse with its 
width tending to zero in the limiting case, as shown in Fig. 2.15, 
d(at) represents a rectangular pulse scaled in time by a factor of ‘a’ 
with amplitude unchanged. To keep the integral value of unity, the 
amplitude must be scaled by the same factor ‘a’. Refer to Fig. 2.23.

4. The integral of the impulse function is the unit step function and the 
derivative of unit step function is a delta function. du/dt = d(t). Strictly 
speaking, the unit step function has a discontinuity at zero, and its 
derivative will not exist. Let us define the unit step function as the integral 
of the delta function.

Physical significance of impulse We cannot generate the physical 
impulse. However, it is useful for providing an approximation to a physical 
signal in terms of short duration pulses. The reader will understand this 
fact further when convolution is discussed in further chapters. This fact is 
utilized in finding the characterization of the system in terms of its impulse 
response. As a test signal it is useful for finding the response of the system 
for sudden changes like voltage spikes.

The CT unit step function is continuous except for a discontinuity at t = 0. 
Fig. 2.24 shows the unit step function.
Fig. 2.24 Unit step function
Physical significance of unit step function The unit step is particularly 
easy to realize as it represents the closing of a switch for applying a battery 
voltage. As a test signal, it has significance related to the response time of 
the system to a quick input. We can analyze as to how quickly the system 
responds to sudden changes. This is measured in terms of the rise time for 
the output waveform.

The plot of the function is shown in Fig. 2.25. This occurs naturally in logic 
devices and is encountered in digital switching circuits. Fourier Transform 
of the rectangular function is a sinc function. The rectangular pulse 
contains a wide range of harmonics. Owing to infinite sharp edges in time 
domain, the frequency domain representation has infinite bandwidth. 
Note The reader will understand the concepts well in chapter 6 on 
Fourier transform (FT). The FT of the rectangular pulse is shown to be a 
sinc function.
Physical significance of the rectangular pulse The rectangular pulse 
is used for square wave testing of an amplifier. The sudden rising edge 
represents all frequencies from zero to infinity. The time response of the 
system is tested using rise time measurements. The flat edge is representative

Physical significance of the ramp function The ramp function represents 
a slow rise. As a test signal it is useful to find the response of the system to 
slow changes in the input. The response will be detected as the slope of the 
ramp at the output of the system.

The three reasons for using normalized sinc function can be listed as 
follows. 
1. Firstly, the definite integral of the function is one. 
2. Secondly, all zeros of the normalized sinc function is integer value of 
the argument and thirdly, the normalized sinc function is the Fourier 
Transform of the rectangular function with no scaling. 
3. The third reason is the main concept behind using a sinc function 
in reconstructing the continuous bandlimited signal from uniformly 
spaced samples of that signal. 
Definition of normalized sinc function The sinc function is said to 
be normalized when it includes π in the sine argument and also in the 
denominator. The plot of a normalized sinc function will have a maximum 
value of 1 i.e., the amplitude is normalized to 1.

Physical significance of a sine wave function Any signal can be 
decomposed in terms of linear combination of scaled and shifted sine 
waves (Fourier series or Fourier transform representation). This enables 
one to find the response of the system to any input. This is called as the 
frequency response of the system. The sine wave function is useful as a test 
signal. We use sine wave testing for finding the frequency response of the 
amplifiers. If the system produces a sine wave in response to a sine wave 
input, it indicates that the system has no phase distortion.

Physical significance of exponential function The exponential function 
can be used to model many physical signals occurring in nature, for 
example, charging and discharging of a capacitor. Exponential distribution 
is one of the standard distributions defined for continuous random 
variables. Complex exponential function can be used as a building block 
for many complex signals.

  2.6 Classification of Signals Based on Signal Properties
The analog, DT and Digital signals exhibit properties namely even and 
odd property, periodicity property, randomness, etc. We give below the 
classification of the signals based on these properties. 
 2.6.1 
Even and odd signals
We will first treat the even and odd property for analog signals. A continuous 
time, continuous amplitude signal or analog signal is said to be even if
x(t) = x(–t) for all t. The even signals are symmetrical with respect to the origin 
or a vertical i.e., amplitude axis. 
Further, the signal is said to be an odd signal if it satisfies x(t) = –x(–t) for all 
t. The odd signals are anti-symmetrical with respect to the origin or a vertical 
i.e., amplitude axis. Any signal x(t) can be written as a summation of even part 
xe(t) and odd part x0(t). Let us substitute t = –t in the expression for x(t), we 
will get

valued, it can be represented as

It can be easily verified that the signal x(t) is conjugate symmetric, if a(t) is 
even and b(t) is odd.
Example 2.27 
Consider an analog signal given by 
x(t) = A for – T/2 ≤ t ≤ T/2. Find if the signal is even.

Signals and Operations on Signals
73
Solution 
We will plot the signal and will find out if x(–t) = x(t). The plot of a signal is 
shown in Fig. 2.44. We observe that x(t) = x(–t) for all t. It is symmetrical with 
respect to the origin or a vertical i.e., amplitude axis. Hence, the signal is even. 
The same signal can also be written as 
x(t) = A rect(t/T) = 1  for  | t | < T/2 
(2.60)
                                = 0  for | t | > T/2

Solution 
Let us plot the signal. The plot is shown in Fig. 2.45. We observe that 
x(t) = –x(–t) for all t. The signal is anti-symmetrical with respect to the origin 
or a vertical i.e., amplitude axis. Hence, the signal is an odd signal.

We can conclude that analog cosine function is an even function and analog 
sine function is an odd function. Let us plot the sine function and cosine 
function using MATLAB and confirm that cosine is an even function and sine 
is an odd function. A MATLAB program to plot sine and cosine function is 
given below. Figure 2.46 shows the output of MATLAB program for plot of 
sine and cosine functions. The plot clearly indicates that cosine function is an 
even function and sine function is an odd function.

We can conclude that the terms containing even power of t like t2, t4, t6, etc. 
are even functions and terms containing odd orders of t like t, t3, t5, etc. are 
odd functions.

function and the product of two odd functions is always an even function. 
Note that we may use any other variable in place of t.

We can conclude that the second and the third term are products of one even 
term and one odd term, so the product term is an odd function. The fourth 
term is a product of 2 odd functions and one even function that results in an 
even function.

The tan function is the ratio of sine (odd function) and cosine (even function). 
The ratio will be an odd function. We can conclude that the function consists 
of the sum of two terms that are the products of two odd terms. So, both the 
terms are even.

We can conclude that the function consists of sum of three terms out of which 
two terms are odd and one term is even. This fact is evident when we expand 
the bracket. 
We will now consider even and odd classification for DT signals. We will 
illustrate this with the help of following examples. 
Example 2.39 
Consider a discrete time signal given by
x[n] = 1  for  –2 < n < 2
        = 0  otherwise
Find if the signal is even or odd.
Solution 
Let us plot the signal. A plot is shown in Fig. 2.47. The signal is symmetrical 
with respect to the origin and with respect to the amplitude axis. x[–n] = x[n] 
for all n. Hence, the signal is even.
Fig. 2.47 Plot of signal for Example 2.39
Example 2.40 
Consider a discrete time signal given by
x[n] = 1  for  1 < n < 2
        = –1  for  –1 < n < –2
Find if the signal is even or odd.

Signals and Systems
80
Solution 
Let us plot the signal. A plot is shown in Fig. 2.48. The signal is anti-symmetrical 
with respect to the origin and with respect to the amplitude axis. x[–n] = –x[n] 
for all n. Hence, the signal is odd. 
Fig. 2.48 Plot of signal for Example 2.40
Example 2.41
Consider a discrete time signal given by
x[n] = 1  for  1 < n < 5
        = 0  otherwise
Find if the signal is even or odd.
Solution 
Let us plot the signal. A plot is shown in Fig. 2.49. The signal is having a value 
zero for all negative values of n. It is neither symmetric nor anti-symmetrical 
with respect to the origin and with respect to the amplitude axis. Hence, the 
signal is neither even nor odd.
Fig. 2.49 Plot of signal for Example 2.41
We conclude that if the signal is neither symmetric nor anti-symmetric with 
respect to the amplitude axis, then the signal is neither even nor odd.
Physical significance of even and odd property If the signal is even, 
its mirror image is same as itself. If the signal is odd, its mirror image is 
x(–t) = –x(t). This is useful when we take the convolution of one signal with 
the other. Here, the first step for convolution, we have to take the mirror image 
of the signal. (The reader may refer to chapter 4 for convolution)

2.6.2 Periodic and aperiodic signals
Let us go through the classification of signals based on periodicity property. 
Periodicity of analog Signals
Let us consider the periodic and aperiodic classification for analog signals. 
The periodic signal x(t) is a function for which there exists some value T 
that satisfies the condition x(t + T) = x(t) for all t. T denotes the period. For 
example, consider a sinusoidal signal given by x(t) = A sin(t). Here, the signal 
is periodic with the period of 2p. For some signals no such value T exists for 
which x(t + T) = x(t) holds good. Such a signal is termed as an aperiodic signal. 
Example 2.42
Consider the equation given by
π
=
( )
cos(2
)
x t
ft . Is x(t) a periodic signal? What 
is the period of this signal? 
Solution
Here, we will check if there is some T for which x(t) = x(x + T) 
Put t = t + T in 
π
=
( )
cos(2
)
x t
ft  
(2.91)
We obtain

f  
(2.92)
Hence, there exists some T for which x(t) = x(x + T). The signal is periodic. 1/f 
is the period.
We can conclude that any continuous (Analog) cosine or sine function is 
periodic with period of 1/f where f is the frequency of the cosine or a sine wave. 
The value of the frequency must be finite. It may be rational or irrational. 
Periodicity has nothing to do with rationality.
So the signal x(t) = cos(2t) is also periodic with period equal to x(t + T) = 
cos(2t + 2T) = cos(2t) 2T = 2p i.e., T = p and frequency equal to 1/p. Here, the 
frequency is irrational.

period.

So, period of signal is ½ seconds and frequency f is 2. Now if we define the 
signal only over a finite duration as x(t) = cos(4pt) for 
≤
| | 2
t
, then the signal 
will become truly aperiodic; however, for a defined duration, it will be treated 
as periodic. 

Signals and Systems

A periodic signal by definition must strictly start from –∞ and end at ∞. 
However, in practice, the signals are available only for a finite duration. So, 
we relax the periodicity condition. The signal will be treated as periodic if it is 
periodic over the finite duration for which it is defined.

So, period of signal is 2π/3 seconds and frequency f is 3/2π. The value of the 
period is not rational, still the signal is periodic. Every analog sinusoidal signal 
is periodic.

Consider the signal shown in Fig. 2.57. Is x[n] a periodic signal ? 
Fig. 2.57 Plot of signal for Example 2.54
Solution 
We can refer to the plot of the signal to see that the signal repeats itself after 
every 10 samples (i.e., from n = –1 to n = 9). So, the period is 10 samples. 
Example 2.55
Consider the signal shown in Fig. 2.58. Is x(t) a periodic signal ?
Solution 
We can observe from the signal plot that even though the positive square 
waveform between –4 and –3 repeats between –2 to –1 and that from 1 to 2 
repeats between 3 to 4, it is negative for some duration i.e., from –0.5 to 0.5. 
Hence, the signal is not periodic.

Periodicity of DT Sinusoidal Signals
The CT sinusoidal signals are all periodic. We need to discuss periodicity of DT 
sinusoids only. The periodic analog signal when sampled may generate a DT 
signal, which is one of the following:
Case 1
Periodic.
Case 2 Periodic with different reconstructed frequency (aliased frequency).
Case 3 It may become aperiodic. 
We will first see the criterion for a DT signal to be periodic. 
The DT signal x[n] is periodic if and only if its digital frequency f is a rational 
number (ratio of two integers). To test if it is periodic we have to check if 
x[n]= x[n + N] for some integer N

The fundamental period of the sinusoid is N when k and N are relatively 
prime. N represents the number of samples in one period of the sinusoid i.e., 
frequency in terms of number of samples. We will illustrate three cases with 
the help of examples solved below.
Example 2.56 
(Case 1) This Example illustrates case 1. 
Consider a sinusoid of frequency 10 Hz sampled with a sampling frequency 
FS of 30 Hz. The resulting DT signal is

(2.104)
Comparing Eq. (2.103) with Eq. (2.104), we find that f = 1/3. It is rational and 
is lying within the range of –1/2 to 1/2. It is perfectly recoverable in analog 
domain as per the sampling theorem. The DT signal retains the properties of 
the original sinusoid. It is periodic with digital period of three samples. 
 Example 2.57 
(Case 2) This Example illustrates case 2.
Discrete time sinusoids whose frequencies are separated by an integral 
multiple of 2p are identical. Any sequence resulting from a sinusoid with a 
frequency of |w| > p or |f | > 1/2 is identical to the corresponding sequence 
obtained from a sinusoidal signal with frequency |f | < 1/2. Hence, the 
frequencies in the range –1/2 < f < 1/2 are unique and all frequencies f > 1/2 
fold back to |f | < 1/2. This indicates that the highest rate of oscillations for a 
DT sinusoid is attained when |f | = 1/2. The range of DT signal frequencies 
is between –1/2 and 1/2. (Refer Fig. 1.7 in Chapter 1 for details of sampling.)
Let us consider the same signal with a bandwidth of 10 Hz. Here, the 
sampling frequency as per the sampling theorem is 20 Hz. We will sample the 
signal with the sampling frequency below the Nyquist rate, that is, FS = 7.5 Hz. 
Let us concentrate on the 10 Hz sinusoid. We will see that the DT sinusoid will 
be periodic; however, when reverted back in time domain, the signal is aliased.

Here F/FS is equal to 1/3. It is a rational number, so the DT sinusoid is 
periodic. If we put FS as 7.5 Hz, F turns out to be 2.5. Here, the 10 Hz signal 
is aliased as a 2.5 Hz signal. We conclude that unless the value of FS is known, 
the analog signal cannot be reconstructed from the signal samples. (Note that 
the DT signals in Examples 2.56 and 2.57 have the period N of 3 samples. 
However, both have different sampling frequencies namely 30 Hz and 7.5 Hz 
respectively. In Example 2.57, the recovered signal is aliased.)
Example 2.58
(Case 3) This example illustrates case 3.
 Let us consider the same signal again with a bandwidth of 10 Hz. Here the 
sampling frequency as per the sampling theorem is 20 Hz. We will sample 
the signal with a sampling frequency above the Nyquist rate, that is, FS = 30 
Hz. Let us concentrate on 10/π Hz sinusoid. The analog sinusoidal signal of 
10/p Hz is periodic. When sampled with a sampling frequency of 30 Hz, the 
resulting DT signal will turn out to be aperiodic. The DT signal is

The reader can note the additional points stated below.
1. A very small change in frequency of the analog signal may drastically change 
the fundamental period of discrete time signal. 
Let us represent the frequency of the digital signal as f and frequency of the 
analog signal as F. Let Fs represent the sampling frequency as decided by 
the sampling theorem. Then

by putting value of F = 10 Hz and FS =30 Hz with f = 1/3 (note that we have 
made F and FS relatively prime) and has a period of three samples. Now change 
the frequency of a sinusoid by 1 Hz. Let it be 11 Hz (for example). Sample it 
using a sampling frequency FS of 30 Hz. The DT signal frequency f is 11/30 and 
the period of DT signal is 30. 
2. A very small change in the sampling frequency can result in a large change 
in fundamental period of DT signal. This fact is illustrated in the numerical 
example below.

30 Hz. The signal is represented with f = 1/3 as

sampling frequency by 1 Hz. Let it be 31 Hz (for example). The discrete time 
signal frequency f = 10/31 and the period of DT signal is 31.
 Let us go through additional examples for better understanding of the 
concept of periodicity.

The period is not a rational number. However, because it is an analog sinusoid, 
the combination signal is periodic. 
Physical significance of property of periodicity When the signal is 
periodic, it repeats itself from minus infinity to plus infinity i.e., it extends 
over infinite duration. Hence, its total energy is infinite. If the average power is 
finite, it becomes a power signal. To find the frequency contents of the signal, 
we need to find power spectral density (PSD). If the signal is aperiodic and if it 
exists over a finite duration, it is an energy signal. We need to find the energy 
spectrum density (ESD) to analyze the frequency contents of the signal. (The 
reader may refer to chapter 9 on random signals for ESD and PSD.)
 2.6.3 Causal and non-causal signals
The CT and DT signals are characterized as causal and non-causal signals. 
They are also called right-handed and left-handed signals and sequences, 
respectively. The CT signal is said to be causal if x(t) = 0 for all t < 0. It is also 
called as a right-handed signal. The CT signal is said to be anti-causal if it 
exists only for negative values of time. It is also called as a left-handed signal. 
The sequence x[n] is called as a right-handed sequence if it is zero for all n < 
0. The right-handed sequence is said to be a causal sequence. The sequence
x[n] is called as a left-handed sequence if it exists only for n < 0. The left-
handed sequence is said to be a non-causal sequence. Non-causal sequences 

Signals and Operations on Signals

are basically the signal samples obtained off-line and are useful for off-line 
systems when the signal ahead of time is required to be known.
Example 2.72
Consider a CT signal given by x(t) = e–2t for t ≥ 0, is it a causal signal?
Solution
The signal exists only for ≥0
t
, and is equal to zero for all t < 0. According to 
the definition of causality, the signal is causal and is also called as right-handed 
sequence. 
Example 2.73
Consider a CT signal given by x(t) = e3t for t < 0, is it a causal signal?
Solution
The signal exists only for t < 0, and is equal to zero for all ≥0
t
. According to 
the definition of causality, the signal is non-causal and is also called as left- 
handed sequence.

(2.135)
As the signal is appended by u(t–1), it exists for positive values of t ≥ 1, and is 
zero for all t < 0. Hence, it is causal.
Example 2.75
Consider a signal given by x(t) = 3sin c(5t). Find if the signal is causal.
Solution
The sinc function exists from minus infinity to infinity. Hence, the signal 
exists for negative values of t and is anti-causal. 
Example 2.76

Physical significance of causality When a signal is causal, it extends from 
t = 0 /n = 0 onwards. When the signal is non-causal, it exists for all negative 
values of t. the signal can also be both-sided. When the signal values are 
acquired from t = 0 / n = 0 onwards, it is said to be real time signal and when 
we have signal values also available for negative values of time, it is said to be 
off line signal.
2.6.4 Deterministic and random signals
For a deterministic signal, there is no uncertainty with respect to its value at 
any instant t. The signal can be specified by writing a mathematical expression. 
For example, a signal represented as 
π
=
( )
sin(2
)
x t
ft  is a deterministic signal. 
Using the equation, it is possible to determine the signal value at any time 
instant. On the other hand, unlike deterministic signals, random signals take 
different values with different probabilities at any point in time. Almost all 
naturally occurring signals contain random signal of some strength.
In case of random signals, the next sample cannot be predicted with 
precision. Researchers are putting forth different models for the random 
signals like speech that allow us to write the mathematical expression for a 
short duration signal. So, even though we write mathematical expression 
for a random variable, it is after modeling it for a short duration signal. 
The mathematical model only fits closely to the signal and is not the exact 
representation. The reader will understand the details in chapter 9 on random 
signals. 
Example 2.81
Consider the equation given by
π
π
= +

ft . Is x(t) a

Solution
The equation for the signal is provided. We can use this equation to find the 
value of the signal at any time t. Hence, the signal is deterministic.

The equation for the signal is provided. We can use this equation to find the 
value of the signal at any time instant n. Hence, the signal is deterministic.
Note Any signal for which we can write a mathematical equation to find the 
value of a signal at any time t or any time instant n is a deterministic signal. 
Researchers are putting forth different models for different random signals 
like speech that allow them to write the mathematical expression for a short 
duration signal. Almost all naturally occurring signals have some random 
component of signal. The natural signals are like elephants. The blind persons 
(researchers) around the elephant try to describe the elephant by touching some 
body parts. If the researcher analyzes the tail part of the elephant, he/she will put 
forth a model describing the tail of the elephant and so on. No model so far exists 
for the entire elephant!!
Physical significance of deterministic and random property When the 
signal is deterministic, the next samples are easily calculable. This allows us to 
find all statistical properties like mean and variance, etc. When the signal is a 
random signal, further signal samples cannot be exactly predicted. We need to 
only estimate the statistical properties. (The reader may refer to the chapter on 
random signals -chapter 9) 
 2.6.5  Energy and power signals
Let us now define the measure to find the size of the signal. The size of the 
signal can be measured in terms of its energy because it is a square quantity 
and hence, is positive. It in a way defines the strength of the signal. For a 
signal x(t), x represents the amplitude or magnitude or value of the signal. The 
instantaneous power is given by |x(t)|2. The instantaneous power integrated 
over its duration gives the total energy. The generalized format for representing 
the total energy of a signal x(t) is defined as

 (2.144) 
In order that the total energy is measurable, the signal value must tend to zero 
as the T approaches positive or negative infinity, otherwise the integral will 
not converge. 

Signals and Operations on Signals
101
Definition of energy signal The signals that have finite or measurable 
energy are termed as energy signals. This means that the energy signal must 
exist over a finite duration. It is indicating the amount of energy that can be 
extracted from the signal when the load is applied.
Power is the energy per unit time. Now, to calculate power over a period 
(2T), we divide the energy over a period 2T by 2T. The average power is then 
calculated as the limit of power over the period as the period tends to infinity. 
Mathematically, this is given by

Definition of instantaneous power of the signal Instantaneous power 
is defined as the power of the signal at a particular instant. It is defined as  
PX(t) = |x(t)|2.
  The definition of the power divides the energy by T and T tends to infinity. 
Hence, energy signals have finite energy and zero average power. 
For some signals the amplitude of the signal does not go to zero as time 
t tends to infinity. Here, the total energy becomes infinite. The meaningful 
measure of the size of such signals is the time average of energy i.e., the power 
of the signal. Such signals extending up to infinity have infinite energy. If the 
average power is finite, then it is termed as the power signal. 
Definition of Power signal The signals that have infinite or non-measurable 
energy and finite average power are termed as power signals. This means that 
the power signal must exist over infinite duration. In order to have finite 
average power, the signal must be periodic or it must have statistical regularity. 
If the average power does not exist, then the signal is neither energy nor a 
power signal. Signals for which both energy and average power are infinite are 
neither energy signals nor power signals. Example: White noise (idealized form 
of noise, the power spectral density of which is independent of the operating 
frequency). The adjective white is used in the sense that white light contains 
equal amount of all frequencies within the visible band of electromagnetic 
radiation. Periodic signals are power signals. They exist over infinite time and 
hence, total energy of the signal is infinite. The average power for a period is 
finite. Usually, random signals are also power signals. For example, a sinusoidal 
signal is a power signal and a short-lived aperiodic signal is an energy signal.
Let us define energy and power for a DT signal. In case of DT signals, the 
integral in the analog signal equation will be replaced by the summation. The 
total energy of the signal is defined as

Example 2.83
Consider the sinusoid of frequency 1 KHz. Is it a power signal?
Solution
The signal is a sinusoid that exists from –∞ to ∞. Hence, the energy of a signal 
is infinite. Let us calculate the average power. The period of a signal 2T is

Physical significance of energy and power signals When the signal is an 
energy signal, it exists for a finite duration. We need to find ESD to analyze 
the frequency contents of the signal. When the signal is a power signal, it has 
infinite energy and finite average power. We need to find PSD to analyze the 
frequency contents of the signal. (The reader may refer to chapter 9 for ESD 
and PSD)

  2.7 Operations on Signals
Typical signal-processing operations are time and amplitude scaling, 
multiplication, addition and shifting. Advanced signal-processing operations 
include convolution, filtering, interpolation and decimation. We will illustrate 
and discuss amplitude scaling, addition, multiplication, time scaling, time 
shifting and folding operations. We will then describe a precedence rule that 
will help the reader to implement the operations on the signals successively. 
Let us go through simple operations on signals one by one.
 2.7.1 
Time shifting
We will illustrate the time shifting operation for CT signal by considering a 
numerical example. 
Example 2.107
Consider time-shifting operation for CT signal. Shift the signal shown in 
Fig. 2.66 towards right and left by one time unit.
Solution
Let the time shift be of T time units. The shifted signal can be represented as 
=
−
( )
(
)
y t
x t
T  
(2.198)
Let T be positive and equal to 1. Consider the signal x(t) as plotted in Fig. 2.66. 
The shifted signal is represented in Figs 2.67 and 2.68 for positive and negative 
value of T.
Fig. 2.66 Plot of signal x(t)

Signals and Operations on Signals
119
Fig. 2.67 Plot of x(t – 1)
Fig. 2.68 Plot of x(t + 1)
The reader may note that x(t–T) for positive T shifts the signal towards right 
by T units and for T negative, it shifts the signal towards left by T units. When 
T is negative, the signal becomes x(t + T).
Physical significance of time shifting Many times when we compare the 
two signals for recognizing the pattern, we find that the signals are identical 
except that one signal is shifted with respect to the other. We need to slide 
and shift one signal over the other to find if they are matching. Time-shifting 
operation is useful for pattern matching and recognition. 
We will illustrate time shifting for DT signals.
Example 2.108
Consider time-shifting operation in case of a DT signal x[n] shown in Fig. 
2.69. We will draw x[n – 2] and x[n + 2]. The shifted signals are shown in Fig. 
2.70 and Fig. 2.71. The signal x[n] is given by

 Fig. 2.70 x(n) shifted right by 2 positions       Fig. 2.71 x(n) shifted left by 2 positions 
The reader may note that x[n – k] shifts the signal towards right by k samples 
for positive values of k and shifts the signal towards left by k positions for 
negative values of k. Here, we have considered k = 2 for the above example. 
When k is negative, the signal is represented as x[n + k]. For k = 2, we have 
to shift the signal x[n] towards right by 2 samples. This means, the sample at 
n = 1 will appear at n = 1 + 2 i.e., n = 3 (Refer to Fig. 2.70). For k = –2, we have 
to shift the signal x[n] towards left by 2 samples. This means, the sample at 
n = 1 will appear at n = 1 – 2 i.e., at n = –1 (refer to Fig. 2.71).
 2.7.2 Time reversal
We will illustrate the time reversal operation for CT signal by considering 
numerical example. 
Example 2.109
Consider time reversal operation for CT signal. Perform time reversal of the 
signal shown in Fig. 2.66 and shift it towards right and left by one time unit.
Solution
Consider time reversal of signal represented in Fig. 2.66. Let us plot x(–t). Let 
the time shift be of T time units. The shifted signal can represented as 
=

(2.200)
Let T be positive. Consider the signal x(–t) as plotted in Fig. 2.72. Note that 
it is the mirror image of the signal x(t). The shifted signal is represented in  
Figs 2.73 and 2.74 for positive and negative value of T = 1.

Signals and Operations on Signals
121
The reader may note that x(–t + T) for positive T shifts the signal towards 
right by T units and for T negative, it shifts the signal towards left by T units. 
Compare this with x(t – T). 
Fig. 2.72 Plot of signal x(–t)
Fig. 2.73 Plot of x(–t + 1) 
Fig. 2.74 Plot of x(–t –1)
Example 2.110
Let us now consider the time reversal and shifting for DT signal x[n] shown 
in Fig. 2.69. 
Solution
Let us plot x[–n]. This is a time-reversed signal. Time-reversed signal is plotted 
in Fig. 2.75. Note that it is the mirror image of signal x[n]. Let it be shifted by 

Signals and Systems
122
k units to get x[–n + k] with k = 2. This shifts the signal x[–n] by 2 samples 
towards right for positive values of k = 2 and shifts it towards left by 2 samples 
for negative values of k = –2. The shifted signals are shown in Figs 2.76 and 
2.77, respectively.

  Fig. 2.76 x[–n] shifted right by 2 samples    Fig. 2.77 x[–n] shifted left by 2 samples
Physical significance of time reversal Sometimes, the two signals are 
identical, except that they are mirror images of each other. The time reversal 
operation will allow one to check if one signal is a mirror image of the 
other. Time-shifting operation is required to be performed as a first step in 
convolution operation. (The reader will come across convolution in chapter 4.) 
Let us solve some numerical problems based on these properties.

x(t) towards right by 3 units. The shifted signal is plotted in Fig. 2.79. 

Signals and Operations on Signals
123
Let us execute time reversal and plot x(–t). Figure 2.80 shows plot of x(–t). 
Owing to symmetry about y axis, x(t) = x(–t). Let us shift it to the right by 2 
units to get x(–t + 2). Figure 2.81 shows the plot of x(–t + 2).

shown in Fig. 2.85.

The signal is plotted in Fig. 2.78. Let us plot scaled signals 2x(t) and ½x(t). 
Solution
Let us plot both these signals as shown in Figs 2.86 and 2.87, respectively. Note 
that the signal 2x(t) has double the amplitude at each time instant as compared 
to x(t) and the signal ½ x(t) has half the amplitude at each time instant as 
compared to x(t) (refer to Fig. 2.78).

Let us introduce time-scaling operation.
Example 2.114
Consider signal x(t) of Example 2.113 above, as shown in Fig. 2.78. Plot x(2t) 
and x(t/2).
Solution
The signal x(2t) is a signal compressed by a factor of 2 and x(1/2t) is a signal 
dilated (elongated) by a factor of 2. The plots for compressed and elongated 
signals are shown in Figs 2.88 and 2.89, respectively. Note the time scale along 
x axis in elongated and compressed signals.
Fig. 2.88 Plot of x(2t)

Signals and Systems
126
Fig. 2.89 Plot of x(t/2)
The reader may remember that multiplication of t (the argument of x) by a 
factor ‘a’ compresses the signal along x axis by the same factor. Division of t by 
a factor elongates the signal along x axis by the same factor. 
Example 2.115
Consider signal x[n] shown below in Fig. 2.90. Plot x[2n] and x[n/2].
 
Fig. 2.90 Plot of signal x[n]
Solution
x[2n] will be a compressed signal. Here, in DT domain, compression by a 
factor of 2 will actually decimate the signal by 2 i.e., we have to collect alternate 
samples only. The signal x[2n] is shown plotted in Fig. 2.91. We can observe 
that the samples with value equal to 1 are lost when we collect alternate 
samples. The signal x[n/2] is plotted in Fig. 2.92. This is a dilated signal. Here, 
the sample at n = 1 is shifted to n = 2 and a sample value of zero appears at n = 
1. Similarly, samples at all odd values of n will be zero and the samples of x[n] 
will appear at all even values of n successively.
Physical significance of amplitude and time scaling When we are 
comparing the two signals, one may just be the amplified version of the other. 
In this case, we normalize the signals and then compare them with each other. 
Here, we need to find the scaling factor for amplitude scaling. Sometimes, the 
time scale is different for two signals. Consider the two speech signals having 

Signals and Operations on Signals
127
utterance of the same word two times. When a person utters the same word 
two times, the signal duration differs for both the signals. When we want to 
compare these two signals, we need to find the time scaling factor for time 
scaling. In practice, for speech signals, we use time warping (other name given 
for time scaling.)
Fig. 2.91 Plot of x[2n]
Fig. 2.92 Plot of signal x[n/2]
Let us now combine the time scaling and time-shifting operations. We will 
illustrate this with a numerical problem.

Plot x(2t – 3). 
Solution
We have to execute time shifting first and then time scaling. This is called as 
precedence rule.

Signals and Systems
128
Let us first plot x(t – 3), which is a signal shifted towards right by 3 samples. 
The signal plot is shown in Fig. 2.93. Now execute time scaling i.e., compression 
by a factor of 2. The signal x(2t – 3) is shown in Fig. 2.94. 
Fig. 2.93 Plot of x(t – 3) 
Fig. 2.94 Plot of x(2t – 3)
If we implement scaling and then time shifting later, for example, find x(2t) 
first and then translate by 3 units, we will get a wrong result. Let us verify this. 
We will plot x(2t) and then find x(2t – 3) by shifting operation. The plots are 
shown in Figs 2.94 and 2.95, respectively. 
 
Fig. 2.95 Plot of x(2t)

Signals and Operations on Signals
129
Fig. 2.96 Plot of x(2t – 3)
What went wrong?
We will now find what went wrong when we implemented scaling first. Let 
us examine the problem again. We have to find x(2t–3). We may write it as 
x(2(t-3/2)). This means if we scale first, we have to translate by x shift of 3/2 
rather than 3. Let us do it. We will shift x(2t) towards right by 3/2 units. The 
signal can be plotted as shown in Fig. 2.97.
The reader can observe that the result is the same as we obtained when we 
used a precedence rule. So, if we take proper care, we can implement scaling 
first and then the translation.

Let us first draw x(t). It is shown in Fig 2.98. We will now time scale it by a

Let us plot x(2t) and invert it to get x(–2t). We will find that x(–2t) is the same 
as x(2t), as the signal is symmetrical about y axis. It is shown in Fig. 2.101. 
x(–2t–1) = x(–2(t + 1/2)) is signal x(–2t) shifted towards left by ½ time units. 
Let us draw x(–2t –1). It is shown in Fig. 2.102.

Refer to Fig. 2.101 for the plot of x(t). To plot x(3t + 2) using precedence rule, 
we will first shift the signal x(t) towards left by 2 time units. It is shown in 
Fig. 2.107. Now let us compress it by a factor of 3 to get x(3t + 2). It is shown 
in Fig. 2.108. The reader may verify that the Fig. 2.108 is same as Fig. 2.105.

Owing to the symmetric nature of x(t), x(–t) is same as x(t). To plot x(–2t –1) 
using precedence rule, we will first shift x(–t) towards left by 1 time unit to get 
x(–t –1). It is depicted in Fig. 2.109. Then we will compress it by 2 to get  
x(–2t –1), as shown in Fig. 2.110. The reader may compare Fig. 2.110 with  
Fig. 2.102 to confirm that they are the same.

To find x(2(t + 2)) using precedence rule, we have to first expand the bracket 
to write it as x(2t + 4). We will translate it towards left by 4 positions to get 
x(t + 4), as shown in Fig. 2.111. Then we will compress it by a factor of 2 to get 
x(2t + 4), as depicted in Fig. 2.112. The reader can compare Fig. 2.112 with the 
plot of Fig. 2.103.

The reader is encouraged to plot x(2(t – 2)), x(3t) + x(3t + 2) using a precedence 
rule. 
Let us consider similar operations on DT signals. We will illustrate the 
concepts with the help of a numerical example. 
Example 2.119
Consider a DT signal x[n], as shown in Fig. 2.113. Draw x[2n], x[2n + 2], 
x[n/2], x[n + 2], x[–n + 2].
Fig. 2.113 Plot of x[n] for Example 2.119
Solution
Let us plot x[2n], which is obtained by taking alternate samples of x[n]. It is 
plotted in Fig. 2.114. This operation is also termed as down sampling by a 
factor of two.
Down sampling by a factor of M requires deleting M–1 samples after every 
sample that is retained. Consider x[2n + 2] = x[2(n + 1)]. This is obtained by 
shifting x[2n] towards left by one sample. It is shown in Fig. 2.115. Let us plot 
x[n/2] now. It is obtained by interpolating x[n] by inserting zeros between 
every two samples, as shown in Fig. 2.116. This process is also termed as up 
sampling by a factor of two. Up sampling by a factor of M is done by inserting 
M–1 zeros between every two samples.

the help of suitable numerical examples. We will consider 2 CT signals. We 
will implement addition, subtraction and multiplication of x(t) and y(t).
Example 2.120
Consider two CT signals x(t) and y(t), as shown in Fig. 2.119. Find x(t) + y(t), 
x(t) – y(t) and x(t)y(t), x(t)y(t – 1), x(t + 1)y(t – 2), x(t – 1)y(–t), x(t)y(–t –1), 
x(2t)y(–t + 2), x(2t) + y(2t). 
Solution
Plot of x(t), y(t) and x(t) + y(t) is shown one below the other in Fig. 2.119. Plot 
of x(t), y(t) and x(t) – y(t) is shown one below the other in Fig. 2.120. Let us 
now plot x(t)y(t) in Fig. 2.121. y(t–1) is a signal y(t) shifted towards the right 
by 1 time unit. We have plotted x(t), y(t–1) and x(t) y(t – 1) in Fig. 2.122. x(t 
+ 1) is a signal x(t) shifted left by 1 time unit and y(t – 2) is a signal y(t) shifted 
towards the right by 2 time units. We have plotted x(t + 1), y(t – 2) and the 
product x(t + 1) y(t – 2) in Fig. 2.123. x(t – 1) is a signal x(t) shifted right by 1 
time unit and y(–t) is the time-reversed signal y(t). The product x(t – 1) y(–t) 
is shown in Fig. 2.124. y(–t –1) is a signal y(–t) shifted left by 1 time unit. x(t) 
y(–t –1) is plotted in Fig. 2.125. x(2t) and y(2t) both are compressed signals by 
a factor of 2. The plot of x(2t) + y(2t) is shown in Fig. 2.126.

Solution
Let us plot x[n] + y[n]. We have to add sample by sample. i.e., first sample of 
x[n] will be added to the first sample of y[n] and so on. The signal x[n] + y[n] 
is shown in Fig. 2.129. x[n] + y[n] = {4,2,3,2,3,2,3,1}. The multiplication of the 
two DT signals is a multiplication taken sample by sample. The reader may 
verify that 
x[n] y[n] = {4,1,2,1,2,1,2,0}, it is plotted in Fig. 2.130. We can obtain x[2n] 
by taking alternate samples of x[n] i.e., x[2n] = {2,2,2,2}. The reader may verify 
the result.
 x[2n] y[n] = {4,2,2,2,0,0,0,0}. The plot of x[2n]y[n] is shown in Fig. 2.131. 
The signal x[n – 1] is a shifted signal x[n], shifted towards the right by 1 sample 
and y[n + 2] is signal y[n] shifted left by 2 samples. Plot of x[n – 1] y[n + 2] is 
shown in Fig. 2.132.

Consider the signal given by x(t) = u(t) – u(t – 2). It is drawn in Fig. 2.133. 
x(t) = u(t + 1) – 2u(t) + u(t – 1) is plotted in Fig. 2.134. x(t) = –u(t + 3) + 
2u(t + 1) + u(t – 3) is depicted in Fig. 2.135. x(t) = –r(t + 3) – r(t) + r(t – 2) is 
plotted in Fig. 2.136. Note that slope is –1 at t = –3 and slope is equal to –2 at 
t = 1, slope is –1 at t = 2.

these operations are performed in a convolution process. Especially for DT 
signals, the process of adding and multiplying sample by sample is useful for 
understanding the process of convolution. (The reader may refer to chapter 4 
for convolution.)

Summary
In this chapter, we have described signals and their classification. 
• 
A signal may have one or multiple values for a particular time. If it has a single 
value for every time instant over which it is defined, it is a single-valued signal 
called ‘scalar signal’. If it has multiple values, it is a multiple-valued signal 
called as a vector signal’. If a signal can be represented using a mathematical 
expression, it is said to be deterministic, otherwise it is random. Naturally 
occurring signals are random signals. 

Signals and Systems
148
• 
The signal is plotted with dependent variable on y axis and independent 
variable on x axis. The domain is decided by the independent variable. If we 
plot temperature for different time instants the signal is said to be in time 
domain. When different frequency components of the signal are plotted 
with frequency on x axis, it is said to be in frequency domain. The image 
signal is in spatial domain. Basically the signal can be analog or continuous 
time continuous amplitude (CTCA) signal, discrete time signal or digital i.e., 
discrete time discrete amplitude (DTDA) signal. 
• 
When the system is designed on paper, it is tested by applying simulated 
standard inputs. If the performance of the system is satisfactory, then it is 
implemented. The system can be tested for worst case situations by applying 
am impulse, unit step or ramp as standard inputs. The standard CT and DT 
signals are listed and their significance is emphasized for each signal listed. 
Some examples based on delta functions are solved to illustrate the use of delta 
function in case of deterministic signals.
• 
Signals can be either even or odd. If the signal is symmetrical with respect 
to the amplitude axis, it is even and if it is anti-symmetric with respect to 
the amplitude axis, then it is odd. The product of an even and odd signal 
is odd. The signal is even if it contains all even orders of t. The product of 
two odd signals is an even signal. The section discusses the classification of 
signals based on signal properties. Signals can be periodic or aperiodic. It 
is emphasized that the analog sinusoids are always periodic irrespective of 
if the period is rational or irrational. Several examples are solved to explain 
the basic concepts. The practical signals are of finite duration. If the signal is 
periodic over a finite duration, we relax the periodicity condition and treat 
it as periodic even if it is not extending up to infinity. The DT sinusoid is 
periodic if the period is rational and can be represented as the ratio of two 
prime numbers, for example, k/N. The period of the DT signal is then N 
samples. A periodic CT sinusoid can become aperiodic DT signal if the CT 
signal has a frequency f/π. Periodic signals are repetitive and aperiodic signals 
non-repetitive. Signals are also classified as either energy or power signals. 
An energy signal has finite energy and zero average power, whereas a power 
signal has finite average power but infinite energy. Some signals have infinite 
energy and infinite average power and are said to be neither energy nor a 
power signal.
• 
Different signal operations are explained in the next section. Time-shifting 
operation for shift left and shift right is explained for signal x(t) and the time-
reversed signal x(–t). The amplitude scaling is straightforward; however, time 
scaling is a bit complicated. When the signal is time-scaled by a factor of ½, it 
gets dilated and when time-scaled by a factor of 2, it gets compressed. When 
the time scaling as well as time shifting is involved, it must be done with due 
precaution. To solve it correctly, the precedence rule helps the students better. 
We emphasize that we can do time scaling first and then shifting by properly

putting the operations in bracket. For example, x(2t – 3) will be written as 
x(2(t – 3/2)) for proper implementation. The sample by sample addition and 
multiplication is so illustrated for both CT and DT signals. Time scaling by ½ 
and 2 means interpolation and decimation, respectively, in case of DT signals. 
All operations are explained and illustrated for both CT and DT signals. Some 
miscellaneous problems are solved for the benefit of students. The physical 
significance of each standard signal, each property and each operation on the 
signals is explained.

CT and DT Systems

This chapter concentrates on system definition and properties. The properties 
of systems such as linearity, time invariance, causality, invertibiity, memory 
and stability are discussed in detail. We have discussed sampling in chapter 
1. The reader is already familiar with CT and DT signals. We will define 
properties of CT and DT systems simultaneously. Finally, we will see how 
to represent a system as an interconnection of operators and series/parallel; 
connection of systems.
  3.1 Properties of CT and DT Systems – Linearity and  
Shift Invariance
We will discuss and explain properties of CT and DT systems in the following 
sections. We will study the property of linearity and Shift/time invariance in 
this section.

Signals and Systems
182
  3.1.1 Linearity property
Any CT or DT system is said to be linear if it obeys two important properties. 
The first is homogeneity and the second is additivity. 
Homogeneity property
The system is said to obey the property of homogeneity if the following 
condition holds:
• For CT and DT input signal of x(t) or x[n], respectively, if the output is 
given by y(t) or y[n], then if the input signal is scaled by a factor of k to get 
input signal of kx(t) or kx[n], then the output is also scaled by the same 
factor k i.e., output is ky(t) or ky[n], where k is any scaling factor. Let H 
represent the system operator, then

Additivity Property (Superposition Property) 
The system is said to obey additivity property if the following condition holds 
good.
• Let y1(t)  and y1[n] be the output for the CT and DT input signal x1(t) and 
x1[n], respectively, and y2(t) and y2[n] be the output for input signal x2(t) 
and x2[n], respectively, for a CT and DT system. The property of additivity 
states the following: 
 
 If the input to a system is the addition of two signals, then the output 
of the system is the addition of the respective outputs. Let H represent the 
system operator, then

This indicates that the signals added at the input do not interfere with each 
other when they pass via a system. 
Considering homogeneity and additivity holding good, we can write 
the following statement for CT and DT systems. This is a statement of 
superposition property. All the linear systems obey the superposition property.

Physical significance of linearity
If the system is linear, the transfer graph of output Vs input is a straight line 
graph passing through the origin. Linear systems have a meaning more than 
this! If the system is linear, the input signal can be suitably decomposed into 
component signals and the corresponding outputs for the component signals 
one at a time can be calculated by assuming all other inputs equal to zero. 
The component outputs can be scaled and added to generate the output of 
the system for the input signal. This procedure simplifies the computation 
of the system output for different input signals. This property is called as the 
superposition property.
We will consider some examples of CT and DT systems to illustrate the 
concept of linearity. We will first consider CT systems
Example 3.1 
Check if the homogeneity property holds good for a system given by y(t) = 5? 
Find if the system is linear.
Solution
Note that for any input, the output is constant. We will have to check if 
the homogeneity and additivity property hold good. We will first check 
homogeneity property. If the input is doubled (scaled by a factor of 2), 
the output is not scaled by the same factor. It remains constant equal to 5. 
According to the property of homogeneity,

(3.7)
Here, the output remains constant even if the input is doubled. Hence, the 
system is not homogeneous. 
We will now check for additivity.
If the input to the system is x1(t) + x2(t), then the output must be

(3.8) 
if the property of additivity holds good. The actual output is just equal to 5 
whatever the applied input is. The additivity also fails.
The system is not homogeneous and not additive and hence, is not linear. 

Signals and Systems
184
Example 3.2
Check if the system given by y(t) = x(t) + 2 is linear.
Solution
In the given system, for an input x(t), the output is given by
y(t) = x(t) + 2 
(3.9)
Therefore for the input kx(t), where k is any scaling factor, according to 
homogeneity property, the output would be
y(t) = k[x(t) + 2] ≠ k[x(t)] + 2 
(3.10)
Hence, the system is not homogeneous. 
We will now check for additivity.
If the input to the system is x1(t) + x2(t), then output must be

(3.12)
The additivity property also fails.
Teaser The graph for both above systems is a straight line, yet they are non-
linear systems! The above systems are said to have a bias. The systems with 
bias are incrementally linear.  The incrementally linear system will have a 
graph of Δy Vs  Δx as linear and it will pass through the origin.
Example 3.3
Check if the system given by y(t) = x(t) + x(t – 1) is linear.
Solution
Let the system be y(t) = x(t) + x(t – 1). Suppose the input is kx(t), where k is 
any scaling factor. Then the output is 
y(t) = kx(t) + kx(t – 1) 
(3.13)  
To satisfy the homogeneity property the output should be y(t) = k[x(t) + 
x(t – 1)], which is the actual output. Hence, the system is homogeneous. 
To satisfy the property of additivity, if the input to the system is x1(t) + x2(t) 
then output must be

The additivity property holds good. Hence, the system is linear.
Note The system obeys superposition property and hence, is linear!
Example 3.4
Find if the system given by y(t) = 0.1 × x(t) is linear?
Solution
Let the system be y(t) = 0.1 × x(t). Suppose the input is kx(t), where k is any 
scaling factor. Then the output is 
y(n) = 0.1k × x(t) 
(3.16)

then the output must be

Note The graph of the system is linear and it passes through the origin!
Let us solve some examples for DT systems.
Example 3.5 
Does the homogeneity property hold for y[n] = 2? Is the system linear?
Solution 
Note that for any input, the output is constant. We will have to check if 
the homogeneity and additivity property hold good. We will first check the 
homogeneity property. If the input is doubled (scaled by a factor of 2), the 
output is not scaled by the same factor. It remains constant equal to 2. Hence, 
the system is not homogeneous.

We will now check for additivity.
If the input to the system is x1[n] + x2[n], then the output must be

(3.20)
if the property of additivity holds good. The actual output is just equal to 2 
whatever the applied input is. The additivity also fails.
The system is not homogeneous and not additive and hence, is not linear. 
Example 3.6
Consider the following system y[n] = x[n] + c. Is the system homogeneous? Is 
it linear?
Solution
In the given system, for an input x(n) the output is given by
y[n] = x[n] + c 
(3.21)
Therefore for the input kx[n], where k is any scaling factor, the output 
would be
y[n] = k[x[n]] + c 
(3.22)
According to the condition of homogeneity property the output in this case 
should be k times the output when the input was x[n], that is, the output 
should be 
k[x[n] + c] 
(3.23)
which is not the case and hence, the system is not homogeneous. 
We will now check for additivity.

✓ Teaser The graph for both the systems is a straight line, yet they are non-
linear systems! The above systems are said to have a bias. The systems with 
bias are incrementally linear.  The incrementally linear system will have a 
graph of Δy Vs  Δx as linear and it will pass through the origin.

✓  Things to remember The system is a linear system if the output Vs input 
graph for a system is linear and it passes the through origin. If the graph is 
linear and it does not pass through the origin, it is an incrementally linear 
system, but not a linear system. A system with a non-linear transfer graph 
is linear if it obeys the superposition principle. 
Example 3.7
Consider the following system   y[n] = |x[n]|. Is the system linear?
Solution
Suppose the input is kx[n], where k is any scaling factor, then the output is 
y[n] = |kx[n]|  
(3.26)
To satisfy the homogeneity property the output should be
y[n] = k|x[n]| 
(3.27)
Hence, the system is not homogeneous. The system is not homogeneous, 
therefore it is non-linear.

x2[n], then the output must be

Consider the following systems and verify the homogeneity and additivity 
property. 
1. y[n] = 0
2. y[n] = x[0] 
3. y[n] = x[n – 1]
4. y[n] = 2x[n] + 3x[n – 1]
5. y[n] = 0.2x[n] – 0.1y[n – 1] 
Solution
1. Let the system be y[n] = 0. Suppose the input is kx[n], where k is any scaling 
factor, then the output is zero = ky[n].  
 
 To satisfy the homogeneity property the output should be y[n]= k × 0 = 
0. Hence, the system is homogeneous.

 3.1.2 
Time invariance / shift invariance property 
Most signal-processing (DSP) techniques also require the system to be shift 
invariant even though it is not a requirement for linearity. The system is said 
to be time invariant or shift invariant if its input–output characteristics do 
not change with time. If y(t) or y[n] is the output for some input x(t) or x[n], 
respectively, for analog and digital systems, then for a shift invariant system, 
if the input is shifted by k time units / k samples to the right, that is, the input 
is x(t – k)/x[n – k] then the output is y(t – k)/y[n – k], that is, the output is 
also shifted by k time units/k samples to the right. The system that is linear 
and obeys the time invariance property is called a linear time invariant (LTI) 
system. We will refer to the LTI systems only unless stated otherwise. 
Physical significance of time/shift invariance If the system is time/shift 
invariant, then the output of the system for any shifted input can be easily 
calculated by introducing same amount of shift in the output. 
Physical significance of linear time/shift invariance If the system is LTI, 
one can characterize the system in terms of its impulse response. One may 
decompose any input signal into scaled and shifted delta functions and the 
output of the system can be obtained using the principle of superposition. 
The output of the system to a shifted delta function is just the shifted impulse 
response. The computation of the output to any input signal is greatly 
simplified.  
We will illustrate the property of shift invariance with the help of CT and 
DT systems.
Example 3.11
(Non-linear and non shift invariant system) Is the following system linear and 
shift/time invariant?  y(t) = x(1).
Solution
We will verify the shift invariance property. Let the input be shifted by k time 
units, therefore the new input is x(t – k). The output is still x(1) and is not 

CT and DT Systems
195
shifted by k time units. So, the system is not a shift variant system. We will now 
check for linearity. If the input is kx(t), the output must be kx(1). However, the 
actual output is just x(1) and is constant. Similarly, if the input is x1(t) + x2(t), 
still the output is
y(t) = x(1) ≠ x(1) + x(1) 
(3.54) 
Teaser Verify that the system is non-linear by checking conditions for 
homogeneity and additivity. (The system is non-linear.)
Example 3.12
(Shift invariant, but non-linear system) Check if the following system is shift 
invariant and linear? y(t) = [x(t)]2. Prove that the system is shift invariant, but 
non-linear.
Solution
We will verify the shift invariance property. Let the input be shifted by k 
time units, therefore the new input is x(t – k). The output is [x(t – k)]2 and 
is same as shifted by k time units i.e., y(t – k). So, the system is a shift variant 
system. We will now check for linearity. If the input is kx(t), the output must 
be k[x(t)]2. However, the actual output is [kx(t)]2 Similarly, if the input is 
x1(t) + x2(t), the output is not 
y(t) = [x1(t)+x2(t)]2 ≠ [x1(t)]2 + [x2(t)]2 
(3.55)

Therefore the system is additive.
The system satisfies both the homogeneity and additivity properties, 
therefore the system is linear. It is also shift invariant. Hence, the system is an 
LTI system.
We will solve some examples for DT systems.
Example 3.14
(Non-linear and non-shift invariant) Is the following system shift variant? Is 
it linear? y[n] = x[0] 
Solution
We will verify the shift invariance property. Let the input be shifted by k units; 
therefore, the new input is x[n – k]. The output is still x[0] and is not shifted 
by k units. So, the system is not a shift variant system
Teaser Verify that the system is non-linear. (The system non-linear.) Verify 
homogeneity and additivity property.
Example 3.15
(Shift Invariant however, Non-Linear System)
Consider the following system: y[n] = x[n]2 
Prove that the system is shift invariant, but non-linear.
Solution
We will verify the shift invariance property. Let the input be shifted by k units, 
that is the new input be x[n – k]. Then the output is given by

(3.58)
One can see that the output is also shifted by k units. So the system is a shift 
invariant system. 
Let us now check the linearity of the system. Let x[n] = 3, then y[n] = x[n]2 = 9. 
If the input is now doubled, that is, if x[n] = 6, then the output is

(3.59)
We see that the output is not doubled. So, the system is not homogeneous and 
hence, is not linear. The reader may also check for additivity property.

Let us now check the linearity of the system. 
1. Homogeneity: Let the input be doubled. Then the output is also doubled. 
So, the system is homogeneous. 
2. Additivity: We will check the additivity. Let the input be a1x1[n] + a2x2[n]

  3.2 Properties of CT and DT Systems – Causality and   
Memory
We will study the properties of causality and memory in this section.
3.2.1 
Causality property
A system is said to be causal if its present output depends only on past and 
present inputs and past outputs. Let us consider an example of a causal CT 
and DT system.

(3.74)
Here, the output at time instant ‘t’ in case of CT system or ‘n’ in case of DT 
system depends on current input at time instant ‘t’ or ‘n’ and past input and 
output at instant ‘t – 1’ or ‘n – 1’ i.e., previous time sample. These systems are 
causal. Now consider CT and DT systems represented as

(3.76)
These are non-causal systems as the output of the system at current time instant 
‘t’ or ‘n’ depends on the current inputs and the next input at time instant  
‘t + 1’ and ‘n + 1’, respectively. 

Signals and Systems
202
Physical significance of Causality Causal systems are practically realizable 
or implementable. The system of a human being is causal as we always keep 
on learning from the past inputs and past outputs of the system. The future 
inputs have no effect on our act at current or present time. The causal systems 
can be implemented in real time. The present and past inputs have meaning 
only for temporal systems where time is an independent variable. In case of 
spatial domain systems, present and past input has no meaning. Such non- 
causal systems can be implemented after grabbing the complete input data. 
Non-causal temporal systems can be implemented if some delay is tolerable. 
The system considers the future inputs for calculating the current outputs 
and can generate a bench mark for system performance. The real-time system 
performance may be compared with the ideal system implemented with some 
tolerable delay. Offline systems can always be implemented as non-causal 
systems. 
We will consider some examples for CT systems first.

y t
h

d  
Is the system causal? If not, explain why.
Solution
In this case, h(t) exists for  τ = –1. The input for this value of time is t + 1.
The output of the system at time instant t depends on the next input, i.e., 
input at t + 1, therefore the system is non-causal.
Example 3.20
Consider a system given by  y(t) = x(t – 1) + y(t – 3) Is the system causal?
Solution
The output of the system at instant t depends on input at current time instant t 
and past input at t = t – 1 and past output at time instant  t = t – 3, therefore 
the system is causal.
Example 3.21
Consider a system represented as y(t) = x(1 – t). Is it causal? 
Solution
The system output at time instant t depends on time instant 1 – t. consider  
t = –2, 1 – t becomes 1 + 2 i.e., 3. So, the output at t = –2 time units depends 
on input at time instant t = 3. This is a future time instant. Hence, the system 
is non-causal.  
We will now consider examples for DT systems.

The output of the system at instant n depends on the next input, i.e.,  input at

We see from Eq. (3.78) that the output of the system at n depends on the input 
at the next time instant, that is, at n + 1, if h[n] exists for n = –1 and therefore 
the system becomes non-causal.

Solution

Reason To see why it is non-causal, put n = –2 in the given equation. We 
will get
y[–2] = x[2] 
(3.79)
The output at n = –2 depends on the input at the next time instant, that is,
n = 2; therefore, the system is non-causal;

the inputs up to t = 1. Let us put t = –4, now we have to integrate the inputs 
up to t = –1, which is the next time instant.  Hence, the system is non-

on input at 4 = 3 – (–1) i.e.,  the next time instant.  Hence, the system is 
non-causal.
5. y(t) = x(t/5). Let us put t = –5, the output at t = –5 depends on input at  
t = –1, which is the next time instant. Hence, the system is non-causal.

2. y[n] = 3x[n]u[n].
Let us first write the definition of u[n].
u[n] = 1 for n ≥ 0
= 0 otherwise
Let us put n = –1, u[–1] = 0, The output at time ‘–1’ is zero irrespective of 
the input x[n]. Let us put n = +1, u[+1] = 1, The output at time ‘1’ is 3x[1] 
depend on current input x[1]. The system is causal. 
3. y[n] = log10(|x[n]|). Let us put n = –1, the output at t = –1 will depend on 
log of x[–1], i.e., current time instant input. The system is causal.

the delta function exists, then the system is causal.
6. y[n] = x[n2]. Consider n = 1, the output at time instant 1 depends on input 
sample at time instant 1; however, the output at time instant 2 depends on 
the input at time instant 4. This makes the system non-causal.
 3.2.2 Memory
The system is said to have memory or said to be dynamic if its current output 
depends on previous, future input or previous and future output signals. The 
system is said to be memoryless or instantaneous if its current output depends 
only on the current input.  The extent of memory depends on the number of 
past inputs or outputs on which the current output depends.
We will consider examples of systems with memory.

Does the system have memory?
Solution

memory. The memory extends into infinite past inputs.

Solution
The current output of the system depends only on the current input. The 
system is without memory or is memoryless.

Solution
The current output of the system depends on current and one past input. The 
system is with memory. The memory extends into one past input.

Does the system have memory?
Solution
The current output of the system depends only on the current input. The 
system is without memory or is memoryless.   
Physical significance of memory The systems containing only the resistive 
network has no memory and is said to be memoryless or instantaneous 
systems. If the system contains active element like capacitor or inductor, 
the system memory will extend up to infinity.  Such systems are said to be 
dynamic. Generally, we have to handle dynamic systems. We human beings 
always learn from the past. Our brain system has a memory that allows us to 
understand the new concepts.

4. y(t) = x(3 – t). Let us put t = 2. The output at time instant of 2 depends on 
input at t = 3 –(2) = 1 i.e., the previous time instant.  Hence, the system 
has memory. The extent of memory varies with the value of the current 
instant. 
5. y(t) = x(t / 5). The output at the current instant depends on the input at 
previous instant t/5. The system has memory. The extent of memory is up 
to t/5 time.

on future inputs and the extent of memory depends on the value of ‘n’

  3.3 Properties of CT and DT Systems – Invertibility and  
Stability
We will study the properties of invertibility and stability in this section.
  3.3.1 Invertibility
If it is possible to recover the input of the system, then the system is said to 
be invertible. Consider the system represented by the operator H producing 
the output as y(t) with input as x(t). The idea of system invertbility is more 
clearly understood if one considers the new operator H–1called as inverse 
operator with the so-called inverse system, as shown in Fig. 3.2. The H–1 is not 
the reciprocal of the operator H; however, it is the symbol used to indicate the 
inverse.

Fig. 3.2 Invertibility of systems
Note that there must be a one-to-one correspondence between the input and 
the output in order to have invertibility. 
Physical significance of invertibility When we use a system for processing 
the signal, for example, for calculating some transform for removing the noise, 
the system is required to be invertible (inverse transform) to recover the signal 
back in time domain. If we process the signal to extract some features for 
recognition, then the system may be non-invertible as we are not recovering 
the signal. Invertible system also finds applications in communication field. 
For error-free transmission an equalizer is used at the input of the receiver that 
has inverse characteristics as that of the channel.   
We will consider some examples of invertible systems.

  3.3.2 Stability
Stability is a notion that describes whether the system will be able to follow the 
input. A system is said to be unstable if its output is out of control or increases 
without bound. To define stability, we define the following types of responses 
for linear time invariant systems. 
1. Zero State Response This is due to the input only. All initial conditions 
are zero.
2. Zero Input Response This is due to the initial conditions only. All inputs 
are zero.
The system response will be discussed in detail in chapter 4. 
BIBO stability An arbitrary relaxed system (with zero initial conditions) 
is said to be bounded input bounded output (BIBO) stable if and only if its 
output is bounded for every bounded input.

For zero input stability, the magnitude of the output signal/sequence must 
be finite and it must asymptotically approach zero. If the output sequence is 
represented as y[n], then

Physical significance of Stability The stable system is only of practical 
value. If the system is unstable, the extraneous noise or even thermal noise 
may allow the system to become unstable and the system output may become 
infinite. The characteristic roots of the system will basically decide the stability 
of the system. (Refer to section 4.2.)
We will consider some examples to illustrate the concepts.
Example 3.41
Consider a system given by y(t) = x(t) + 3. Determine if the system is stable. 
Solution
Let the input signal be bounded.

This section interprets the systems as interconnection of operations. Let us 
consider a simple example to illustrate the concept. When the input signal is

transformed by some operator H to produce the output signal, the operator 
denotes the action of the system. Let the output of any system y(t) or y[n] be 
represented as 
y(t) = H[x(t)]
y[n] = H[x[n]] 
(3.113)
Where, H is the operator that acts on the input signal x(t) or x[n] to produce 
the output y(t) or y[n]. The operator H can be represented as interconnection 
of operators as follows.

This equation represents a moving average system. Basically, the current 
output of the system is found by taking the average of current and previous two 
input samples. To obtain the next output sample, we have to take the average 
of next, current and the previous input sample. This is a sliding average and 
hence, called as the moving average system.  Let us try to represent the system 
in the form of a block schematic, as shown in Fig. 3.1. Let us represent the 
time shifting operation by the operator S. Here, S represents a time shift by 1 
time unit for CT systems and time shift by 1 sample for DT systems.  Now, the 
operator H can be represented as

We can conclude that when the two systems are cascaded or connected in 
series, the impulse response of the cascaded system is the convolution of 
impulse responses of the two systems. 
Fig. 3.8 Series interconnection of CT systems
In case of DT systems, same equations will hold good. When the two systems 
with impulse responses h1[n] and h2[n] are cascaded or connected in series, 
the impulse response of the cascaded system is the convolution of impulse 
responses of the two systems given by h1[n]*h2[n]. 
Consider the series connection of two linear and shift invariant systems, 
i.e., LTI DT systems, as shown in Fig. 3.9. Let the impulse responses of the two 
systems be specified as h1[n] and h2[n], respectively. The series connection is 
also termed as cascaded configuration. The output of the system is y[n]. Let

Consider the parallel connection of two linear and shift invariant systems, 
i.e., LTI systems, as shown in Fig. 3.10. Let the impulse responses of the two 
systems be specified as h1(t) and h2(t), respectively.

systems with impulse responses h1[n] and h2[n] are connected in parallel, the 
impulse response of the cascaded system is the addition of impulse responses 
of the two systems given by h1[n] + h2[n].

We can conclude that when the two systems are connected in parallel, the 
impulse response of the parallel configuration system is the addition of 
impulse responses of the two systems. 
Let us go through some numerical problems to illustrate the concepts. 
Example 3.51
Consider the configuration shown in Fig. 3.12 with impulse responses given 
by h1(t), h2(t), h3(t) for the systems, as shown. Find the impulse response of the 
overall configuration.
Fig. 3.12 Configuration of three systems for Example 3.51
Solution
Firstly we will find the impulse response of the parallel interconnection of two 
systems with impulse response h1(t) and h2(t). The impulse response of the 
parallel configuration is h(t) = h1(t) + h2(t). The third system is connected 
in series with the parallel configuration. Hence, the impulse response of the 
series configuration will be the convolution of the two impulse responses. We 
find that the distributive law holds good.

• How will you find the impulse response of the parallel configuration?
• Does the rule for series and parallel interconnection hold good for DT 
systems?
Summary
In this chapter, we have described and explained the properties of DT systems.
• We have discussed the important properties of DT systems, namely, 
linearity and shift invariance. It was shown that a system is linear when it is 
homogeneous as well as additive. It was emphasized that if the transfer curve 
of the system is linear passing through the origin, then it is linear. Linearity has 
a meaning more than this. If the system obeys the principle of superposition 
i.e., additivity and homogeneity, then the system is linear. We then defined 
the property of time/shift invariance. If the system is linear, the input signal 
can be suitably decomposed into component signals and the corresponding 
outputs for the component signals one at a time can be calculated by assuming 
all other inputs equal to zero. The component outputs can be scaled and added 
to generate the output of the system for the input signal. This is exactly the 
property of superposition. The system is said to be time/shift invariant if 
the input to the system is shifted impulse d(n – k), then it results in a shifted 
impulse response of h(n – k). The linear and shift invariant system is termed 
as LTI system. If the system is LTI, one can characterize the system in terms 
of its impulse response. The calculation of the output for any given input in 
case of LTI system gets greatly simplified due to the principle of superposition. 
• We further concentrated on causality and memory property of systems. We 
defined the property of causality for systems. The system is said to be causal 
if the present output of the system depends only on current and past input 
or output at previous instant. Causal systems are practically realizable or 
implementable. The system of a human being is causal as we always keep on 
learning from the past inputs and past outputs of the system. The future inputs 
have no effect on our act at current or present time. The present and past 
inputs have meaning only for temporal systems where time is an independent 
variable. In case of spatial domain systems, present and past input has no 
meaning. Non-causal temporal systems can be implemented if some delay is 
tolerable. We can generate a bench mark for system performance using non- 
causal systems. Offline systems can always be implemented as non-causal 
systems. The system is said to have memory or said to be dynamic if its current 
output depends on previous, future input or previous and future output 
signals. The system is said to be memoryless or instantaneous if its current 
output depends only on current input.  Examples of memoryless systems are 
the systems containing only resistive elements.

Signals and Systems
236
• We further discussed invertibility and stability. If it is possible to recover the 
input of the system, then the system is said to be invertible. Invertible system 
also finds applications in communication field. For error-free transmission an 
equalizer is used at the input of the receiver that has inverse characteristics as 
that of the channel.  Stability is a notion that describes whether the system will 
be able to follow the input. A system is said to be unstable if its output is out 
of control or increases without bound. An arbitrary relaxed system (with zero 
initial conditions) is said to be bounded input bounded output (BIBO) stable 
if and only if its output is bounded for every bounded input.
• The system can be described as an interconnection of operations. If the time 
delay is represented as S block, we can draw the block schematic for the time 
difference equations. We have discussed series and parallel interconnections of 
LTI systems and have shown that for series connections, the impulse responses 
of the individual systems get convolved and for parallel interconnections, the 
impulse responses of individual systems get added.

  4.1 Response of CT Systems
Let us discuss the response of the system based on its differential equation. We 
will consider a system described by the differential equation and illustrate the 
response of the system due to initial conditions called as zero input response 
and the response due to externally applied input with all initial conditions 
zero namely zero state response. The total response of the system is then the 
addition of zero input response and the zero state response. 
Consider a generalized differential equation for a system.

is termed as a numerator polynomial 
of order m. We will consider two cases for the ratio of degree of a numerator 
to the degree of a denominator namely m/n.  
Case 1 n < m, i.e., the ratio is greater than 1. In this case, the system behaves 
as a differentiator of the order m – n. It will amplify high-frequency noise 
through differentiation. High-frequency signal will have high amplitude of 
differentiation output. The system will be more prone to noise. 
Case 2 n > m, i.e., the ratio is less than 1. In this case, the system will be stable 
and it will not amplify noise.   
We will assume that the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of 
the denominator polynomial i.e., case 2 holds good. 
4.1.1 
Zero input response

the externally applied input x(t) is zero, we get the system equation as

, this indicates that all the n derivatives

; if all n derivatives are to be zero, then this is true only for the 
exponential function.  
2. The second reason is that in case of the LTI systems, if the input is 
exponential function, the output is also an exponential function. The other 
functions cannot have this claim. The exponential solutions are called as 
eigen functions. 
The characteristic modes decide the behaviour of the system when the external 
input is zero. The response of the system when the external input is zero is 
termed as the zero input response. The characteristic modes will also play a 
major role in deciding the zero state response. The characteristic roots may be 
all distinct, may be repeated roots or may be complex roots. 
We will consider a numerical problem to illustrate the concepts.

  4.2 System Representation as Impulse Response
Let us first understand the meaning of impulse response of the system. As 
discussed in chapter 2, there are some standard inputs used for testing the 
response of the system. One such standard input is an impulse. The response 
of the system to the impulse function is termed as an impulse response of the 
system and is generally denoted as h(t) or h(n) in case of CT and DT systems, 
respectively. Impulse response goes by a different name in some other 
applications. If a system is functioning as a filter, then the impulse response is 
called the filter Kernel, the convolution Kernel or simply the Kernel. In image 
processing, impulse response is called the point spread function. 
Any CT or DT system can be characterized by its impulse response. Any 
DT signal can be decomposed into summation of weighted and shifted unit 
impulses. Unit impulse function in CT domain is used as a standard input 
for testing of the system. When any CT input signal is applied, the output is 
obtained either as a convolution integral of the input signal with the impulse 
response of the system. Let us try to understand the concept of convolution. 
Let us deal with CT systems first. Any input signal can be represented 
in terms of unit impulses. Ideally impulse function exists in time domain. 
Practically, generating the impulse function with infinite amplitude and 
zero width is impossible. Impulses can be realized as the pulses of very small 

Signals and Systems
250
duration and very high amplitude. Ideal impulse function cannot be realised 
in practice. Summarizing, we can say that the impulse function is used as a 
standard input to the LTI systems for the following reasons.
1. Any signal can be decomposed into a linear combination of scaled and 
shifted impulses.
2. LTI system is completely characterised by its impulse response.
3. The output is obtained by the convolution of input signal with the impulse 
response. 
Consider any analog signal. We will try to decompose the input signal into 
closely spaced impulses. If we know the response of the system to the impulse 
function, the response of the system to any input can be found out as follows. 
1. Decompose the input signal in terms number of impulse functions. 
2. Find the response of the system for each of these impulses.
3. Integrate the responses to get the final response. 
 4.2.1 
Representation of signals in terms of impulses 
Let us first understand the decomposition of the signal in terms of impulses. 
The signal under consideration can be decomposed in two ways.
1. The signal can be decomposed into shifted and scaled impulses.
2. The signal can be decomposed into scaled exponential functions.
If the signal is decomposed using impulses, we will represent the system 
in terms of the impulse response and if the signal is decomposed using 
exponential functions, we will represent the system in terms of its frequency 
response. Decomposition of the signal using exponential functions and the 
frequency response will be discussed in chapter 5.
The representation of the system in terms of its impulse response is discussed 
in chapter 4 and representation of the system in terms of its frequency response 
will be discussed in chapter 5. Let us first understand the decomposition of the 
CT signal in scaled and translated unit impulses. Consider a CT signal x(t) as 
shown in Fig. 4.10. Let us consider a pulsed or staircase approximation to x(t). 
A small duration pulse is defined as δ∆( )t .
A CT signal x(t) may be decomposed into pulses of small duration ∆ and 
with different scaling factors equal to the height of the pulse, as shown in Fig. 
4.1. The pulsed approximation to x(t) can be written as

has unit amplitude. The staircase 
approximation to a CT signal x(t) can be depicted in Fig. 4.1.
Fig. 4.1 Staircase approximation to a continuous time signal
The approximation is closer as the duration of the pulse approaches zero. As 
∆ approaches zero, the staircase approximation to x(t) will change into the 
integral and can be written as

where dτ represents a small duration of the pulse tending to zero, x(τ) is the 
amplitude of the pulse and δ(t – τ) represents a delta function at t = τ. Using 
the property of shifting for the delta function, the integral is equal to x(t). 
 We assume that the system is a linear time invariant (LTI) system. When 
the input signal is decomposed in terms of impulses, it is easy to find the 
system response to any input signal using the principle of superposition. Let 
the system be characterized by its impulse response h(t). 
The procedure to find the response of the system to the signal x(t) using a 
graphical method can be stated as follows.
1. Decompose the signal x(t) in terms of scaled and shifted unit impulses.
2. Find the response of the system x(t) to unit impulse at t = 0.

Signals and Systems
252
3. The system being shift invariant, the response of the system to impulse at
t = t1 is h(t – t1).
4. Find the response of the system to all shifted impulses.
5. Finally add all the responses.
 4.2.2 Calculation of impulse response of the system
Referring to section 4.1 the system equation must have a degree of numerator 
polynomial less than the degree of the denominator polynomial for 
noise considerations and for stability. The section 4.2 discusses about the 
decomposition of the signal into unit impulses. To find the response of the 
system to any input, we must know the impulse response of the system. The 
impulse response can be found out by applying an impulse at t = 0 and assuming 
zero initial conditions before the application of the impulse. The impulse is 
like a sudden shock and it generates the energy storages in the system after
t = 0.  It creates new initial conditions in the system. These newly created 
initial conditions will generate the system response even after the impulse is 
removed immediately after t = 0. The system response generated will naturally 
depend on the characteristic modes of the system. At the instant t = 0, the 
response will at the most be equal to the scaled impulse and it will exist only 
if the degree of the numerator is same as the degree of the denominator. The 
generalized equation for the impulse response can be written as

For the proof of the above equation the reader may refer to the chapter on

  4.3 Convolution Integral for CT Systems
We will assume the system to be linear and time invariant i.e., LTI. Let us 
represent the impulse response of the CT system as h(t) for the impulse at 
t = 0. We have implemented step 1 of the procedure in section 4.2.1. Let us 
implement steps 3, 4 and 5. The output of the system can be written as

The output can be seen as the weighted sum of the shifted impulse responses. 
The weights are the amplitude of the impulse at each time instant i.e., x(τ). The

(4.39)
Here, * denotes convolution operation. 
The procedure for the calculation of the convolution integral can be stated 
as follows:
1. Plot a graph of x(τ) and h(–τ). To plot h(–τ), we have to reflect h(τ) about 
τ = 0. 
2. Start with time shift t large and negative.
3. Find x(τ) h(t – τ) and y(t).
4. Increase the time shift t until functional form of the product x(τ) h(t – τ) 
changes.
5. Find x(τ) h(t – τ) and y(t) for the new interval of t.
6. Continue by increasing t in positive direction and each of new interval t 
find y(t).
Let us illustrate this procedure by some numerical examples. If the impulse 
response of the system is known, then the response of the system to any 
external input can be easily calculated by convolving the impulse response 
with the input signal. This is called as convolution integral.

We start with step 1 i.e., drawing x(τ) and h(–τ).
Step 1 Let us draw both these waveforms. Plots of x(τ) and h(t – τ) for 
different intervals are shown in Fig. 4.2. We have to shift h(t – τ) slowly 
towards the right.
Step 2 Start with time shift t large and negative. Let t vary from minus 
infinity to zero. We find that until t crosses zero, there is no overlap between 
the two signals. So, the convolution integral has a value ranging from minus 
infinity to zero. At t = 0, the right edge of h(–τ) touches left edge of x(τ).

Let x(t) = 2 for 1 ≤ t ≤ 2, h(t) = 1 for 0 ≤ t ≤ 3, , find x(t)*h(t).
Solution
We start with step 1 i.e., drawing x(τ) and h(–τ).
Step 1 Let us draw both these waveforms. Figure 4.6 shows plots of x(τ) and 
h(t – τ) for different intervals.
Step 2 Start with time shift t large and negative. Let t vary from minus 
infinity to 1. We find that until t crosses 1, there is no overlap between the two 
signals. So, the convolution integral has a value of zero from minus infinity to 
zero. At t = 1, the right edge of h(–τ) touches the left edge of x(τ).
Step 3 Consider the second interval between t = 1 to 2. x(τ)h(t – τ) = 2.
The overlapping interval will be between 0 and t. The output can be 
calculated as

Solution
We start with step 1 i.e., drawing x(τ) and h(–τ).
Step 1 Let us draw both these waveforms. Figure 4.10 shows the plots of x(τ) 
and h(t – τ) for different intervals. 
Step 2 Start with time shift t large and negative. Let t vary from minus 
infinity to zero. We find that until t crosses zero, there is no overlap between 
the two signals. So, the convolution integral has a value of zero from minus 
infinity to zero. At t = 0, the right edge of h(–τ) touches the left edge of x(τ).
Step 3 Consider the second interval between t = 0 to 2. x(τ)h(t – τ) = 2(t – τ).

4.3.1 
Zero state response
The zero state response can be defined as the response of the system for the 
external input assuming zero initial conditions. When the initial conditions 
are zero, the system is said to be relaxed. We have seen the procedure for the 
calculation of impulse response of the system in section 4.2.2. The computation 
of the convolution integral is studied in section 4.3.1. To find the response of 
the system for external input, we have to convolve the impulse response of 
the system with the input using the procedure studied in section 4.3.1. We 
will illustrate the calculation of zero state response with the help of a simple 
numerical problem. 
Example 4.10
Consider a system given by (D + 2)y(t) = x(t). The impulse response is 
calculated as h(t) = (e–2tu(t)). Let the external input be applied as x(t) = (e–t 
u(t)). Find the response of the system for the applied input. 
Solution
We have to find the zero state response by convolving the impulse response 
with the externally applied input assuming all initial conditions as zero. 
We start with step 1 i.e., drawing x(τ) and h(–τ).
Step 1 Let us draw both these waveforms. Figure 4.13 shows plots of x(τ) and 
h(t – τ) for different intervals.
Step 2 Start with time shift t large and negative. Let t vary from minus 
infinity to zero. We find that until t crosses zero, there is no overlap between 
the two signals. So, the convolution integral has a value of zero from minus 
infinity to zero. At t = 0, the right edge of h(–τ) touches the left edge of x(τ).
Step 3 Consider the second interval between t = 0 to ∞. x(τ )h(t – τ ) = e–2τ 
e–(t – τ).
The overlapping interval will be between 0 and t. The output can be calculated as

  4.4 Response of DT Systems
Let us discuss the response of the system based on its difference equation. DT 
systems are described in terms of the difference equation. We will consider a
Fig. 4.15 Convolved output for Example 4.10
system described by the difference equation and illustrate the procedure for 
evaluating the response of the system. The reader may recall the meaning of 
zero input response and the zero state response. When the external input is 

Signals and Systems
272
zero, the response of the system is termed as zero input response. When the 
external input is applied and the initial conditions are zero i.e., the system is 
relaxed, the output of the system is termed as the zero state response. We may 
evaluate the zero input response and zero state response separately and then 
find the total response. The total response of the system is then found as the 
addition of zero input response and the zero state response. 
Consider a generalized difference equation in advance form for a DT system 
given by the equation

For a causal system m ≤ n, so that the output of the system does not depend 
on future inputs or future output samples. The coefficient of y[k + n] is 
normalized to unity. We will introduce a delay of n samples for all the terms.

 (Dn + an–1Dn–1 + … + a0) is referred to as a denominator polynomial in D of 
order n and (bm Dm + bm–1 Dm–1 + … + b0) is termed as a numerator polynomial 
of order m for a ratio of output to the input of the system. Let us consider two 
cases.
Case 1 n < m, i.e., the ratio is greater than 1. In this case, the system behaves 
as a differentiator of order m – n. It will amplify high-frequency noise 
through differentiation. High-frequency signal will have high amplitude of 
differentiation output. The system will be more prone to noise. 
Case 2 n > m, i.e., the ratio is less than 1. In this case, the system will be stable 
and it will not amplify noise.   
We will assume that the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the 
denominator polynomial i.e., case 2 holds good. 

Signals and Systems

 4.4.1 
Zero input response
The denominator polynomial is called as the characteristic polynomial. When 
the externally applied input f[k] is zero, we get the system equation as 
(Dn + a1Dn–1 +…….+ an) = 0. Let us assume the solution as y[k] = crk. Putting 
this value of y[k] in the polynomial, we get

This polynomial is same as the polynomial in D or with D replaced by r. This

The roots of the characteristic polynomial are called as characteristic roots 
or eigen values or natural frequencies of the system. The characteristic modes 
or the natural modes are denoted as 
1,2,
k
ir i =
…, etc. These are also termed as 
eigen functions of the system. 
We write the roots as exponential functions for two reasons:
To get the linear combination of y[k] to get the values of y[k], y[k + 1], … 
y[k + n] etc. zero for all values of k, y[k] and y[n + k] must have the same form. 
Only an exponential function satisfies this condition.  
The second reason is that in case of the LTI systems, if the input is an 
exponential function, the output is also an exponential function. The other 
functions cannot have this claim. The exponential solutions are called as eigen 
functions. 
The characteristic modes decide the behaviour of the system when the 
external input is zero. The response of the system is termed as the zero input 
response. The characteristic modes will also play a major role in deciding 
the zero state response. The characteristic roots may be all distinct, may be 
repeated roots or may be complex roots. 
We will consider a numerical problem to illustrate the concepts.

the input. The initial conditions will now be assumed to be zero and the input 
will be applied to find the zero state response. The input can be decomposed 
into linear combination of impulses and the responses to all impulses can be 
added to get the total response. We will illustrate this with the help of a simple 
numerical example.

  4.5 Representation of DT Signals in Terms of Delta Functions
We will use the property of superposition for decomposition of a sequence using 
scaled and shifted delta functions. Let us first go through the superposition 
property of LTI systems.
Property of Superposition
For LTI systems, once the impulse response is known, the system response to 
any DT input signal can easily be analyzed using the principle of superposition.
Most of the DSP techniques work on the principle of divide and conquer. 
This technique allows us to break the input into small parts and find the 
output for every small part and finally combine the outputs for small parts 
using the principle of superposition. A system is said to obey the property 
of superposition if it obeys the properties of homogeneity and additivity and 
is then called a linear system. Superposition is a powerful tool for analyzing 
complicated input signals. 
Figure 4.16 depicts the principle of superposition clearly. In this figure, for 
the input k1x1[n] + k2x2[n] to a system the output is k1y1[n] + k2y2[n].

Fig. 4.18 Input side algorithm
Output side algorithm for convolution
This algorithm changes the viewpoint for the process of convolution. It 
finds out number of input signal components contributing the output point. 
Contribution at each time instant is shown in Fig. 19.
Step 1 Concentrate on the output at n = 0. The only input component 
contributing to this output point is at n = 0. The output is 1*1 = 1, as shown 
in Fig. 4.9. 
Step 2 The output at n = 1 is contributed from input at n = 0 and input at n 
= 1(red color lines). The output is 2*1 + 1*2 = 4. The output is contributed by 
solid lines.
 Step 3
The output at n = 2 is shown to be contributed by three green lines. 
We observe from the three dotted lines that it is as if the impulse response is 
flipped around to find the output at n = 2. The output is 1*1 + 2*2 + 2*1 = 7. 
Step 4 Similarly the output at n = 3 is contributed by the three dash dotted 
paths. The output is again 7. 
Step 5
Calculate the output at n = 3 on similar lines. Output at n = 3 is 
obtained from the two long dashed lines 2*1 + 1*2 = 4

Step 6 The output at n = 4 is 1*1 = 1 from the single long dash dot dot line.

Consider the convolution of two sequences given by 
x[n] = {1 2 2 1}
h[n] = {1 2 1}

where P is the number of points in the sequence x[n] and Q is the number of 
points in the sequence h[n]. The procedure for computation of the sum can be 
stated as follows.
Step 1 Invert one of the sequences, that is, calculate x[–m] or h[–m]. Let us 
assume that we calculate h[–m].
Step 2 Perform sample-by-sample multiplication, that is, h[–m]x[m] for all 
m and accumulate the sum. This operation of sample-by-sample multiplication 
and summation is called multiply and accumulate operation.
Step 3 Shift the inverted sequence towards the right by one sample and again 
calculate the sum.
Step 4 Repeat step 3 until all P + Q – 1 number of samples are calculated.
In this example P = 4, Q = 3, so we need to calculate P + Q – 1 = 6 samples.
The procedure is represented in Table 4.1.

We see from Table 4.1 that for the calculation of y[0], the last sample of h[–m] 
overlaps with the first sample of x[m]; therefore, multiply and accumulate 
operation will result in output = 1. Successive shifting of h[–m] towards the 
right and application of multiply and accumulate operation will generate the 
output as shown in Table 4.1. 
The result is same as obtained on the output-side and input-side algorithms.
Let us solve some examples to illustrate convolution for DT systems.
Example 4.17
LTI system has the impulse response given by h[n] = u[n] – u[n – 8]. If the 
input is x[n] = u[n – 2] – u[n – 5], find the output of the system.
Solution
Let us first plot the two signals. Figure 4.20 shows the plots of h[n], x[n] 
and x[–n]. Let us find the output y[n] sample by sample using conventional 
method by shifting x[–n] towards the right, one sample at a time. Here, h[n] 
has 8 samples, so P = 8. x[n] has 3 samples, i.e., Q = 3. We have to find P + Q 
– 1 = 10 output samples.
We will follow the step by step procedure. 
Step 1 Invert one of the sequences, that is, calculate x[–m] or h[–m]. Let us 
assume that we calculate x[–m].
Step 2 Perform sample-by-sample multiplication, that is, x[–m] h[m] for all 
m and accumulate the sum. This operation of sample-by-sample multiplication 
and summation is called multiply and accumulate operation.
Step 3 Shift the inverted sequence towards the right by one sample and again 
calculate the sum.
Step 4 Repeat step 3 until all P + Q – 1 number of samples are calculated.
In this example P = 8, Q = 3, so we need to calculate P + Q – 1 = 10 samples.

Step 3 Shift the inverted sequence towards the right by one sample and again 
calculate the sum.
Step 4 Repeat step 3 until all P + Q – 1 number of samples are calculated.
In this example P = 3 to infinity, Q = • so we need to calculate P + Q – 1 = 
1 to infinity samples.

We will follow the step-by-step procedure.
Step 1 Invert one of the sequences, that is, calculate x[–m] or h[–m]. Let us 
assume that we calculate x[–m].
Step 2 Perform sample-by-sample multiplication, that is, x[–m] h[m] for all 
m and accumulate the sum. This operation of sample-by-sample multiplication 
and summation is called multiply and accumulate operation.
Step 3 Shift the inverted sequence towards the right by one sample and again 
calculate the sum. Shift the inverted sequence towards the left by one sample 
and again calculate the sum until the output is non-zero. 
Step 4 Repeat step 3 until all P + Q – 1 number of samples are calculated.
In this example P = 3, Q =4, so we need to calculate P + Q – 1 = 6 samples. Note 
that here we have to shift the inverted sequence towards the left as well until 
the generated output is zero. 
The plots of x[m], h[m] and x[–m] are shown below in Fig. 4.26.

We see from Table 4.4 that for the calculation of y[0], 3 samples of x[–m] 
overlap with samples of h[m]; therefore, multiply and accumulate operation 
will result in output = 4. Successive shifting of x[–m] towards the right and 
application of multiply and accumulate operation will generate the output 
y[1] = 5, y[2] = 4, y[3] = 2 etc., as shown in Table 4.4, as less and less samples 
overlap. To find y[–1], we have to shift x[–m] towards the left by one sample 
to get y[–1] = 2. Here, only 2 samples overlap. To find y[–2], shift x[1 – m] 
towards the left again by one sample to get y[–2] = 1, as shown in Table 4.4. 
The output is calculated and listed below.
y[0] = 4,  y[1] = 5, y[2] = 4, y[3] = 2, y[4] = 0, y[5] = 0......

4.5.2 Convolution using MATLAB
We will illustrate the use of MATLAB for solving convolution problems in 
Examples 4.17, 4.18, 4.19 and 4.20.
Let us consider Example 4.17. LTI system has the impulse response given 
by h[n] = u[n] – u[n – 8]. If the input is x[n] = u[n – 2] – u[n – 5], find the 
output of the system. Let us write MATLAB program for the same. MATLAB 
uses ‘conv’ command to execute convolution. The output of the convolution 
is shown in Fig. 4.28. Compare Fig. 4.28 with Fig. 4.21.

Let us consider Example 4.18. LTI system has the impulse response given by 
h[n] = (0.2)n {u[n] – u[n – 3]}. If the input is x[n] = (0.3)n u[n], find the output 
of the system. Let us write MATLAB program for the same. The output of the 
convolution is shown in Fig. 4.29. Compare Fig. 4.29 with Fig. 4.23. Note that 
the index for the output starts at n = 1 rather than zero.

Let us write MATLAB program for the same. The output of the convolution 
is shown in Fig. 4.30. Compare Fig. 4.30 with Fig. 4.25. Here, we have taken 
only 10 samples of h and x sequence. Hence, the output decreases after sample 
number 10. Actually, it extends upto infinity. Hence, the actual output after 
sample number 10 will continuously increase as a function of (n – 2) and will 
tend to infinity.

  4.6 Unit Step Response of CT and DT LTI Systems
We have studied the calculation of impulse response for CT and DT systems 
in the previous sections. We will discuss the step response in this section. To 
find the unit step response of the system, we have to convolve the impulse 
response of the system with the unit step applied as input. The output of the 
system is the desired step response. We will illustrate the concepts with the 
help of simple numerical examples. We will first consider the step response 
for a CT system.

Let us plot both the signals. We will invert one of the signals, for example, 
u[n] and find u[–n]. The reader may recall that this is step 1 in the procedure 
for conventional convolution of DT signals. We will follow the step-by-step 
procedure.
Step 1 Invert one of the sequences, that is, calculate x[–m] or h[–m]. Let us 
assume that we calculate x[–m].
Step 2 Perform sample-by-sample multiplication, that is, x[–m] h[m] for all 
m and accumulate the sum. This operation of sample-by-sample multiplication 
and summation is called multiply and accumulate operation.
Step 3 Shift the inverted sequence towards the right by one sample and again 
calculate the sum. Shift the inverted sequence towards the left by one sample 
and again calculate the sum until the output is non-zero. 
Step 4 Repeat step 3 until all P + Q – 1 number of samples are calculated.
In this example P = infinity, Q = infinity, so we need to calculate P + Q – 1 = 
infinite samples. Note that here we have to shift the inverted sequence towards 
the left as well until the generated output is zero. 
 
The plot is shown in Fig. 4.36.

We see from Table 4.5 that for the calculation of y[0], only one sample of
x[–m] overlaps with the samples of h[m]; therefore, multiply and accumulate 
operation will result in output = 1. Successive shifting of x[–m] towards the 
right and application of multiply and accumulate operation will generate output
y[1] = 1 + 1/2, y[2] = 1 + 1/2 + 1/4, y[3] = 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8, etc., as shown 
in Table 4.5, as more and more samples overlap. The output is calculated and

  4.7 Properties of LTI DT Systems
Let us discuss the properties like memory, causality and stability for CT and 
DT LTI systems. We will study how the properties translate for LTI systems. 
4.7.1 
Memory property of CT and DT LTI systems 
The system is said to have memory or said to be dynamic if its current output 
depends on previous, future input or previous and future output signals. The 
system is said to be memoryless or instantaneous if its current output depends 
only on the current input. Let the system impulse response of the DT system 
be h[n]. Let the input to the system be x[n] and the output be y[n]. The output 
of the system can be written as the convolution sum in case of DT system as

In order that the system is memoryless, y[n] should depend only on x[n] 
i.e., x[n – m] must be zero for all non-zero m. This condition will be true if

4.7.2 Condition of causality for CT and DT LTI systems
Let us now consider an LTI system. An LTI system is causal or realizable if its 
current output depends on past and current inputs and past outputs. To put it 

Signals and Systems

formally, a DT LTI system is causal if its impulse response h[n] is zero for all 
n < 0. If x[n] is the input to a system, then the output y[n] is given by

If, for example, h[–1] exists, then y[n] will depend on x[n + 1], which is the 
next input, and the system will be non-causal.

(4.128)
As the system is an LTI system, the response of the system to input at ‘n – k’ is 
h[n – k] due to property of time invariance. If we put h[n] = 0 for n < 0, then 
h[n –k] = 0 for k > n
Hence, the limits for k will be from –∞ to n. 
We will now consider the causality for CT LTI systems. A CT LTI system 
is causal if its impulse response h(t) is zero for all t < 0. If x(t) is the input to a 
system then the output y(t) is given by

If, for example, h(t) exists for t < 0 i.e., h(–1), then y(t) will depend on x(t + 1), 
which is the input at next time instant, and the system will be non-causal.

To see why the impulse response of the system h(t) or h[n] must be zero for 
all t < 0 or n < 0 for causality, we will consider the following example.

4.7.3 Stability for CT and DT LTI systems
Theorem
CT or DT LTI system is BIBO stable if and only if its impulse response is 
absolutely summable. 
 Let us first prove this theorem for CT LTI systems.
Proof
Let the input to the system x(t) be bounded, then there exists a finite constant 
M such that |x(t)| ≤ M. 
The output y(t) is given by the convolution sum

system is absolutely summable. We have proved the ‘if’ part of the theorem.
Let the sum be represented as S.
It is now required to be shown that if the impulse response is unbounded, 
then there exists some input x(t) for which the output is unbounded.

  4.8 Series and Parallel Interconnection of Systems
We have studied series and parallel interconnection of systems in section 3.5. 
We will go through the calculation of impulse response of the overall system 
in case of series and parallel interconnection of systems as we have studied 
convolution integral and convolution sum for CT and DT systems in this 
chapter. We will illustrate the concepts with the help of simple numerical 
calculations.
Example 4.37
Consider the interconnections of the systems, as shown in Fig. 4.40. Let the 
impulse responses be specified as 
h1(t) = u(t) 
h2(t) = d(t) 
h3(t) = d(t – 1)
Find the response of the overall interconnection.

Summary
We have introduced the concept of solution of the differential equation and 
difference equation.
• 
We have discussed the important properties of CT system equation namely 
the differential equation. We have explained the meaning of characteristic 
equation, which is the denominator polynomial. We write the solution of the 

Signals and Systems
320
characteristic equation as y(t) = ce–lt. The roots of the characteristic equation 
namely e–l1t, e–l2t

are the eigen values or characteristic modes or 
the natural modes of the system. The reason for selecting the exponential 
terms as solution is two-fold. If (Dn + a1Dn–1 + … + an) = 0, this indicates 
that all the n derivatives of the function are zero at all values of time.  The 
nth derivative is (–l)n e–lt, if all n derivatives are to be zero, then this is true 
only for the exponential function. Secondly, in case of the LTI systems, if the 
input is exponential function, the output is also exponential function. No 
other function can have this claim. The exponential solutions called as eigen 
functions. 
• 
We then discussed the concept of zero input response with initial conditions 
specified and showed that the response will contain the characteristic mode 
terms. When external input is zero, the response of the system with initial 
conditions applied is the zero input response. The zero state response was 
described as the response of the system to external input when the initial 
conditions are zero. Several examples are solved to illustrate the concepts. 
The evaluation of impulse response is described and explained with the 
help of a simple example. To find the impulse response, we have to apply 
impulse as an input to the system. Impulse response is also known as filter 
Kernel, convolution Kernel or simply Kernel. Practically, generating the 
impulse function with infinite amplitude and zero width is impossible. Ideal 
impulse function cannot be realised in practical Kernel. The impulse function 
is used as a standard input to the LTI systems for three reasons. Any signal 
can be decomposed into a linear combination of scaled and shifted impulses. 
Secondly, LTI system is completely characterised by its impulse response, and 
the output is obtained by adding the individual output responses. Numbers 
of numerical problems are solved for the calculation of convolution of system 
impulse response with the input signal. To find the zero state response, find 
the impulse response and convolve the input with the impulse response.     
• 
We further concentrated on DT systems. DT systems are described by the 
difference equation. The concepts of zero input response and zero state 
response are explained for DT systems as well. Here, we have to find the 
characteristic mode terms for the difference equation. The roots of the 
characteristic equation are again assumed as exponential functions for the 
same reason. The calculation of zero input response and zero state response 
is explained with simple numerical examples. The procedure for convolution 
sum is explained with three different algorithms namely input-side algorithm, 
output-side algorithm and conventional method. Several examples are solved 
to further illustrate the process of convolution. The problems are also solved 
using MATLAB programs. The convolution outputs can be compared for 
hand calculations and using MATLAB.  
• 
We considered the unit step response as the next section. It is illustrated using 
number of solved problems both for CT and DT systems. The properties of 

Time Domain Response of CT and DT LTI Systems
321
CT and DT LTI systems like memory, causality and stability are explained 
related to the impulse response of the system. The condition for DT system 
to be memoryless is translated in terms of impulse response as h[n] = cd[n] 
for DT systems and h[t] = cd[t] for CT systems. The system is causal if h[n] is 
zero for all n < 0 and in case of CT system, the system is causal if h(t) = 0 for all 
t < 0. The stability condition is named as BIBO stability. DT or CT system 
is said to be stable if the impulse response is absolutely summable. Several 
problems are solved to illustrate the properties of LTI systems. The series 
and parallel interconnection of systems were explained in chapter 3. This 
chapter explains the calculation of effective impulse response if the systems 
are interconnected using series or parallel connection.

Fourier Series Representation 
of Periodic Signals
5
This chapter deals with the Fourier series representation of periodic CT signals. 
Chapter 4 dealt with the representation of signals in terms of impulses where 
the impulse function is treated as a basic unit. Any signal can be represented 
as a linear combination of scaled and shifted impulses. This chapter uses 
the decomposition of a signal in terms of sines and cosines or exponential 
signals and represents the signal as a vector with each coefficient of the vector 
representing the amount of similarity of the signal with the basic functions 
namely sines and cosines or exponential functions. This representation is 
termed as Fourier series representation after the scientist named Fourier 
who claimed that every signal can be represented as a linear combination of 
sinusoidal functions.
Firstly, we will study the representation of signals in terms of vectors, which 
makes it easy to understand the concept of orthogonality. The use of exponential

series representation is elaborated. The trigonometric series representation and 
exponential representations are compared. We will then classify the signals as 
periodic and aperiodic. Periodic signals will be represented in terms of Fourier 
series representation. Aperiodic signals will be represented in terms of Fourier 
transform representation. Fourier series representation will be illustrated for 
CT and DT signals. 
  5.1 Signal Representation in Terms as Sinusoids
We have discussed the decomposition of any CT signal in terms of impulses 
and decomposition of any DT signal in terms of unit impulse function in 
chapter 4. Unit impulse is considered as a basic unit because the LTI systems 
can be characterized by impulse response. We can also decompose any signal 
in terms of sinusoids or in terms of complex exponentials. Here, the sinusoids 
or exponential functions are used as basic units. The decomposition of a 
signal as a linear combination of scaled sinusoids or complex exponentials is 
discussed further. 
Why we select a sinusoid or complex exponentials? 
The reason is when a sinusoid or complex exponential is given as input to any 
LTI system, the output is the same sinusoid or the same complex exponential 
except the change in amplitude and/or the change of phase. No other signal can 
have this claim. We will first prove that the sinusoids of different frequencies 
are orthogonal to each other and complex exponentials of different frequencies 
are also orthogonal to each other. The orthogonal set of functions forms the 
set of basis functions that are then used for unique representation of any CT 
signal.
  5.1.1 Orthogonality property
We will first define orthogonality. The two signals are said to be orthogonal 
over the time interval t = [t, t’] if

Let us first prove that two sinusoidal functions or two cosine functions of 
different frequencies are orthogonal to each other. We will prove this with the 
help of simple numerical examples.

We have proved that the set of sinusoids and complex exponentials form two 
sets of orthogonal functions or what are called as basis functions. Let us try to 
understand the definition of basis functions.
  5.1.2 Basis functions  
Basis functions are orthogonal functions that are used to find the similarity 
of the signal with. When they are combined in a linear manner it will result 
in a signal.  In mathematics, particularly numerical analysis, a basis function 
is an element of the basis for a function space. It can also be defined as a 
set of functions that can be linearly combined to form a more general set 
of functions. We will consider a simple example to illustrate the concept. 
Consider representation of point in a space. We use orthogonal basis as x axis 
and y axis. These orthogonal basis functions can represent any point in a plane 
with unique coordinates x and y. The point P is represented as doublet (x, y) 
where x represents the projection of a vector joining a point to origin and y 
represents the projection of the vector on y axis, as shown in Fig. 5.1. Here, 
we try to represent a point P using two orthogonal basis functions namely x 
and y coordinates as a vector given by
+
_
_
X i Y j. The two axis namely x-axis and 
y-axis are the elements of the basis for a two dimensional space. The point P is 
represented as a linear combination of the basis functions namely unit vector 
along x-axis and unit vector along y-axis. The x-axis and y-axis are orthogonal 
i.e., perpendicular to each other namely their dot product is zero.
There is a great analogy between signals and vectors. We know that we 
can express any vector as a linear combination of two weighted unit vectors 
one in x and other in y direction for a planner representation and as a linear 
combination of three weighted unit vectors in case of a 3-D representation, 
we express any vector in 3-D space as a linear combination of 3 weighted unit

vectors namely the unit vectors in x, y and z directions. Similarly, we can 
express any signal as a linear combination of weighted complex exponential 
functions that form a complete orthogonal set of basis functions. We will 
consider signals as vectors. We will represent any signal as a linear combination 
of these basis functions namely sinusoids and co-sinusoids. The alternative 
representation of the signal is in terms of the complex sinusoids i.e., complex 
exponential functions. Consider any CT signal x(t). We will express the signal 
as a weighted sum of complex exponential functions given by

The expression for y(t) proves that LTI system only changes the amplitude and 
phase of the exponential  function. Similarly, it can be easily proved that when 
a sinusoid is given as input to the LTI system, the output is again the same 
sinusoid with change of magnitude and phase. Let us consider one numerical 
example to illustrate the concepts.

Let the input to the system be x(t) = sin(2t). Find the output of the system.

FS Representation of Periodic CT Signals
Any periodic signal can be represented in frequency domain as a Fourier series. 
Let us first understand why Fourier series? Fourier series representation 

Signals and Systems
340
is a representation of a signal as a sum of scaled fundamental and its scaled 
harmonics. When we say that a signal is periodic with a period of T or a 
fundamental frequency of ‘f = 1/T’, the signal contains fundamental frequency 
component ‘f’ and its harmonics like ‘2f ’, ‘3f ’, etc. or it may contain only the 
harmonics of some fundamental frequency with fundamental frequency being 
absent. We have to find out the amplitude of the fundamental and amplitudes 
of the harmonic frequencies present in the signal for writing a Fourier series for 
a signal. These amplitudes will then be called as the Fourier series coefficients. 
The Fourier series coefficients will represent the degree of matching of the 
signal with the corresponding harmonic component. In short, Fourier series 
expansion of a signal xP(t) is equivalent to resolving a signal into sum of sine 
and cosine terms. This expansion can be written as

 are called as basis functions and as we 
have understood, they are orthogonal. We have proved in section 5.1.1 that 
each of the cosine and sine term for all harmonics is orthogonal to every other 
term i.e., their dot product is zero. The periodic signals usually encountered in 
practice are found to satisfy Dirichlet’s conditions necessary for Fourier series 
representation to hold good. Dirichlet’s conditions can be stated as follows:
1. The function xp(t) is single valued within the period.
2. It has at the most finite number of discontinuities. 
3. It has finite number of maxima and minima.
4. The function is absolutely integrable.
Fourier series representation is used for periodic signals due to following 
reasons:
1.  Fourier series decomposes the signal into linear combination of scaled 
sines and cosines.
2. Sines and cosines are orthogonal functions and hence the decomposition 
is unique.
3. The periodic functions encountered in practice satisfy the Dirichlet’s 
conditions.

The coefficients in Eq. (5.21) namely a0, an, bn are termed as Fourier coefficients 
of the trigonometric Fourier Series representation. Let us see how to evaluate

The exponential representation is easy to handle. It also simplifies the 
mathematical calculations. The presence of negative frequencies appearing in 
exponential series representation is a by-product. It has no physical significance. 
Conventionally we write Fourier series using exponential terms with positive 
as well as negative frequencies and the graph representing frequency domain 
representation, which is a graph of amplitude or magnitude with respect 
to frequency, has both positive and negative frequencies represented. The 
representation of negative frequency side is just the replica or mirror image of 
the representation of positive frequency side. 
Thus the frequency domain representation of a periodic analog signal 
in terms of exponential Fourier series is a spectrum consisting of discrete 
components corresponding to fundamental and harmonic terms. It is a 
discrete spectrum. 
Fourier for the first time presented a paper on the decomposition of any 
signal using complex exponentials. Any periodic signal can be decomposed 
as a linear combination of weighted exponentials or weighted sine and cosine 
functions. Consider any periodic signal x(t). We can write the FS representation 
as

  5.3 Application of Fourier Series Representation 
Communication systems use a technique called as pulse modulation. In this 
case the carrier is a pulse train. Let us study the representation of a periodic 
pulse train using exponential Fourier series as a discrete spectrum. This 
enables us to draw the spectrum of the modulated signal.

Example 5.13
Consider a pulse train of rectangular pulses of duration T and period T0, as 
shown in Fig. 5.5. Find FS representation.

Fig. 5.5 Periodic train of rectangular pulses
The signal is an even signal. It is said to have even symmetry if x(t) = x(–t). If 
we fold the signal with respect to the vertical axis, the signal on left of vertical 
axis exactly falls on to the signal on right of the vertical axis. 
We will use the formula specified in Eq. (5.36) to find the Fourier series 
coefficients. The plot of cn coefficients is a sync function. The sync function 
magnitude plot for T/T0 equal to 0.1 is plotted in Fig. 5.6, which indicates 
that the sync function will have first zero crossing for n = 10. Referring to 
Eq. (5.48), we can verify that if T/T0 is 0.1, the sync function will have first zero 
crossing for n = 10, as shown in Fig. 5.6 i.e., when the angle is equal to π and 
when T/T0 is 0.05, the sync function will have first zero crossing for n = 20, as 
shown in Fig. 5.7.

Fourier Series Representation of Periodic Signals

A MATLAB program to plot the Fourier series coefficients using Eq. (5.48) 
is given below. The number of coefficients plotted is 81. Actually the sync 
function extends from minus infinity to plus infinity. The centre coefficient 
with index 41 is actually the coefficient at n = 0. The coefficients plotted 
for n = 1 to 40 are with negative index. The index of the coefficients is to be 
understood as n = –40 to 40. The reader can easily verify that the second zero 
crossing occurs for T/T0 equal to 0.05 is at n = 60, which is actually for n = 20, 
and the first zero crossing occurs for T/T0 equal to 0.1 is at n = 50, which is 
actually for n = 10 in Fig. 5.7. The phase plot is shown in Fig. 5.8. 
The zero crossings will occur when the angle is multiples of π. The spacing 
between the lines for T/T0 equal to 0.1 is at π/10 and for T/T0 equal to 0.2 is at 
π/5. We can conclude that
1. If we assume that T is kept constant, when T/T0 is reduced, actually T0 
increases and the spacing between the lines is reduced. 
2. If we assume that T0 is kept constant, when T/T0 is reduced, actually T 
reduces and the first zero crossing occurs farther away i.e., at n = 10.

We can note the following points from the above exercise.
1. The line spacing in the spectrum is decided by the period T0.  
2. The envelope of the amplitude spectrum is determined by the ratio T/T0.
3. The zero crossings occur at frequencies that are multiple of 1/T.
4. The phase spectrum has values between 0° and ± 180°.

terms. 
Let us consider the signal with odd symmetry. We will show that it will have 
only odd terms i.e., sine terms. The following signal satisfies the condition 
x(–t) = –x(t) for signal between –1 to 1.

Find the trigonometric FS and exponential FS for the periodic signal shown 
in Fig. 5.16.

Hence, it will have only sine terms. If we remove the DC term and observe the 
signal between 0 to 2, we will confirm odd symmetry.
Step 2 Find equations of the straight line from 0 to 2. The straight line from 
0 to 2 can be written as t. For x(t) we will put the equation of the straight line 
for that corresponding interval.

Note that when the function has odd symmetry, the FS contains only the sine 
terms.
Let us consider a signal with half wave symmetry given by x(t) = – x(t ± T/2).  
Consider a function shown in Fig. 5.18. It is neither purely even nor purely 
odd. It has half wave symmetry. Such functions contain only odd harmonics 
in FS. As can be seen the function has DC term equal to zero.
Example 5.20
Determine the FS representation for the signal with periodic wave, as shown 
in Fig. 5.18.

Note that for all examples solved above, even though the signal is periodic 
in time domain its Fourier series representation is aperiodic. We will consider 
a periodic train of impulses, which is again a periodic signal, and find its FS 
representation.

Note that for the above examples, the signal is periodic but is discrete in time 
domain. The FS representation is periodic in this case. We will study FS for 
DT signals in section 5.6.

Physical significance of property of linearity If  the signal can be decomposed 
into linear combination of component signals. The FS representation can be 
found for each signal and the FS can be added to get the FS for the linear 
combination. This simplifies the mathematical computations.

Physical significance of property of Time shifting Consider two vectors 
with one time-shifted with respect to the other. If FS is evaluated for both, the 
FS will be identical in magnitude. The time-shifted signal will have a FS with 
phase shift of 
ϑ

This fact can be used for template matching when two templates are same but 
just shifted in time.

complex conjugate of the FS coefficient of the original signal.

Physical significance of convolution property When the two signals are 
convolved in time domain, the FS coefficients get multiplied. Convolution 
is computationally costly. When the signal passes via the LTI system, the 
signal gets convolved with the impulse response of the system. To find the FS 
representation for the convolved output, one may find FS for the input signal 
and the impulse response and multiply the two FS.

Physical significance of Parseval’s identity Parseval’s identity states that 
the energy of the signal in time domain is the same as the energy of the FS 
coefficients. This simply means, when the signal is transformed in frequency 
domain, its energy is preserved.  
To illustrate the significance of the above properties, we will consider 
numerical examples to illustrate the use of different properties.

  5.5.1 Gibbs phenomenon
In the above two examples, the FS coefficients are finite in number. Hence, 
we can recover the analog signal very easily. This will not be the case if the 
FS coefficients are infinite in number. We cannot process infinite number 
of coefficients due to finite processing power of our computer. Gibbs 
phenomenon cannot be eliminated as we can never use infinite coefficients in 
the recovery process. The recovered signal using finite number of coefficients 
will not be the exact square wave signal we started with but the recovered signal 
will show oscillations near the edge of the square wave. These oscillations near 
the edge are called as Gibbs phenomenon. When we use finite number of FS 
coefficients, we can say that we are truncating the infinite FS. This truncation 
leads to Gibbs phenomenon. Let us consider one example to illustrate the 
concepts.

We will write a MATLAB program to recover the signal. We have used 
number of coefficients equal to 50 in the program below. The reader is required 
to change value of N to 100 and 200 and see its effect on the recovered signal. 
The plot of FS coefficients for N = 50 is shown in Fig. 5.31 and the recovered

We can see from Figs 5.32 and 5.33 that as we use more number of FS coefficients 
in the recovery process the recovered signal matches more closely towards the 
original square wave. It can be observed that the amount of overshoot remains 
the same even after increasing the value of N. The peak overshoot is seen to 
shift towards the point of discontinuity.

Note from the examples solved above for DT periodic signals that FS for DT 
periodic signals is also periodic. DTFS has the same period as that of DT signal 
in terms of number of samples. We can summarize this fact in Table 5.1.

Summary
We have introduced the concept of representation of signals in terms of linear 
combination of sinusoids and discussed Fourier series representation for CT 
periodic signals in detail.
• We started with the introduction of decomposition of the signal in terms of 
sinusoids or exponential functions. The reason for selection of these functions 
as basic functions is explained. The concept of orthogonality of basic functions 
is emphasized for unique representation of signals. The basic functions selected 
are called as basis functions. Examples are solved to show the orthogonal 
condition for sinusoids and co-sinusoids of different frequencies. The example 
of x-axis and y-axis for the representation of point in a plane is illustrated. It 
is shown that the sinusoids and exponential functions when given as input to 
LTI system result in the output of the same frequency except for the change in 
amplitude and phase. 
• The formula for computation of Fourier series representation is given and 
the concept is illustrated with numerical problems. It is shown that when 
sinusoidal signal or exponential signal is given as input to the LTI system, the 
output is again a sinusoidal signal or exponential signal of same frequency with 
a change in amplitude and phase. 

Fourier Series Representation of Periodic Signals
399
• Fourier series representation is a representation of a signal as a sum of scaled 
fundamental and its scaled harmonics. The amplitude of the fundamental 
and amplitudes of the harmonic frequencies must be found for writing a 
Fourier series for a signal. These amplitudes are called as the Fourier series 
coefficients. The Fourier series coefficient for a particular harmonic represents 
the degree of matching of the signal with the corresponding harmonic 
component. Fourier series expansion of a periodic signal is equivalent to 
resolving a signal into sum of scaled sine and cosine terms of the harmonics. 
FS representation requires that the signals satisfy the Dirichlet’s conditions 
namely the signal must be single-valued with finite discontinuities or with 
finite minima and maxima. The signal must also be absolutely integrable. The 
exponential representation is preferred as it is easy to handle. It also simplifies 
the mathematical calculations. The presence of negative frequencies appearing 
in exponential series representation is a by-product. The negative frequencies 
have no physical significance. FS representation gives a discrete spectrum.
• Numerical examples are solved to illustrate the evaluation of FS coefficients. 
The magnitude and phase spectrum is drawn. Applications of FS are in the 
area of communication where the signal is modulated using a pulse train. The 
representation of a periodic pulse train using exponential Fourier series is 
illustrated as a discrete spectrum. This can be used to find the spectrum of the 
modulated signal. The line spectrum for a square wave pulse indicates that the 
zero crossings will occur at multiple of 1/pulse width. The spacing between the 
lines will increase when the period of the square wave reduces. The first zero 
crossing occurs farther away when the width of the pulse reduces. Numerical 
examples are solved to illustrate the evaluation of FS using trigonometric and 
exponential signals for periodic signals of different types namely with even 
symmetry, with odd symmetry and with half wave symmetry. Signals with even 
symmetry will have no sine terms. Signals with odd symmetry will have no 
cosine terms. Signals with half wave symmetry will have only odd harmonics. 
• The properties of FS namely linearity, time shifting, scaling, reversal are 
explained with their physical significance. Properties like time differentiation, 
time integration, modulation and convolution with Parseval’s identity are also 
explained with physical significance for each. Numerical examples illustrating 
the property of time shifting, scaling and differentiation are solved. Recovery 
of the signal from FS is explained with examples. When the FS contains infinite 
coefficients, the practical recovery process does not use infinite coefficients, 
but uses only finite terms. The effect of using only finite terms in the recovery 
gives rise to Gibbs phenomenon. The example of recovery of square wave is 
explained using finite terms. It is shown that there are oscillations and the 
overshoot is independent of the number of terms used. As the number of 
terms increases, the overshoot shifts towards the edges. The oscillations near 
the edges are called as Gibbs phenomenon.  
• FS representation of the DT periodic signal is also discussed. Two DT periodic 
signals are said to be orthogonal if their inner product defined as the sum 

Signals and Systems
400
of values in their product is zero.  The complex sinusoids with frequencies 
separated by integer multiple of fundamental frequency are orthogonal to each 
other.  These sinusoids are used as the basis function for FS representation. 
The FS representation of periodic DT signals is illustrated with numerical 
examples. FS for CT periodic signals is aperiodic, whereas FS for DT periodic 
signals is periodic with same period as that of DT signal.

The chapter deals with Fourier transform (FT) representation for continuous 
time and discrete time aperiodic signals. The FT of CT signals is called as CTFT 
and that for DT signals is called as DTFT. The Fourier transform is defined 
and is evaluated for all standard aperiodic signals such as exponential signal, 
rectangular pulse, triangular pulse, etc. The IFT of some standard signals such 
as sinc function is also discussed. The use of Dirac Delta function is explained 
for evaluation of FT for periodic signals. FT of DT signals are illustrated with 
some numerical examples. Properties of FT and DTFT are emphasized with 
their physical significance. The numerical examples for the calculation of FT 
using FT properties are illustrated. The calculation of response of LTI system 
to the input signal is simplified using FT.

Signals
If the signal x(t) is aperiodic, a similar representation for a signal in frequency 
domain can be developed in terms of Fourier Transform using exponential 
signals as basis function. The signal xP(t) a periodic signal can be generated by 
repeating x(t) after a period of T0. We can now define x(t) as

As the period tends to infinity, the spacing between the spectral lines, which is 
equal to 1/T0, will tend to zero and the spectrum will be a continuous spectrum. 
Now, the summation will turn into the integral. The coefficients will represent 
a frequency point on the frequency axis represented by X(f). The Eqs (6.2) and

The Eqs (6.4) and (6.5) represent the inverse Fourier Transform and 
Fourier Transform of the signal. FT of continuous time aperiodic signal can 
be denoted as Continuous Time Fourier Transform (CTFT) i.e., Fourier 
Transform representation of a continuous time signal namely the analog 
signal that is aperiodic. CT aperiodic signal is represented as a superposition

. The integrals in Eqs (6.4) and (6.5) may not always converge for 
all x(t) and X(jω). Without going into the details of analysis of convergence,

This simply means the difference has zero energy and it does not guarantee 
the convergence at all points in time. The point-wise convergence can be 
confirmed if the signal satisfies the Dirichlet conditions stated below.
1. The signal is absolutely integrable. i.e., the Eq. (6.8) holds good.
2. The signal x(t) has finite number of maxima, minima and discontinuities 
in the finite range for which the signal exists or is defined. The signal shown 
in Fig. 6.1 has finite number of maxima, minima and discontinuities.
Fig. 6.1 Signal with finite number of maxima, minima and discontinuities
3. The size of the discontinuities is finite i.e., the signal must not tend to 
infinity at the point of discontinuity. We can observe that the signal x(t) in 
Fig. 6.1 is not tending to infinity at the point of discontinuity. 

Signals and Systems

FT of CT aperiodic signal is a continuous function of frequency and is also 
aperiodic. If we consider the signals encountered in practice, the conditions 
2 and 3 are satisfied. However, sometimes the signal may not be square 
or absolutely integrable, for example, the unit step signal. It is possible 
to define FT for some of such cases using impulses as will be explained in
section 6.2.1.  Here, FT does not converge. However, we can still make use of 
FT for simplifying the mathematical calculations.         
The reader is advised to closely observe Eqs (6.5) for FT and (6.6) for IFT. 
It can be observed that there is an additional factor of 1/2π in IFT and the 
sign of exponential function is reversed in IFT as compared to FT. Otherwise, 
the equations have a similarity. We will discuss it further in the property of 
duality. We will solve some numerical problems to illustrate the calculation 
of FT. 
Example 6.1
Determine the FT representation for the signal given as x(t) = e–3tu(t).
Solution
The exponential signal x(t) exists between zero to infinity and is termed as a 
right-handed signal. We can use Eq. (6.5) to find the FT.

  6.1.1 Evaluation of magnitude and phase response using hand  
 
 
 
calculations
We define the magnitude response of signal characterized by its FT. FT 
expression is a complex function. Magnitude response defines the magnitude 
of FT (a complex number) at different values of angular frequency ω. Phase 
response defines the phase angle of FT (a complex number) at different values 
of angular frequency ω. Let us first understand the physical significance of the 
Magnitude and Phase response plots. Magnitude response plot signifies the 
magnitudes of different angular frequencies in a signal. Phase response plot 
signifies the phase angle of different angular frequencies in a signal. 
We can write the magnitude and phase spectrum as

To evaluate magnitude response, we have to put different values of ω in  
Eq. (6.10). We have to find the magnitude of FT by finding a square root of 
sum of real part square and imaginary part square, as the equation for FT is a 
complex quantity.  Let us put values of ω as 1, 2, etc. in the Eq. (6.10).

Note We can see that the magnitude of FT decreases as the angular frequency 
increases. 
Owing to symmetry property, the magnitude response on negative ω axis 
is symmetric with respect to the magnitude response on positive ω axis. FT

Let us understand the physical significance of this symmetry, if any.

The representation uses the range of both positive as well as negative angular 
frequencies. The frequency as determined by number of oscillations per second 
is definitely a positive quantity. We have introduced negative frequencies for 
mathematical convenience. The exponential terms simplify the mathematical 
calculations. This negative frequency information is just a replication of the 
positive frequency information. It carries no additional meaning. It has no 
physical significance. It is just appearing as a by-product because we use 
exponential signal representation.

To evaluate phase response, we have to put different values of ω in Eq. (6.13).  
Let us put values of ω as 1, 2, etc. in the equation. The Eq. (6.13) indicates that 
the phase response for negative frequencies is anti-symmetric with respect to 
the response for positive frequencies.
if ω =   0, arg(X(jω)) = –arctan(0)    =   0.00
if ω =   1, arg(X(jω)) = –arctan(1/3) = –0.3218
if ω =   2, arg(X(jω)) = –arctan(2/3) = –0.5880
if ω =   3, arg(X(jω)) = –arctan(3/3) = –0.7854
if ω =   4, arg(X(jω)) = –arctan(4/3) = –0.9273
if ω =   5, arg(X(jω)) = –arctan(5/3) = –1.0304  
(6.14)
if ω = –1, arg(X(jω)) = –arctan(1/3) =   0.3218
if ω = –2, arg(X(jω)) = –arctan(2/3) =   0.5880
if ω = –3, arg(X(jω)) = –arctan(3/3) =   0.7854
if ω = –4, arg(X(jω)) = –arctan(4/3) =   0.9273
if ω = –5, arg(X(jω)) = –arctan(5/3) =   1.0304, etc.

We see that as the value of ω increases, the angle value decreases. The angle 
value is negative for positive values of ω. The phase (angle) value is positive 
for negative values of ω and it increases as the negative value of ω increases. 
Let us now write a MATLAB program to plot the magnitude and phase 
response and verify the result of hand calculations. Fig. 6.2 shows the plot 
of the signal and Fig. 6.3 shows magnitude and phase plot of the signal. The 
result of magnitude value and phase value may be verified by the reader using 
the following MATLAB program and display the result of z and z1 in the

Note We can see that the magnitude of FT decreases as the angular frequency 
increases. Owing to symmetry property, the magnitude response on negative 
ω axis is symmetric with the magnitude response on positive ω axis. The 
magnitude response for Example 6.2 is the same as that for Example 6.1. Note 
that the signal in Example 6.2 is the time-reversed signal of Example 6.1. The 
reader is requested to refer to the time reversal property of FT in section 6.5.  
To evaluate phase response, we have to put different values of ω in  
Eq. (6.17). Let us put values of ω as 1, 2, etc. in the equation. 
The phase response of FT distinguishes the two signals. Phase response for 
Example 6.1 is negative of the phase response for Example 6.2. Phase response 
is responsible for distinguishing the causal and anti-causal signal.

  6.2 Fourier Transform of Some Standard CT Signals
Communication systems use a technique called as pulse code modulation 
(PCM) and then binary phase shift keying. We are required to find the 
spectrum of the rectangular pulse in PCM signal and the spectrum of BPSK 
signal. After reading this section the reader will understand the nature of FT 
of the carrier, the nature of FT of the rectangular pulse and its variation with 
the width of the pulse. This will give the reader the insight of finding FT of the 
BPSK signal, which is a multiplication of rectangular pulse with the carrier. 
The modulation property of FT tells us that multiplication of two signals in the 
time domain results in the convolution of the transforms of the two signals. 
Let us study the representation of aperiodic pulse using Fourier Transform.
Example 6.4
Consider a rectangular pulse of duration T and amplitude A, as shown in  
Fig. 6.8. Find its FT.

The zero crossings occur in the spectrum at multiples of 1/T. As the pulse 
duration decreases, the zero crossings are separated and the spectrum spreads 
with the decrease in the peak amplitude. This fact is used in the spread 
spectrum technique to spread the spectrum of the BPSK signal for application 
in communication engineering. 
Let us write a MATLAB program to plot the continuous spectrum. We 
have used a value of T = 0.1 and T = 0.2. The value of A is kept constant, 
equal to 1. The index ‘n’ represents the frequency. The plots for T = 0.2 and 
T = 0.1 are shown in Figs 6.10 and 6.11. We can observe that as T decreases 
from 0.2 to 0.1, the spacing between the zero crossings increases and the peak 
amplitude decreases. This is the important finding. The zero crossing for 
T = 0.2 occurs after an interval of 1/T i.e., 5 and for T = 0.1, zero crossing 
occurs after an interval of 1/T i.e., 10 samples. The frequency domain picture 
shows a main peak at the centre with certain width, which is called as the main 
lobe, and the other similar lobes on either side of are called as side lobes. We 
can say that as the width of the rectangular pulse in time domain increases, 
the width of the main lobe in frequency domain decreases and vice versa. This 
indicates that if the signal gets concentrated in the time domain, it is more 
spread out in the frequency domain and vice versa. In other words, we say 
that the time bandwidth product remains constant and has a lower bound. 
This fact is summarized as a principle called Heisenberg uncertainty principle 
written as

.  This equation also indicates that if we want to get good 
resolution in time domain, we will have to sacrifice for resolution in frequency 
domain.

This is a sinc function. Let us write a MATLAB program for this example. 
Figure 6.13 shows the magnitude response plot of time domain response 
for the width of the rectangular pulse in frequency domain equal to 0.2 and 
the magnitude plot for time domain is shown in Fig. 6.14 for the frequency 
domain width of 0.1 seconds. We can see that the width of the main lobe of 
the time domain response decreases as the width of the rectangular pulse in 
frequency domain increases.

(time domain main lobe has width = 112–80 = 32 time units)
Note that a time domain rectangular pulse has a FT as a sinc function and a 
frequency domain rectangular pulse also has IFT as a sinc function. Hence, if 
the function is a rectangular function in one domain, it is a sinc function in 
the other domain. If the function is localized in one domain, it is well spread 
out in the other domain. When the width of the rectangular pulse increases in 
one domain time/frequency, then the width of main lobe in the other domain 
frequency/time decreases and vice versa. This is exactly stated in Heisenberg’s 
uncertainty principle. If we interchange the word time with frequency we get 
the other property. This phenomenon is called as duality property.

  6.2.1 Use of dirac delta function
The theory of Fourier Transform is applicable to signals that satisfy Dirichlet’s 
conditions. This means the function must be integrable and these conditions 
include all energy signals. It is required to extend the theory of Fourier 
Transform to all power signals as well. It is also desirable to combine Fourier 
series and Fourier Transform and treat Fourier series as a special case of 
Fourier Transform.  Both these requirements can be fulfilled if we can make a 
proper use of Dirac delta function or unit impulse function.

The above examples indicate that if the function is spread out in time domain, 
it is concentrated in the other domain and vice versa. This result is useful for 
finding the spectrum of the carrier wave used in communication systems.

amplitude modulation to study the spectrum of amplitude modulated wave, 
spectrum of double side band suppressed carrier wave, single side band wave, etc.

  6.3 Fourier Transforms of Periodic CT Signals
We have seen in section 3.3 that periodic signals can be represented in terms 
of Fourier series in frequency domain. Fourier Transform representation is 
used for aperiodic signals. We will now see how to write Fourier Transform 
representation of periodic signals. We will make use of delta functions to 
represent the transform.
Example 6.19
Consider a periodic signal xp(t) of period T0. Find the FT of the periodic signal.
Solution
We know that we can represent the periodic signal using exponential Fourier 
series given by Eq. (5.21) and the coefficients of the series can be calculated 
using Eq. (5.22).  The equations are reproduced here for easy reference.

Fourier Transform Representation of Aperiodic Signals
443
This relation means that FT of a periodic signal is a set of delta functions 
occurring at integer multiples of the fundamental frequency 1/T0, including 
the origin, and each delta function is weighted by a factor equal to the value of 
FT coefficient at n/T0.
Example 6.20
Use the above result to find FT of an ideal sampling function shown in Fig.  6.20.

An ideal sampling function is an infinite sequence of uniformly spaced delta 
functions. The ideal sampling function can be written as

Equation (6.53) states that the FT of a periodic train of delta functions spaced 
T0 apart, consists of another set of delta functions weighted by a factor of 1/T0 
and spaced by frequency equal to 1/T0 apart. The ideal sampling function and 
its FT is depicted in Fig. 6.24.

If the FT equation is in the form of a polynomial in jω in numerator and 
a polynomial in jω in the denominator, then a normally partial fraction 
expansion is required to be used for decomposing the polynomial of higher

degree in component factors. The process of decomposing the equation of 
higher degree into addition of component factors is called as partial fraction 
expansion (PFE). The FT equation is called as the transfer function of the 
system. Each factor of the transfer function is then inverse Fourier transformed 
by inspection. To find IFT by inspection, we make use of the result of some 
standard FT pairs. The property of linearity of FT is made use of in this case. 
To illustrate the concept of partial fraction expansion, we will consider some 
numerical examples.

  6.5 FT of Aperiodic DT Signals (DTFT)
Consider a band-limited aperiodic analog signal (energy signal) x(t). Let it be 
suitably sampled as per the sampling theorem to generate a DT signal x(n). In 
the process of sampling, the signal x(t) is multiplied by an impulse train with 
spacing between the impulses as T = 1/Fs where Fs stands for the sampling 
frequency, as shown in Fig. 6.25 (refer to Fig. 1.3 in chapter 1 on sampling).
When we look at the Fourier domain picture of the x(n), we see that it is 
periodic in the spectral domain, as shown in Fig. 6.26. (Refer to Fig. 1.4 in chapter 
1 on sampling). The resulting spectrum of x(n) i.e., DTFT is a convolution of 
the spectrum of x(t) and the spectrum of the train of impulse. The reader is 
encouraged to refer to the modulation property of FT in section 6.6, which 
states that the multiplication of two signals in time domain is a convolution of 
the FTs of the two signals. Note that it is customary to show the spectrum of the 
signal with a bandwidth of W as a triangular representation. It does not mean 
that that the respective frequencies have decreasing amplitude. The x axis is 
either the frequency or the normalized angular frequency given by
2
,
s
F
F
ω
π
=
when F = Fs, the normalized angular frequency is equal to 2p, as shown in  
Fig. 6.26. We see that the continuous spectrum is periodic with a period equal 
to 2p. It is given by Eq. (6.72).

To find the magnitude response using hand calculations, we have to put 
different values of ω in the equation and find real and imaginary parts. 
Magnitude and phase can be calculated using rectangular to polar conversion. 
Let us write a MATLAB program to plot magnitude and phase response. We 
will use abs command and angle command to find magnitude and phase. 
Figures 6.27 and 6.28 show the magnitude and phase response. We can note 
that the magnitude response and phase response, both are periodic with a 
period equal to 2pi. The magnitude response is a periodic sinc function.

Figure 6.31 shows the plot of the signal and the DTFT of the signal. A 
MATLAB program to plot the inverse DTFT of the periodic rectangular pulse 
in frequency domain is given below. Inverse DTFT is a DT signal that is a sinc 
function (aperiodic signal).

Fig. 6.31 Inverse DTFT of a periodic rectangular pulse 
Note When the DT signal is aperiodic, the DTFT is continuous and periodic 
in frequency domain with a period of pi and when a signal is continuous and 
periodic in frequency domain, its inverse DTFT is aperiodic and discrete. 
  6.5.1 FT of standard aperiodic DT signals 
We will evaluate the DTFT of some standard DT signals such as unit impulse, 
exponential sequence. We will also find the inverse DTFT of train of impulse 
in the frequency domain.
Example 6.29
Find DTFT of the unit impulse in time domain. 
Solution
We know that the unit impulse is an aperiodic DT signal. Let us find DTFT 
using the formula in Eq. (6.73).

  6.6 Properties of FT and DTFT 
We will study the properties of FT and DTFT. We will state and prove the 
following properties linearity, time shifting, time reversal, time scaling, time 
differentiation, time integration, Frequency shifting, frequency differentiation, 
convolution, frequency convolution, modulation, conjugation property, 
duality and Parseval’s relation. 
1. Property of Linearity
 
If
x1(t) ´ X1(jw) and  x2(t) ´ X2(jw),
then  ax1(t) + bx2(t) aX1(jw) + bX2(jw)

Similarly, linearity also holds for the FT of DT signals. 
If 
x1[n] ´ X1(ejW)  and  x2[n] ´ X2(ejW),
then  ax1[n] + bx2[n] aX1(ejW) + bX2(ejW) 
(6.98)
Physical significance of property of linearity    If  the signal can be decomposed 
into linear combination of two or more component signals, then the FT of the 
signal is the linear combination of the component signals. This simplifies the 
mathematical computations. Similarly, if the signal can be decomposed into 
linear combination of two or more component signals in FT domain, then 
IFT of the signal is the linear combination of the component IFT signals. This 
property is used in the calculation of IFT using partial fraction expansion.
2. Time Shifting Property
The time shifting property states that if
x1(t) ´ X(jw),
then  x(t – t0) ´ e–jwt0 X(jw)

Similarly, for DTFT the property can be translated as
 
If 
x[n] ´ X (ejW),
then  x[n – n0] ´ e–jWn0 X(ejW) 
(6.101)
Physical significance of property of time shifting Consider two signals 
with one time shifted with respect to the other. If FT is evaluated for both, the 
FT will be identical in magnitude. The time-shifted signal will have a FT with a 
phase shift of 
0
where
j
e
t
ϑ
ϑ
ω
−
=
. The magnitude of 
j
e
ϑ
−
 is one and hence, the 
magnitude response for a signal and its shifted version will be identical. This 
fact can be used for template matching when two templates are same, but are 
just shifted in time.

Physical significance of property of Time reversal The FT coefficients 
for a time-reversed signal are
(
)
X
jω
−
. This means the FT coefficients will 
have same magnitude, but the phase angle is negative of the phase angle 
for FT coefficients of the original signal.  The FT coefficients of the time-
reversed signal will be a complex conjugate of the FT coefficient of the 
original signal.

Physical significance of property of Time scaling FT of the time-scaled 
signal with scaling factor a will have both magnitude and phase inverse 
scaled by the factor a. Consider the example of perceiving higher pitch of 
recorded sound when played at a higher speed. When the recorded sound 
is played again with higher speed, the time domain signal is compressed. 
This expands the frequency domain signal, which is perceived as a higher 
pitch.

The properties of differentiation and integration apply only for continuous 
function and hence, are discussed for CT signals.
Physical significance of property of Time differentiation When the 
signal is differentiated in time domain, its FT is multiplied by jω. For higher 
frequencies, the multiplying factor will also be high. Hence, after time 
differentiation, the higher frequencies are enhanced in frequency domain. 
Low frequencies will be reduced. The DC component will be destroyed when 
the signal is differentiated. The average value of the signal is reduced to zero 
when the signal is differentiated in time domain. FT of the differentiated signal 
will be zero at ω equal to zero.

Physical significance of property of time integration When the signal is 
integrated in time domain, its FT gets multiplied in time by –1/jω. This factor 
is indeterminate at ω = 0. If the signal has a zero DC component, then X(j0) = 
0, and the integration equation exists and applies only to signals with zero DC 
value. Integration is basically a smoothing operation and hence, it smoothes 
the signal. The smoothing in time deemphasizes the high frequencies as is 
indicated by a factor of ω in denominator.

Physical significance of conjugation property FT of the conjugate of the 
signal appears on negative frequency axis and is a conjugate of FT of the 
original signal. If the signal is real, FT coefficients for the signal show the 
conjugate symmetry. The positive coefficients are complex conjugates of the 
negative coefficients.

Physical significance of frequency shifting property When the FT of the 
signal is shifted in frequency domain by ω0, the inverse transformation leads to 
a phase shifting of the signal by the same angular frequency ω0. The resulting 
time domain signal is complex and its FT does not exhibit the symmetry 
property. Frequency shifting property is a dual of time shifting property. A 
shift in one domain leads to multiplication by a complex sinusoid in the other 
domain.

Physical significance of convolution property When the two signals 
are convolved in time domain, their FTs get multiplied. Convolution is 
computationally costly. The convolution can be performed in transform 
domain using a multiplication operation that is less costly. Another important 
use of FT is to find the response of the system to a given input. When the signal 
passes via the LTI system, the signal gets convolved with the impulse response 
of the system. To find the FT representation for the convolved output, one 
may find FT for the input signal and FT of the impulse response and multiply 
the two FTs. The convolution in one domain transforms to modulation in the 
other domain. (Modulation refers to the multiplication of the two signals.)  
Both convolution and modulation properties are due to the fact that complex 
sinusoids are eigen functions of LTI system.   
11. Frequency Convolution or Modulation Property
 
Frequency convolution property is also called as the modulation property.

, we get 
double side band suppressed carrier modulated signal. This property states 
the property of FT for the multiplied signal (multiplication of two sinusoids 
results in modulation); hence, it is called modulation property. The FT for the 

Signals and Systems

modulated signal is the convolution of the FTs of the component signals. We 
can understand the effect of signal truncation using the modulation property. 
When the signal is truncated, it is multiplied by a rectangular window in 
time domain. The result of multiplication of two signals in time domain is a 
convolution in the frequency domain. Hence, truncation of the signal in time 
domain results in convolution of signal spectrum and a sinc function (FT of 
a rectangular window). The convolution in frequency domain gives rise to 
a ripple near the band edge of the signal spectrum. This is termed as Gibbs 
phenomenon.  
12. Duality Property
Throughout this chapter, we have observed symmetry between frequency 
domain and time domain representations of the signals. The reader may refer 
to the following examples. 
1. A rectangular pulse in time/frequency domain results in a sinc function in 
frequency/time domain. 
2. An impulse in time/frequency domain corresponds to a constant in 
frequency/time domain.
3. Convolution in time/frequency domain corresponds to multiplication in 
frequency/time domain.
The above examples indicate that we may interchange the words time and 
frequency. This interchangeability property is called as duality.   
Consider the definitions of FT and IFT.

as indicated in Fig. 6.40. 
The duality of rectangular pulses and sinc function is clear from Examples 6.4 
and 6.5. 
13. Time Bandwidth Product
 
Consider the example of a rectangular wave pulse. It was observed that 
the FT of a square wave pulse is a sinc function. Referring to Example 6.4 
in section 6.2, the reader can recollect that if the width of the rectangular

Fourier Transform Representation of Aperiodic Signals
481
Fig. 6.40 FT duality property
pulse increases, the width of the main lobe of the sinc function decreases 
and vice versa. If the time extent of the signal increases, the frequency 
extent decreases. The property can be stated in other words as the product 
of the time extent and the frequency extent (time bandwidth product) 
remains constant.    
 
 Let us explain the concept of bandwidth for a sinc function for example. 
If the FT is a sinc function, the signal extends up to infinity in frequency 
domain. Hence, it is difficult to define the bandwidth. The bandwidth 
is actually referring to the significant content of the signal for positive 
frequencies. Considering the word significant, the bandwidth of the sinc 
function is defined as the positive width of the main lobe. Other commonly 
used definition of bandwidth is the frequency extent where the gain falls to 
0.707 of its maximum value. 
The time bandwidth product for any signal is lower bounded, as shown 
in the equation
1/2
d
w
T B ≥
(6.128)
This lower bound indicates that the signal duration and bandwidth cannot 
be simultaneously decreased. The signal satisfying the equation with 
equality is Gaussian pulse. Equation (6.128) is also called as uncertainty 
principle. The same result holds good for all Fourier representations.

Physical significance of Parseval’s identity Parseval’s identity states that 
the energy of the signal in time domain is the same as the energy of the FT 
coefficients. This simply means, when the signal is transformed in frequency 
domain, its energy is preserved.  |X(jω)|2 represents the energy spectral density 
of the signal.

  6.8 Analysis of LTI System using FT and DTFT
The FT and DTFT can be used for the analysis of LTI systems in two ways.
1. The system performance can be easily tested and analyzed in the frequency 
domain. The impulse response of the system is known in time domain. 
The impulse response signal is aperiodic. Depending upon if it is a CT or a 
DT signal, we can take its FT or DTFT. The FT or DTFT can be analyzed to 
find the magnitude and phase response of the system for different frequencies.
2. The response of any LTI system to a given input is evaluated as a 
convolution of the input signal with the impulse response of the LTI 
system in time domain. The convolution is computationally costly. The 
convolution property of FT helps in this regard. The convolution in time 
domain is equivalent to a multiplication in FT domain. Multiplication is 
less costly. One may first find FTs of the signal and impulse response of the 
LTI system, multiply the two FTs and then take inverse FT of the result. 
This gives the result of convolution of the signal and impulse response 
of the LTI system in time domain. Let us understand the procedure for 
finding frequency response and output of the system to any given input by 
considering some numerical examples.
Example 6.58
Let the impulse response of the system be given by h(t) = e–2tu(t – 2) and the 
input to the system be x(t) = e–4tu(t). Find the output of the system.
Solution
Let us first find the FT of the input signal x(t).

We need to convolve the two rectangular window functions
The transform X(jω) is plotted in Fig. 6.43. The same signal is convolved 
with itself to get the result of convolution, as shown in Fig. 6.44 below.
Note from the examples solved above for DT aperiodic signals that FT 
for DT aperiodic signals is periodic. DTFT has the period of 2*pi. We can 
summarize this fact in Table 6.1. Representations that are continuous in 
one domain either time or frequency are non-periodic in other domains. 
Representations that are discrete in one domain are periodic in the other 
domain, as listed in Table 6.2.

Summary
In this chapter, we have described the FT of aperiodic CT signals and DTFT of 
aperiodic DT signals. The important concepts are explained. 
• 
We have started with the Fourier representation of periodic signals and 
used the limit as the period tends to infinity to get the FT representation of 
aperiodic signals. The integrals of the FT equation may not always converge. 
The convergence can be confirmed if the signal satisfies Dirichlet conditions. 
Even if the signal is not square integrable, FT can still be defined using

impulses. The procedure for the evaluation of magnitude and phase response 
using hand calculations is explained. MATLAB programs are given to confirm 
the results for magnitude and phase response of exponential signals. FT of a 
CT aperiodic signal is a continuous function of frequency and is aperiodic. 
The FT of left-handed and right-handed exponential signal have the same 
magnitude response. The phase values are reversed.
• 
The significance of FT is explained for the evaluation of the spectrum of 
BPSK in communication. FT of a rectangular pulse for different pulse widths 
is evaluated and is shown to be a sinc function. Effect of the pulse width 
variation on width of the main lobe of the sinc function is discussed. As the 
width of the rectangular pulse increases, the width of the main lobe of the sinc 
function decreases and vice versa. The extent of the signal in time multiplied 
by the extent of the signal in frequency domain is constant and has a lower 
bound. This is to state that time bandwidth product remains constant. This is 
also called as Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. It was also shown that IFT 
of a rectangular pulse in frequency domain is a sinc function in time domain. 
This is called as the property of duality. The FT of some standard signals is 
evaluated including the delta function, a constant, unit step, signum function, 
etc. The use of Dirac delta function for the evaluation of FT for complex 
exponential, sine function, cosine function, etc. is illustrated. 
• 
FT of the periodic pulse train with spacing between the pulses of T is shown to 
be again a pulse train of spacing of 1/T.  The inverse FT calculations are shown 
using a direct formula for IFT. The IFT computation using partial fraction 
expansion is illustrated with several numerical examples. FT of DT signals 
are then discussed. The DT signal is generated by multiplication of a train of 
impulses and the signal. The multiplication in time domain is equivalently a 
convolution in transform domain. In FT domain, there is a convolution of the 
spectrum of the signal and the FT of a train of impulses, which is again a train 
of impulses. This results in DTFT as the replicated continuous spectrum. The 
DTFT of some standard aperiodic DT signals is evaluated. The procedure for 
calculation of inverse DTFT using a direct formula for DTFT is illustrated 
using numerical examples. DTFT of the periodic DT signal such as impulse 
train is shown to be the impulse train function.
• 
The properties of FT and DTFT are discussed with their physical significance. 
The property of linearity is used in inverse FT calculations. We have 
explained time shifting, time reversal, time scaling and time differentiation 
and integration properties of FT. The physical significance of all these 
properties is discussed. Time shifting property states that time shifting of a 
signal results in FT with same magnitude with phase changed by the angle ωt0, 
where t0 is the amount of shift. Time-reversed signals will also have the same 
magnitude response, but the sign of phase angle is reversed. Time scaling of 
a signal results in the scaling of both magnitude and phase angle of its FT. 
Time differentiation operation of a signal will remove the DC component of

the FT and will multiply the magnitude of all frequencies by the frequency 
value resulting in the enhancement of high frequencies in FT domain. Time 
integration of the signal is basically a smoothing operation and hence, it 
deemphasizes the high frequencies in FT domain. Similar properties also 
apply to DTFT except the differentiation and integration. 
• 
Conjugation property, Frequency shifting, frequency scaling, frequency 
differentiation properties are then discussed. FT of a real signal exhibits 
complex conjugate property. Frequency shifting by ω0 in FT domain results 
in signal with phase change by same angular frequency. A shift in the signal 
in one domain results in the multiplication by the complex exponential in 
the other domain. Frequency differentiation results in multiplying the same 
by ‘t’. Further the properties of modulation and convolution are discussed. 
These properties indicate that multiplication in one domain results in the 
convolution in the other domain. This is a duality property. Duality is also 
indicated in FT and IFT calculations. FT of a rectangular pulse is a sinc 
function and vice versa. The Parseval’s theorem is then explained. Several 
numerical examples are solved based on all the properties discussed. 
• 
Output of the LTI system to any given input can be found by convolving the 
impulse response of the LTI system with the input signal. FT helps in this 
regard. Instead of using convolution, one may simplify the computations 
using FT. Find FTs of both the input signal and impulse response of LTI 
system, multiply the two and take inverse FT of the product. FT is useful for 
analyzing the frequency response of the system. Several numerical examples 
are solved to illustrate the concepts.

We will discuss the unilateral and bilateral Laplace Transform (LT) and its 
significance in analyzing the systems. The significance of complex frequency 
will be discussed. The relation between LT and FT will be explained. Different 
examples based on calculation of LT and inverse LT will be solved. LT of some 
standard signals will be evaluated. LT is very useful for analyzing the stability 
of the system. Stability of the system in Laplace domain will be explained.
  7.1 Definition of Laplace Transform
Laplace transform was first proposed by Laplace (year 1980). This is the 
operator that transforms the signal in time domain in to a signal in a complex 
frequency domain called as ‘S’ domain. The complex frequency domain will be 
denoted by S and the complex frequency variable will be denoted by ‘s’. Let us 
understand the significance of Laplace transform. The reader must be familiar

with complex numbers. The complex frequency S can be likewise defined as 
s = s + jw, where s is the real part of s and jw is the imaginary part of s. The 
complex numbers are defined by mathematicians and are the mathematical 
abstractions useful for the analysis of signals and systems. It simplifies the 
mathematics. Similarly, the complex frequency plane is also the mathematical 
abstraction useful for the simplification of mathematics. Laplace transform 
does not have any physical significance. We can just say that w stands for the 
real frequency and Laplace transform transforms the signal from time domain 
to some kind of frequency domain. 
Physical significance of Laplace transform Laplace transform has no 
physical significance except that it transforms the time domain signal 
to a complex frequency domain. It is useful to simply the mathematical 
computations and it can be used for the easy analysis of signals and systems. 
The stability of the system is directly revealed when the transfer function of 
the system is known in Laplace domain. LT is used for solving differential 
equations.

(7.1)
Here, the signal x(t) is a both-sided signal existing from –∞ to +∞ and LT is 
termed as bilateral LT. Unilateral LT is a special case of LT where the signal 
x(t) is restricted to be causal i.e., it exists between 0 and ∞. Unilateral LT is a 
special case of LT.
We define inverse LT as

The inverse LT cannot be evaluated directly, as it requires contour integration. 
Inverse LT is usually obtained by inspection.  
The integral defined for LT may not always converge. The region of values 
of σ for which LT converges is called as region of convergence (ROC). ROC 
is shown in the complex frequency plane called as S plane. S plane has σ on 
x-axis called real axis and jΩ on the y-axis called as imaginary axis, as shown 
in Fig. 7.1. The significance of ROC is LT for the signal does not exist for all 
σ, but it is convergent over certain range of values of σ for which | ( )

absolutely integrable. 
LT converts a time domain signal into a complex frequency plane. We can 
say that it is the representation of continuous time signal in terms of complex 
exponentials. Laplace transform possesses a number of properties useful for 
signal and system analysis. Many of the properties are similar to FT.

1. Continuous time complex exponentials are eigen functions of LTI systems.
2. Convolution of two time domain signals results in multiplication of their 
LTs.
3.
LT of the impulse response of the system is called as transfer function of 
the system in S domain.
4. LT converts a time domain differential equation into a simple algebraic 
equation in s.
LT comes in two varieties. One is a unilateral transform that is used for the 
analysis of differential equations with initial conditions specified. The second 
is bilateral transform, which is used for the analysis of the system with respect 
to its stability, causality and frequency response. LT can also be used for the 
analysis of signals that are not absolutely integrable such as impulse response 
of an unstable system. 
Let us first prove that the complex exponential namely est is an eigen 
function of the LTI system. Let us apply est as input to the LTI system with 
impulse response h(t). The system output y(t) can be written as

The action of LTI system on the complex exponential is its multiplication with 
H(s). Hence, the complex exponential is an eigen function of H(s) and H(s) is 
an eigen value. 
Extended transform LT uses complex exponentials as basis functions 
namely e–st. FT uses 
j t
e
ω
−
 as basis functions whose frequencies are restricted to 
the imaginary axis in a complex plane. These basis functions are not capable 
of synthesizing rising exponential signals. This basic problem is solved by 
using e–st as basis function in LT where the frequency variable is generalized 
to s

. This generalization permits us to synthesize the exponentially 
growing signals. FT is evaluated on the imaginary axis, whereas LT is

LT can be converted to FT by substituting s = jω i.e., σ = 0.
The range of values of σ for which LT converges is called as the region of 
convergence (ROC). Note that even though x(t) is not absolutely integrable, 
by limiting ourselves to certain range of σ, we can ensure that Eq. (7.5) holds 
good. 
The concepts can be better explained using one numerical example.
Example 7.1
Find LT and region of convergence for the signal x(t) = etu(t).
Solution
The signal x(t) can be plotted to see that the signal is divergent and is not 
absolutely integrable. The plot of the signal is shown in Fig. 7.3. The FT of the 
signal does not exist.

Now, let us find the LT of the signal.

is absolutely integrable if σ > 1. So, LT exists with 
ROC as σ > 1, as shown in Fig. 7.4.
Note that ROC will be the area of the S plane on the right or on the left of 
the vertical line with a pole on the vertical line intersecting the x-axis.

FT
LT
1
Uses e–jwt as basis function, frequencies are 
restricted to the imaginary axis in a complex 
plane
Uses e–(s + jw)t = e–st as basis function, frequencies 
are the complex frequencies in a complex plane
2
FT exists only if |x(t)| is absolutely integrable
LT exists only if |x(t)e–st| is absolutely 
integrable
3
No ROC specified
ROC is specified as a range of σ for which |x(t)
e–st| is absolutely integrable
4
For some signals such as x(t) = et i.e., 
growing exponentials, FT does not exist
For a signal such as x(t) = et, |x(t)e–st| is 
integrable for range σ > 1, and LT exists.
5
Rarely used for solving differential 
equations, as for many x(t) FT is not 
convergent
Widely used for solving differential equations
6
FT is an LT of the same signal x(t) evaluated 
by putting s = jω
LT of x(t) is a FT of x(t)e–st
7
Cannot be used for analysis of unstable or 
even marginally stable systems
Can be used for the analysis of unstable 
systems.

We will state and explain different properties of LT that include linearity, time 
shifting, time scaling, time reversal, time differentiation, time integration, 
differentiation in S domain, frequency shifting, time convolution, modulation, 
conjugate property, Parseval’s theorem, initial value theorem, and final value 
theorem. Let us consider the properties one by one.

Physical significance of property of linearity If the signal can be 
decomposed into linear combination of two or more component signals, 
then the LT of the signal is the linear combination of the component signals. 
This simplifies the mathematical computations. Similarly, if the signal can be 
decomposed into linear combination of two or more component signals in LT 
domain, then the inverse LT (ILT) of the signal is the linear combination of 
the component ILT signals. This property is used in calculation of ILT using 
partial fraction expansion.

corresponds to multiplication by the complex exponential

is usually applied to causal signals with positive time shift t0. The restriction

on the time shift arises because the time shift, if not restricted, may move the 
signal to negative time and the transform will no longer be unilateral.

Physical significance of property of time integration When the signal is 
integrated in time domain, its LT gets multiplied in S domain by 1/s. This 
factor is indeterminate at s = 0. Integration is basically a smoothing operation 
and hence it smoothes the signal. The smoothing in time deemphasizes the 
high frequencies, as is indicated by a factor of s in denominator.

domain transforms to modulation in the other domain. (Modulation refers 
to the multiplication of the two signals.)  Both convolution and modulation 
properties are due to the fact that complex exponentials are eigen functions 
of LTI system.

energy of the signal in time domain is same as the energy of the LT coefficients. 
This simply means, when the signal is transformed in any other domain, its 
energy is preserved.  |X(s)|2 represents the energy of the signal in S domain.

Physical significance of the final value theorem The final value of the 
signal can be found from its LT by taking the limit of sX(s) as s tends to zero. 
We need not take ILT. To apply final value theorem, we have to cancel poles 
and zeros of sX(s) before applying the limit. All the poles of X(s) must lie on 
the left-hand side of the S plane i.e., the system must be stable.  
16. Time periodicity property
 
Let us consider a causal periodic signal with period equal to T, which 
satisfies the condition x(t) = x(t + nT) for all t > 0 and n = 0, 1, 2,…. We 
will use the definition of LT.

Example 7.25
Find LT of the signal drawn in Fig. 7.34 below. Find ROC.
Fig. 7.34 Plot of signal for Example 7.25
Solution
We will use the definition of LT. We have to find the equation of the straight 
line. 
Y = mx + c. Points (0,1) and (1,0) are on the line. These coordinates must 
satisfy the equation.
1 = c and 0 = m + c; hence, m = –c = –1; The equation becomes y = –x + 1
We have to write the signal x(t) = –t + 1

7.4.4 Properties of ROC
We list below the properties of ROC.
1. The ROC does not contain any pole.
2. ROC is bounded by the poles or it extends to infinity.
3. If x(t) is a right-handed signal, then ROC extends to the right of the 
rightmost pole. ROC is a strip parallel to the imaginary axis and extends 
from the rightmost pole to infinity.
4. If x(t) is a left-handed signal, then ROC extends to the left of the leftmost 
pole. ROC is a strip parallel to the imaginary axis and extends from the 
leftmost pole to minus infinity.
5. If x(t) is a two-sided signal, then ROC is a strip bounded by the poles.
6. The finite duration absolutely integrable function has ROC as the entire S 
plane.
7. ROC of the LTI system contains the imaginary axis.
The reader is encouraged to verify the above properties from the examples 
solved in the previous sections.      
Concept Check
• 
If the signal is causal, what is the nature of ROC?
• 
Can the two signals have same LT but different ROC?
• 
Can the two signals have same ROC and different LT?
• 
Can a sgn(t) function have a LT?
• 
If u(t) transforms to 1/s, find LT of tu(t), which property of LT have you 
used?
• 
Which property of LT will you use to find LT(e–atu(t))?
• 
Which property of LT will you use to find LT of a periodic signal?
• 
If the signal is left-handed signal, what is your conclusion regarding the 
ROC?
• 
If the signal is a right-handed signal, what is your conclusion regarding 
ROC?

When will ROC be a strip between the 2 pole locations?
• 
Can ROC contain a pole?
  7.5 Inverse LT
To find the signal from its given LT requires the evaluation of contour 
integration, as stated in section 7.1. It is preferred to find LT by inspection 
using one-to-one relationship between a known function and its LT. 
The procedure for finding LT given the function in S domain can be stated 
as follows:
Step 1 First factorize the denominator to get the poles of the function.
Step 2 Use partial fraction expansion.
Step 3 Find the inverse LT of each term.
Let us illustrate this procedure by a simple example. 
Example 7.44
Find the inverse LT of

1)(
2)
s
X s
s
s
s
−
−
=
+
−
+
 with ROC given by 
–1 <Re(s) < 1.
Solution
The denominator is already in the factored form. So, step 1 is over.
Step 2 We will use partial fraction expansion and decompose the function 
in three terms.

Solution
The steps up to the decomposition of X(s) will remain the same. We will repeat 
the steps here. 
The denominator is already in the factored form. So, step 1 is over.
Step 2 We will use partial fraction expansion and decompose the function 
in three terms.

We have to study ROC for finding the inverse LT. It is a strip between –2 
and –1. Here, the common area of convergence is a strip between σ = –2 and
σ = –1. We will recover the terms with poles at 0 and –1 as the left-handed 
signals. We will recover the signal for the term with pole at s = –2 as the 
right-handed signal so that its ROC will also include the common area of 
convergence.

Note that ROC cannot be specified as –2 < Re(s) < 1. Here, the signal for the 
term with a pole at s = –1 cannot be recovered either as a left-handed or as a 
right-handed signal. In any case, it will not completely overlap with the ROC 
specified. 
If the ROC is not specified, we assume that all the signals are unilateral i.e., 
all are right-handed signals.

Note that the terms having poles at zero and –1 are recovered as left-handed 
signals and are appended by –u(–t) and the terms with pole at –2 are recovered 
as a right-handed signal and are appended by u(t).
The roots of the denominator can be real or can be complex. Complex 
roots will result in complex-valued exponential function in time. Complex 
conjugate roots are combined to generate real coefficients for the denominator 
polynomial.
Let us consider one example with complex roots. Note that we have to find 
ILT by inspection. We will require the help of the following standard results

Note that the term with pole at 1 is recovered as the left-handed signal and 
the term with pole at –1 is recovered as the right-handed signal, so that the 
common area of convergence is the same as the ROC specified.
Let us consider the case when the term has a double real pole. Here, the 
method for decomposition using partial fraction expansion and method to 
find the coefficients is different, as indicated in the following example.

  7.5.1 Transform analysis of LTI systems
LTI system is characterized by its impulse response. If we consider unilateral 
Laplace transform, we can use LT for analysis of the system to solve the 
differential equation with non-zero initial conditions. The initial conditions 
can be assumed to occur at t = 0. We will illustrate the use of LT with the help 
of a simple example.

 7.5.2 Total response of the system using LT
LTI system is described by the constant coefficient differential equation. The 
response of the system is obtained by solving the differential equation. LT 
converts the differential equation in time domain to the algebraic equation in 
Laplace domain. These algebraic equations can be solved to find the solution. 
The total response o the system can be expressed as 
Total response = Natural response + Forced response
Natural response of the system is due to initial conditions alone. It is also 
termed as the zero input response i.e., when the externally applied input is 
zero. Forced response is due to the externally applied input signal. The forced 
response consists of steady state response and the transient response. The 
forced response is also termed as zero state response i.e., when the initial 
conditions are zero.
The steady state response is the response due to the poles of the input. It 
remains as t tends to infinity. Hence, it is called as a steady state response. The 
response due to poles of the system is called as the transient response as it 
vanishes as t tends to infinity. 
Let us illustrate the concepts with the help of suitable example.

Teaser The reader is encouraged to verify the coefficients.
Take ILT to find the solution. The forced response is the sum of steady state 
response and the transient response. The response due to input is the steady 
state response and the response due to poles of the system is the transient 
response.

 7.5.3 Stability considerations in S domain 
The system transfer function in S domain determines the location of poles. 
The pole locations determine the stability of the system. If the poles for a causal 
system are on the left-hand side of an imaginary axis, then the system is stable. 
If the poles for a causal system are on the right-hand side of the imaginary axis, 
the system is unstable. The frequency response of the system can be found 

Laplace Transform
599
by putting s = jω in the equation of the transfer function. The imaginary axis 
must be in the ROC. In case of the non-causal system the reverse is true. If the 
poles are on right-hand side of the imaginary axis, the system is stable and vice 
versa. 
Let us consider one simple example to illustrate the concepts.
Example 7.62
Find LT of the right-handed signal x(t) = e–atu(t) with a > 0, x(t) = eat u(t) with 
a > 0 and  a left-handed signal x(t) = e–atu(–t) with a > 0, x(t) = eat u(–t) with 
a >0
We will use the definition of LT.

Summary
In this chapter, we have described and explained the properties of Laplace 
Transform (LT). 
• 
We started with the complex numbers and explained the significance of using 
a complex plane for LT. The S plane is defined and the physical significance 
of LT is explained. Unilateral and bilateral LTs are defined. It is stated that 
inverse LT involves calculation of contour integration and hence is found by 
inspection. Properties of LT are stated. Continuous time complex exponentials 
e–st are eigen functions of LTI systems. Convolution of two time domain signals 
results in multiplication of their LTs. LT of the impulse response of the system 
is called as transfer function of the system in S domain and LT converts a time 
domain differential equation into a simple algebraic equation in S. ROC is 
defined as the range of values of σ for which ( )
t
x t e σ
−
 is absolutely integrable. 
Relation between LT and FT is discussed. LT also exists for unstable systems. 
One numerical example is used to explain the convergence of LT for unstable 
system. FT and LT are compared.
• 
LTs of some standard functions like delta function, unit step, ramp, exponential 
function, complex exponential function, damped sinusoid are evaluated. The 
ROCs for each are shown diagrammatically and explained. The properties 
of LT such as linearity, time shifting, time reversal, time scaling are stated 
and proved. The properties such as frequency sifting, time differentiation, 
time integration, frequency differentiation, conjugate symmetry, Parseval’s 

Signals and Systems
604
theorem, initial and final value theorem are also stated and explained. The 
periodicity property is proved. It is useful for finding the LT of some standard 
periodic signals. The physical significance of all these properties is explained. 
• 
Some examples on LT are solved for the benefit of the reader. The evaluation 
of ROC for each example is illustrated. LTs for some standard signals are 
evaluated. LTs for some standard aperiodic signals are solved. We have 
illustrated the use of periodicity property to find the LT of any periodic signal 
given its waveform. Properties of ROC are then discussed. The nature of ROC 
for right-handed, left-handed and both-sided signals are given. ROC is always 
a strip between two poles. It is emphasized that ROC can not contain any 
pole. The locations of the poles in S domain decide the ROC. The formula for 
inverse LT uses a contour integration which is little difficult to solve. 
• 
The ILT evaluation by inspection is illustrated using several solved examples. 
To find ILT, we need to know the nature of ROC. The examples illustrate the 
calculation of ILT for different ROC specifications for same X(s). If the poles 
are complex, the ILT calculation by inspection is a bit tricky. ILT evaluation 
for complex conjugate roots is also explained with simple examples. MATLAB 
programs are given for plotting the poles and zeros of the transfer function 
and for plotting the response of the system. The analysis of LTI systems is 
explained using LT. The terms such as impulse response, natural response, 
steady state response, transient response and forced response are explained. 
Simple examples are solved to illustrate the concepts. The zero state response 
and zero input response are also described.

Z Transform
8
Z domain is used for DT signals. The purpose of Z transform for DT signals 
is similar to that of Laplace transform for analog signals. The Z transform 
(ZT) is used to characterize a DT system by analyzing its transfer function 
in the Z domain. The locations of poles and zeros of the transfer function 
are further used for stability analysis of the DT systems. We will first discuss 
the significance of a transform. To understand that Laplace transform and Z 
transform are parallel techniques, we will start with Laplace transform and 
develop its relation to Z transform. The properties of Z transform will be 
discussed along with the region of convergence (ROC). The overall strategy of 
these two transforms is as follows. Find the impulse response from the transfer 
function. Find poles and zeros of the transfer function and apply sinusoids and 
exponentials as inputs to find the response. The basic difference between the 

Z Transform
619
two transforms is that the s-plane used by S domain is arranged in a rectangular 
co-ordinate system, while the z-plane used by Z domain uses a polar format. 
The Z transform provides mathematical framework for designing digital filters 
based on the well-known theory of analog filters using a mapping technique. 
The reader will study this part in the course on “Digital signal processing”.
  8.1 Physical Significance of a Transform 
When any natural signal is to be processed, the signal parameters or features 
are required to be extracted. A transform helps in three ways.
1. The spectral properties of the signal are better revealed in a transform 
domain.
2. The system transfer function directly indicates the locations of poles and 
zeros that help in analyzing the stability of the system. 
3. A signal, while transmission over a communication channel, needs to be 
compressed. Energy compaction can be achieved in a transform domain. 
The signal containing, for example, 128 sample points when transformed 
in Fourier domain will result in Fourier coefficients 128 in number. 
However, only a small number of them will have significant values and the 
others will be tending to zero. This effect is termed as energy compaction, 
as the energy gets concentrated in few coefficients in transform domain. 
For example, 128 samples of a DT sinusoid will convert to only one 
coefficient using Fourier series, namely the corresponding frequency term. 
(Here, it is assumed that DT sinusoid is periodic and there is no aliasing, as 
sampling is proper.) All other frequency coefficients will have zero values. 
This is one extreme case of energy compaction. 
Concept Check
• What are the advantages of using a transform domain?
• What is energy compaction?
• Compare Laplace domain with Z domain.
• Can you analyze the stability of the system in Z domain?
• Do you get energy compaction when you Fourier transform the signal?
• Can you analyze the spectral contents of the signal in transform domain? 
  8.2 Relation between LT and ZT
Let us consider an analog signal sampled using an ideal sampler. Let us first 
understand the meaning of an ideal sampler. Ideal sampler is one which 
samples the signal at a particular instant such that the switch in Fig. 8.1 is closed 
for a very short duration almost tending to zero. The switch in Fig. 8.1 is ideal. 
The characteristics of ideal switch can be stated as follows. The ideal switch has 

Signals and Systems
620
zero resistance when closed and infinite resistance when it is open. We assume 
that is there is no leakage. The signal is sampled with a sampling frequency of 
FS KHz. Here, we are assuming that sampling is uniform sampling. Uniform 
sampling means that the samples are taken at constant i.e., uniform sampling 
instants. The signal is assumed to start at t = 0 and the sampler starts taking 
samples from t = 0, t = T, t = 2T, and so on. The sampling interval that is the 
interval between successive samples is constant. Let T represent the sampling 
interval. Let the sampled signal be denoted by f *(t), as shown in Fig. 8.1.

Now, f *(t) can be written as

Let dT(t)  represent the train of unit impulse function having a value 1 at each 
sampling instant that is a multiple of T. The impulse exists at t = 0, t = T, t = 
2T, and so on, for uniform sampling. Then

Here F(Z) is called as a Z transform of a DT signal f(nT). A DT signal is usually 
denoted as f[n] by dropping T as it remains constant. There is a one-to-one 
correspondence between a signal and its Z transform. Hence, we can recover  
f(nT) from its Z transform via inverse Z transformation.

  8.3 Relation between Fourier Transform (FT) and Z  
 
Transform
Since Z has been defined as a complex variable, we can express it in the polar 
form as
Z = rejΩ 
(8.7)
where r represents the magnitude of Z and Ω represents the angle or phase of 
Z. Let us substitute this value of Z in Eq. (8.6)

Here, in Eq. (8.9), T is dropped as we are using uniform sampling, so a sample 
taken at t = nT namely (f(nT)) represents the nth sample and is just denoted 
as f[n].
We can conclude from Eq. (8.9) that F(Z) is a Fourier transform (FT) of a 
sequence f[n]r-n. In general, the analog signal may exist from –∞ to +∞, and 
we can put the summation limits from –∞ to +∞ and write

Note that for r = 1 or equivalently when Z = 1, the Z transform reduces to 
FT. In other words, Z transform reduces to FT on the unit circle (circle with 
radius equal to one) in complex Z plane. Convergence of Z transform (ZT) 
requires the convergence of a sequence f[n]r-n. For any f[n]r–n the infinite 
series represented by Eq. (8.10) will converge for only some range of values 
of r. The range of values of r for which the sequence f[n]r-n converges is called 
the region of convergence (ROC). If ROC includes the unit circle, then the FT 
also converges.

• What is ROC?
• What is the significance of a unit circle in Z domain?
• Specify the ROC for convergence of ZT and FT.
  8.4 Solved Problems on Z Transform
The concept of region of convergence is explained further with the help of 
solved examples. We will find the ZT of some standard signals.

Note that the term in the bracket of Eq. (8.12) appears in the bracket in the

for F(Z). It is clear that ZT (the infinite series) only converges for |Z–1| < 1 [the 
term inside the bracket in Eq. (8.17.)], that is for |Z| > 1. |Z| > 1 is the ROC. It 
is the entire Z-plane outside the unit circle, as shown in Fig. 8.2.

ROC is computed at Eq. (8.23). Set the terms inside the brackets to less than 1:
|ejωTZ–1| < 1 and |e–jωTZ–1| < 1 but |ejωT| = 1, |e–jωT| = 1 
(8.28)
Hence, ROC is |Z–1| < 1 or |Z| > 1. ROC is the region outside the unit circle in Z 
plane. Here ROC is the same as that for Problem 8.1 (Fig. 8.2), but Z transforms 
are different. When a sequence is transformed in Z domain, it is completely 
specified by its Z transform along with its ROC. The transfer function F(Z) has 
a zero at Z = 0. The poles of F(Z), namely,

ROC is computed at Eq. (8.29). Set the terms inside the brackets to less than 1:
|ejωTZ–1| < 1 and |e–jωTZ–1| < 1 but |ejωT| = 1, |e–jωT| = 1 
(8.30)
Hence, ROC is |Z–1| < 1 or |Z| > 1. ROC is the region outside the unit circle 
in Z plane. Here, ROC is the same as that for Problem 8.1 (Fig. 8.2), but Z

transforms are different. When a sequence is transformed in the Z domain, 
it is completely specified by its Z transform along with its ROC. The transfer 
function F(Z) has a zero at Z = 0 and at Z = cos(ωT). The poles of F(Z), namely,

with angles ωT and –ωT. The plot of poles and zeros is shown in Fig. 8.4.
Fig. 8.4 ROC is the Z plane outside unit circle. The poles are on the  
                             unit circle at angle = wT and –wT
We will now consider an example of two sequences for which Z transforms are 
same and ROCs are complementary.

ROC is calculated as the term inside the bracket in Eq. (8.32) to be less than 
1. |aZ–1| < 1 that is |Z| > a. ROC is the area outside the circle |Z| = a in the 
Z domain, as shown in Fig. 8.5. If a < 1, then the Fourier transform of the 
sequence f(n) will also converge as it will include the circle |Z| = 1:

F2(Z) is same as F1(Z). ROC is calculated using Eq. (8.38) by putting the term 
inside the bracket to be less than 1. |a–1Z| < 1, that is, |Z| < a. ROC is the area 
inside the circle |Z| = a in Z domain, as shown in Fig. 8.5.
Fig. 8.5 ROC for F1(Z) is the Z plane outside the circle |Z| = a and  
                             ROC for F2(Z) is the Z plane area inside circle |Z| = a

• What is the significance of ROC being inside a circle in the Z domain?
• If two sequences have the same Z transform, how can one distinguish  
between them?
• How will you calculate the closed-form expression for Z transform?                                                                                     
  8.5 Properties of ROC
Property 1
The ROC of X(Z) consists of a circular ring in the Z plane centered around 
origin.
Proof
ROC consists of a range of values of Z (i.e., rejω) for which x[n]r–n has a Fourier 
transform that converges. ROC of the Z transform of x[n] consists of the values 
of Z for which x[n]r–n is absolutely summable. This indicates that convergence 
is dependent only on r = |Z| and not on ω. If a specified value of Z is in the 
ROC, then all values of Z on the same circle (with same magnitude) will be in 
the ROC. Hence, ROC will consist of a circular ring. The inner boundary of 
ROC may tend towards the origin and the outer boundary of ROC may tend 
towards infinity. (Refer to Figs 8.3 and 8.8.).
Property 2
The ROC does not contain any pole.
Proof
We know that the system function diverges at pole locations. This clearly 
means that the ROC will not include any pole location.
Property 3
If the sequence x[n] is of finite duration, then the ROC is the entire Z plane, 
except possibly Z = 0 and/or Z = ∞.
Proof
Let us consider a finite duration sequence existing between n = N1 and n = N2. 
Case 1 N1 and N2 both are negative

( )
[ ]
N

n N
X Z
x n Z−
=
= ∑
 
(8.39)
As N1 and N2 are negative, X(Z) is a series with positive powers of Z and hence, 
it will diverge for |Z| → ∞. Hence, ROC will exclude Z = ∞.
Case 2 N1 and N2 are both positive

Z Transform
631
As N1 and N2 are positive, X(Z) is a series with negative powers of Z and 
hence, it will diverge for |Z| → 0. Therefore, ROC will exclude Z = 0.
Case 3 N1 is negative and N2 is positive
As N1 is negative and N2 is positive, X(Z) is a series containing both negative 
and positive powers of Z and hence, it will diverge for both |Z| → ∞ and |Z| → 
0. ROC will exclude Z = 0 and Z = ∞.
Property 4
If x[n] is a right-handed sequence (causal sequence) and if the circle |Z| = r0 is 
in ROC, then all finite values of Z for which |Z| > r0 will also be in ROC.
Proof
A right-handed sequence is zero prior to some positive value of n, for example, 
n = N1. X(Z) will contain all negative powers of Z.
1. If |Z| = r0 is in ROC, the sequence x[n]r0
–n converges.
2. If |Z| > r0 and let us assume that |Z| = r1, then the sequence x[n]r1
–n will 
converge more rapidly and |Z| = r1 will also be in ROC.
Property 5
If x[n] is a left-handed sequence and if the circle |Z| = r0 is in ROC, then all 
finite values of Z for which |Z| < r0 will also be in ROC.
Proof
A left-handed sequence is zero after some negative or zero value of n, and let 
us assume that n = N1. X(Z) will contain all positive powers of Z.
1. If |Z| = r0 is in ROC, the sequence x[n]r0
n converges.
2. If |Z| < r0, and let us assume that |Z| = r1, then the sequence x[n]r1
n will 
converge more rapidly and |Z| = r1 will also be in ROC.
Property 6
If x[n] is a both-handed sequence and if the circle |Z| = r0 is in ROC, then ROC 
will consist of a ring in a Z-plane which includes Z = r0.
Proof
Consider a both-sided sequence as made up of a right-handed sequence and 
a left-handed sequence. The right-handed sequence will have the ROC as the 
entire Z-plane outside some circle with |Z| = r1, as shown in Fig. 8.6. The left-
handed sequence, on the other hand, will have the ROC as the region inside 
some circle |Z| = r2, as shown in Fig. 8.6. ROC for a both-sided sequence is the 
overlapping area in the Z-plane including |Z| = r0.

  radius |Z| = r1. (b) ROC for a left-handed sequence is  
                 inside the circle with radius r2. (c) ROC for a both-sided  
                                      sequence is the common area of convergence including  circle 
                             with radius rn (r0 < r1 < r2)
To illustrate Property 3, let us consider the example of delta and shifted delta 
functions.

The ROC is the entire Z-plane including Z = 0 and Z = ∞.
• Case 2 Let δ[n] be shifted towards right by one sample so that it becomes  
       δ[n – 1].
X(Z) = Z–1 
(8.41)
This function has a pole at Z = 0 and ROC will exclude Z = 0.
• Case 3 Let δ[n] be shifted towards left by one sample so that it becomes  
 
δ[n + 1].
X(Z) = Z

ROC can be calculated at Eq. (8.54). The first term converges for |Z| > b and 
the second term will converge for |Z| < 1/b. Common area of convergence will 
exist only if b < 1. Figure 8.8 shows the area of convergence, which consists of 
a ring between b and 1/b.
Here, the sequence is a both-sided sequence of infinite duration. Hence, ROC 
is a ring between two circles with radii b and 1/b. It is given that b > 0. There will 
be two cases. First is b < 1, 1/b > 1. In this case ROC will exist. The second case is 
b > 1, 1/b < 1. In this case the ROCs for the two terms will be disjoint and there 
will be no common area of convergence.

ROC can be found at Eq. (8.63). The first term converges for |Z| > 0.5 and the 
second term converges for |Z| < 1. So the common area of convergence is the

  8.6 Properties of Z Transform
The section discusses different properties of Z transform, namely linearity, 
time shifting, scaling in Z domain, time reversal, differentiation in Z domain, 
convolution and initial value theorem. Let us discuss these properties one by 
one.

Physical significance of property of linearity If the signal can be 
decomposed into linear combination of two or more component signals, 
then the ZT of the signal is the linear combination of the component 
signals. This can be easily computed. Similarly, if the signal can be 
decomposed into linear combination of two or more component signals in 
ZT domain, then inverse ZT (IZT) of the signal is the linear combination 
of the component IZT signals. This property is used in the calculation of 
IZT using partial fraction expansion.

1. 
If n0 > 0, then the poles are introduced at the origin and if ROC of  
x[n] includes origin, ROC of x[n – n0] will exclude origin.
  
 
2. 
If n0 < 0, then the poles are introduced at infinity and ROC of x[n – 
n0]   
will exclude infinity.

Physical significance of property of scaling in Z domain The

The convolution property can be interpreted as follows. We can recognize 
the Z transform as a series in Z–1 where the coefficients of Z–n are the 
sequence values. Hence, the convolution property says that when the two 
polynomials or power series in Z–1 are multiplied, the coefficients in the 
power series of a product are the convolution of the coefficients of two 
power series X1(Z) and X2(Z).
Physical significance of property of convolution When the two signals 
are convolved in DT domain, their ZTs get multiplied. Convolution is 
computationally costly. The convolution can be performed in transform 
domain using a multiplication operation that is less costly.

Physical Significance of the final value theorem The final value of the 
signal can be found from its ZT by taking the limit of (Z–1)X(Z) as Z tends to 
one. We need not take IZT. To apply final value theorem, we have to cancel 
poles and zeros of (Z–1)X(Z) before applying the limit. All the poles of X(Z) 
must lie inside the unit circle in Z plane i.e., the system must be stable.
We will solve some examples based on properties of Z transform.

The first term will converge for |Z| > 1/2 and the other will converge for

If the poles of aX1(Z) + bX2(Z) contain all poles of X1(Z) and X2(Z) with no 
deletion or cancellation of any pole by a zero, the ROC is the overlapping area

  8.7 Relation between Pole Locations and Time Domain  
Behavior 
Stability of the system is analyzed by identifying the locations of poles of 
the system transfer function. We will consider the input to a system as unit 
impulse, that is, δ[n]. Let the impulse response of the system be represented 
as h[n], then the output of the system will also be h[n]. The system transfer 
function in the Z domain is given by
( )
( )
( )
Y Z
H Z
X Z
=
(8.117)
where X(Z) is ZT of δ[n] and is equal to one. (This can be verified from the 
basic equation of ZT.)
( )
( )
( )
1
Y Z
H Z
Y Z
=
=
(8.118)
ZT of y[n] is Y(Z) = H(Z). The system transfer function is H(Z). The poles of 
H(Z) will reflect the stability of the system.
Let us consider the mapping between Laplace domain and Z domain. The 
complex variable Z is defined as 
sT
Z
e
=
 (refer to Section 8.2). The complex Z 
may be written as 
j T
Z
re ω
=
, where r is the magnitude of Z and ωT stands for 
the phase.
1. Consider any point on the imaginary axis in the S (Laplace) domain. 
S
j
σ
ω
=
+
. We have S
jω
=
on the imaginary axis, as here the real part is 
0. Now 
j T
Z
e ω
=
 and r = 1 (|
| 1
j T
e ω
= ). Thus a point on the imaginary axis 
in the S domain will map to a point on the unit circle in the Z domain. 
2. Any point on the left side of imaginary axis will have negative value for 
σ and therefore |e–σ| is less than one. A point on the left-hand side of the 
imaginary axis in the S domain will map to a point inside the unit circle in 
the Z domain.
3. Similarly, a point on right-hand side of the imaginary axis in the S domain will 
map to a point outside the unit circle in the Z domain, as |eσ| is greater than one.  

Signals and Systems
656
We can now translate the stability criteria from the S domain to the Z domain. 
When the poles are inside the unit circle in the Z domain, the system is stable 
and its impulse response, that is, time domain behavior, will be a decaying 
signal. Here, the output is bounded. When the poles are outside the unit circle 
in the Z domain, the system is unstable and its impulse response, that is, time 
domain behavior, will be an exponentially increasing function becoming 
infinite as the sample number (n) tends to infinity. We say that the output is 
unbounded. The system is marginally stable if there are poles of order one on 
the unit circle. The system becomes unstable for higher order poles on unit 
circle. 
We will analyze systems with real poles of order one and two and the systems 
with complex conjugate poles. We will illustrate the behavior of stable and 
unstable systems with the help of known sequences representing the impulse 
response of the system.
Example 8.34 
Let the impulse response of the system be represented as [ ]

know that ZT of x[n] is
( )
Z
X Z
Z

(8.119)
with ROC as |Z| > a. This ZT has a pole at Z = a and a zero at Z = 0.
Let us consider three different cases depending on the value of “a”.
Case 1 a < 1
The pole is inside the unit circle. The sequence representing the impulse 
response is causal with ROC |Z| > a. ROC will include the unit circle in the 
Z domain. The pole zero plot and the time domain behavior are shown in  
Fig. 8.13. We see that the time domain behavior is a decaying function and the 
output is bounded. The system is stable.
Fig. 8.13 Pole zero diagram and time domain behavior for a < 1

Z Transform
657
Case 2 a > 1
The pole is outside the unit circle. The system is unstable and it generates 
unbounded output. ROC excludes the unit circle in the Z domain. The pole 
zero plot and the time domain behavior are shown in Fig. 8.14.
Fig. 8.14 Pole zero diagram and time domain behavior when a > 1
Case 3 a = 1, pole is on the unit circle
The response of the system reduces to a unit step function. The system is 
marginally stable. The pole zero diagram and time domain behavior are shown 
in Fig. 8.15.

  8.8 Inverse Z Transform
Given any DT sequence, we can find its ZT and ROC. There is one-to-one 
correspondence between the sequence and its ZT (with ROC). The ZT is an 
invertible transform in the sense that we can recover a sequence from the 
given ZT and ROC. This process is termed as inverse Z transformation. There 
are three different methods for evaluation of inverse ZT.
1. Power series method
2. Partial fraction expansion method (PFE)
3.
Residue method

polynomial to obtain a power series in Z–1 or Z depending on whether the 
series to be recovered is a right-handed sequence (causal) or a left-handed 
sequence (non-causal).
Here, the sequence to be recovered is a causal sequence. Let us obtain a

Now let us pull the coefficients of the Z–1 series to get the sequence values for 
n = 0, 1, 2, 3, etc. There is no constant term, so the sequence value for n = 0 is 
zero. Sequence values for n = 1, 2, 3, etc. are 1, 4, 9, 16, etc. The causal sequence 
f(n) is recovered as

Note that in the case of non-causal sequence, we simply carry out the long 
division by writing down the two polynomials in the reverse order, that is, by 
starting with the most negative term. The left-handed sequence x[n] can be 
recovered as

Sometimes, it is easy to use a property of differentiation in the Z domain to 
calculate IZT instead of directly writing a power series. We will solve the next 
problem using the property of differentiation in the Z domain.
Example 8.40
If

log(1

X Z
aZ −

 for |Z| > a, find x(n) using the property of differentiation 
in the Z domain.

Solution 
Using the property of differentiation in the Z domain, we have the following:
If given X(Z) is ZT of x[n], then

✓ Teaser The problem can also be solved by writing a power series for the 
log term and then by pulling the coefficients of the Z–1 series to get the 
sequence values for n = 0, 1, 2, 3, etc. This is left as an exercise for the 
reader.

  8.8.2 Partial fraction expansion method
The partial fraction expansion method is used to decompose a rational fraction 
given by X(Z) as a linear combination of ZTs of known sequences:
( )
( )
( )
N Z
X Z
D Z
=
 
(8.142)
If this type of decomposition is possible, then it is possible for us to use a simple 
look-up table method to infer the sequence x[n] as a linear combination of 
known sequences. 
Let X(Z) be represented as
1
2
0

(8.143)
Here 
0
N
a ≠
 and N > M. This rational form is termed as “proper.” If M > N, 
then X(Z) can be written as a sum of a polynomial and a “proper” rational 
function. The IZT of the polynomial can be found very easily by inspection 
by pulling the coefficients. Let us discuss the evaluation of IZT of a rational 
function further.
Let us consider X(Z) as a non-proper rational function with M = N = 2. 
We will express X(Z) as a linear combination of a polynomial and a rational 
function. The IZT of the rational function with a numerator of order 1 and 
a denominator of order 2 is to be evaluated using partial fraction expansion. 
Let us now discuss the partial fraction expansion (PFE) method to 
decompose a rational function. We will list the steps involved in PFE method 
for the IZT calculation of a rational function X(Z).

Z Transform
665
• Step 1 Multiply the numerator and denominator of X(Z) by ZN, where N 
is the negative power of the denominator.
• Step 2 Evaluate ( )
( )
P Z
X Z
Z
=
 and decompose the denominator of  
P(Z) into number of possible factors. Each factor is of the form Z-P, where P 
is the location of a pole for P(Z).
• Step 3 Write P(Z) as
1
2
1
2
( )
...
k
k
P Z
Z
p
Z
p

+

  where p1, p2,... are poles of P(Z).

Note that we can evaluate ILT (inverse Laplace transform) of 
1
1 (

S
p
+
. 
However, to evaluate IZT, the expression must in the form
1
(
)
Z Z
p
−
. In 
order to borrow the same procedure for PFE, we divide X(Z) by Z to get the 
following form of equation 
1
1 (
)
Z
p
−
. Finally, after using PFE, multiply each 
term by Z to get the exact form for the evaluation of IZT.
• Step 5 After proper decomposition multiply each term by Z to get it in 
proper form and calculate the IZT of each term.
• Step 6 Express x[n] as a linear combination of individual IZTs.

We have recovered both sequences as right-handed sequences, because ROC

right-handed sequences. Here, the common area of convergence is |Z| > 1.

  8.8.3 Residue method
This method evaluates the residues of the function at poles that are inside the 
closed contour in the ROC. The sum of these residues gives the IZT of the 
function in the Z domain. The method is based on a theorem called Cauchy’s 
integral theorem.

Hence, put k = n in the term on the right-hand side of Eq. (8.198). It can now 
be written as just  f [k] as the integral exists only for n = k. Statement of the 
method is thus proved. The integration over the closed contour denotes the 
evaluation of residues.
We will now illustrate the procedure for the residue method.

Step 2 Select a closed contour c inside the ROC.
Step 3 Find the poles of the function G(Z) inside the closed contour c.
Step 4 Evaluate the residue of the function G(Z) for all poles within the 
closed contour c. Then, f[n] is recovered as a sum of all these residues.

Step 2 We will now select a closed contour as a circle with radius |Z| > a, so 
that it is in ROC.
Step 3 The poles of G(Z) will depend on the value of n. We will consider two 
different cases n ≥ 0, n < 0.
Case 1 n ≥ 0. Here, there is only pole of G(Z) at Z = a, which is inside the 
circle with radius |Z| > a. We will evaluate the residue of G(Z) at Z = a.

Step 2 We will now select a closed contour as a circle with radius |Z| > 1, so

and its inverse?
• What is a residue? How does one calculate IZT using residues?
• When are we supposed to recover a negative power series in Z? 
• From ROC specification, can we decide if it is a left-handed or a right- 
 
handed sequence?

  8.9 Solution of Difference Equation using Z Transform
We will now consider one of the important applications of the Z transform, 
namely, solving the difference equations. The approach involves calculation 
of the ZT of the shifted sequences with appropriate initial conditions and 
then solving for the ZT of the sequence f[n]. We finally take IZT to obtain the 
sequence f[n].
Let us consider one solved problem to illustrate the use of ZT for solving 
the difference equation.

The current output depends on present and past inputs and past outputs.
Using the procedure outlined in Section 8.9, we can take the ZT of the 
difference equation and find the Z domain transfer function of the system. The 
system transfer function can be further analyzed to find the locations of poles. 
If the poles are inside the unit circle in the Z domain, the system is stable. Thus 
we can confirm the stability of the system before it is actually implemented. 
The IZT of the transfer function will result in the impulse response of the 
system. This helps in analyzing the time domain behavior of the system, as 
discussed in Section 8.6. 
ZT is utilized to draw the realization forms for the causal filters. ZT and IZT 
are useful for the design of FIR and IIR systems. The effect of quantization can 
also be studied using ZT and IZT.

Summary
In this chapter, we have described and explained the following important concepts.
• 
We started with the need for a transform. Spectral properties of the signal 
are better revealed in the transform domain. We can analyze the system for 
stability. Energy of the signal gets compacted in the transform domain. We 
then related the Z transform to Laplace transform and Fourier transform. The 
equation Z = esT defines relation between the Z domain and the S domain. Z 
transform reduces to FT on the unit circle (circle with radius equal to one) in 
complex Z plane.
• 
We defined Z = rejW. The range of values of r for which the sequence   
f[n]r–n converges is called the region of convergence (ROC). If ROC includes 
the unit circle, then the FT also converges. We then concentrated on Z 
transform examples. We have seen that for a right-handed sequence, the ROC 

Signals and Systems
686
is the area outside some circle in the Z domain. For a left-handed sequence, 
the reverse is the case. Here, the ROC is the area inside some circle in the Z 
domain. We can have two sequences, one left-handed and one right-handed, 
for which the Z transform can be the same but the ROCs are different. For 
example, the sequences f1[n] = an for n > 0 and f2[n] = a–n for n < 1 have 
complementary ROCs. We have also seen that if the sequence x(n) is of finite 
duration, then the ROC is the entire Z plane, except possibly Z = 0 and/or 
Z = ∞. Examples based on the properties of ROC are solved to explain the 
concepts. 
• 
We have considered the properties of Z transform such as linearity, time 
shifting and differentiation in Z domain, time reversal, time scaling, 
convolution, multiplication, initial value theorem and final value theorem. 
We have seen that if the time shift of n0 > 0, then the poles are introduced at 
the origin and if the ROC of x[n] includes the origin, the ROC of x[n – n0] 
will exclude the origin. Similarly, if n0 < 0, then the poles are introduced at 
infinity and if the ROC of x[n] includes infinity, the ROC of x[n – n0] will 
exclude infinity. The physical significance of each property is explained. 
Simple examples are solved based on the properties of Z transform. The 
scaling property in the Z domain is discussed. We have considered a special 
case of this property, namely the multiplication of a sequence by a complex 
exponential that will result in rotation of the Z plane by angle ω. This is also 
termed as frequency shifting in the Z domain. We have stated the property of 
time reversal if x[n] ´ X(Z) with ROC = R, then x[–n] ´ X(1/Z) with ROC 
= 1/R, that is, if Z = Z1 is in ROC of x[n], then Z = 1/Z1 is in ROC of x[–n]. 
• 
We then explained property of convolution using a numerical problem. Here, 
we have seen that the coefficients of the multiplication of Z transforms of two 
sequences are actually the convolution of the two sequences. We have studied 
the property of differentiation in the Z domain and initial value theorem. We 
have shown that stability of the system is analyzed by identifying the locations 
of poles of the system transfer function. We have translated the stability 
criteria from the S domain to the Z domain. When the poles are inside the 
unit circle in the Z domain, the system is stable and its impulse response, that 
is, time domain behavior will be a decaying signal. We say that the output 
is bounded. When the poles are outside the unit circle in the Z domain, the 
system is unstable and its impulse response, that is, time domain behavior 
will be an exponentially increasing function becoming infinite as the sample 
number (n) tends to infinity. We say that the output is unbounded.
• 
We have discussed three methods for inverse Z transformation: power series 
method, partial fraction expansion (PFE) method and residue method. 
Using long division, we divide the numerator polynomial by a denominator 
polynomial to obtain a power series in Z–1 or Z depending on whether the 
series to be recovered is a right-handed sequence (causal) or a left-handed 
sequence (non-causal). The PFE method is used to decompose a rational 

Z Transform
687
fraction given by X(Z) as a linear combination of ZTs of known sequences. 
We then introduced the residue method. This method evaluates the residues 
of the function at poles that are inside the closed contour in the ROC. The 
sum of these residues gives the IZT of the function in the Z domain. The 
method is based on the theorem called as Cauchy’s integral theorem.
• 
We considered one of the important applications of Z transform, namely, 
the solution of the difference equations. The approach involves calculation 
of the ZT of the shifted sequences with appropriate initial conditions and 
then solving for the ZT of the sequence f [n]. We have introduced the use 
of MATLAB programs to plot poles and zeros of the transfer function. It is 
also indicated that we can write a program to plot the frequency response 
and the impulse response of the system for the number of examples of the 
transfer functions. Lastly, we indicated different applications of Z transform 
to be discussed in further chapters.

The theory of signals and systems is applied for the processing of signals like 
speech signal, RADAR signal, SONAR signal, earth quake signal, ECG and 
EEG signals. All these signals are naturally occurring signals and hence have 
some random component. The primary goal of this chapter is to introduce 
the principles of random signals and processes for in-depth understanding 
of the processing methods. We will introduce the concept of probability and 
will discuss different standard distribution functions used for the analysis 
of random signals. Different operations on the random variables namely 
expectation, variance and moments will be introduced. We will then discuss 
central limit theorem. The classification of random processes namely wide 
sense stationary, ergodic and strict sense stationary processes will be defined. 
  9.1 Probability
Consider the experiment of throwing a dice. The result of the throw is random 
in nature in the sense that we do not know the result i.e., the outcome of the 
experiment until the outcome is actually available. The randomness in the 

Signals and Systems
694
outcome is lost once the outcome is evident. The result of the experiment 
is either a 1dot, 2dots, 3dots and so on. The outcome is a discrete random 
variable. Here, there are only 6 possibilities and so one can easily find the 
probability of getting 1 dot is 1/6 evaluated as one of total possible outcomes. 
If the experiment is performed a large number of times, the ratio of frequency 
of occurrence of a 1dot and the total number of times the experiment is 
performed approaches 1/6 (Refer to  Eq. (9.1)). 
We will first define the term event. When any experiment is performed to 
generate some output, it is called as an event. The output obtained is called as 
the outcome of the experiment. The possible set of outcomes of the experiment 
is called as a space or as event space or sample space. Many times, there is the 
uncertainty or randomness involved in the outcome of the experiment. The 
term probability is closely related to uncertainty. In case of the experiment of 
throwing of a die, the uncertainty is involved in the outcome. When a die is 
thrown, we do not know what will be the outcome. Using the notion we may 
define a relative frequency of occurrence of some event. Consider the example 
of a fair coin. Let it be tossed n times. Let nH times Head appear. The relative 
frequency of occurrence of Head is defined as 
relative frequency of occurence 
H
number of favorable outcomes
total number of times the die is thrown
n
n
=
=
 (9.1)
The relative frequency approaches a fixed value called probability when n 
tends to infinity. We define probability as
H

n
→∞
=
 
(9.2)
Using the definition of probability as a frequency of occurrence, we can easily 
conclude that the probability P is always less than one. When P = 1, the event 
becomes a certain event. A certain event is not a random event. 
Let us consider the example of event. When a die is thrown, let us assume 
that the number ‘1’ comes up. This is an event. This experiment spans a discrete 
random space as the output of the experiment is discrete, and the total number 
of outcomes is finite, equal to 6. Discrete random spaces are easier to deal with 
as the events are countable. Continuous sample spaces are generated when the 
outcomes of the experiment are real numbers. An example is the acquisition 
of speech samples, measurement of temperature, etc. 
To understand the concept of relative frequency, we will consider one 
example. 
Example 9.1 
Let there be 100 resistors in a box, all of same size and shape. There are 20 
resistors of value 10Ω, 30 resistors of value 22Ω, 30 resistors of value 33Ω and

Example 9.2 
If a single (fair) die is rolled, determine the probability of each of the following 
event.
a. Obtaining the number 3
b. Obtaining a number greater than 4
c. Obtaining a number less than 3 and obtaining a number greater than or 
equal to 2
Solution 
a. Obtaining the number 3
Since the die we are using is fair, each number has an equal probability of 
occurring; therefore,
P(3)=1/6
b. Obtaining a number greater than 4
In this case, the set of possible outcomes is given by (5, 6) Note that these 
are all mutually exclusive events. Therefore,

Conditional probability
In case of random experiments, sometimes the probability of occurrence of 
one event may depend on other event. The probability of occurrence of such 
an event is termed as the conditional probability. Consider one example. Let a 
card be drawn from a pack of cards. Let the card drawn be the heart card. Let 
us now define other event of drawing the second card if the first card drawn 
is a heart card. The probability of occurrence of second event depends on the 
first event i.e., if the first card drawn is heart card, the probability of second 
event is 12/51. This is because when the first card drawn is the heart card, 
the number of heart cards remaining in the pack of cards is 12 and the total 
number of cards remaining in a pack of cards is 51 as the card drawn in the 
first draw is not replaced. If the first card drawn is not a heart card, then the 
probability of drawing the second card as heart card is 13/51.
We define the conditional probability as follows. The probability of 
occurrence of an event A given that event B has occurred is called as conditional 
probability and is given by

a. What is the probability that the equivalent resistance of this network will 
be 390Ω?
b. What is the probability that the equivalent resistance will be greater than 
390Ω?
c. What is the probability that the equivalent resistance will be less than
1000Ω?
Solution

(900+100||300), (900+300||100)}
a. The probability P(A) of getting equivalent resistance of 390Ω can be found 
by tracking the combinations that give 390Ω. They are 300+100||900 and 
300+900||100.

P(B) = 1/3

terminated.  If the outcome is even, the die is tossed a second time.  Find the 
probability of 
a. Throwing a sum of 7
b. Throwing a sum of 2
Solution 
Let us find the sample space for the experiment as follows
S={(2,1), (2,2),(2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6),  
(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)}. Note that if the first die has outcome of 1, 
3 or 5 experiment will be terminated.
Let A be the event ‘throwing a sum of 7’. The possible combinations are 
(4,3), (2,5), (6,1)
P(A) = 3/18 = 1/6 
(9.25)
Let B be the event ‘throwing a sum of 2’ here, only possibility is (1,1), but it 
is to be discarded as when the first die gives odd output, the experiment is 
terminated.
P(B) = 0/18 = 0

Bayes theorem
Bayes theorem is also called as the theorem of inverse probability. Consider 
one example.
Example 9.12

A – Picking up a diamond card
B – Picking up a spade card
C – Picking up a club card
D – Picking up a heart card
E – Picking up a king.

Signals and Systems

Events A, B, C and D are mutually exclusive. i.e., their sample space is 
exclusively different and there is no overlapping. Consider the events A and E, 
they are not mutually exclusive. There is some overlapping space between the 
two events. The events spaces are drawn in Fig. 9.3.
Fig. 9.3 Sample spaces for the events
We try to find the inverse probability namely, if the king is drawn, what is the 
probability that it is the diamond card? We are now interested in P(A/E).
Solution 
P(A/E) is the probability of picking a diamond card given that it is a king. 
Let us find P(A/E).

Alternative statement of Bayes theorem 
Bayes theorem has application in finding the class membership value based 
on the value of selected feature. Let us consider a problem of class selection 
based on a single feature, for example, ‘x’. Let P(x) denote the probability 
distribution of x in entire population. Let P(C) denote the probability that the 
sample belongs to class C. P(x/C) is a conditional probability for feature value 
x given that a sample comes from class C. The goal of the experiment is to find 
the inverse probability namely probability that a sample belongs to class C 
given that the feature value is x i.e., P(C/x).

Consider a binary symmetric channel with a priori probabilities P(B1) = 0.6, 
P(B2) = 0.4. A priori probabilities indicate the probability of transmission of 
symbols 0 and 1 before the experiment is performed i.e., before transmission 
takes place. The conditional probabilities are given by P(A1 / B1) = 0.9; P(A2
/ B1) = 0.1 and P(A2 / B2) = 0.1; P(A2 / B2) = 0.9. Find the received symbol 
probabilities. Find the transmission probabilities for correct transmission and 
transmission with error.
[Note Conditional probabilities are the same for symmetrical links. Hence, 
it is termed as symmetric channel.] [A1 and A2 stand for received symbols and 
B1 and B2 indicate transmitted symbols, respectively, as shown in Fig. 9.5.]

The received symbol probabilities can be calculated as 
P(A1) = P(A1 / B1) × P(B1) + P(A1 / B2) × P(B2)

  9.2 Random Variable
We have considered the examples of random experiments like tossing of a 
coin, throwing a die, etc. The outcome of these experiments was random in 
the sense that the outcome cannot be predicted. The sample space spanned 
by the outcomes is also known. These are called as discrete random outcomes 
with sample space consisting of only finite values. A random variable can be 

Random Signals and Processes
707
defined as the characterization of the outcome of the random experiment that 
will associate a numerical value with each outcome. Consider the example of 
throwing a die. Let us denote the random variable associated with the outcome 
of the experiment as ‘X’. The range of ‘X’ is from 1 to 6. Every time when a die 
is thrown, a value corresponding to the number on the face is associated with 
the outcome. If number ‘1’ appears, ‘X’ = 1. If the random variable takes on 
only discrete values, the random variable is called a discrete random variable. 
On the other hand, if the random variable takes on real values, it is called as 
continuous random variable. Here, the range of random variable is infinite. 
  9.2.1 Cumulative distribution function (CDF)
Let us now define the concept of distribution function. Cumulative distribution 
function called as CDF is defined as the probability that the random variable 
‘X’ takes a value less than or equal to some allowed value ‘x’. The value is 
allowed if it belongs to a sample space. CDF is defined by the equation

(9.43)
Example 9.17 
Consider a fair die. Plot a CDF verses ‘x’.
Solution 
We are considering a fair die. This indicates that the probability of getting any 
value on the face is equally likely. There are 6 possible outcomes. Hence, the 
probability of getting each face is 1/6 as total probability is 1. We will now find 
the CDF for each value of ‘x’.

The above properties can be easily verified by the reader. The first property 
holds good because Fx(x) is a probability. The second and third properties also 
follow from the concept of probability. For a certain event i.e., the face value 
of a die if less than or equal to 6 is one and probability for no face value is zero. 
The fourth property holds because the probability is a positive value. The fifth 
property says that for a discrete random variable, the probability of getting a 
specific value is finite. We will see that for a continuous random variable, the 
probability of getting a specific value is zero. The sixth property indicates that 
the events 
and

Example 9.18 
Consider a pair of dice. Find the probability of getting the sum of the faces as 
less than 6. Also find the probability for getting sum of faces equal to 10.
Solution 
We understand that the probability of getting any particular combination 
of faces is 1/6*1/6 = 1/36. The possible outcomes can be listed, as shown in  
Table 9.1.

Total outcomes are 36. To find the probability of getting the sum of faces as 
less than 6, we have to count such combinations for which the sum of faces is 
less than or equal to 6. It can be verified that such a probability is 15/36. 
To find the probability for getting sum of faces equal to 10. Let us list such 
combinations: (5,5), (6,4), (4,6). The probability is 3/36.  
Example 9.19 
Consider 2 unfair dice. The probability of the first die of getting a face value of 
2 is 2/7 and the probability of the other die of getting a face value 3 is 2/7. Find 
the probability of getting a sum of 6 for two faces.
Solution 
To get a sum of 6, we have the following combinations.
(1,5), (5,1), (2,4), (4,2), (3,3). Let us find the probability.

The nature of pdf drawn can be explained as follows. Referring to Fig. 9.4, 
we see that the value of the derivative at x = –10 is 1/6. The slope of the CDF 
graph is zero for values of x from –10 to –5 and for values of x from 5 to 10.

The pdf being a probability must be a non-negative quantity. If we integrate 
the pdf between some limits, it gives the probability for the variable to be 
between the limits specified. The integration of pdf over the entire range is 
nothing but the probability of a certain event. Hence, it is equal to one. 
Example 9.22 
Given the pdf for different x values as follows. x = 1, pdf = 0.2, x = 2, 
pdf = 0.1,  x = 3, pdf = 0.3, x =4, pdf = 0.3, x = 5, pdf = 0.1. Draw the pdf and 
its corresponding CDF.
Solution 
Let us first draw the pdf, as shown in Fig. 9.10.
Fig. 9.10 Plot of pdf for Example 9.22 
 
To draw the CDF, we have to integrate the pdf. CDF is shown in Fig. 9.11.
 
Note that we have to add the probability values at each step. At 1, there 
is a step of 0.2. Then it remains constant until 2. At 2, it has a step of 0.1 and it 
reaches 0.3. It remains constant until 3. At 3, it has a step of 0.3 and it reaches 
0.6. It remains constant until 4. At 4, it has a step of 0.3 and it reaches 0.9. It 
remains constant until 5. At 5, it has a step of 0.1 and it reaches 1.0. The total 
value of probability must reach 1.

  9.3 Statistical Properties of Random Variables
When we analyze any random variable for example speech samples, we have 
only finite data values available with us. Based on these finite samples, the 
statistical properties are predicted or estimated. The actual data may exist over 
infinite interval. We cannot process the infinite samples due to limitations 
of processing capacity of a computer. It is possible to estimate the statistical 
properties from finite samples. The method of fitting a standard pdf for 
unknown signal namely Chi square test and K–S test will be discussed in 
section 9.5. Let us define important statistical properties and discuss the 
method for prediction of these properties. The statistical properties are mean, 
variance, moments, centre moments, etc. We will start with the mean or the 
expected value.
1. Mean or Expected value The mean or expected value for a continuous 
random variable is defined as 
[ ]

In case of a discrete random variable, mean is defined as 
i

µ =

(9.57)
 
The mean of a random variable may not belong to a sample space. To 
find the value of mean for a continuous random variable, there are two 
hurdles. First one is that the signal is not available over infinite duration 
and secondly, the pdf for a random variable is not known. We fit the pdf 
for an unknown signal and try to find the mean using the mathematical 
expression for that standard pdf in the equation for mean. The mean is also 
termed as expected value.

Random Signals and Processes
717
 
 There are number of standard distribution functions defined for which 
mathematical expression for pdfs are available. Some of the standard 
distributions are uniform distribution, Gaussian distribution, Rician 
distribution, Rayleigh distribution, exponential distribution, etc. We will 
indicate how to make use of such standard distribution pdfs for unknown 
random variable in the next section.

The mean is the first order moment. This can be seen by comparing 
Eqs (9.56) and (9.58). For the definition of mean n = 1. When n = 2, we 
obtain the mean square value of the variable given by

Standard Deviation The symbol σ represents the standard deviation of 
the random variable. 
 
Skew The third order centre moment is a measure of asymmetry of the 
density function about the mean. Skewness can be considered is a measure 
of symmetry, or in fact the lack of symmetry. A distribution is said to be 
symmetric if it looks identical to the left and to the right of the center point. 
The skewness of the normal distribution is zero.
It is called as the skew of the density function. It is given by

Kurtosis Kurtosis is a measured relative to a normal distribution. It 
measures if the data are peaked or flat relative to a normal distribution. 
If the value of Kurtosis is high, data sets tend to have a distinct peak near 
the mean, it is found to decline rapidly, and it will have heavy tails. On 
the other hand, the data sets with low kurtosis will have a flat top near the 
mean. A uniform distribution is thus the extreme case of low Kurtosis. 
 
 Kurtosis is defined as the ratio of fourth order centre moment and fourth 
power of standard deviation.

distribution and negative kurtosis will indicate a “flat” distribution.

  9.4 Standard Distribution Functions
There are standard distribution functions defined for continuous random 
variables namely uniform probability distribution, Gaussian distribution, 
Rayleigh distribution and Exponential distribution. Discrete random variables 
use Poison distribution and binomial distribution. We will first describe 
standard distribution functions for continuous random variables.

The Gaussian pdf is completely specified by σ and μ.
 
 It is found that many physical situations are found to follow the 
Gaussian distribution function. As the mean value increases, the entire 
curve for Gaussian distribution function shifts towards right. If the 
variance increases, the curve becomes wider. To find the probability that 
the random variable lies between –∞ and some fixed value, we have to 
integrate the square function that is a computationally involved task. To 
help the user in this regard, the tables are available to read the integral 
value. If the mean and a variance changes, the integration values in the 
table will change. The problem can be simplified if only a single table is 
prepared for mean value of zero and variance of one. The random variable 
can be normalized to get a mean value of zero and variance of one. Let us 
illustrate the procedure for normalization.
 
 The function (
)/
x
µ
σ

 can be replaced by another variable y as
(
)/

σ
=

. After replacing the function by a normalized random 
variable, we obtain the CDF for a normalized random variable y as

Now, the table can be listed for the normalized random variable to find 
the integral value. We can then find the value for the actual variable x by 
putting the obtained value for y. The probability distribution function 
listed in Eq. (9.48) is called as the normal distribution function.
 
 A MATLAB program to plot Gaussian pdf is shown below. 
clear all;
sigma=2;
mean=0;
x=(-5:0.1:5);
a=(x-mean).*(x-mean);
y=(1/(sigma*sqrt(2*pi)))*exp(-(((x-mean).*
(x-mean))/(2*sigma^2)));
plot(x,y);xlabel(‘x’);ylabel(‘pdf’);
title(‘Gaussian pdf’);
 
A Gaussian pdf is plotted in Fig. 9.16. If the variance sigma increases, the 
width of the curve increases, as shown in Fig. 9.17. If the mean is positive 
and it increases, the curve shifts towards right. If mean is negative and it 
increases, the curve shifts towards left, as shown in Fig. 9.18.

the example of a rifle aimed at a target. Let the distance of the target be 
r given by

r
x
y
=
+
. Let x and y represent the x and y coordinates 
of the distance. If x and y are statistically independent random variables 
that are Gaussian-distributed with zero mean and unit variance, then 
the pdf of r is said to be Rayleigh-distributed. A second example of the 
Rayleigh distribution arises in case of random complex numbers with real 
and imaginary components denoted by x and y. If the real and imaginary 
components are statistically independent Gaussian random variables with 
identical mean, then the absolute value of the complex number is Rayleigh-
distributed.
 
 A MATLAB program to plot a Rayleigh density function for a particular 
value of b is given below. RAYLPDF defines a Rayleigh probability 
density function in MATLAB. Y = RAYLPDF(X, B) returns the Rayleigh 
probability density function with parameter B at the values in X.

Probability distribution functions for discrete variables
We will discuss the standard distribution functions for discrete random 
variables. Before going through the details of distribution function, we will 
introduce the terms like permutation, Bernoulli’s trials, etc.
Permutations To understand this term, we will consider one simple 
example of a pack of cards. Let us assume we have 4 successive draws. After 
every draws, the card drawn is not replaced. In this case, the sample space 
reduces after each draw. It becomes 51, 50 and 49 after the first, second and 
third draw, respectively. Here, the sequence in which the cards are drawn is 
important. Consider that there are n elements in the pack and there are n 
possible outcomes on first draw. (n – 1) possible outcomes from second draw, 
(n – 2) outcomes on third draw, etc. if r elements are drawn, the number of 
possible sequences or outcomes is n(n – 1)(n – 2)….(n – r).
We can write the possible outcomes for r draws as

This number is called as number of permutations of r elements taken from n 
elements when order of sequence of draw is important.
Combinations Let us now define combinations. When the order of sequence 
of draw is not important, we get a possible number of combinations. In this 
case the number is less than the permutations because different ordering of 
same elements is counted as one combination. The number of permutations 
reduced is equal to the number of permutations of r things taken from r 
elements i.e., r!. Hence, the total number of combinations of r things taken 
from n things denoted as n

 can be written as

Bernoulli’s trials Consider an experiment wherein there are only two 
possible outcomes for every trial. For example, the experiment of tossing a 
coin wherein there are two possible outcomes namely getting ‘Head’ or getting 
‘Tail’. If we denote the probability of getting one outcomes as P, then the 
probability of getting the other outcome is exactly 1 – P. If the experiment 
is repeated a number of times, it is called as Bernoulli’s trials. When the 
experiment is repeated N times, we ask a question, what is a probability of 
getting ‘Head’ exactly k times? Let us calculate this probability. We will first 
find the Binomial coefficient indicating the number of times (k) we get the 
first outcome out of N number of trials. It is exactly the number of possible 
sequences that result in same output. It is given by

Find the probability that the first white ball is drawn on the third draw.
Solution
The events are independent, since the ball is replaced in the box and thus 
the sample space does not change. Let B denote drawing a black ball and W 
drawing a white ball. The total number of balls in the sample space is 25. We 
will find the probability that the first white ball is drawn on third draw. Hence,

  9.4.3 Functions for finding moments
There are two functions defined that allow the calculation of moments. They 
are called as characteristic function and moment generating function. Let us 
understand the characteristic function first.

The Eq. (9.66) can be easily recognized as the Fourier Transform (FT) of 
(fx(x)) with the sign of ω reversed. Hence, the pdf (fx(x)) can be obtained from 
the characteristic function by taking inverse FT. We have to reverse the sign 
of variable x. The advantage of using a characteristic function is that the nth
moments can be easily obtained from the characteristic function given by

The density function of Y is the M–1 fold convolution of M density function. 
The distribution function of Y can be found by integrating the density function. 
Central Limit Theorem The theorem states that probability distribution 
function of sum of a large number of random variables approaches a Gaussian 
distribution. The theorem does not guarantee that the density function 
will always be Gaussian. Under certain conditions, the density function 
is also Gaussian. Let the mean values of M random variables be defined as

The theorem is found to hold good for special cases of dependent variables as well.
Computer generation of a Gaussian-distributed random variable. Many 
times there is a need to simulate a system for estimating the performance 
before its actual implementation. The simulation of a system usually requires 
the simulation of a random variable having a Gaussian distribution. A function 
like rand is available with MATLAB for the generation of a random variable 
with uniform distribution.
Let us take some 10 uniformly distributed random variables. We will use 
the addition of these variables and plot their density function. It can be shown 
to be a Gaussian density function to a good approximation using Central limit 
theorem. Let us write a MATLAB program to generate a Gaussian variable 
as the sum of 12 uniformly distributed random variables. Figure 9.28 shows 
the Histogram plot of the generated variable. We can easily verify that the 
envelope of the histogram approaches Gaussian pdf.

Let us try to understand the meaning of the histogram. We have used 12 
random variables with uniform distribution between 1 and 100. These are 
generated using a rand function. The generated values of random variable are 
divided into, for example, 10 bins one from 1 to 10, the other from 11 to 20, 
and so on. Now, the number of random variables lying in the range 1 to 10 
is counted, 11 to 20 are counted and so on. The histogram plots this count 
on y axis and the bin value is plotted on x axis. If we increase the number 
of random variables to 1000, the histogram plot will further approach the 
Gaussian distribution.

When a histogram is drawn, the data values are divided into bins. The 
frequency of occurrence of the data in the bin interval is computed and plotted 
against the bin. To find the test statistic, we find the squared distance between 
the two frequency values, namely observed frequency and frequency as per the 
required distribution. We will illustrate the procedure with a simple example 
of a uniform distribution. 
Example 9.35 
The experiment is conducted with a fair die. The die is tossed 120 times, for 
example. The following data are obtained, as shown in the table below. Find 
the test statistic to check if it obeys a uniform distribution.

frequency for each face is 20. Let us find the test statistic.

This value of test statistic is less than the 5 percent level equal to 120*0.05 = 6. 
Hence, the distribution is uniform. 
The Kolmogoroff–Smirnoff test This test is used when the set of 
observations is from a continuous distribution. It detects the deviation from a 
specified distribution. Given a set of observations, we determine the following 
statistic.

Where, G(x) is a sample distribution and F(x) is a standard distribution against 
which the sample distribution is compared. If the value of D is less than the 
critical value specified in K–S table, then the hypothesis that an unknown 
distribution is a known standard distribution is accepted. 
 
Usually the signal of unknown distribution is to be analyzed. When the 
pdf of the random signal is not known, the mean and variance, etc. cannot 
be calculated as it requires the mathematical expression of pdf. To solve this 
problem, the unknown signal is used to find its histogram and is compared 
with the standard known density functions discussed above. The extent to 
which the match occurs between unknown density/distribution and known 
density/distribution is evaluated as discussed using Chi-square test or K–S 
test. If the hypothesis for the known distribution can be accepted, then the 
mathematical expressions for the known density/distribution are used for the 
computation of signal statistical properties.

  9.6 Random Processes
We now extend the concept of random variable to include time. A random 
variable is a function of the outcomes of the random experiment called as 
ensemble. If we allow the random variable to be a function of time denoted by 
X(s, t), then a family of such functions is called a random process. Figure 9.18 
shows a random process. If the value of s is fixed, we get a random variable that 
is a function of time. If the value of t is fixed, we get a random variable that is 
a function of s i.e., an ensemble function. Consider an example of temperature 
measurement using a number of transducers. If we measure the value of 
temperature for different transducers at the same time t, we get the random 
variable called an ensemble function. The mean value of this random variable 
is called as ensemble average. If we measure the value of temperature using the 
same transducer at a different time, we get a random variable that is a function 
of time. The mean value of this random variable is called as time average. If we 
can predict the future values of any sample function from its past values, we 
call it as a deterministic process. If the future values of a sample function scan 
not be predicted, then it is called as non-deterministic process. 
Stationary and Non-stationary process We can also classify the random 
processes as stationary or non-stationary random processes. If all the 
statistical properties namely the mean, moments and variance, etc. for the 

Random Signals and Processes
745
random variables of the random process are constant with respect to time, the 
process is said to be a stationary random process. The two processes are said 
to be statistically independent if random variable groups of one process are 
independent of random variable groups of other process. We define different 
levels of stationarity for a process namely first order stationarity and second 
order stationarity.  
Stationary processes We will define first order stationary process. A random 
process is said to stationary to order one if its density function does not shift 
with the shift in time origin and the mean value is constant.

A random process is said to be stationary to order two if its second order 
density function is invariant to a time difference and if its autocorrelation 
function is a function of time difference and not the absolute time.

If we put 
1t
δ = −, we can conclude that the second order density function is a 
function of time difference.  
A random process is said to be wide sense stationary if the two conditions 
are met. First is if the mean is constant and second is if the auto-correlation of 
a process is a function of the time difference.  
Nth order or Strict sense stationary process A random process is stationary 
to order N if its nth order density function is invariant to a time origin shift. 
Stationarity of order N implies stationarity to all orders < N. A process 
stationary to all orders is called as a strict sense stationary process. Figure 9.29 
shows a continuous random process.

The second term in the equation integrates to zero. We find that the 
autocorrelation is a function of time difference, and the mean value is constant. 
These two conditions confirm that the process is a wide sense stationary 
process. 
Ergodic process The process is said to be an ergodic process if the time 
average is equal to the ensemble average and the time average autocorrelation is 
equal to the ensemble autocorrelation.  Equation (9.78) specifies the ensemble 
autocorrelation. The condition of ergodicity requires that

Ergodicity is a restrictive form of stationarity. It is normally very difficult to 
prove that the given process is ergodic. For simplicity, we assume the given 

Random Signals and Processes
747
process to be ergodic so that we can find the ensemble average from the time 
average. We can find the ensemble autocorrelation from the time average 
autocorrelation. The computations are simplified. The argument may be made 
that due to the assumption of ergodicity, our analysis is on shaky grounds. The 
fact is that the theory only suggests a model for real situation. The problem is 
that it is solved as an approximation problem. Hence, it makes no difference if 
we assume additionally that the process is ergodic.

  9.7 Estimation of ESD and PSD
The section 2.6.5 has introduced the classification of signals as energy signals 
and power signals. The need for estimation of spectrum will be emphasized. 
We will define energy spectrum density (ESD) and power spectrum density 
(PSD) and the method for spectrum estimation such as periodogram method 
will be discussed. 
We discuss the estimation of energy spectrum and power spectrum in this 
section. The naturally occurring signals are random in nature. We can not 
predict the next sample from the previous samples using any mathematical 
model. The naturally occurring signals are of infinite duration and we have 
only finite duration signal available with us. Based on the finite duration signal, 
we try to predict the characteristics of the signal such as mean, variance, etc.
  9.7.1 Computation of energy density spectrum of deterministic signal
Consider a deterministic signal that has finite energy and zero average power. 
This signal is then termed as an energy signal. We will estimate the energy 
density spectrum of energy signal. Let us consider x(t) as a finite duration 
signal available with us. The problem is to estimate the true spectrum from a 
finite duration record. If x(t) is a finite energy signal, its energy E is finite and 
is given by

Fourier transform of autocorrelation function.

We can now list two different methods for computing energy density spectrum, 
namely direct method and indirect method.

Direct method In the direct method, one computes the FT of the sequence 
x(n) and then calculates the energy density spectrum as

There is a practical difficulty involved in the computation of energy density 
spectrum using Eqs (9.127) and (9.128). The sequence is available only for 
finite duration. Using a finite sequence is equivalent to the multiplication of 
the sequence by a rectangular window. This will result in spectral leakage due 
to Gibbs phenomenon, as discussed in chapter 5. 
Autocorrelation indicates the similarity between the same signal and its 
time-shifted version. We will list below the properties of autocorrelation.

Example 9.39
Find cross-correlation of x[n] = {1, 2, 1} and y[n] = {1, 4, 6, 4, 1}.
Solution
We have to skip the first step of convolution i.e., taking time reversal.
We will start from step 2. We will take a sample-by-sample product.
Z[0] = {1 + 8 + 6 = 15},
Now we will shift x[n] towards the right by one sample and again take a 
sample-by-sample product.
Z[1] = {4 + 12 + 4 = 20}, 
We will shift x[n] towards the right again by one sample and take a sample-
by-sample product.
Z[2] = {6 + 8 + 1 = 15}, Z[3] = [4 + 2 = 6], Z[4] = [1]
We will now shift x[n] towards the left by one sample and take a sample-by-
sample product.
Z[–1] = [4 + 2 = 6], Z[–2] = [1], total 7 values are non-zero.
Z[n] = {1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1}.

Correlgram
We will now define the correlogram. Correlogram is a plot of one signal 
against another signal. It tells us about the similarity between the two signals. 

Signals and Systems
754
If it is a straight line graph, two signals are highly correlated. If the slope of the 
graph is positive, they are positively correlated. If the slope is negative, they 
are negatively correlated. If the graph is random, the signals are not correlated 
at all.

Solution
We will find the values of the functions from 0 to 2pi radians and plot one 
function against other using a MATLAB program given below. We can also 
do it using hand calculations.

 9.7.2 Estimation of power density spectrum of random signal
A class of signals called as stationary random signals are of infinite duration 
and have infinite energy. The average power is however finite. Such signals are 
classified as power signals. We need to estimate the power density spectrum 
for such signals. For a random process, the autocorrelation is given by

(9.149)
Where E denotes expected value. This can not be calculated if the probability 
density function (pdf) is not known. For a random process we do not know 
pdf. We need to only estimate the value of autocorrelation as 
1. We have only finite duration record.
2. pdf is not known.
We assume that the process is wide sense stationary and is ergodic. We calculate 
time average autocorrelation, as it is the same as an ensemble autocorrelation 
in case of an ergodic process. Hence, we calculate

There are two approaches for the computation of power density spectrum 
namely a direct method, as given by Eq. (9.127), or an indirect method by first 
calculating the autocorrelation and then finding FT of it to get power density 
spectrum. 
In practice, we have only finite samples of the DT signals. The time average 
autocorrelation is computed using the equation

The normalization factor results in a mean value of autocorrelation computed

Equation 9.154 represents the well-known form of the power density 
spectrum estimate and is called as periodogram. To find the pdf, one draws 
the histogram for a signal with finite duration and uses curve fitting tests such 
as Chi-square test or K–S test to fit a standard probability distribution for a 
given signal. The mathematical equation for that standard pdf can now be 
used in the calculations.

Summary
We started with the introduction to probability theory. In this chapter, we have 
described different standard distribution functions and their use for signal 
analysis. The highlights for the chapter are as follows.  
• 
The term event is defined. When the experiment is performed to generate 
some output, it is called as an event. The output of the experiment is called 
as the outcome of the experiment. Probability
lim
H
n
n
n
→∞

 is defined in terms of 
relative frequency. The conditional probability is given by 
(
)
(
/ )
( )
P A
B
P A B
P B
∩
=
. 
Bayes theorem is introduced, which is the theorem of inverse probability.  
• 
A random variable is defined. A random variable can be defined as the 
characterization of the outcome of the random experiment that will associate 
a numerical value with each outcome. Cumulative distribution function 
called as CDF is defined as the probability that the random variable ‘X’ takes 
a value less than or equal to some allowed value ‘x’. The probability Density 
Function is defined as the derivative of the CDF. The properties of CDF and 
pdf are listed. 
• 
The statistical properties of random variables are discussed. The statistical 
properties include mean, variance, skew, Kurtosis and higher order moments. 
All these properties are defined. The standard distribution functions are 
described for continuous and discrete random variables. Uniform, Gaussian, 
Rayleigh and exponential distributions are discussed for continuous random 
variables. Permutation and combination is defined. Bernoulli’s trials are 
described. The Binomial and Poisson distribution are discussed for discrete 
random variables. Functions for finding the moments are described. These 
are characteristic function and moment generating function. 
• 
Central limit theorem is defined. The theorem states that probability 
distribution function of a sum of a large number of random variables 
approaches a Gaussian distribution. Use of histogram to find the density 
function of the unknown signal is explained. The Chi-square test is called 
as Goodness of Fit test. To perform the test, the test statistic is calculated. 
The Kolmogoroff–Smirnoff test is used when the set of observations is from a 
continuous distribution. It detects the deviation form a specified distribution. 
When the unknown signal is to be analyzed, it is used to find the histogram 
and is compared with the standard known density functions discussed. The 
extent to which the match occurs between unknown density/distribution 
and known density/distribution is evaluated using Chi-square test or K–S 
test. If the hypothesis for the known distribution can be accepted, then the 
mathematical expressions for the known density/distribution are used for the 
computation of signal statistical properties.

A random variable is a function of the outcomes of the random experiment 
called as ensemble. If we allow the random variable to be a function of time 
too denoted by X(s, t), then a family of such functions is called a random 
process. The classification of the random process such as deterministic/non-
deterministic, stationary/non-stationary is described. A random process 
is said to be wide sense stationary if the mean is constant and the auto-
correlation of a process is a function of time difference. The process is said to 
be an ergodic process if the time average is equal to the ensemble average and 
time average auto-correlation is equal to the ensemble autocorrelation.  
• 
The energy and power signals are defined. The autocorrelation and cross 
correlation for the signals are defined. The relation between autocorrelation 
and energy spectral density is explained. They are FT pairs. Similarly, for 
power signals, autocorrelation and power spectral density are FT pairs. The 
problems in the estimation of ESD and PSD are discussed. Simple examples 
are solved to illustrate the concepts. The correlogram is defined. MATLAB 
programs are written to draw correlograms for signals. If the graph is a 
straight line, the signals are highly correlated. If the graph has some regularity, 
the signals have a relation. If the graph is of a random nature, the signals are 
not correlated. The properties of autocorrelation are listed and proved. The 
properties of ESD and PSD are listed.
