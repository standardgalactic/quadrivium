Foreword
During the past decade there has been a growing demand for an assurance of
quality before a contract is let. This is not an entirely new concept, for quality
has always played an important role in securing new markets as well as retain-
ing those markets that already exist, but without doubt, in these days of com-
petitive world markets, quality assurance has become even more relevant.
To meet this requirement, manufacturers and suppliers have had to recognise
the importance of quality and the fact that it can only be achieved through effi-
cient company organisation and a determination by management to meet the
increased quality requirements of their potential customers.
This concept is not just related to the larger manufacturing companies and
suppliers. It also affects the smaller companies, even those employing only one
or two people. In fact, no matter how large or small the company, there has to
be an increasing reliance on quality and the recommendations of ISO 9000 in
order to meet customers’ requirements. In fact, for anyone wanting to sell their
product in a multi-national European or American market, the ISO 9000 pub-
lications are essential publications. Together they provide a comprehensive set
of rules and regulations, specifications and recommendations that enable a
manufacturer (or supplier), large or small, to set up workable quality processes
and procedures and to operate within their constraints.
Many books have already been written on the topic of Quality Management
and ISO 9000, but most of these appear to automatically assume that the reader
belongs to a large company who already have an established management sys-
tem in place. Small to medium size manufacturing companies and/or service
industries now need to set up similar systems (but on a smaller scale) and show
that they too can work in conformance with ISO 9001:2000.
This book, with its series of examples and audit procedures, attempts to
show how a smaller company can benefit from the requirements of ISO
9001:2000 and in so doing, gain entry into more lucrative markets. Its main
aim is to enable readers, at very little expense, to set up an ISO 9001:2000
compliant Quality Management System for themselves.

But ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses, third edn is not just a book, it also
includes a fully worked, generic Quality Management System that can be cus-
tomised to suit any company – without having to rely on a specialist or a con-
sultant to complete the task for them.
Prior to the reissue of the ISO 9000 series in 2001, the majority of organisa-
tions wrote their Quality Manuals to just show how they met the 20 requirements
of the 1994 standard – clause by clause. Although this made it easier for the
authors of the manual to show the auditors that all of the requirements of 
the standard had been met, quite often (especially for very small businesses), the
manual was of little use to the organisation itself in actually running their business.
ISO 9001:2000 now requires the Quality Manual to ‘include the scope of the
system, any justifications for exclusions, refer to established procedures and
describe the interaction between processes’. A Quality Manual that simply
echoes the requirements of ISO 9001:2000 will, therefore, not be compliant, as
certain sections of the standard’s content may not be applicable to a particular
organisation. It is essential that an organisation’s Quality Manual serves a 
useful purpose and clearly just paraphrasing ISO 9001:2000’s requirements 
or using an ‘off the shelf’ generic Quality Manual to show compliance is 
not the answer unless, it has been suitably customised to suit that particular
organisation.
The prime aim of this book, therefore, is to help small businesses (who prob-
ably will have insufficient time to thoroughly read, understand, extract and
implement all of the requirements of ISO 9001:2000) by providing them with a
fully worked example. For simplicity my generic QMS is based on one particu-
lar type of company (i.e. Stingray – a ‘paper producing’company) and this should
be used as a template to describe the way that your organisation does business
by leaving out those bits that are not particularly relevant and/or amplifying/
writing new policies, processes and procedures to cover the organisation-specific
areas that I have not covered in my book. To be of any real use, this customisa-
tion should be completed on a page by page basis, to suit your own purposes.
Note:To save you having to copy this QMS ‘unlocked’, fully accessible, non .pdf,
soft copies of all of these files (as well as a selection of audit checklists, etc.
from the sister publication ‘ISO 9001: 2000 Audit Procedures’) are available,
on a CD (for a small additional charge) from the author in Word format. See 
p. xviii for further details.
Historically this is the 3rd edition of ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses
and although the requirements of ISO 9001:2000 have not changed since pub-
lication of the 2nd edition in 2000, it was felt that its predecessor (because it
was written during the transitional stage between the 1994 and the 2000 stand-
ards) made far too much mention and comparisons with the old version of this
standard. It also laid insufficient emphasis on the fact that ISO 9001:2000 has
now become the industry accepted standard for international quality.

xiv Foreword

Preface
With the increased demand for quality in everything that we do or make nowa-
days has come the need to have some formalised set of rules to work to. Up
until a few years ago, however, there were no formalised standards for assum-
ing a manufacturer’s (or supplier’s) quality. Quality procedures and guarantees
were therefore required and the Military – as so often happens in these cases –
came to the rescue.
NASA (in their capacity as controlling body for the US Space Program and
with their requirement for the highest level of equipment reliability) were the
first to produce a set of procedures, specifications and requirements. These
become known as Military Specifications (Mil Specs) and manufacturers and
suppliers, regardless of their size, were required to conform to these require-
ments if they wanted to provide equipment for this lucrative military market.
The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), under the American influ-
ence, then produced a series of quality assurance procedures which were
known as the NATO Allied Quality Assurance Publications (AQAPs). These
were republished by the British Ministry of Defence (MOD) as the Defence
Standard (DEF STAN) 05 series of procedures.
Civilian firms and contractors quickly realised the necessity of ensuring that
manufacturers and suppliers should abide to an agreed set of quality standards
and the British Standards Institution (BSI) formally adapted the DEF STAN 05
series into a virtually identical set of documents known as the BS 5750 series.
This standard was then copied by other nations and a common series of rec-
ommendations known as the ISO 9000:1994 series of ‘Standards for Quality
Assurance’ were produced.
Under existing international agreement, all international standards have to
be re-inspected five years after publication. In accordance with this agreement,
the 1994 versions of ISO 9000 series were revised with more emphasis being
placed on the need for customer satisfaction and the use of a more modular,
process approach to quality management. The main change caused by this 
new review process, however, was the amalgamation of the previous (similar)

requirements contained in the ISO 9001:1994, ISO 9002:1994 and ISO
9003:1994 standards into a single ISO 9001:2000 standard.
Note: Although not officially referred to as a requirements standard, ISO
9001:2000 does, nevertheless, contain 141 ‘shalls’ and 2 ‘musts’ as opposed to
4 ‘shoulds’ and 1 ‘could’.
ISO 9001:2000 specifies the national, regional and international accepted
procedures and criteria that are required to ensure that products and services
meet customers’ requirements. It identifies the basic disciplines of a Quality
Management System and can be used by manufacturers, suppliers, service
industries and end users – large or small – with equal effect.
These processes, procedures, disciplines and criteria can be applied to any
firm, no matter its size – whether they employ just a few people or many thou-
sands. It can also be used by companies to set up their own Quality Manage-
ment System and can form the basis for assessing a manufacturer’s Quality
Management System (i.e. to ensure that a supplier or service industry has the
ability to provide satisfactory goods and/or services).
The aim of ISO 9001:2000 is that it:

is flexible enough to fit any sort of organisation (the manufacturing empha-
sis is gone);

no longer consists of 20 isolated elements;

has a new quality process management model;

defines responsibilities and authorities within the process areas;

has a new emphasis on the identification of stakeholders and how the
organisation plans to meet their needs;

includes quality planning (similar to the automotive industries advanced
quality planning shown in QS 9000:1995 ‘Quality system requirements’);

sets a requirement for the regular review of quality objectives;

provides a flexible approach to quality documentation;

provides useful rules for presenting the Quality Manual;

enables an organisation to assure that its infrastructure is sufficient to meet
its quality objectives;

provides a method for continually reviewing the work environment and its
effect on quality;

emphasises the identification and review of customer needs and 
expectations;

needs a formal review of an organisation’s ability to meet customer needs;

emphasises close communications with customers;

includes process capability studies;

includes design control based on project management;

includes expanded validation of design requirements; 
xvi Preface


gives a better definition of the function of purchasing and procurement;

verifies purchased products;

validates the output of processes within an organisation;

replaces service requirements with delivery and post delivery service
requirements;

closely integrates with ISO 10012 ‘Quality Assurance Requirements for
Measuring Equipment’ concerning the use of measurement and inspection
equipment;

needs process measurements and process audits;

documents how a product is measured and evaluated using a Quality
(Control) Plan;

includes the requirement for regular revalidation of products or services to
ensure that they continue to meet customer expectations;

requires a formal system of measuring customer satisfaction;

gives a more aggressive definition of corrective and preventive action;

requires a formal policy on continuous improvement;

is in line with other management systems.

Part One
The Background to
ISO 9000
In Part One, the necessity and the interoperability of quality standards
is discussed, the historical background of ISO 9000 is presented and
the basic requirements of ISO 9001:2000 are explained. The UK
Government’s support of Quality Management Systems is also briefly
examined.

ISO 9000
1.1 ISO 9000
Wherever you go nowadays, it seems that you are always hearing the word
‘quality’ especially in relation to the requirements of ‘ISO 9000’, but even
though these have become everyday words, they are often misused, misquoted
and misunderstood. But why is this? Well, normally you will find that when
most people talk about the quality of an object, they are talking about its excel-
lence, perfection and/or value. In reality, of course, they should be talking
about how much it meets its designed purpose and comes up to the manufac-
turer’s or supplier’s original specifications. Referring to the quality of a single
article is, of course, fairly simple. Problems occur, however, when one has to
talk about complex systems. Then it can become very difficult indeed to assess
a level of quality.
Quality
“The degree to which a set of
inherent characteristics fulfils
requirements”.
Figure 1.1 The accepted definition of quality

So what exactly is meant by the word quality? There are many definitions
but the most commonly accepted definition of quality is ‘the degree to which a
set of inherent characteristics fulfills requirements’. (ISO DIS 9000:2000).
But customers are not just interested in the level of quality ‘intended’ by the
manufacturer or supplier, they are far more interested in the maintenance of
quality level and want an assurance that the product (i.e. hardware, software,
service or processed material) that they are buying truly meets the quality stan-
dard that they were initially offered and/or recommended.
This customer requirement has, quite naturally, had a sort of knock-on effect
which has meant that manufacturers and suppliers (especially in the larger
companies) have now had to pay far more attention to the quality of their product
than was previously necessary. Organisations have had to set up proper Quality
Management Systems in order to control and monitor all stages of the produc-
tion process and they have had to provide proof to the potential customer that
their product has the guaranteed – and in some cases certified – quality
required by the customer. In other words, the manufacturer or supplier has had

Unfortunately, with the current trend towards microminiaturisation and nano-
technology, most modern day products have become extremely complex assem-
blies of components compared to those which were available a few years ago.
This has meant that many more people are now involved in the manufacture
and/or supply of a relatively simple object and this has increased the likelihood
of a production fault occurring.
In much the same way, the responsibility for the quality of a product or serv-
ice has also been spread over an increasing amount of people which has meant
that the manufacturer’s and/or supplier’s guarantee of quality has, unfortunately,
become less precise.
With the 2004 expansion of the European Union (EU), there is now a poten-
tial marketplace of some 450–500 million people. In North America the 
potential is very similar and selling to these markets has, therefore, become an
extremely competitive business and (in order to gain a foothold in these mar-
kets) it has meant an increased reliance on internationally recognised quality
procedures and recommendations. This is, of course, an area where ISO
9001:2000 has proved its worth.

Standards, of course, are as international as the markets they serve and 
currently the main producers of national standards in Western Europe are:

United Kingdom – British Standards Institution (BSI);

Germany – Deutsch Institut fur Normung e.v. (DIN);

France – Association Français de Normalisation (AFNOR).
Outside Europe the most widely used standards come from:

America – American National Standards Institute (ANSI);

Canada – Canadian Standards Association (CSA).
There are, of course, others (for example Japan and Saudi Arabia) but Europe
and North America are the main two.

Figure 1.4 Main producers of national standards outside Europe
Although these countries publish what are probably the most important series
of standards, virtually every country with an industrial base has its own organisa-
tion producing its own set of standards. This can obviously lead to a lot of confu-
sion, especially with regard to international trade and tenders. For example, if
America were to invite tenders for a project quoting American (ANSI) national
standards as the minimum criteria, other countries might find it difficult to submit
a proposal, either because they didn’t have a copy (or a translation) of the rele-
vant standard, or they wouldn’t find it cost effective to retool their entire works
in order to conform to the requirements of that particular national standard.

ISO 9000 7
The situation in Europe has been made even more difficult when the
European Union (EU) – in an attempt to stop national standards forming trade
barriers to community trade – produced even more regulations!

From a more civilian point of view the International Telecommunications
Union (ITU) Committees (i.e. The International Telegraph and Telephony
Consultative Committee (CCITT) and the International Radio Consultative
Committee (CCIR)) also publish recommendations.
For this reason there has been a steady growth in international standardisa-
tion and ISO, (International Organisation for Standardisation) and the IEC
(International Electrotechnical Commission), are now the standards bodies
that most countries are affiliated to – via, that is, their own particular National
Standards Organisation (NSO).
Like ITU documents, these ISO and IEC standards (ISO is mainly concerned
with industrial standards whilst IEC refers to electrical equipment) were 
initially published as ‘recommendations’, but they are now accepted as inter-
national standards – in their own right.
The standards themselves are drawn up by International Technical Committees
which have been approved by ISO or IEC member countries and there are now
many hundreds of different ISO and IEC standards available.
But national bodies and national standards cannot dictate customer choice. A
product that may legally be marketed need not be of universal appeal. Indeed,
where different national standards persist they will do so as a reflection of differ-
ent market preferences. For industry to survive in this set of ‘liberalised’market,
therefore, it must have a sound technological base supported by a comprehensive
set of internationally approved standards.
Quality has thus become the key word in today’s competitive markets and there
are now more than 80 countries with similar organisations – most of which are
members of ISO and IEC. Figure 1.7 shows the inter-relationship of these stan-
dards and committees.

1.3 The demand for standardisation of 
Quality Management Systems
The growing demand for assurance of quality before a contract is awarded 
has reinforced the already accepted adage that quality products play an important
role in securing new markets as well as retaining those markets that already
exist. Without doubt, in these days of competitive world markets, quality assur-
ance has never been more relevant. No longer can suppliers rely on their reputa-
tion alone.
The drive towards quality-led production now means that today’s major pur-
chasers are not just expecting a quality product but are also demanding proof
that a company is capable of producing quality products and/or providing quality
services. The provision of this proof is normally in the form of an independent
third-party certification and this is possibly the single most important require-
ment for a manufacturer, company or supplier.
Up until the early 1970’s, however, there were no viable third-party certifi-
cation schemes available. But with an increased demand for quality assurance
during all stages of the manufacturing processes, came the requirement for
manufacturers to work to a recognised set of standards.

Figure 1.7 Inter-relationship of the standards bodies and committees

Within the United Kingdom the BSI (British Standards Institution) had
already published a number of guides to quality assurance (for example BS
4891:1972 – A guide to Quality Assurance) and quickly set about providing an
acceptable document that would cover all requirements for a two-party manu-
facturing or supply contract.
This became the BS 5750 series of standards which were first published in 
the United Kingdom during 1979. These standards supplied guidelines for 
internal quality management as well as external quality assurance and they
were quickly accepted by manufacturers, suppliers and purchasers as being a 
reasonable minimum level of quality assurance that they could be expected to
work to. The BS 5750:1979 series thus became the ‘cornerstone’ for national
quality.
But in the meantime America had been working on their ANSI 90 series and
other European countries were also busily developing their own sets of stan-
dards. Quite naturally, however, as the BSI had already produced and published
an acceptable standard, most of these national standards were broadly based on
BS 5750.
In 1981, the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) formed a committee
called FOCUS to examine areas where standardisation could benefit the com-
petitiveness of British manufacturers and users of high technology – for instance
Local Area Network (LAN) standardisation. Owing to the wider international
interest concerning quality assurance, ISO then set up a Study Group during
1983 to produce an international set of standards that all countries could use.
This initiative, the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI), ensured that prod-
ucts from different manufacturers and different countries could exchange data
and interwork in certain defined areas. In the United States, the Corporation of
Open Systems (COS) was formed in 1986 to pursue similar objectives.
1.4 The background to the ISO 9000 set of 
quality standards
ISO was first established as a United Nations Agency in 1947 and is made up
of representatives from more than 90 countries including BSI for the United
Kingdom and ANSI for the United States. Over the years the work of ISO has
increased considerably and a great number of standards are now available and
have already been adopted.
10 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses

From the consumer’s point of view, however, the importance of international
(i.e. ISO) standards is that all major agencies are committed to recognising
their requirements. Equipment, modules and components can be designed and
built so that they will be acceptable to all member countries and in this way
interoperability is assured.
1.4.1 What does the term ISO mean?
As the term ‘ISO’ actually stands for the ‘International Organization for
Standardization’ one would normally assume that the acronym should be ‘IOS’!
Apparently there are two reasons why ISO was chosen instead of IOS. The first
is that ‘iso’in Greek means ‘equal’(and this mirrors ISO’s aim to develop stan-
dards that will enable organisations to be on an equal footing and, therefore,
conveys the idea of equality). The second (and probably the main reason) is
that ‘ISO’ is spelt the same (and, therefore, has the same acronym) in most 
languages spoken by the members of the original organisation.

Similar to quality standards from other countries, ISO’s first attempt at producing
an international standard for quality management (i.e. the ISO 9000:1987 set of
standards) were very heavily based on BS 5750 Parts 1, 2 and 3. They followed
the same sectional layout except that an additional section (ISO 9000:1987 Part
0 Section 0.1) was introduced to provide further guidance about the principal
concepts and applications contained in the ISO 9000 series.

Table 1.1 Comparison chart of equivalent standards to the 
ISO 9000:1994 series

When ISO 9000 was first published in 1987 it was immediately ratified by the
UK (under the direction of the Quality Management and Statistics Standards
Committee) and republished by the BSI (without deviation), as the new BS
5750:1987 standard for QMSs.
Similarly, on 10 December 1987 the Technical Board of the European
Committee for Standardisation (Commission European de Normalisation
Electrotechnique – CEN) approved and accepted the text of ISO 9000:1987 as the
European Standard – without modification – and republished it as EN
29000:1987.
At that time official versions of EN 29000:1987 existed in English, French
and German. CEN members were allowed, however, to translate any of these
versions into their own language and they then had the same status as the orig-
inal official versions.
Note: Up-to-date lists and bibliographical references concerning these and
other European standards may be obtained on application to the CEN Central
Secretariat (Rue Brederode 2, Boite 5, B–1000, Brussels, Belgium) or from
any CEN member.
BS 5750:1987 was, therefore, identical to ISO 9000:1987 and EN 29000:1987
except that BS 5750 had three additional guidance sections. Consequently, BS
5750 was not just the British Standard for Quality Management Systems it was
also the European and the international standard.
1.4.3 ISO 9000:1994
As ISO 9000:1987 became more popular, ISO realised that calling the same
document by a variety of different names could cause a certain amount of 
confusion and so in March of 1994 the ISO 9000:1994 series of Quality
Management documents were published.
Although the most notable change between the 1987 and the 1994 versions
of the ISO 9000 standard was the streamlining of the numbering system, there
were also around 250 other changes, the main ones being that:

it became an explicit requirement that all members of an organisation
(down to supervisory level at least) had job profiles (descriptions) to define
their authority and responsibility;

design reviews were now compulsory throughout the Work Package lifetime;

documentation control was extended to ensure that all data was kept up 
to date.
Most of the 250 changes were intended to clarify the standard, making it easier
to read. They did not significantly alter the way in which most companies were
running their businesses; they simply sought to improve it.
ISO 9000 13

1.5 ISO 9001:2000
1.5.1 Background to the ISO 9001:2000 standard
When ISO 9000 was first released in 1987, it was recognised as being largely
incomplete and required the auditors to fill in lots of the gaps. The first revi-
sion of ISO 9000 in 1994 got rid of many of these problems. However, an
organisation could still conform to the standard but at the same time produce
substandard products that were of a consistent poor quality! There was clearly
a major loophole that enabled organisations to comply with the requirements of
ISO 9000:1994 – without having to improve their quality!
Some managers also found it extremely difficult to see the real benefit of
having to commit more and more manpower and finance in maintaining their
ISO 9000 certification. Whilst most organisations accepted that the initial cer-
tification process was worthwhile and could result in some very real benefits,
these were mainly one-offs and it was felt that once ISO 9000 had been fully
adopted within an organisation, these savings could not be repeated. The ISO
9000 certificate had been hanging on the wall in the reception office for many
years but third party surveillance visits don’t tell the management much more
than they already knew from their own internal audits! Quite a few organisa-
tions also felt that they had gone well beyond ISO 9000 and apart from associ-
ating the organisation with a quality standard, there was little or no actual
benefit to be gained from having to continually pay out for re-certification and
surveillance fees.
On the other hand, however, BSI frequently come across organisations who
initially sought ISO 9000 registration (because it was a requirement to continue
business with a client), but having seen the benefits they, in turn, had pushed it
on down their own supply chain, thus increasing the requirement for ISO 9000
certification.
So as the 1990s progressed, more and more organisations started reaping
benefits from the existing ISO 9000:1994 requirements but as the standard
became more popular the inadequacies of ISO 9000:1994 became more appar-
ent. For example:

some organisations did not need to carry out all the 20 elements making up
ISO 9000:1994 in order to be a quality organisation;

the standard was too biased towards manufacturing industries thus making
it difficult for service industries to use;

the requirements were repeated in other management systems, resulting in
duplication of effort (e.g. ISO 14001 Environmental Management and BS
8800 Management of Health and Safety);

many organisations wanted to progress beyond the confines of ISO 9000
towards Total Quality Management (TQM);

the documents were viewed by many as not being very user-friendly;
14 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses


the language used was not clear and could be interpreted in many different
ways;

the standard was very inflexible and could not be tailored to specific indus-
tries, etc;

the standard did not cater for continual improvement;

the standard did not fully address customer satisfaction.
The reasons went on and on and there was clearly a need for revision.
Fortunately, help was on its way for under existing international agreement, all
International standards have to be re-inspected, five years after publication, for
their continued applicability. In accordance with this agreement, ISO/TC176 (ISO
Technical Committee No 176 ‘Quality Management and Quality Assurance’) con-
ducted a global survey of over 1000 users and organisations for their views on ISO
9000:1994 using a questionnaire (produced by ISO member bodies) covering:

problems with the existing standards;

requirements for new/revised standards;

possible harmonisation and interoperability between quality management,
environmental management and health & safety standards.

The primary objective of this exercise was to make ISO 9001:2000:

more compatible with the other management systems;

more closely associated to business processes;

more easily understood;

capable of being used by all organisations, no matter their size;

capable of being used by all types of industries and professions (i.e. manu-
facturers and service providers);

a means of continually improving quality;

future proof.
1.5.2 The revision process
The revision process was the responsibility of ISO TC–176. Initial specifica-
tions and goals were established following extensive user surveys and these
were followed by a user verification and validation process, to ensure that the
standards produced would actually meet the requirements of the user.

1.5.3 Factors considered during the revisions of the
standards
Some of the factors considered during the development of the draft standards
included:

the problems with ISO 9001:1994’s 20-element model and its current bias
towards manufacturing organisations;

the increased use of the ISO 9000 standards by regulated industries and
their subsequent need for change;

the proliferation of guideline standards in the ISO 9000:1994 family (most
of which were not fully used!);

changed user requirements with more emphasis on meeting customer
needs;

the difficulties that small businesses were having in trying to meet the require-
ments of the standards;

the need to be more compatible with other management system standards
(e.g. ISO 14001 for environmental management);

the incorporation of ISO 9000 standards into specific sector requirements
standards or documents;

the adoption of process-oriented management and the need to assist organ-
isations in improving their business performance.
The interest shown by users in improving ISO 9000:1994 was obvious by their
response to the questionnaires which resulted in over 6000 comments on each
ISO 9000 17

of the first and second sets of committee drafts. The results of the survey
clearly showed the need for a revised ISO 9000 standard, which would:

be split, so that one standard [i.e. ISO 9001:2000 would address requirements,
whilst another (ISO 9004:2000) would address the gradual improvement of
an organisation’s overall quality performance];

be simple to use, easy to understand and only use clear language and ter-
minology (a definite plus for most readers of current international stan-
dards!);

have a common structure based on a ‘process model’;

be capable of being ‘tailored’to fit all product and service sectors and all sizes
of organisations (and not just the manufacturing industry);

be more orientated toward continual improvement and customer satisfaction;

be capable of demonstrating continuous improvement and prevention of
non-conformity;

provide a natural stepping stone towards performance improvement;

have an increased compatibility with other management system standards;

provide a basis for addressing the primary needs and interests of organisa-
tions in specific sectors such as aerospace, automotive, medical devices,
telecommunication and others.
The survey also indicated that organisations were finding it increasingly diffi-
cult to do business in the world marketplace without ISO 9000. The growing

confusion about having three quality standards available for certification (i.e.
ISO 9001:1994, 9002:1994 and 9003:1994) was also a contributing factor and
so it was recommended that the requirements of all three standards be com-
bined into one overall standard (i.e. ISO 9001:2000).
ISO emphasise, however, that the year 2000 revision of the ISO 9000 stan-
dards does not require the rewriting of an organisation’s current QMS docu-
mentation! They point out that the major change has been from a ‘system based’
to a more ‘process orientated’ management approach, which can be easily
addressed by organisations who have a fully documented QMS that already
complies with the 1994 standard.
1.5.4 Key changes in the standards
In ISO 9001:2000, the 20 elements contained in section four of ISO 9001:1994
have been replaced by four major sections covering the management of
resources, the quality of the product, the maintenance of quality records and
the requirements for continual improvement.
Each of the three main standards (i.e. ISO 9000:2000, ISO 9001:2000 and
ISO 9004:2000) now have a revised title, which no longer includes the term
‘quality assurance’. This has been done in order to reflect the fact that the QMS
requirements specified in these standards address the quality assurance of a
product as well as customer satisfaction.
They have been designed so that ISO 9000:2000 now includes a description
of the basic approach to quality management as well as including a revised

vocabulary to reflect the usage of new and revised terms and associated defi-
nitions contained in ISO 9001:2000 and ISO 9004:2000.
ISO 9001:2000 is focused towards ‘providing confidence, as a result of demon-
stration, in product conformance to established requirements’ and includes a
clause entitled ‘permissible exclusions’. This clause allows organisations to
formally ‘omit’certain non-applicable requirements of the standard, yet still claim
conformance to it. However, only those organisations that can prove that the
nature of their products, customers and/or the applicable regulatory require-
ments do not need to meet the full requirements of ISO 9001:2000, are allowed
these exclusions. For example, organisations whose products require no design
activities (and who would had previously sought ISO 9002:1994 certification)
can now claim to be in compliance with ISO 9001:2000 by excluding the
requirements for design and/or development.
On the other hand, ISO 9004:2000 is focused towards providing ‘benefits for
all interested parties through sustained customer satisfaction’. ISO 9004:2000
also includes the requirements of ISO 9001:2000 in text boxes inserted in
appropriate places (which means, I suppose that organisations only need to
purchase 9004 and not both of the standards – funny old world!). In addition,
ISO 9004:2000 includes an annex giving guidance on ‘self-assessment’ to
enable an organisation to check the status of their own QMS. This has proved
extremely useful for organisations applying for ISO 9001:2000 certification,
but who are unsure what additional quality documentation would be required.
ISO 9001:2000 and ISO 9004:2000 have, therefore, been developed as a
‘consistent pair’of QMS standards, based on eight quality management princi-
ples with a common process-oriented structure and harmonised terminology.
They are designed to be used together, or may be used as stand-alone docu-
ments, however, only ISO 9001:2000 can be used for certification purposes.
One specific change to ISO 9001:2000 and ISO 9004:2000 that was brought
about late in the day concerned the usage of the term ‘product’. During the
Committee Draft stages, it became apparent that there was a need to have a sin-
gle word that described an organisation’s output as well as the service that it
provided. Consequently in the new standards, ‘product’ has been defined as 
‘a process, which uses resources to transform inputs into outputs’and there are
four agreed generic product categories, namely:

hardware (e.g. engine, mechanical part);

software (e.g. computer program);

services (e.g. transport);

processed materials (e.g. lubricant).
In practice, most products will be combinations of these four generic product cat-
egories and whether the combined product is then called hardware, processed
material, software or service will depend on the dominant element.
20 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses

Although upgrading an organisation’s QMS to ISO 9001:2000 will be fairly
simple for organisations previously certified to ISO 9001:1994, the impact on
organisations who were previously only registered to ISO 9002:1994 and
9003:1994 (i.e. organisations not involved in the design and manufacture of a
product) have inevitably proved to be more difficult as greater documentation
is now required (in order to demonstrate why service and design functions do
not apply to their organisations) and more detailed records are required.
1.5.5 What are the aims, benefits, main changes and 
new requirements of ISO 9001:2000?
1.5.5.1 What are the aims of ISO 9001:2000?
The aim of ISO 9001:2000 is to assist users to produce a QMS that is capable
of being:
(1) Flexible

it is flexible enough to fit any sort of organisation (the manufacturing
emphasis is gone);

it provides a flexible approach to quality documentation;

it includes quality planning similar to other associated standards (e.g. ISO
13484:2004);

it is in line with other management systems.
(2) Structured

no longer consists of 20 isolated elements;

has a new quality process management model;

includes process capability studies;

relies on process measurements and process audits;

includes design control based on project management;

includes expanded validation of design requirements;

requires configuration management;

documents how a product is measured and evaluated using a Quality
(Control) Plan.
(3) Customer orientated

has a new emphasis on the identification of stakeholders and how the
organisation plans to meet their needs;

emphasises close communications with customers;

requires a formal system of measuring customer satisfaction;
ISO 9000 21


emphasises the need to identify and review customer requirements and
expectations;

replaces service requirements with delivery and post-delivery service
requirements.
(4) Verification and validation

verifies purchased products;

validates the output of processes within an organisation;

includes the requirement for regular revalidation of products and/or serv-
ices to ensure that they continue to meet customer expectations.
(5) Corrective action

gives a more assertive definition of corrective and preventive action.
(6) Continuous improvement

provides for continually reviewing the work environment and its effect on
quality.
(7) Workforce

defines responsibilities and authorities within the process areas;

enables an organisation to assure that its infrastructure is sufficient to meet
its quality objectives.
(8) Reviews

sets a requirement for the regular review of quality objectives;

requires a formal policy on continuous improvement.
1.5.5.2 What are the advantages of ISO 9001:2000?
With the publication of ISO 9001:2000, there is now a single quality manage-
ment ‘requirements’ standard that is applicable to all organisations, products
and services. It is the only standard that can be used for the certification of a
QMS and its generic requirements can be used by any organisation to:

address customer satisfaction;

meet customer and applicable regulatory requirements;

enable internal and external parties (including certification bodies) to
assess the organisation’s ability to meet these customer and regulatory
requirements.
22 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses

1.5.5.3 What are the benefits of the revised standards?
The major benefits associated with the new standards include its:

applicability to all product categories, regardless of sector and/or size of an
organisation;

capability of being used (as the basis) for other product sector systems (e.g.
medical devices, telecommunications, automotive, etc.);

compatibility with other management systems (e.g. such as ISO 14000);

emphasis on continual improvement;

emphasis on customer satisfaction;

move toward improved organisational performance;

need for less documentation;

pivotal part in integrated management;

process approach;

understandability and ease of use;

use of one standard (i.e. ISO 9001) to cover the requirements and another
(i.e. ISO 9004) to provide guidance.
1.5.5.4 What are the main changes?
The main changes caused by the introduction of 9001 and 9004 as a consistent
pair of QMS standards are:

a considerable reduction in the amount of required documentation;

the introduction for the need to monitor customer satisfaction (as a meas-
ure of system performance);

the introduction of organisational self-assessment as a driver for 
improvement;

their consideration of the benefits and needs of all interested parties;

their continual improvement process;

their increased emphasis on the role of top management especially its com-
mitment to:
 the development and improvement of the QMS;
 the consideration of legal and regulatory requirements;
 the establishment of measurable objectives for relevant functions and
levels;

their increased compatibility with other management systems (e.g. ISO
14001);

their logical structure;

their new process-oriented structure;

their reference to quality management principles;

their terminology (providing easier interpretation).
ISO 9000 23

1.5.5.5 What new requirements have been introduced?
Main new requirements include the:

analysis of collected data to evaluate the performance of the QMS;

consideration of statutory and regulatory requirements;

establishment of measurable objectives at relevant functions and levels;

increased attention to availability of resources;

increased emphasis on the role of top management;

need to determine training objectives and effectiveness;

need to monitor customer satisfaction as a measure of system performance;

requirement for continual improvement;

requirement to measure (and monitor) system and processes as well as
product.
1.5.5.6 What are the main advantages to organisations using
ISO 9001:2000?
Many companies stipulate that their suppliers are ISO 9000 compliant; there-
fore, once you’re certified, your opportunities will increase. What’s more…

profitability increases;

market share expands;

customer satisfaction increases;

operating costs dramatically reduce;

demand for your products and services are heightened;

employees experience better working conditions.
1.5.6 Certification registration and accreditation
Following consultation between ISO/TC 176, the International Accreditation
Forum (IAF) and the ISO Committee on Conformity Testing (ISO/CASCO), it
was agreed that those organisations who had previously used ISO 9002:1994
and ISO 9003:1994 would be allowed to work to this new international stan-
dard by reducing the scope of their conformance. For example, when a customer
needs a particular type of product and/or service that does not necessarily require
all the QMS requirements, then they can be excluded. This exclusion can be
made, provided that the organisation does not reduce the actual scope of its
QMS or exclude any QMS requirements that affect the organisation’s ability to
provide a conforming product and/or service. All exclusions need to be defined
in the organisation’s Quality Manual and by definition, reducing the scope 
of conformance does not absolve the organisation from providing a product
and/or service which meets customer requirements.
As previously mentioned, the 2000 revision is also an attempt to harmonise the
common quality management elements of ISO 9000 with those contained in the
24 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses

ISO 14001 environmental management system standard and, to some degree,
the health and safety requirements of standards such as BS 8800. The overall
intention is to enable an organisation to run one management system that
addresses quality, the environment and health and safety.
It has to be said, however, that much of the old standard has been pre-
served and the revisions that have been made have been aimed mainly at clos-
ing the gap between ISO 9000, QS 9000 for the automotive industry and 
TR 9000 for the telecommunications industry and ISO 13485 for the medical
industry etc.
1.5.6.1 What is the difference between being certified and
being registered?
Actually there is no difference! In some countries companies/organisations
will say that they are certified, in others they will say that they are registered –
but it means the same thing.
1.5.6.2 What is the difference being certified and 
being compliant?
When an organisation claims that they are ISO 9000 certified or registered,
they mean that a Notified Body (that is, an independent registrar) has audited
their QMS, certified that it meets the requirements of ISO 9001:2000, given
them a written assurance that ISO’s quality management system standard has
been met and registered their organisation as having been certified.
On the other hand, when an organisation says that they are ISO 9000 ‘compli-
ant’, they usually mean that they have met ISO’s quality system requirements but
have not been formally certified by an independent registrar. In effect, they are
self-certified and whilst this is perfectly acceptable for many organisations,
especially the smaller ones, an official certificate issued by an independent
registrar does tend to carry more weight in the market place.
Note: As ISO 9001:2000 is a process standard (and not a product standard),
when a company says that they are certified or compliant, they are not saying
that their products and/or services meet the ISO 9000 requirements.
1.5.6.3 What is the difference between being certified and
being accredited?
Registrars, audit and certify organisations who wish to become ISO 9000 reg-
istered. Accreditation Bodies, like UKAS (United Kingdom Accreditation
Service), on the other hand, evaluate and accredit the registrars. In effect
accreditation bodies audit the auditors and certify that the registrars are com-
petent and authorised to issue ISO 9001:2000 certificates in specified business
sectors.
ISO 9000 25

1.5.7 The ‘consistent pair’
ISO 9001:2000 and ISO 9004:2000 have been developed together – with the
same sequence and structure – in order to form a ‘consistent pair’of quality man-
agement standards. Their primary aim is to give ISO 9000 a more global applica-
bility, to relate modern quality management to the actual processes and activities
of an organisation and to promote continual improvement and achievement of
customer satisfaction.
These two international standards are designed to be used together, but can also
be used independently. ISO 9001:2000 specifies the requirements for a QMS
(that can be used for internal application, certification, or contractual pur-
poses), ISO 9004:2000 gives guidance on a wider range of objectives aimed at
improving an organisation’s overall performance. ISO 9004:2000 is not, how-
ever, meant as a guideline for implementing ISO 9001:2000 neither is it
intended for certification or contractual use. Both standards are based on eight
quality management principles, which reflect best management practices.
1.5.8 Quality management principles
The eight quality management principles defined in ISO 9000:2000 Quality
Management Systems – Fundamentals and vocabulary can be used by senior
management as a basis for improving their organisation’s performance. They
have been derived from the collective experience and knowledge of the inter-
national experts making up the technical committee responsible for developing
and maintaining ISO 9000 (i.e. ISO-TC 176).
Note: ISO 9000:2000 also provides examples of the benefits that can be
derived from the use of these eight principles and some of the actions that 
managers could typically take in applying them to improve their organisations’
performance.

1.5.9 What has happened to other standards previously
based on ISO 9000:1994?
During its lifetime, the 1994 version of ISO 9000 was frequently used as the
generic template for other industry management system standards. The prob-
lem with using ISO 9001:1994, however, was that because it was a requirements
based quality management system (primarily designed for manufacturers) it was
not entirely suitable for all industries. As a result, these other industries found
that they had to leave out some of the requirements of this standard whilst, 
at the same time, include additional topics that were specific to their own 
particular industry.
By the end of the 1990’s there were a growing number of these ‘ISO 9000
equivalent standards’and standards for telecommunications (TL 9000), the auto-
motive industry (QS 9000) and medical devices (ISOs 13485 and 13488:1966)
were widely used. To simplify matters, it was agreed that part of ISO TC-176’s
work in upgrading the 1994 standard would, therefore, be to take these ‘sons 
of 9000’ into consideration and try to produce one standard that would cover
virtually all industries – not just one for the manufacturers of a product.
Currently, although there are still a number of these other industry standards
available, they are all gradually being rewritten around the requirements and
recommendations of ISO 9001:2000 and the following is a selection of some
of the most important ones.

1.5.9.1 Telecommunications industry
TL 9000 (Quality management standard for the telecommunication sector) is a
set of quality system requirements for the telecommunications industry which
were originally developed by the QuEST Forum (Quality Excellence for
Suppliers of Telecommunications Leadership) and was first published in
November 1999. It has now been updated to conform to ISO 9001:2000.
The purpose of TL 9000 is to provide a quality management system for the
design, development, production, delivery, installation and maintenance of
telecommunication products and services, using ISO 9000 as the base with cer-
tain specific additions. It applies to all suppliers of telecommunications hard-
ware, software and services and – as it is totally compatible with existing ISO
9000 protocols – registration to TL 9000 reduces the need to meet other
telecommunication quality management standards.
The three registration options (or any combination of these three) being
offered are:

TL 9000 – H (Hardware quality system requirements and metrics);

TL 9000 – S (Software quality system requirements and metrics);

TL 9000 – V (Services quality system requirements and metrics).
Further information about the QuEST Forum is available from their website
(www.questforum.org) or from the American Society for Quality at www.asq.or.
1.5.9.2 Automotive industry
QS-9000 (Quality System Requirements QS-9000) is a common supplier qual-
ity standard for the Daimler Chrysler Corporation, Ford Motor Company and
General Motors Corporation. It is based on the 1994 edition of ISO 9001, but
contains additional requirements that are particular to the automotive industry. 
QS-9000 applies to all suppliers of production materials, production and serv-
ice parts, heat treating, painting and plating and other finishing services for the
‘Big Three’ and its requirements are divided into three sections, as follows:

Section 1: Common requirements – the exact text of ISO 9001 with the
addition of automotive/heavy trucking requirements;

Section 2: Additional requirements – requirements beyond the scope of
ISO 9001, common to all three manufacturers;

Section 3: Customer specific sections – requirements unique to Ford,
General Motors, or Chrysler.
Being specific to the automotive industry, additional documentation is
required for the QS 9000 program and consist of:

QS-9000 Quality System Requirements;

Advanced Product Quality Planning and Control Plan (APQP);
30 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses


Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA);

Measurement Systems Analysis;

Fundamental SPC;

Production Part Approval Process (PPAP) manual and the

Quality System Assessment (QSA) manual.
When ISO 9001:2000 was released it was realised that this standard with its
process orientated approach more closely met the requirements of the automotive
industry and so a working party was set up to amend QS 9000. This resulted in
the publication of ISO/TS 16949:2002 (Quality management systems –
Particular requirements for the application of ISO 9001:2000 for automotive
production and relevant service part organizations) which, in conjunction with
ISO 9001:2000, now defines the quality management system requirements for
the design and development, production and, when relevant, installation and
service of automotive-related products.
ISO/TS 16949:2002 was released in March 2002 and provides a supplier to
vehicle manufacturers with a QMS that is recognised by all of the IATF
(International Automotive Task Force). The Big Three (as part of IATF) have
agreed to adopt ISO/TS 16949:2002 as the minimum qualifying standard for
suppliers to vehicle manufacturers and as from 14th December 2006 the cur-
rent QS-9000 standard (which includes text from the old ISO 9000:1994) will
cease to exist.

1.5.9.3 Medical devices
ISO 13485:2003 (Medical devices – Quality management systems – Requirements
for regulatory purposes) is intended for the medical device industry, regardless of
the type and/or size of the organisation. The standard specifies the requirements
for a quality management system and is aimed at ensuring that all medical
devices manufactured and/or provided by an organisation continue to meet
customer and regulatory requirements applicable to those medical devices.
As patient safety is involved, all of the requirements of ISO 13485:2003 are
mandatory and as this standard differs from ISO 9001:2000 by including some
additional requirements that are intended only for medical devices and excluding
some ISO 9001:2000’s requirements that are inappropriate. One major change is
ISO 9000 31

that rather than targeting customer satisfaction – as the new ISO 9001 does –
ISO 13485 targets customer requirements. Because of these exclusions, an organ-
isation that is registered to ISO 13485:2003 cannot also claim conformity to
ISO 9001:2000 unless their QMS also covers the excluded ISO 9001:2000
requirements.

1.5.9.4 Testing and calibration laboratories
ISO/IEC 17025:2000 (General requirements for the competence of testing and
calibration laboratories) was produced as a result of EN 45001 and ISO/IEC
Guide 25 and contains requirements for all test and calibration laboratories
wishing to demonstrate that they are technically competent and operate an
acceptable quality system.
The standard is applicable to all laboratories (regardless of size) and labora-
tories meeting this standard are certified as being able to produce test and cal-
ibration results which are mutually acceptable between countries. The standard
has two main requirement clauses, Clause 4 (which specifies the management
requirements) and Clause 5 which specifies the technical requirements.
Clause 4 has been written around the 1994 version of ISO 9000 and empha-
sises the need for:

a quality manual (containing quality policy statement, supporting proce-
dures and a formalised document control system – so very much the same
as ISO 9001:2000);

procedures for the review of requests, tenders and contracts;

purchase control (including subcontractor management);

corrective and preventative action (including control of non-conforming
product and cause analysis);

control of records (particularly technical records);

regular internal and management audits.
Clause 5 is specifically aimed at testing and calibration laboratories and covers
additional items such as:

competence of personnel performing the tests and calibrations;

laboratory facilities (accommodation, infrastructure and environmental
conditions);
32 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses


test and calibration methods (plus method evaluation);

control of data (in particular computer software);

control of equipment (records, maintenance plan, transportation etc.);

measurement traceability (calibration of test equipment, reference 
standards);

sampling plan;

reporting the results of testing and calibrations (test reports, calibration
certificates and test reports).
This standard is currently being updated to comply with the basic management
system requirements of ISO 9001:2000.
1.5.9.5 Petroleum, petrochemical and natural gas industries
PD ISO/TS 29001:2003 (Petroleum, petrochemical and natural gas industries –
Sector specific quality management systems – Requirements for product and
service supply organizations) is another new Technical Specification that has
recently been developed by ISO as a quality management system for these 
particular industries.
As with all QMSs, the aim is for continual improvement and this specification
is no different except, in this particular case, continual improvement is focused on:

defect prevention;

reduction of variation and waste in the supply chain;

reduction of variation and waste from service providers.
The requirements specified in PD ISO/TS 29001:2003 are supplementary to
ISO 9001 and have been developed separately to ensure that the requirements
for the design, development, production, installation and service of products
are clear and auditable. The standard also helps to guarantee a global consis-
tency and improved assurance in the quality of goods and services supplied
from providers – the failure of which could have severe ramifications for the
companies and industries involved.
Further details concerning this Technical Specification are available from
the Association for Petroleum and Explosives Administration (APEA) via
admin@apea.org.uk.
1.5.9.6 Aerospace
AS/EN/JIS Q 9100:2001 (Quality Management Systems – Aerospace –
Requirements) is an international aerospace standard for quality assurance in
design, development, production, installation and servicing. ASQ 9100 certifi-
cation can be obtained by companies specialising in design and manufacture of
ISO 9000 33

equipment, aircraft accessory supply, airport and airline operations, spares
supply and maintenance, flight operations or cargo handling. An increasing
number of major aerospace contractors (e.g. Boeing, Rolls Royce Allison,
GEAE, NASA and Honeywell etc.) are now encouraging suppliers to use ASQ
9100, which is boosting (‘propelling’ one might even say!) its use throughout
the industry.
For further details about the requirements of AS 9100, try the American
Society for Quality (ASQ) website at www.asq.org.
1.5.9.7 Computer software
ISO/IEC 90003:2004 (Software engineering – Guidelines for the application
of ISO 9001:2000 to computer software) provides guidance for organisations
using ISO 9001:2000 to purchase, supply, develop, operate and maintain com-
puter software and related support services. It is suitable for all software that is:

part of a commercial contract with another organisation;

a product available for a market sector;

used to support the processes of an organisation;

embedded in a hardware product, or

related to software services.
ISO/IEC 90003:2004 itself is independent of the technology, life cycle models,
development processes, sequence of activities and business structure used by
an organisation. It does not add to or otherwise change the requirements of ISO
9001:2000 and the guidelines provided are not intended to be used as assess-
ment criteria in quality management system registration/certification.
1.5.9.8 Food and drink industry
ISO 15161:2001 (Guidelines on the application of ISO 9001:2000 for the food
and drink industry) is aimed at organisations involved in all aspects of this indus-
try sector, including sourcing, processing and packaging food and drink products.
The standard provides guidelines for the food and drink industry for imple-
menting a QMS based on ISO 9001:2000 and provides information on the pos-
sible interactions between ISO 9000 and the Hazard Analysis and Critical
Control Point (HACCP) system for food safety requirements.
This International Standard is not intended for certification, regulatory or
contractual use.
1.5.9.9 Education
IWA 2:2003 (Quality management systems – Guidelines for the application of
ISO 9001:2000 in education)
International Workshop Agreement IWA 2:2003 provides guidelines for the
application of ISO 9001:2000 in educational organisations providing educational
34 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses

products. These guidelines do not add to, change or modify the requirements of
ISO 9001:2000 and are not intended for use in contracts for compliance assess-
ments or for certification.
Each clause of ISO 9001:2000 is included before the corresponding text of
IWA 2:2003. The whole text of ISO 9004:2000 is also included to provide a
complete vision of the continual performance improvement of organisations.
1.5.9.10 Iron ore industry
ISO/TR 13352:1997 (Guidelines for interpretation of ISO 9000 series for
application within the iron ore industry) was written around the old procedural
based 1994 version of ISO 9000 with certain additions that were specific for
the mining and quarrying (iron ore) industry.
It is currently being updated to comply with the basic management system
requirements of ISO 9001:2000.
1.5.9.11 TickIT
TickIT procedures relate directly to the requirements set out in ISO 9001:2000
and similar to this standard, certification is conducted by an independent third
party certification body using specialist auditors trained by the International
Register of Certificated Auditors (IRCA) with the support of the British
Computer Society. A successful audit by a TickIT-accredited certification body
results in the award of a certificate of compliance to ISO 9001:2000, endorsed
with a TickIT logo.
TickIT is supported by the UK and Swedish software industries with the aim
of stimulating software system developers to think about:

what quality really is in the context of the processes of software development;

how quality may be achieved;

how quality management systems may be continuously improved.
Through the following objectives:

to improve market confidence in a third party QMS certification through
software sector accredited certification bodies;

to improve professional practice amongst software sector QMS auditors;

to publish authoritative guidance material (i.e. the TickIT Guide) for use by
all stakeholders.
TickIT, therefore, provides software developers with an accredited quality cer-
tification scheme that meets the special needs of the industry, enjoys the confi-
dence of professional staff and commands respect from purchasers and suppliers.
It applies to all types of information system suppliers (software houses and 
ISO 9000 35

in-house developers) which involve software development processes. TickIT
disciplines are also relevant to the development of embedded software.
Within the UK, TickIT is recognised by all Government departments and
major purchasers and it is compatible with European requirements for accred-
ited quality system certification. World-wide, over 1400 TickIT certificates
have now been issued and currently, 50% of all new certificates are being
granted to organisations outside the United Kingdom.
For more information about this scheme, contact the TickIT Office at BSI
(Floor 8E), 389 Chiswick High Road, London W4 4AL.

1.5.9.12 The future evolution of ISO 9000
To ensure that the current ISO 9000 family can continue to benefit from new
developments within the quality management field, ISO/TC-176 continuously
monitor the use of the ISO 9000 standards.
Similar to other ISO standards, ISO 9000:2000 is due to be reviewed every
five years and so a new version might well be published during 2008 (i.e. five
years after ISO 9001:2000 became the mandatory standard for quality man-
agement). As well as customer feedback, ISO have stated that this review will
take into consideration all of the other system specific industrial standards and
specifications and be aimed at producing a more generic standard.
1.5.10 Are there any other standards based on 
ISO 9001:2000?
Well, yes . . . there is BS 7799 which provides a specification for the design, devel-
opment and implementation of an information security management system – just
as ISO 9001 does for a QMS. This standard recognises that information is a sig-
nificant asset to any organisation and, therefore, it needs to be carefully managed.
It also recognises the risks associated with software copies and records and, as
well as having to accurately identify its information assets, an organisation
must also ensure that the security of this information is maintained.
As an information security management standard, BS 7799 is designed to
help anyone who is responsible for initiating, implementing and/or maintaining
security within an organisation. It provides a comprehensive set of controls for
best practice in information security. It was first published in 1995 with the
purpose of:

providing a common basis for developing organisational security standards
and an effective security management practice;

providing confidence in inter-organisational dealings;
36 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses

and the preservation of:

confidentiality;

integrity – safeguarding the accuracy and completeness of information and
processing methods;

availability – ensuring that authorised users have access to information and
associated assets when required.
The 1999 revision took into account recent developments in the application of
information processing technology (in particular networks, communications
and information security) and now addresses all types of information that is
stored electronically and/or transmitted electronically, such as through the
Internet and other telecommunications channels. This standard also covers data
that is written, mailed or on film.
There are definite parallels between BS 7799 and ISO 9000 and so the aim
of the 2002 revision of BS 7799 was to bring it into line with ISO 9001:2000
and other management system standards. The latest revision even includes the
plan-do-check-act model.
1.5.11 What is the ISO 9000 family?
The three main standards which make up the ISO 9000 family areas follows:

Note: Whilst the term ‘ISO 9001’ has only one very specific meaning (i.e. it
refers to the ISO 9001:2000 requirements standard), the term ‘ISO 9000’ can
be taken two ways. In its broadest sense, it can mean all of the ISO 9001:2000
family (i.e. ISO 9000:2000, ISO 9001:2000, ISO 9004:2000 and ISO 19001).
In its narrow sense, the term ISO 9000 can refer only to the ISO 9000:2000
standard (which talks about definitions and vocabulary!). In trying to make
their definitions easier to understand, ISO have unfortunately introduced a 
little bit of added confusion!
These three standards are then supported by:

1.5.12 Integrated Management Systems
ISO 9001:2000 is intended to be compatible with other management system
standards in particular, those relating to environmental management, occupational
health & safety and financial management, etc. With this in mind TC/176 when
producing ISO 9001:2000 have made sure that the requirements of ISO 14001
‘Environmental Management Systems – Specifications with guidance for use’
have been carefully considered and a very good degree of compatibility now
exists between these two standards.
Note: For a brief description of ISO 14001 see Appendix 1 to this Chapter.
Thus, although ISO 9001:2000 does not include any requirements that are spe-
cific to ISO 14001 (or, indeed, any of the other management systems) it does, nev-
ertheless, allow an organisation to align and integrate its own QMS with other
(related) management system requirements. In some cases, it may even be pos-
sible for an organisation to adapt its existing management system(s) in order 
to establish a QMS that complies with the requirements of ISO 9001:2000.

Both from a financial and a business perspective the advantages to be gained
from combining the management systems for quality, environment, and health
and safety into just one basic, integrated management system are well worth
pursuing – especially considering the natural similarity between a company’s
business processes and procedures for each of these three systems (for example,
the document control process shown in the Quality Manual will be the same as
that for the other two systems).
Other than economy of scale and unnecessary duplication, the three main
reasons for integrating the systems together are:

ease of use – one simple arrangement that is used frequently by staff will
become far more familiar than three disconnected systems, used periodically;

reduced amount of internal auditing – and advantages gained by using 
different departments to audit each other (e.g. the quality department can
audit the environmental department etc.);

reduction in certification costs – as there now only needs to be one assess-
ment and surveillance.
Without doubt, an Integrated Management System (IMS) – based on a process
structure that reflects an organisation’s business model – is the way forward
and many organisations have seen the light.
Note: There are a number of texts on this topic (e.g. those published by BSI in
its IMS series).
1.5.13 ISO 9000:2000
To ensure a more harmonised approach to standardisation and the (hopeful!)
achievement of coherent terminology within the ISO 9000:2000 family, the 
development of ISO 9000:2000 was completed in parallel with ISO 9001:2000,
ISO 9004:2000 and all other existing and planned management standards.
ISO 9000:2000 now includes a revision of the previous ISO 8402:1995 Quality
Management and Quality Assurance – Vocabulary standard, provides a more
formal approach to the definition of terms, specifies terminology for QMSs
and will assist:

those concerned with enhancing mutual understanding of the terminology
used in quality management (e.g. suppliers, customers, regulators);

those internal or external to the organisation who assess the QMS or audit
it for conformance to the requirements of ISO 9001:2000 (e.g. auditors,
regulators, independent Registrar and/or Notified Body);

those internal or external to the organisation who give advice on QMSs
appropriate to that organisation;

developers of related standards.
42 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses

ISO 9000:2000 also provides an introduction to the fundamentals of QMSs and
following publication of this standard, ISO 8402:1995 was withdrawn.
1.5.14 ISO 9001:2000
The previous ISO 9001:1994, ISO 9002:1994 and ISO 9003:1994 family of stan-
dards have now been consolidated into a single revised ISO 9001:2000 standard.
With the publication of ISO 9001:2000, there is now, therefore, a single quality
management ‘requirements’ standard that is applicable to all organisations,
products and services. It is the only standard that can be used for the certifica-
tion of a QMS and its generic requirements can be used by any organisation to:

address customer satisfaction;

meet customer and applicable regulatory requirements;
ISO 9000 43
ISO 9000:2000
Figure 1.15 The way to ISO 9000:2000
ISO 9001:2000
Figure 1.16 The way to ISO 9001:2000


enable internal and external parties (including certification bodies) to assess
the organisation’s ability to meet these customer and regulatory requirements.
For certification purposes, an organisation will have to possess a documented
management system which takes the inputs and transforms them into targeted
outputs. Something that effectively:

says what they are going to do;

does what they have said they are going to do;

keep records of everything that they do – especially when things go 
wrong.
The basic process to achieve these targeted outputs will encompass:

the client’s requirements;

the inputs from management and staff;

documented controls for any activities that are needed to produce the 
finished article;

and, of course, delivering a product or service, which satisfies the customer’s
original requirements.
The adoption of a QMS has to be a strategic decision for any organisation and
the design and implementation of their QMS will be influenced by its varying
needs, objectives, products provided, processes employed and the size and

structure of that organisation. As ISO are quick to point out, however, it is not the
intention of ISO 9001:2000 to insist on a uniform structure to a QMS or 
uniformity of documentation. The QMS requirements specified in this standard
should always be viewed as complementary to the product technical 
requirements.
This latest revision process has made ISO 9001:2000 into a far more generic
standard than the previous 20-element ISO 9001:1994 structure. It adopts the
process management approach widely used in business today and more clearly
addresses the QMS requirements for an organisation in order to demonstrate its
capability of meeting customer requirements. It is now also more compatible
(indeed linked with) the ISO 14001 standard for environmental management and
includes the relevant managerial requirements found in national/international
health and safety management standards.
As previously mentioned, the ISO 9001:2000 standard is the only standard
within the 2000 edition to which an organisation can be certified. It includes all
the key points from the previous 20 elements of ISO 9001:1994, but integrates
them into four major generic business processes, namely:

management responsibility (policy, objectives, planning, system, 
review);

resource management (human resources, information, facilities);

product 
realisation 
(customer, 
design, 
purchasing, 
production, 
calibration);

measurement, analysis and improvement (audit, process/product control,
improvement).
The new structure of ISO 9001:2000 is shown in Tables 1.2–1.6.

1.5.15 Process approach
Any activity that receives inputs and converts them to outputs can be consid-
ered as a process. Often, the output from one process will directly form the
input into the next process.
For organisations to function effectively, they will have to identify and manage
numerous interlinked processes. This systematic identification and management
of the processes employed within an organisation (and particularly the interac-
tions between such processes) is referred to as the ‘process approach’.
Throughout ISO 9001:2000, the requirement for continuous improvement 
is frequently (and heavily) emphasised. ‘Continual improvement’ (i.e. in the

context of ISO 9001:2000) requires an organisation to concentrate on continu-

carrying out the policies and objectives of that organisation. With a well struc-
tured, planned process, continual improvement will respond to the growing
needs and expectations of customers and ensure a dynamic evolution of the
Quality Management System.
The following process model (shown in Figure 1.21) seeks to show how the
four major sections of ISO 9001:2000 (i.e. management responsibility, resource
management, product realisation and measurement, analysis and improvement)
interrelate and how the improvement processes continuously revolve around
all other aspects of quality management.
Continual improvement is assured by utilisation of the PDCA model devel-
oped by ISO (see Figure 1.20 above).
For clarity, the QMS requirements and management responsibilities can be
combined as shown in Figure 1.22.
Organisations seeking to change over an existing ISO 9000:1994 QMS to the
2000 edition are referred to Figure 1.23 below that shows the correlation between
the key elements from ISO 9001:1994 and the clauses of ISO 9001:2000.
Note: If your current Quality Management System is successfully imple-
mented, satisfies the needs and objectives of your organisation, reflects the way
your organisation works, addresses all of the new requirements, no changes are
required. However, if your current documented system does not address all of
the new requirements, additional documentation may be necessary.

1.5.16 Planning an organisation’s business processes
All businesses are made up of a series of processes which, when placed together,
make the business operate. In a similar manner, ISO 9001:2000 is based around

52 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses
Figure 1.23 Correlation between the clauses of ISO 9001:1994 and 
ISO 9001:2000

four generic business processes, these being management responsibility,
resource management, product and/or service realisation and measurement,
analysis and improvement. All processes within businesses will contain an 
element of these four business processes.
Processes are the keys to providing a clear understanding of what an organisa-
tion does and the quality controls it has in place to control their business activities.
ISO 9001:2000 recommends the use of ‘processes’ to define how resources and
activities are combined, controlled and converted into deliverables. As shown in
Table 1.7, there are three types of processes associated with an organisation’s QMS.

Figure 1.26 Core Business Process – Example A

56 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses
1.5.16.1 Core Business Process
A company’s organisational processes making up their QMS normally comprise a
Core Business Process supplemented by a number of supporting processes which
describe the infrastructure required to produce the contact deliverable (or 
market opportunity) on time.
The Core Business Process describes the end-to-end activities involved in pro-
ducing a contract deliverable or marketing opportunity. It commences with the def-
inition of corporate policy and ends when the product is manufactured and/or
marketed. Marketing and product information is then used to plan future strategies.
A process owner with full responsibility and authority for managing the
process and achieving process objectives should always be nominated.
1.5.16.2 Supporting processes
The Core Business Process may then (depending on the size of the business) be
supplemented by a number of supporting processes that describe the infra-
structure required to produce a deliverable on time.
These business processes could (depending on the actual organisation) be
made up of one (or all) of the following processes:

Continual improvement process;

Customer communications process;

Customer needs assessment process;

Document control process;

Internal audit process;

Purchasing process;

Record keeping process;

Regulatory research process;

Service provision process;

Training process.
Primary supporting processes
All businesses revolve around taking inputs and putting them through a series
of activities that turn them into useful outputs, be that a product or service.
These activities are the supporting processes.

Figure 1.27 Supporting processes
Of course the only way to ensure repeat orders is to control the quality of not
only the deliverable but also the organisation itself. Consequently, it is essential
that you define your quality policy and objectives for each supporting process.
For each process within the flowchart there needs to be an organisational
documentation detailing:

objective – what the process aims to achieve;

scope – what the process covers;


responsible owner – who is ultimately responsible for implementing the
process;

policy – what the organisation intends doing to ensure quality is controlled;

key performance indicators – those items of objective evidence that can
be used as a way of monitoring performance of the process;

reference to supporting system documentation (QPs and WIs).
Secondary supporting processes
In addition to primary supporting processes there may also be a number of 
secondary supporting processes that run in parallel with and support the pri-
mary supporting processes. These secondary supporting processes are equally
important as they control all other activities that may influence the quality of
the product.

60 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses
Secondary supporting processes may include such things as:

identification and provision of suitable staff;

management and support of staff;

identification and provision of information;

identification and provision of materials;

identification and provision of equipment and facilities;

management of the QMS;

continual improvement.
The purpose of secondary supporting processes is to document those activities
that are essential for supporting and achieving the primary supporting processes.
An example of a secondary supporting process is shown in Figure 1.28.
These secondary-supporting processes will have an identical structure to the
primary supporting processes, and will also have their own associated supporting
documentation (e.g. Quality Procedures (QPs) and Work Instructions (WIs)).
1.5.16.3 Interrelationship of process documentation
All processes are documented so as to provide a complete picture of how to
perform the activity to a consistent level of quality. The level of detail varies
depending whether it is a:

Process – an outline of its objective, scope and key performance indicators;

Quality Procedure – an enlargement of the process explaining how it is
controlled;

Work Instruction – the ‘fine print’ required to perform a specific activity.
Note: All these documents are explained in more detail elsewhere in this book.
Note: By using a matrix such as that shown in Figure 1.30, it is possible to
identify the parts of ISO 9001:2000 which are met by each process.
1.5.17 Brief summary of the ISO 9001:2000 standard
ISO 9001:2000 is made up of eight sections which are summarised below.
Section 1 – Scope
This short section explains what the standard covers and emphasises its pri-
mary objective of achieving customer satisfaction by meeting customer
requirements. In this context, customer satisfaction is achieved through the:

effective application of a QMS;

process for continual improvement of that system;

prevention of non-conformity.

Section 2 – Normative reference
Another short section directs the reader to other standards that form a manda-
tory input to ISO 9001:2000. In this instance the only reference is ‘ISO
9000:2000, Quality Management Systems – Fundamentals and vocabulary’.
Section 3 – Terms and definitions
This third section explains how the standard is based on the supply chain
shown in the Figure 1.31.

Section 4 – Quality management system
This basically states that an organisation shall have a documented QMS that
defines the processes necessary to ensure that the product conforms to cus-
tomer requirements. This QMS must be implemented, maintained and, most
importantly, continually improved by the organisation.
This section also clearly states the types of documentation required to com-
ply with the standard, as follows:

Quality Manual – establishing and maintaining an organisational ‘Rule
Book’;

Control of documents – establishing and maintaining a documented pro-
cedure for the control of QMS documents;

Quality records – controlling and maintaining quality records;

System level procedures – used to detail the activities needed to imple-
ment the QMS;

Procedures that clearly describe the sequence of processes necessary to
ensure the conformity of a product or service;

Instructions that describe the physical operating practices and controls
within each process.
Note: The extent of the QMS documentation (which may be in any form or
type of medium) is dependent on the:

size and type of the organisation;

complexity and interaction of the processes;

competency of personnel.
Section 5 – Management responsibility
This section consists of the majority of the old ISO 9001:1994 management
responsibility and quality requirements all rolled together. It is broken down
into the following sub-sections that cover the requirements for:

Management commitment – top (i.e. senior) management committing,
fully, to the development and improvement of the QMS. (Without their
commitment the system will fall at the first hurdle);

Customer focus – determining, fully understanding and documenting cus-
tomer requirements; ensuring compliance with identified statutory legisla-
tion (e.g. EC Directives, other national and international standards etc.);

Quality policy – ensuring that it is appropriate for the purpose, understood
by everyone and reviewed for continued suitability;

Planning – clearly stating management’s quality objectives and policy on
quality in an established, fully documented, QMS;

Administration – identifying and planning the activities and resources
required to achieve quality objectives;
62 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses


Management representative – appointing someone (or some people) to
be responsible for the implementation and improvement of the organisa-
tion’s QMS;

Management review – carrying out regular reviews of the QMS to ensure
it continues to function correctly (and to identify areas for improvement).

This section covers resources with regard to training, induction, responsibili-
ties, working environment, equipment requirements, maintenance etc. It is bro-
ken down into the following sub-sections:

Provision of resources – identifying the resources required to implement
and improve the processes that make up the QMS;

Human resources – assigning personnel with regard to competency, edu-
cation, training, skill and/or experience;

Infrastructure – identifying, providing and maintaining the workspace,
facilities, equipment (hardware and software) and supporting services to
achieve conformity of product;

Work environment – identifying and managing the work environment
(e.g. health and safety, ambient conditions etc.).
Section 7 – Product realisation
Section 7 absorbs most of the 20 elements of the old ISO 9000:1994 standard,
including process control, purchasing, handling and storage and measuring

Planning of realisation processes – clearly defining and documenting 
the processes used to ensure reliable and consistent products (e.g. verifica-
tion and validation activities, criteria for acceptability and quality 
records etc.);

Customer-related processes – identifying customer, product, legal and
design requirements;

Design and development planning – controlling the design process 
(e.g. design inputs, outputs, review, verification, validation and change
control);

Purchasing – having documented processes for the selection and control
of suppliers and the control of purchases that affect the quality of the fin-
ished product or service;


Control of monitoring and measuring devices – their control, calibration
and protection.
Section 8 – Measurement, analysis and improvement
This section absorbs the former inspection and measurement control sections
of ISO 9001:1994 and includes requirements for:

Planning – defining the requirements for measurement analysis and
improvement (including statistical analysis);

Customer satisfaction – monitoring customer satisfaction (and dissatis-
faction) as a measurement and improvement of the QMS;

Internal audits – conducting periodic internal audits to confirm continued
conformity with ISO 9001:2000;

Monitoring and measurement of processes and product – defining
processes to monitor the performance of the QMS and the products and
services delivered by the organisation;

Non-conformity – controlling non-conformity and its rectification;

Data analysis – collecting and analysing statistical data obtained from the
organisation’s measuring and monitoring activities to find areas of
improvement;

Improvement – planning for continual improvement of the QMS;

Corrective and preventive action – having available procedures to
address corrective and preventive action.
1.5.18 ISO 9004:2000 Quality Management Systems –
guidelines for performance improvement
ISO 9004:2000 provides guidance on all aspects of a QMS (including the
processes for continual improvement) that contribute to the satisfaction of an
66 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses
ISO 9004:2000
Figure 1.36 The reason for ISO 9004:2000

organisation’s customers and other interested parties. The guidance provided in
this standard is generic and is applicable to all organisations, regardless of the
type, size and the product provided. It is based on sound quality management
principles that provide an understanding of quality requirements and their
application to improve the performance of an organisation.
ISO 9004:2000, therefore, is aimed at improving an organisation’s overall
quality performance and provides a stepping stone to Total Quality
Management (TQM). In the words of the standard, ‘ISO 9004:2000 is, there-
fore, designed to go beyond quality management requirements and provide
organisations with guidelines for performance improvement through sustained
customer satisfaction’. In doing so it:

provides guidance to management on the application and use of a QMS to
improve an organisation’s overall performance;

is recommended as a guide for organisations whose management wishes to
move beyond the minimum requirements of ISO 9001:2000 in pursuit of
increased performance improvement;

defines the minimum QMS requirements needed to achieve customer sat-
isfaction by meeting specified product requirements;

can also be used by an organisation to demonstrate its capability to meet
customer requirements.
Note: ISO 9004:2000 is not a guideline for implementing ISO 9001 and is
not intended for certification, regulatory or contractual use.
1.6 Certification
1.6.1 Who can certify an organisation?
There are a number of companies (i.e. Notified Bodies and/or Registrars)
available to carry out ISO 9001:2000 certification (e.g. TÜV, BSI, SGS
Yarsley, etc.) and it really depends on where your organisation’s main market is
going to be as to which one you eventually choose.
BSI is the recognised world leader in setting quality and safety standards for
industry. BSI’s main offices are in London which, in addition to conference rooms
that host ISO committees, has a huge administration block for the update and
dissemination of standards. They also have a large library containing copies of
all the BS, EN, IEC, ISO and ANSI standards together with the majority of all
the other industrial and management standards. BSI Inc is a separate company
under US law with 11 regional offices and a corporate office in Reston, VA.
They recently acquired CEEM (the Center for Energy and Environmental
Management that was founded in Fairfax, VA, in 1979) and is now located in
their Reston offices. As well as providing the usual certification services, BSI
ISO 9000 67

Inc (through CEEM) provide training in all ISO 9000/14000 topics including
BSI’s well-established Quality Managers’ and Lead Auditors’ courses.
1.6.2 What is required for certification?
A fully documented, auditable QMS that is totally supported by senior 
management and one that is implemented throughout the organisation.
The QMS shall consist of:

a Quality Manual – describing how an organisation meets the require-
ments of ISO 9001:2000 (objectives, goals, roles, organisation and respon-
sibilities, etc.);

Processes – describing the end-to-end activities involved in project 
management;

Quality Procedures – describing the method by which the processes are
managed;

Work Instructions – describing how individual tasks and activities are
carried out.
Note: Organisations that previously used ISO 9002:1994 and ISO 9003:1994
are allowed to be certified to ISO 9001:2000 through ‘permissible exclusions’
of the standard’s requirement – i.e. by omitting those requirements that do not
apply to their particular organisation. Organisations revising their quality pol-
icy for the first time (i.e. in order to meet ISO 9001:2000 requirements) are
advised to pay particular attention to clauses 4.2.3 (c), (d) and (g).
1.6.3 Who will be responsible for quality within an
organisation?
ISO 9001:2000 requirement:
‘5.5.2 Management representative
Top management shall appoint a member of management who, 
irrespective of other responsibilities, shall have responsibility and
authority that includes:
 ensuring that processes needed for the quality management 
system are established, implemented and maintained;
 reporting to top management on the performance of the quality
management system, and any need for improvement;
 ensuring the promotion of awareness of customer requirements
throughout the organisation;
68 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses

 liaison with external parties on matters relating the quality 
management system’.
An organisation, therefore, needs a Quality Manager who has the full support
of senior management. They need to appoint someone who is fully versed in
the requirements of ISO 9001:2000 and who is capable of acting as a catalyst
and management coach. This post will initially have to be full-time whilst the
organisation is setting up their QMS, but (dependent on the size of the 
company) could probably reduce to part-time following certification.
The Quality Manager’s prime qualities should include:

approachability;

an ability to establish two-way communication with all levels of the com-
pany personnel.
The Quality Manager shall report to the Managing Director and must be 
independent of all responsibilities that may adversely affect quality 
performance.
1.7 Assistance (in the UK) for obtaining a 
Quality Management System
1.7.1 Government assistance
Following publication of the White Paper entitled ‘Standards, Quality and
International Competitiveness’ and via its National Quality Campaign, the UK
Government are also promoting the wider use of quality control, quality assur-
ance and QMSs within industry.
As part of this National Quality Campaign, the UK Government – in this
case the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) – offers assistance to small
and medium-sized companies in order to ‘bring awareness of quality through
the application of modern quality management techniques’.
1.7.1.1 DTI Business Links
Currently, over 100 Business Links (see Yellow Pages) are now open to help
small and medium companies to cut costs, to grow, increase sales and export.
They are also there to help companies operate at the leading edge of design,
quality and delivery and to face the challenge of international competition. The
President of the Board of Trade has stated that the object of Business Links is
to pool the important support services in an area to improve the effectiveness
and quality of support to customers. They are places where services are tailored
ISO 9000 69

70 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses
Business Link services include personal business advisers who work with a
company over time and put together a package of support; access to specialist
counsellors in design, exports and innovation and technology; information and
advice on grants; finance and taxation; consultancy; health checks and diag-
nostics services; export services; and training courses.
1.7.1.2 National Quality Information Centre
The National Quality Information Centre (NQIC) was set up in 1984, in con-
sultation with the DTI, to provide an information source on standards, training
courses and quality generally and to assist the DTI’s National Quality
Campaign. It is run by the Institute of Quality Assurance (IQA) with the aim 
of assisting industry and commerce in obtaining information about how to
improve quality in their activities and the products and services they provide.
The Centre’s main commercial services, in addition to enquiries, are its bib-
liography or abstracts service, quality journals from the American Society for
Quality Control and European Organisation for Quality. The Centre plans to
open a library in the near future for the benefit of those wishing to carry out
serious study.

1.7.2 Assistance for the smaller company
Most small firms are either unable or unwilling to undertake the complicated
procedures required to achieve certification and registration to ISO 9000. With
this in mind, BSI launched (in 1994) a low-cost, no-fuss BSI/QA Small
Business Service. A customer service helpline is also available to provide
assistance.
to fit individual customers’ needs and where trust is built through a long-term
relationship with a personal business adviser.

1.7.3 Assistance in setting up a Quality Management
System in America
Assistance in setting up a QMS in America may be obtained from two stan-
dards bodies. The American Society for Quality (ASQ) are responsible for
quality management systems and standards whilst the American Society
Testing & Materials (ASTM) responsibilities lie in the provision of quality 
statistics for the implementation of Total Quality Management (TQM).
1.7.3.1 American Society for Quality
The American Society for Quality (ASQ) provides:

guidelines for the selection and use of the appropriate internal quality man-
agement and external quality assurance standards. This includes clarification
of the relationships and differences between the principal quality concepts;

guidelines and recommendations for the implementation and development
of quality management and quality systems;

assistance on the particular vocabulary used within the quality manage-
ment and quality assurance fields (i.e. supplying specific terms applicable
to the preparation and use of quality management and quality assurance
standards);

details of all elements that should be considered in quality systems within
a laboratory.

shown how much importance is being placed on companies (large
and small) in having ISO 9001:2000 certification or possessing an
effective QMS that ensures they work in conformance with that
standard.
In Part Two the structure of the ISO 9000:2000 series is explained
and the various clauses and elements making up ISO 9001:2000
are reviewed.

Appendix A to Chapter 1
ISO 14001 – Environmental
Management System
What is the difference between ISO 9000 and 
ISO 14000?
Whilst both of these standards are effectively ‘generic management system
standards’, the ISO 9000 family is primarily concerned with ‘quality manage-
ment’ and:

what the organisation does to fulfil the customer’s quality requirements;

how it meets the applicable regulatory requirements;

how it enhances customer satisfaction;

how it achieves continual improvement of its performance, product and/or
serve.
On the other hand, the ISO 14000 family is an Environmental Management
System (EMS) that is aimed at continually reducing pollution (through the
more efficient and responsible use of raw materials and the minimisation of
energy usage and waste) and is concerned with how an organisation:

minimises harmful effects on the environment caused by its activities;

achieves continual improvement of its environmental performance.
Although ISO 14001 does not set performance requirements (such as emission
limits) it does provide a mandatory, auditable, framework for an Environmental
Management System. In quite a number of areas, these requirements are simi-
lar to those of ISO 9000 and other management systems (e.g. TL 9000, QS
9000, ISO 13485 and ISO/IEC 17025 etc.) and currently work is under way to
produce an integrated management system involving quality, environmental as
well as safety management.
The main difference between ISO 14001 and these other standards, however, is
that organisations must have procedures to identify, examine and evaluate all the
environmental aspects of its activities, products and services. Whilst the stan-
dard doesn’t actually specify the depth of the evaluation or the methodology
ISO 9000 73

(the only requirement is that the methodology should be appropriate!) it does,
however, suggest the use of Critical Path Project Management (CPPM), Life
Cycle Assessment (LCA) or other methodologies, such as mass-balance,
assessment of environmental loads, etc.
EMS
An EMS is a continual cycle of planning, implementing, reviewing and
improving the processes and actions that an organisation undertakes to meet its
business and environmental goals. Most EMS’s are built on the ISO 9001:2000
PDCA (Plan, Do, Check, Act) model which leads to continual improvement
based upon:

planning, including identifying environmental aspects and establishing
goals [PLAN];

implementing, including training and operational controls [DO];

checking, including monitoring and corrective action [CHECK]; and

reviewing, including progress reviews and acting to make needed changes
to the EMS [ACT].
Although ISO 14001 does not specifically require an organisation to have an
‘Environmental Manual’ it does ask them to document their ‘core system
requirements’ (which is almost the same as them needing to have a systems
manual – and so there is little difference between this and any of the other man-
agement systems really). There is also no need to appoint a separate EMS rep-
resentative and frequently this position is combined with that of the Quality
Manager or the Health and Safety Manager.
Organisations do, however, have to demonstrate that they have an auditable,
fully documented, management program in place to meet their declared objec-
tives and they need to have an established system for controlling any environ-
mental impacts caused by new or modified developments, products, services or
processes and that this program should cover all aspects of emergency respon-
sibilities and emergency planning. Other changes include:
(1) Document Control – and the specific requirement:
 for controlling documents by date;
 care and status over legal documents;
 retention of obsolete documents (providing it is absolutely clear that they
are obsolete and will not be used for current operational controls).
(2) Records – an additional requirement to maintain records to demonstrate
that the organisation’s objectives and targets have been met.
74 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses

ISO 9000 75
(3) Management review – and the specific requirement to ‘address the possi-
ble need for changes to the policy and objectives’.
Note: Unlike ISO 9001:2000, there is no requirement to audit the system for
effectiveness.
(4) Environmental management system audit – and the establishment of an
audit program to demonstrate that an organisation’s EMS complies with its
stated requirements and complies with the environmental policy.
ISO 14001:1996 replaced BS 7750:1994 (Environmental Management Systems)
and is supported by a range of related standards (see Table A1 below) to pro-
vide guidance on auditing, qualification criteria, environmental labelling and
life-cycle assessment.

EMAS
In support of ISO 14001 is the Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS)
for registering verified industrial sites, whose aim is to improve the quality of
environmental management throughout industry in Europe, by assisting com-
panies to develop environmental policies, implement them and establish a con-
tinuous programme of improvement. Companies are encouraged to
communicate their progress to the general public and participation in the
scheme which (as well as bringing valuable cost benefits) helps to improve
relations with customers, investors and insurers and provide better control of
raw materials and energy.
The EMAS scheme has proved that the adoption of an environmentally friendly
process can help reduce some of the costs associated with environmental damage
such as high insurance premiums or massive clean-up operations.

To become a member of this scheme, an organisation must demonstrate their
compliance with existing industry pollution control measures and have in place
a programme of continuous improvement that is in excess of the legal mini-
mum. Organisations must also:

have an environmental policy for the whole organisation;

complete an environmental review that covers all aspects of the industrial
site they seek to register;

have in place an environmental programme with pre-determined objectives;

produce an environmental management system defining their operating
procedures for the policy and programme;

complete an environmental audit cycle, to provide regular updates on
progress;

produce an environmental statement of progress for circulation to the 
general public;

be validated by an independent verifier.
Obtaining EMAS registration can be quite expensive (especially for small
businesses) but assistance is available via the Small Company Environmental
and Energy Management Scheme (SCEEMAS) which has been set up by the
UK Department of the Environment to assist the production of an EMS. This
scheme meets some of the costs involved for companies involved in manufac-
turing, waste disposal, recycling, mining, quarrying or power generation.
Euro Info Centres (EICs) have also been set up to help industrial SMEs
make the first move towards EMAS registration. Their Eco Management
Guide is a well thought out publication which provides arguments, technical
information, a short test to confirm an organisation’s readiness and suitability
for EMAS registration. The EIC also have available audit checklists to enable
organisations to analyse their EMS against the EMAS requirements.

Part Two
The Structure of
ISO 9001:2000
In Part One we looked at the background to the ISO 9000 standard, its
requirements and recommendations.
In Part Two the structure of ISO 9001:2000 is explained and details
provided of the various clauses and elements contained in the ISO
9001:2000 sections are reviewed.

This page intentionally left blank

2
The structure of 
ISO 9001:2000
Although the formal procedures contained in ISO 9001 are mainly used by
larger companies, there is absolutely no reason why smaller companies cannot
adapt these procedures to suit their own purposes.
For example, ISO 9001:2000 Section 7.3 states that ‘an organization shall
plan and control the design and development of a product’. Perhaps your com-
pany does not have a design office and this activity is achieved by an individ-
ual. Although all of the requirements of Section 7.3 are probably inappropriate,
the procedures are still the same – so why not use them!
A detailed description of the main sections making up ISO 9001:2000 now
follows.
2.1 Section 1 – Scope
2.1.1 Section 1.1 General
The organisation shall demonstrate its ability to:

consistently provide a product that meets cus-
tomer and regulatory requirements;

enhance customer satisfaction through the appli-
cation of their QMS.
Section 1.1 
General requirements
If there are clauses that an organisation does not
need to meet in order to fulfil the requirements of this
standard, these clauses may be excluded. They may
be due to:

the nature of the product;

customer requirements;

applicable regulatory requirements.
Section 1.2 
Permissible
exclusions
This short section contains an explanation of the contents of the standard and
states the basic requirements for achieving customer satisfaction through the
effective application of a Quality Management System (QMS).
Note: In this international standard the word ‘product’applies only to the prod-
uct intended for (or required by) a customer, product or service.
2.1.2 Section 1.2 Application

Section 1.2 emphasises that all the requirements of this International Standard
are generic and are applicable to all organisations regardless of type, size and
product provided.
If any of the requirements contained in Section 7 cannot be applied owing to the
nature of the organisation, then provided that the exclusion(s) do not affect the
organisation’s ability, or responsibility to provide a product that fulfils customer
and/or applicable regulatory requirements, then it can be considered an exclusion.
For example, if the organisation manufactures a product that does not have
any design and development input, then Clause 7.3.2 is not really relevant.
A reduction in the scope of the ISO 9001:2000 requirements is also permit-
ted for those organisations that were previously registered to ISO 9002:1994
and ISO 9003:1994 and this is achieved by omitting requirements that do not
apply to their particular organisation.
In all cases, they may be excluded provided that the reason(s) why they are
not entirely applicable to that particular organisation are fully documented in
the organisation’s Quality Manual.
Note: The only clauses that may be excluded from ISO 9001:2000 are those
from Section 7.
2.2 Section 2 – Normative reference
82 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses
This section lists standards that form a mandatory
input to ISO 9001:2000.
Section 2 
Normative reference
In addition to those terms defined within ISO
9000:2000, an organisation shall make a note of the
specific terms used to describe the supply chain.
Section 3 
Terms and definitions
This short section requires an organisation to take into consideration ISO
9000:2000: Quality Management Systems – Fundamentals and vocabulary,
when applying ISO 9001:2000.
2.3 Section 3 – Terms and definitions
This section covers the specific use of terminology to describe the supply chain.
The word ‘product’ is defined so as to cover all manufacturing and service
outputs and so, whenever the term ‘product’ occurs, it can also mean ‘service’.
In this particular ISO standard, the definition of a product is ‘the result of a
process’. A product may be defined as:

hardware;

software;


services;

processed materials.
The definition of a supply chain is shown in Figure 2.1.
Note: Most products are, of course, combinations of one of these four generic
product categories and whether the combined product is then called hardware,
processed material, software or service depends on the dominant element. For
example, if the product were an ‘automobile’, it would consist of hardware
(e.g. tyres), processed materials (e.g. fuel, cooling liquid), software (e.g. engine
control software, driver’s manual), and service (e.g. operating explanations
given by the salesman).
2.4 Section 4 – Quality Management System
Section 4 of ISO 9001:2000 covers the requirements for all organisations to
establish, document, implement, maintain and continually improve a QMS in
accordance with the requirements of this standard.
It is broken down into the following sub clauses:

Quality Manual – establishing and maintaining an organisational ‘Rule
Book’;

Control of documents – establishing and maintaining a documented pro-
cedure for the control of QMS documents;

Quality records – controlling and maintaining quality records.
Note: The extent of the QMS documentation (which may be in any form or
type of medium) is dependent on the:

size and type of the organisation;

complexity and interaction of the processes;

competency of personnel.
The structure of ISO 9001:2000 83
SUPPLIER
ORGANISATION
CUSTOMER
The company producing a product or
providing a service. A group of people
and facilities with an orderly arrangement
of responsibilities, authorities and
relationships.
The recipient of the product or service.
The ultimate consumer, user, client,
beneficiary or second party.
The company (producer,
distributor, importer, assembler or
service organisation) that provides a
product or service to the customer.
Note:  The supplier may be either 
          external or internal to the
          organisation.
Figure 2.1 The supply chain

The organisation shall establish, document, imple-
ment, maintain and continually improve a QMS, that
ensures and covers:

identification of processes;

their operation and control;

the availability of resources and information;

measurement, monitoring, analyse and support;

achievement of planned results;

continual improvement;

management (in accordance with the requirements
of ISO 9001:2000).
Proof
A definition of the processes necessary to ensure that
a product conforms to customer requirements which
is capable of being implemented, maintained and
improved.
Section 4.1 
General requirements
Note: The term ‘Organisation’ replaces the term ‘Supplier’ (previously used in
ISO 9001:1994) and refers to the unit to which this International Standard
applies. In addition, the term ‘Supplier’– now replaces the term ‘Subcontractor’.
2.4.1 Section 4.1 General requirements
84 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses
The management of any organisation will rely on a number of different man-
agement disciplines, the most important of which, is quality management. As
this is the core of all organisational structures, the activities and processes that
affect performance improvement will need to be described and defined by
management. They will also need to ensure that they are clearly understood by

the whole workforce, monitored (i.e. to evaluate improvement on a continuing
basis) and managed. Self-assessment can be a very useful tool to evaluate
improvement and ISO 9004:2000 helps organisations by providing an annex
containing ‘Guidelines for self-assessment’.
Note: For the assistance of small businesses, I have also included a section (see
Part Seven) on ‘self-assessment’ which includes check sheets against the
requirements of ISO 9001:2000 and examples of Stage Audit checklists.
An organisation’s self-assessment should be completed on a regular 
basis. Indeed, the use of self-assessment methodology can provide an overall
view of the performance of the organisation and the degree of maturity of 
its QMS. It can also help to identify areas that need improving and determine
priorities.
2.4.2 Section 4.2 Documentation requirements
2.4.2.1 Section 4.2.1 General
The structure of ISO 9001:2000 85
The QMS documentation shall include:

a Quality Manual;

specific statements regarding quality policy and
quality objectives;

documented procedures that clearly describe the
sequence of processes necessary to ensure the
conformity of the product;

documented instructions to ensure the effective
operation and control of the processes;

quality records.
Section 4.2 
General
documentation
requirements
As ISO 9001:2000 is a generic requirements standard it doesn’t state exactly
what an organisation’s quality documentation should look like. It merely pro-
vides details of the mandatory requirements and then leaves it up to the organ-
isation to determine the appropriate documentation to suit their own size and
type of business. This is a good point to be remembered by small businesses
who, whilst wanting to ‘work in conformance with the requirements of ISO
9001:2000’ do not necessarily see the need for their system to be certified
against that standard.
Thus the QMS documentation and records can be in any form or in any
media provided that they meet:

the needs of that particular organisation;

customer and contractual requirements;

the relevant international, national, regional and industry sector standards;

the relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.

2.4.2.2 Section 4.2.2 Quality Manual
86 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses
The organisation shall:

establish and maintain a Quality Manual;

include details of any ISO 9001:2000 exclusions;

include 
details 
of 
associated 
documented 
procedures;

indicate the sequence and interaction of processes.
Proof
A document which describes an organisation’s quality
policies, procedures and practices that makes up
their Quality Management System.
Likely documentation
A controlled document (i.e. Quality Manual) contain-
ing everything related to quality control and quality
assurance within an organisation.
Section 4.2.2 
Quality Manual
One of the requirements of ISO 9001:2000 (see Section 4.2.1) is to define the doc-
umentation required to support an organisation’s QMS. The primary purpose of
this quality documentation is to express the quality policy and describe the QMS.
This documentation serves as the basis for implementing and maintaining the sys-
tem and should be capable of controlling the effective operation of the QMS.
Details of the quality documentation are usually found in an organisation’s
Quality Manual, which will provide information about all of the quality pol-
icies, processes, and their associated Quality Procedures (QPs) and Work
Instructions (WIs). Depending on the size of the organisation, the Quality
Manual will also, probably, include standard formats for data collection, data
reporting and quality records. It will also have to show (and justify) if certain
requirements from ISO 9001:2000 have been omitted.
There are no set rules about what should or should not be included in a Quality
Manual. It all rather depends on the structure and business of the organisation
concerned. As a Quality Consultant, I always recommend that organisations
address each requirement contained in ISO 9001:2000 separately, and in turn, to
ensure that none of the essential (i.e. mandatory requirements) are left out. As
previously described, organisations are allowed to leave out the non-relevant sec-
tions of ISO 9001:2000 provided, that is, that the relevant detail and reasons are
included in the organisation’s Quality Manual. At Part Six I have provided a com-
plete example of a Quality Manual together with a number of example QPs and
WIs which can be used as a template for your own Quality Manual.
Note: For your assistance, a soft copy of this ‘generic QMS’ is available, please
see p. xviii for details of how to obtain these files. If you then wish to customise
this publication to suit your own purposes, the easiest method is to instruct your
computer (using the ‘find and replace all’ facility) to replace ‘Stingray QMC’
with your own company’s name. Each section of the Quality Manual and all of
the QPs and WIs should then be read and carefully modified so that it reflects
your own company’s business.

‘ray@herne.org.uk’.
2.4.2.3 Section 4.2.3 Control of documents
The structure of ISO 9001:2000 87
The organisation shall instigate a documented proce-
dure for the quality control of documents. This proce-
dure shall include processes for:

controlled distribution of documents;

approval of documents prior to issue;

review, updating and re-approval of documents;

identifying the current revision status of documents;

ensuring that only relevant versions of applicable
documents are available at points of use;

ensuring that documents remain legible, readily
identifiable and retrievable;

identifying, distributing and controlling documents
from an external source;

controlling obsolete documents.
Proof

Section 4.2.3 
Control of documents
ISO 9001:2000 requires an organisation to establish and maintain procedures
for the control of all their documents and data (i.e. hard copy as well as elec-
tronic media) especially those relating to quality assurance and quality control.
Indeed, where the term ‘documented procedure’ appears within ISO
9001:2000, this requires the procedure to be established, documented, imple-
mented and maintained.
All documentation used by the organisation in support of its QMS and/or the
execution of a contract (e.g. specifications, customer orders, plans, drawings,
manuals, operating procedures, national and international standards and codes
of practice etc.) must be controlled to ensure that:

they are issued to the appropriate personnel;

they are revised and reissued as necessary;

all obsolete versions are removed from the point of use.
Value of documentation
Documentation enables communication of intent and consistency of action. It
is therefore a necessary element within a QMS and its use contributes to:

achievement of product quality and quality improvement;

provision of appropriate training;


ensured repeatability and traceability;

provision of objective evidence;

evaluation of the effectiveness of the system.
The production of documentation should not be an end in itself but should be a
value-adding activity.
Quality Manual
Normally the Quality Manual and it associated processes, procedures, plans
and instructions are maintained by the Quality Manager who ensures that the
appropriate items, at the correct revision levels, are issued (or at least made
available) to all who need them within the organisation.
Support documentation
National and international standards, codes of practice and so on should (in
large organisations) normally be maintained by the General Manager and/or
the Engineers who would then be responsible for ensuring that the appropriate
documents are available within the organisation and that they are issued at the
correct revision levels. External suppliers of documentation should be con-
tacted on a regular basis to ascertain that the documents held remain current.
Document distribution
The distribution of standard documents should be controlled and recorded on
distribution lists, which also show the current issue status. A master list of all
documents should be maintained which clearly shows the current status of
each document. This list needs to be available at all locations where operations
effective to the functioning of the QMS are performed and this distribution list
needs to be reviewed and updated as changes occur and all invalid and/or obso-
lete documents/data must be immediately removed.
Document changes
All changes (e.g. modified wording, new procedures to be adopted etc.) that
need to be made to a previously issued document or data should, ideally, be
approved by the same person who performed the original review and approval.
Where appropriate, the nature of the change should be indicated on the document
and master copies of the revised documents retained as records of the changes.
Contract documents
Each contract should have a separate file which contains all the relevant infor-
mation applicable to that contract.

dure for the:

The structure of ISO 9001:2000 89
Section 4.2.4 
Control of records
The question is often asked, why bother to keep records?
Nothing is worse than ordering a product or service, finding a firm to meet
the delivery time, but then not being able to use it because the relevant docu-
mentation (for example a specific working instruction), has still to arrive. It is,
therefore, vitally important for the supplier to ensure that the documentation
for the assembly, installation, commissioning and operation of a deliverable are
provided to the purchaser well before delivery and that these are both compre-
hensive and clear.
The progress of a product throughout its life cycle, its many maintenance
cycles, during storage and operational use etc. will doubtless produce a consid-
erable amount of records. Product improvement relies heavily on the availabil-
ity of records such as the results of previous audit reports, customer feedback
and failure reports gathered in the design office and from the shop floor. From
a contract point of view, the maintenance of a complete historical record of all
the alterations made to a contract, concessions allowed, variations permitted by
the purchaser and specifications changed need to be recorded. Indeed it is usu-
ally a contract requirement for organisations to have available, at all times, suf-
ficient records to be able to demonstrate that their products continue to comply
with the relevant contract requirements and specifications. Quality records that
can be analysed to provide inputs for corrective and preventive action, process
improvements etc. are also very important to the quality of the product.
The above are only a few of the examples which show why records should
be maintained and ISO 9001:2000 makes it a mandatory requirement that all
records that are required for the QMS shall be controlled.
2.5 Section 5 – Management responsibility


Quality policy – ensuring that it is appropriate for the purpose, understood
by everyone and reviewed for continued suitability;

Planning – clearly stating management’s quality objectives and policy on
quality in an established, fully documented, QMS;

Responsibility, authority and communication – identifying and planning

Section 5.1 
Management
commitment
Top management should always try to create an environment where people are
fully involved and in which their QMS can operate effectively. They should use
the principles of quality management as a basis for:

establishing the organisation’s quality policies and quality objectives;

ensuring that customer requirements are recognised;

ensuring that processes are available (and implemented) that enable customer
requirements to be fulfilled and quality objectives to be achieved;

ensuring that an effective QMS is established, implemented and maintained
to achieve these objectives;

ensuring the availability of necessary resources;

comparing the achieved results against the quality objectives that were set
by top management;


evaluating the ongoing effectiveness of their organisation’s quality policies
and quality objectives;

deciding on actions for improvement;

defining responsibilities and authorities – e.g. the person or persons
responsible for managing, performing and verifying that the end product
meets the organisation’s quality requirements;

nominating a management representative (or representatives – depends on
the size of the organisation) for quality matters.

Section 5.2 
Customer focus
To satisfy customer requirements, organisations must fully understand the cus-
tomer’s current (and future) needs and expectations. In an ideal world, of
course, management should always attempt to exceed their customers’ needs
and expectations and in so doing, stand to gain follow-on orders. To define 
customer and end-user needs and expectations, an organisation should:

identify its customers (including potential customers);

determine the customer’s key product characteristics;

identify and assess market competition;

identify opportunities and weaknesses;

define financial and future competitive advantages;

ensure that the organisation has sufficient knowledge of the statutory and
regulatory requirements (and is capable of implementing them);

identify the benefits to be achieved from exceeding compliance;

identify the role of the organisation in the protection of community 
interests.
In addition to their customers’ needs and expectations, organisations may also
have a number of other ‘interested parties’ whose needs and expectations will

also have to be addressed. For quality management purposes, these interested
parties may include:

people within the organisation;

owners, partners, investors and shareholders;

suppliers;

the general public.
The needs and expectations of these interested parties will be similar to the
customers except that they will be more directed to recognition, work satis-
faction, competencies and development of knowledge. Involving motivated 
people in the finalisation of a product can be a key to success!
2.5.3 Section 5.3 Quality policy
The structure of ISO 9001:2000 93
The organisation’s quality policy shall be:

controlled;

appropriate;

communicated and understood throughout the
organisation;

capable of continual improvement;

a framework for establishing and reviewing quality
objectives;

regularly reviewed.

Section 5.3 
Quality Policy
Quality policies and quality objectives need to be established in order to pro-
vide a general focus for the organisation. Policies and objectives determine the
intended results and assist the organisation in applying its resources to achieve
these results.
First step
The first step that an organisation must take is to define and document its qual-
ity management policy. That is, produce a mission statement that covers the
organisation’s objectives for quality and its commitment to quality. This quality
policy must be relevant to the company’s organisational goals and take into
account the expectations and needs of the customer. The organisation then

needs to ensure that its quality management policy is understood and imple-
mented by all staff members and use it to provide confidence that the application
of management (as described in the Quality Manual) is efficient, comprehen-
sive and effective in ensuring that the organisation delivers the right product:

on time;

to the agreed specifications;

within budget.
The purpose and benefits of establishing a quality policy and 
quality objectives
The organisation’s quality policy should always be to achieve ‘sustained, prof-
itable growth by providing products which consistently satisfy the needs and
expectations of its customers’. This level of quality can be achieved by adopt-
ing a system of procedures that reflect the competence of the organisation to
existing customers potential customers and independent auditing authorities
and which is aimed at:

maintaining an effective QMS that complies with ISO 9001:2000;

achieving and maintaining a level of quality which enhances the organisa-
tion’s reputation with customers;

ensuring compliance with all the relevant statutory and safety requirements;

endeavouring, at all times, to maximise customer satisfaction with the
products provided by the organisation.
Quality policy structure
Summarised, the quality management policy shall include the requirement that:

clear responsibilities for each activity and development task are identified;

each organisational activity is defined and controlled by a Quality Process,
Quality Procedure (QP) or Quality Plan;

staff are trained to the requirements listed in the company’s Quality
Manual;

compliance with company procedures detailed in the Quality Manual and
associated Quality Plans are audited;

remedial action is taken whenever appropriate;

the QPs contained in the Quality Manual and associated Quality Plans them-
selves are regularly reviewed.
Quality Management System review
One of the responsibilities of top management is to carry out regular systematic
evaluations of their organisation’s QMS to confirm its continued suitability,
adequacy, effectiveness and efficiency with regard to their organisation’s qual-
ity policy and objectives. This review should include the need to adapt and
94 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses

respond to changing needs, customer expectations, the market it serves and
include details of any remedial actions that are required.
2.5.4 Section 5.4 Planning

Section 5.4
Planning
Having defined its overall business objectives, the organisation is then in a
position to define its quality objectives and to plan the resources etc. that they
will need to meet these objectives.
2.5.4.1 Section 5.4.1 Quality objectives
Note: Normally these will be found in the Quality Manual.
The overall quality objectives of the organisation need to be firmly established
during the planning stage and then circulated to all personnel involved so that
they can easily translate them into individual (and achievable) contributions.
These objectives should be periodically reviewed and should:

be relevant to the various levels and functions within the organisation;

be consistent with the organisation’s quality policy;

be capable of being measured.

They should consider:

current and future requirements;

the markets served;

the output from management previous reviews;

current product and process performance;

the required (and anticipated) levels of satisfaction of all interested parties.
2.5.4.2 Section 5.4.2 Quality management system planning
96 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses

Quality management
system planning
Having defined its quality objectives, the next step will be to plan how to meet
these objectives (i.e. the processes, resources, responsibilities, methodologies,
procedures etc. that will be needed). As ISO is quick to point out ‘Quality plan-
ning is an integral part of the QMS’ and so organisations should take into care-
ful consideration the:

needs and expectations of the customers;

required product performance;

previous experiences and lessons learned;

improvement opportunities;

risk assessment;

performance indicators;

results of reviews and the need for change control;

the need for documentation and records.
Customer satisfaction and quality can only be achieved by operating in accor-
dance with the documented QMS. Specific customer requirements need to be
identified and documented during the contract review process and these
requirements need to be communicated and achieved in order to ensure 
customer satisfaction.

ested parties and in such a way that is consistent with the organisation’s size,
culture and products.
The following sub-sections describe how an organisation’s QMS should be
administered.

Section 5.5.1
Responsibility and
authority
The QMS is effectively the organisation’s rule book. As such it has to be
accepted and implemented by everyone. There needs to be a feeling of involve-
ment and commitment in achieving the organisation’s quality objectives, from
top management right down to the newest employee. Personnel need, however,
to know exactly what they are responsible for and so management must clearly
define functions, levels of responsibility and authority for all personnel, in
order to implement and maintain their QMS effectively and efficiently.
It is essential that top management ensures that the responsibilities, author-
ities (and their relationship) for documenting, planning and implementing the
QMS are defined and communicated throughout the organisation.

Top management should continually review the organisation’s resources to
ensure that adequate staff, equipment and materials are available to meet cus-
tomer requirements. All staff should be allocated authority to perform their
allocated responsibilities and they should have a share in the responsibility for
identifying non-compliance or possible improvements and recording these
instances so that that corrective action can be taken, both to rectify the imme-
diate situation and to prevent recurrence.
2.5.5.2 Section 5.5.2 Management representative
98 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses
The organisation shall appoint a member who, irre-
spective of all other duties, is responsible for:

establishing, administering and maintaining the
QMS processes;

and improvements to the organisation’s QMS;


Section 5.5.2
Management
representative
Whilst top management can all agree that they going to have a QMS, they need
to nominate someone from within management (and at managerial level) with
responsibility and authority to see its successful implementation. This person
(usually referred to as the Quality Manager) is responsible for:

ensuring that the organisation’s QMS is (at all times) relevant, effective 
and appropriate – usually achieved by completing internal quality audits
(see 8.2.2).

ensuring that the organisation meets the customer’s quality requirements;

ensuring that all personnel are aware and capable of meeting and (when
required) administering the organisation’s quality processes;

producing and maintaining the quality documentation (i.e. procedures and
instructions) required for those processes;

managing, performing and verifying that the end product meets the 
company’s quality requirements;

supplying regular reports to top management on the performance of the
QMS and making recommendations for its improvement;

liaising with external parties on all matters relating to the QMS.

Section 5.5.3 
Internal
communication
To ensure the continued effectiveness of the organisation’s QMS, it is impor-
tant that everyone involved in the implementation of the system is aware of the
Quality Processes that have been agreed by management. It is the responsibil-
ity of the Quality Manager (as management’s representative) to inform every-
one about the requirements, objectives and accomplishments of and from the
Quality Processes. There are no set rules about how this sort of information
should be distributed; it really depends on how the organisation is set up.
Choices can include (but not necessarily be restricted to) team briefings,
organisational meetings, notice boards, in-house journals/magazines, audio-
visual and other forms of e-information systems.
2.5.6 Section 5.6 Management review

Section 5.6
Management review
Although, when first written, an organisation’s QMS is assumed to cover all even-
tualities, doubtless there are parts of the system that will need further definition.

100 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses
ISO 9001:2000 has recognised this possibility and has made it a mandatory
requirement for top management to complete a review of their organisation’s
QMS (for continued suitability and effectiveness) on a bi-annual basis.
Records of these reviews should be retained and details of all actions agreed,
allocated and minuted.
The objective of these management reviews is to establish that the QMS:

is achieving the expected results;

meets the organisation’s requirements;

conforms to the requirements of ISO 9001:2000;

continues to satisfy the customers needs and expectations;

is functioning in accordance with the established operating procedures;

is capable of identifying irregularities, defects and/or weaknesses in the
system (and to evaluate possible improvements).
During the review, management will also review:

the effectiveness of previous corrective actions;

the adequacy and suitability of the QMS for current and future operations
of the organisation;

any complaints received, identify the cause and recommend corrective
action if required;

previous internal and external audits and identify any areas of recurring
problems or potential improvements;

reports of non-conforming items and trend information to identify possible
improvements.
Evaluation and auditing
When evaluating a QMS, there are four basic questions that should be asked in
relation to every process being evaluated.

is the process identified and appropriately described?

are responsibilities assigned?

are the procedures implemented and maintained?

is the process effective in providing the required results?
There are three basic types of audit to choose from:

First-party audits – conducted by, or on behalf of, the organisation itself
for internal purposes and which can form the basis for an organisation’s
self-declaration of conformity.

Second-party audits – conducted by customers of the organisation or by
other persons on behalf of the customer.

Third-party audits – conducted by external independent audit service
organisations. Such organisations, usually accredited, provide certification
or registration of conformity with requirements such as those of ISO

9001:2000. (See ISO 9001:2000 Section 8.2.2 Internal audit for further
information).
2.5.6.1 Section 5.6.1 General
The structure of ISO 9001:2000 101

Section 5.6.1 
General
Management need to establish a process for periodically reviewing the organi-
sation’s QMS to ensure that it continues to meet the requirements of ISO
9001:2000, agrees with the organisation’s policies and objectives and con-
tinues to provide customer satisfaction. Current performance, client feedback
and opportunities for improvement all need to be evaluated and possible alter-
ations have to be made to the relevant quality documentation analysed.
It is essential that records are retained of all these management reviews and
that any change that might have an effect on existing work practices is sub-
jected to a change control procedure.
2.5.6.2 Section 5.6.2 Review input
The input to management reviews shall include results
from:

earlier management reviews (e.g. follow-up actions);

previous internal, third-party and external audits;

regulatory changes and environmental conditions for their affect on their prod-
uct. Inputs would include, but are not restricted to:

results from previous internal, customer and third-party audits;

analysis of customer feedback;


The aim of completing management reviews is to provide a continuing record
of the organisation’s capability to produce quality products that meet the qual-
ity objectives, policies and requirements (contained in their QMS) and which
continue to provide customer satisfaction.
Review output should be centred on:

improved product and process performance;

conformation of resource requirements and organisational structure;

meeting market needs;

risk management;

change control;

continued compliance with relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.
The actual management review process should also be evaluated to confirm its
continued effectiveness and a complete record of all reviews must be retained
for future use.


Provision of resources – identifying the resources required to implement
and improve the processes that make up the QMS;

Human resources – assigning personnel with regard to competency, 
education, training, skill and experience;

Infrastructure – identifying, providing and maintaining the workspace,
facilities, equipment (hardware and software) and supporting services to
achieve conformity of product;

to implement and improve their QMS and its associated quality processes.
Resources can include (but not be limited to):

natural resources;

tangible resources (e.g. support facilities);

intangible resources (e.g. intellectual property);

future resources;

organisational resources;

information management systems;



resources to encourage continual improvement.
Suppliers
A complete historical record should be maintained by an organisation to regis-
ter any variations to the contract, any concessions made, variations allowed by
the purchaser and specifications altered. The design office often carries out
this activity.
In a similar manner, suppliers must provide the purchasers with an assurance
that they are capable of continuing to supply logistic support for the lifetime of
the product. This logistic support may include the provision of spares, updating
of documentation, details of product improvement etc., depending upon the
purchaser’s requirements.

Section 6.2 
Human resources
Human resources are the principal method of achieving product completion
and customer satisfaction. The old adage ‘a happy worker is a good worker’still
stands true in this age of information technology and with the increased training
and education opportunities currently available, highly motivated, well quali-
fied personnel are at a premium. To employ and retain the right sort of person
for the job, management must, when determining the resources required, ade-
quately define their responsibilities and authorities, establish their individual
and team objectives and encourage recognition and reward. They must also:

consider career planning and On-The-Job training (OJT);

encourage innovation and effective teamwork;

make use of information technology;

measure people satisfaction.

The organisation is responsible for ensuring that all personnel are trained and
experienced to the extent necessary to undertake their assigned activities and
responsibilities effectively. Thus, whenever training needs have been identi-
fied, top management should endeavour to make the relevant training available
and full records must be maintained of all training undertaken by employees.
Most organisations will recruit employees who are already well qualified
and quite capable of meeting the relevant technical, skill, experience and edu-
cational requirements of the organisation. There will still, however, be a need
for some additional system or contract-specific training and all staff have a
responsibility for identifying and recommending the training needs of others
and for ensuring that all employees allocated specific tasks are suitably quali-
fied and experienced to execute those tasks.
It is very important that an organisation’s staff receive sufficient training 
to enable them to carry out their functions. Organisations should, therefore,
determine the competence levels required, assess the competence of its people
and develop plans to close any gaps. Then, based on an analysis of the present 
and expected needs of the organisation (compared with the existing 
competence of its people and the requirements of related legislation, regulation,
standards, and directives) determine the type and amount of training required.
Training plan
Training should cover the organisation’s policies and objectives and, as well as
having introductory programmes for new people, there should also be available
periodic refresher programmes for people already trained. The training should
emphasise the importance of meeting requirements and the needs of customers
and other interested parties. It should also include an awareness of the conse-
quences to the organisation and its people of failing to meet the requirements.

tion and controlled improvement.

Work environment

108 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses
An organisation’s work environment is a combination of human factors (e.g. work
methodologies, achievement and involvement opportunities, safety rules and
guidance, ergonomics etc.) and physical factors (e.g. heat, hygiene, vibration,
noise, humidity, pollution, light, cleanliness and air flow). All of these factors
influence motivation, satisfaction and performance of people and as they have
the potential for enhancing the performance of the organisation, they must be
taken into consideration by the organisation when evaluating product confor-
mance and achievement.
2.7 Section 7 – Product realisation
This section absorbs most of the 20 elements of the old ISO 9000:1994 standard,
including process control, purchasing, handling and storage, and measuring
devices. It is broken down into a number of sub-sections that cover the require-
ments for:

processes used to ensure reliable and consistent products (e.g. verification
and validation activities, criteria for acceptability and quality records etc.);

The organisation shall plan and develop the processes
needed for product realisation.These shall include:

product, contract quality objectives and requirements;


Section 7.1 
Planning and
realisation
A process can be represented as a flow of activities consisting of three separate
elements as shown in Figure 2.6.
Realisation processes result in the products of an organisation. Support
processes include all the other management processes that are necessary to the
organisation, but do not directly add any value. To ensure product realisation,
therefore, consideration should be given to desired outputs, process steps,
activities, workflow, control measures, training needs, equipment, methodolo-
gies, information, materials and other resources. In fact, anything that might
have an effect on the output.

110 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses
Identification of processes
The organisation needs to identify the processes required to realise products
that satisfy the requirements of customers and a plan has to be defined to man-
age these processes, especially their input and output stages. The documenta-
tion that describes how the QMS processes are applied for a specific product,
project or contract is usually contained in a separate Quality Plan.
In ISO 9001:2000 the organisation is recommended to identify and plan all
of the production, installation and servicing processes that directly affect qual-
ity. Procedures should be available to ensure that these processes are completed
under controlled conditions especially with respect to special processes such as
those for defining work to be carried out where no previous procedure exists.
Process planning
Special equipment or environmental conditions; compliance with relevant
standards (national, European and international); criteria for workmanship
(e.g. written standards, representative samples or illustrations) need to be
planned. Procedures must be available to ensure that there is an appropriate
system for the maintenance of equipment to ensure a continuing process capa-
bility. Records of all these procedures and processes must be maintained, 
controlled and fully documented.
Indeed, all productive work should be planned and undertaken in accordance
with the organisation’s procedures and any specific documents that have been
detailed for that particular contract (e.g. contract specifications).

2.7.2 Section 7.2 Customer-related processes
The structure of ISO 9001:2000 111
Before entering into a contract situation, an organisation needs to find out exactly
what the customer wants in terms of product specification, availability, delivery,
support etc. It also needs to confirm that it has sufficient resources to complete the
contract and is capable of satisfying the customer’s requirements, in full.
2.7.2.1 Section 7.2.1 Determination of requirements related to
the product
The organisation shall establish procedures for the:

identification of customer requirements;


On receipt of an order and/or contract, the organisation should thoroughly
review it to ensure:

customer requirements are fully understood and documented;

the organisation has the ability to meet the customer’s requirements;

any differences between a quotation and the order are identified and resolved.
The customer’s requirements can include many elements (e.g. product, options,
delivery method, terms of contract, method of payment etc.) and the organisa-
tion’s ability to meet these requirements will rely on:

people and their skills, experience and motivation;

production tools and equipment;

raw materials;

112 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses

stock availability;

Once the organisation has successfully proved to the customer that their QMS
is acceptable (see preceding paragraphs), the next step is to commence contract
negotiations.
2.7.2.2 Section 7.2.2 Review of requirements related to 
the product
Prior to submission of a tender or acceptance of a
contract, the organisation shall ensure that:

contract requirements have been fully established;

all requirements differing from those previously
expressed are resolved;

the organisation has the ability to meet defined
requirements.

Section 7.2.2 
Review of requirements
related to the product 
Most organisations will offer their standard products in a catalogue for the cus-
tomer to make a selection from. These products will be identified against a
design specification and normally be accompanied by a picture and/or tech-
nical description. Most organisations will also usually be willing to provide
system-specific products to suit individual customer requirements. These spe-
cialist service requirements will differ from one customer to another (and from
one contract to another) and will, therefore, possibly need to be covered by an
individual tender, quotation and/or contract.
The contract document
The contract will specify which part of ISO 9001:2000 is to be used, what por-
tions can be deleted and what additional conditions have to be inserted. The
contract will also specify the use of quality plans, quality programs, quality
audit plans and other relevant technical specifications.
Once the customer has accepted a proposal, or an order is placed, it should
be recorded and reviewed in order to establish that the requirements of the
order are adequately defined and documented. Any differences from the pro-
posal should be resolved and the organisation should have established that they
are fully capable of meeting and satisfying the customer’s requirements. Most
of the larger organisations will rely on some form of computerised order 

The structure of ISO 9001:2000 113
processing system to ensure rapid fulfilment of customer orders. Whilst this is
a preferred method, it is not an essential ISO 9001:2000 requirement.
Contract signature
Before signature, both parties must thoroughly review the contract and be
absolutely sure that:

the QMS requirements are fully understood;

all the requirements, clauses and provisions are complete, unambiguous,
mutually acceptable (considering the economics and risks in their respect-
ive situations);

the requirements are adequately documented and defined;

the organisation is able to meet all the contractual requirements.
Where product requirements are changed, the organisation shall ensure that the
relevant documentation is amended and that the relevant personnel are made
aware of the changed requirements. Where the customer provides no docu-
mented statement of requirement, the customer requirements must be con-
firmed before acceptance.
Any requirement differing from those in the original enquiry or tender
should be resolved at this stage and it must be confirmed that all the contract-
ual requirements can be met.
Servicing
Most service practices will vary widely between suppliers, distributors and users.
If servicing is to be provided, or is required as part of the contract, then the sup-
plier must establish procedures for controlling and authenticating the quality of
the service performed and ensure that they meet the required standards.
2.7.2.3 Section 7.2.3 Customer communication
The organisation shall have procedures available to:

provide customers with product information;

handle, customer enquiries, contracts or order
handling including amendments;

cover customer feedback and/or customer com-
plaints.
Proof
How an organisation communicates (i.e. liaises) with
their customers, keeps them informed (of product
progress etc.) and handles their enquiries and
complaints.
Likely documentation

Section 7.2.3
Customer
communication

The need to maintain open lines of communication with the customer cannot
be over-emphasised and procedures should be put in place to ensure that the
customer is kept fully up-to-date with the progress of their product/contract
and that all customer comments and complaints are dealt with in a speedy and
effective manner.
2.7.3 Section 7.3 Design and development
114 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses
Design is usually meant to mean the production of something new, although it
can, in many circumstances, be a variation of an existing product or service. It
could, therefore, be a new product or it could be a system made up of a variety
of products. Either way, a process or design plan needs to be developed that
confirms:

what the customer needs;

what the boundaries are (e.g. customer requirements);

how the organisation is going to achieve it;

how long it will take;

who will undertake the task;

who will check and verify the product.
The organisation shall develop procedures for design
and development:


Section 7.3.1 
Design and
development planning
The best production methods cannot compensate for an inadequate or
mediocre design! Quality cannot be an ‘add on’; it has to be designed into 
a product before it is manufactured and the only way of achieving that is through
careful planning and controlled documentation throughout the design stage.
Whether the responsibility for the design of a product rests purely with the sup-
plier, the purchaser, or is a joint function, it is essential that the designer is fully
aware of the exact requirements of the project and has a sound background knowl-
edge of all the proper standards, information and procedures that will be required.
Functions of the design office
The functions of the design office are extremely important for they will not
only influence the maintenance of quality throughout the manufacturing
process, but also play a major part in setting the quality level of the final prod-
uct. If there is no quality control in the drawing office, what chance is there of
ever having quality on the shop floor? When the engineers are trying to manu-
facture something to a set of drawings that have countless mistakes on them,
how on earth can they be expected to produce an acceptable item!
Note: The same applies to the production of a service.
Thus, in close co-operation with the marketing, sales and manufacturing sec-
tions, the design office prepares business and performance specifications, sets tar-
get dates, provides technical specifications, reviews drawings, produces overall
schemes to the estimating section, discusses these schemes with the manufactur-
ing section and develops the design in conjunction with other supplier functions.

Design criteria
Design criteria will have to be clarified, documented and recorded in the
design plan and used for reference throughout the design process. The level of
detail on the design plan will vary depending upon the type and size of system,
but at all times it should contain sufficient detail to control the design process
in accordance with the customer’s requirements. Where items require interpre-
tation (e.g. positioning, practicality, maintainability, etc.) they will need to be
reviewed prior to design finalisation.
2.7.3.2 Section 7.3.2 Design and development inputs
116 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses
Product requirement inputs shall be defined, docu-
mented and include:

information derived from previous similar designs;

other requirements essential for design and

environmental requirements;

health and safety aspects.
Section 7.3.2 
Design and
development inputs
Following initial contract approval, details of all the relevant standards, speci-
fications and specific customer requirements that are going to be used during
production will have to be identified and steps taken to ensure that they are
available. Procedures will have to be established and maintained in order to
make certain that the functions of the design office are in agreement with the
specified requirements. Any incomplete, ambiguous or conflicting require-
ments must be resolved at this stage and revisions of the specification reviewed
and agreed by both parties.
The design input items are documented on the design plan and reviewed by
the designer prior to commencing design process. Where ambiguity exists, the
designer will need to clarify this with customer and document the results.
Design input may consist of:

national/international codes of practice;

customer supplied documents, drawings, specifications and samples;


statutory regulations;

previous and/or similar designs.
Process inputs for product design and/or development can be divided into three
categories:
1.
internal – policies, standards, specifications, skill and dependability
requirements, documentation and data on existing products and outputs
from other processes;
2.
external – customer or marketplace needs and expectations, contractual
requirements, interested party specifications, relevant statutory and regu-
latory requirements, international or national standards, and industry
codes of practice;
3.
other – operation, installation and application, storage, handling, mainte-
nance and delivery, physical parameters and environment and disposal
requirements.
Staff
All staff performing productive work should be capable of undertaking their
tasks correctly. Guidance concerning tasks may be available from training,
experience, detailed instructions, comparison with examples; or a mixture of
these. Detailed instructions are normally required where their absence could
adversely affect the quality and acceptability of the product. Other items that
need controlling (especially those that ensure that acceptable products are pro-
duced) include:

tools;

production equipment;

production environment.
Special processes
ISO 9001:2000 requires an approved control system for ‘special processes’
that cannot easily be inspected on completion of the product (e.g. welding).
The simplest means to ensure that they are correct each time is by experiment-
ing, and then documenting the successful process (personnel, equipment,
materials, sequence and environment). The process can then be repeated each
time the product is required. Production of a reject then becomes an improba-
bility but not, unfortunately, an impossibility!
Process control and instructions
As part of a contract, the supplier may be required to identify (and plan) any
production and/or installation process that directly affects quality and (in par-
ticular) any special process that may only become apparent after production
and/or when the product is used. These plans and instructions should be
included in any representative samples that are provided.
The structure of ISO 9001:2000 117

Marketing implications
It would be totally unproductive for an organisation to make something (e.g. a
product or a system), find that it is not required by anyone and consequently be
unable to sell it! For this reason most organisations have a separate marketing
section who are responsible for determining the need for a product or service
and for estimating the market demand.
Customer requirements
Customer requirements will specify and detail the way the work is to be per-
formed, the standard of workmanship and the degree of quality assurance that
they require. The marketing section must be capable of translating the user
requirements into technical language that will be sufficient to enable the
design staff to convert the requirements into practical designs and specifica-
tions that enable production, testing, maintenance and servicing to be techni-
cally and economically possible.
The customer’s technical requirements should include:

performance and environmental characteristics – specific use, reliability etc.;

sensory characteristics – style, colour, taste, smell;

installation configuration or fit;

standards, specifications and specific user requirements;

packaging;

quality assurance.
Market readiness
In order for the management to always be aware of their organisation’s market
readiness, the marketing section (in close co-operation with the design and
manufacturing sections) needs to define and review market readiness, field
support and production capability.
Components, parts and materials
Although the design office needs to be free to be creative, it is also imperative
that they maintain a close relationship with the manufacturing section so that
they can be aware of their exact requirements, their problems and their com-
ponent preferences etc. It can be so easy for the design office to work in splendid
isolation, make arbitrary decisions, select components that they think are suit-
able, but then find that the size and tolerance is completely inappropriate for
the manufacture of that device.
The design office must have available complete listings of all the appropri-
ate components, parts and materials, their reliability, availability, maintainability,
safety, acceptability and adequacy. They must be aware of recent developments,
new technologies and advances in both materials and equipment that are avail-
able on the market and applicable to that particular product.
118 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses

Specifications and tolerances
Tolerances should never be unduly restrictive for this could create problems
with respect to machine capabilities or require operator skills (and time) far
beyond those, which are really essential. Tolerance specifications should also
be flexible enough to allow for interchangeability of material where necessary.
Health and safety
As health and safety has now become a mandatory requirement of ISO
9001:2000, designers should be even more aware of the implications of the
statutory national, European and international legal requirements for health
and safety as they could well place constraints on their designs.
These regulations will not just be concerned with the condition and safety of
the material but will also provide measures for overcoming the possibility of
danger to persons and property when the material is being used, stored, trans-
ported or tested. All aspects of a product or service should be identified with
the aim of enhancing product safety and minimising product liability. This can
be achieved by:

identifying the relevant safety standards that make a product or service
more effective;

carrying out design evaluation tests and prototype testing for safety;

analysing instructions, warnings, labels and maintenance manuals etc. to
minimise misinterpretation;

developing a means of traceability to allow a product to be recalled if safety
problems are discovered.
Note: Currently there are no ISO approved standards for Occupational Health &
Safety (OH&S) management systems. In January 1997, ISO’s Technical
Management Board (TMB) shelved the possibility of ISO developing OH&S
standards along the lines of ISO 9000. At that time, the TMB noted that the out-
come of the international workshop on OH&S management system standardi-
sation held by ISO on 5–6 September 1996 in Geneva indicated that there was
little support from the main stakeholders for ISO to develop standards in this
field. The question was revisited with the same outcome some three years later.
At the time of writing this third edition of ISO 9001:2000 for Small Business,
the situation is still uncertain. Such standards have, however, been developed 
at a national level (e.g. in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and the 
USA etc.).
Computers
Nowadays, of course, most design offices have computers to record and store
their information on plus disc retrieval systems that enable regular updating
and amendment of data. This updated information is then available for use with
The structure of ISO 9001:2000 119

standard software programs and Computer Aided Design (CAD) packages to
produce accurate information either by list, graph or drawing.

outputs
All documentation associated with the design output (e.g. drawings, schemat-
ics, schedules, system specifications, system descriptions, etc.) needs to:

be produced in accordance with agreed customer requirements;

be reviewed (by another designer who has not been associated with the 
initial design) to ensure that it meets the design input;

identify all of the characteristics which are critical to the effective opera-
tion of the designed system;

be reviewed and approved by the customer prior to use.
Design office responsibilities
Another responsibility of the design office is to maintain a link with the pro-
duction department so that they can assist in the analysis of failures, swiftly
produce solutions and forestall costly work stoppages. This is often referred to
as ‘design output’ and is covered by the activities of the ‘internal audit’ system
that is required to ensure that the design output meets the specified require-
ments of the design input through design control methods such as:

undertaking qualification tests and demonstrations;

comparing the new design with a similar proven design;

ensuring that it conforms to appropriate regulatory (for example safety)
requirements; whether or not these have been stated in the input 
documentation;

identifying those characteristics of the design that are crucial and establish-
ing that these characteristics meet the design input criteria.

Examples of the output from design and/or development activities include:

product specifications;

training requirements;

methodologies;

purchase requirements;

acceptance criteria.
Inspection and test status
Once products have been inspected, there needs to be a method for easily iden-
tifying them as being either acceptable or unacceptable. This can be achieved
in many ways, including:

marking;

stamping;

labelling;

segregating;

associated documents;

test reports;


all potential design problems have been identified and evaluated;

all calculations have been correctly performed and re-checked;

the suitability of the designed item/system with respect to environmental
and operating conditions has been considered;

the compatibility with existing (or proposed) items or systems is assured;

the designed item or system is maintainable;

all necessary working documents (e.g. calculations, notes, sketches, etc.)
accompany the design output documentation.
The majority of design activities can be verified during the design process review
and a record maintained of all the items that have been considered together with
their results. Whenever possible the use of computers is recommended for ver-
ifying designs and currently there are many proprietary brands being marketed.
Final verification of the design is usually completed during final inspection
and test and the designer is responsible for specifying and supplying any
inspections or tests that are required during system installation to practically
verify the design.
Design process review
When designing and/or developing products or processes, as well as ensuring
that the needs of all interested parties are satisfied, the organisation will have to
take into consideration life cycle costs, environmental requirements, Reliability,
Availability, Maintainability and Safety (RAMS) requirements and ergonomic
considerations.
A risk assessment (using risk assessment tools such as Failure Mode and
Effects Analysis (FMEA), Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), reliability assessment,
simulation techniques etc.) will be needed to assess the potential for, and the
effect of, possible failures in products and/or processes and the results used to
define and implement preventive actions to mitigate identified risks.
Periodic reviews
Periodic reviews should be completed throughout the design process (for
example, preliminary, intermediate and final) with the aim of:

confirming design and/or development objectives are being met;

evaluating potential hazards and/or modes of failure found in product use;

evaluating life-cycle product performance data;

evaluating the impact of the product on the environment;

ensuring all other viable paths have been considered;

confirming that all statutory requirements have been considered and are
complied with;

ensuring that there is adequate supporting documentation available to define
the design and how the product or service is to be used and maintained.
122 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses

The tests should include:

the evaluation of the performance, durability, safety, reliability and main-
tainability of the product under expected storage and operational conditions;

inspection procedures to verify that all design features are as they were
originally intended and that all authorised design changes have been car-
ried out and that these have been properly recorded;

validation of computer systems and associated software.
Participants in such reviews should include representatives of functions con-
cerned with the design and/or development stage(s) being reviewed and the
results of the reviews and subsequent follow-up actions need to be recorded.

Section 7.3.5 
Design and
development
verification
ISO 9001:2000 requires an organisation to verify that design outputs meet the
design input specifications and that they meet the needs of the customer. In
particular, verification of engineering designs (prior to construction, installa-
tion or application) software outputs (prior to installation or use) and direct
customer services (prior to their widespread introduction) can prove very 
beneficial to an organisation! The aim should be to generate sufficient data
through these verification activities to enable design and development method-
ologies and decisions to be reviewed.
Design verification and review is another form of periodic evaluation and
uses one of the following methods:

alternative calculations – to verify the precision of the original calcula-
tions and their analysis;

comparison – with other similar designs;

third party evaluation – to verify that the original calculations and/or
other design activities have been correctly carried out;

feedback – from previous designs and experience;


information – gained during manufacture, assembly, installation, commis-
sioning, servicing and field use;

customer – feedback (i.e. asking the customer);

testing – by model or prototype.

product is capable of meeting the requirements
for its intended use;

Section 7.3.6 
Design and
development
validation
As design work is normally performed in accordance with the customer’s
instructions, it is sometimes difficult for an organisation to validate the end prod-
uct. In these situations, the organisation will normally only be required to validate
that the design meets the customer’s requirements. Installed systems will then
need to be inspected and tested to ensure compliance and customer satisfaction
and acceptance and it is only then that the design can be finally validated.
In-process inspection and testing
Items that have been produced in accordance with an organisation’s docu-
mented processes generally pass through a number of stages. Rather than leav-
ing inspection and testing to when the last stage has been completed, it is more
cost effective to check the items as they progress through the various stages of
their production and/or installation. These are called ‘in-process inspections’
and their objective is to identify rejects and inadequate processes as they 
happen and not at the end of a job lot.
The organisation must, therefore, establish effective stages of inspection, define
the type of inspection to be performed and clarify the acceptance/rejection crite-
ria. All the in-process inspections should be documented, and any faulty items
must be identified and segregated.
Final inspection and testing
Once again, the principle of final inspection is similar to an in-process inspec-
tion, i.e. to identify acceptable products from faulty products, record the results
and confirm the acceptance/rejection decision.

The tests will normally include the:

evaluation of the performance, durability, safety, reliability and maintain-
ability of the product under expected storage and operational conditions;

inspection procedures to verify that all design features are as they were
originally intended and that all authorised design changes have been car-
ried out and that these have been properly recorded;

validation of computer systems and associated software.
Note: Wherever applicable, validation should be completed prior to the deliv-
ery or implementation of the product. If this isn’t possible or impractical, then
partial validation should be performed to the extent applicable.

changes
The structure of ISO 9001:2000 125
Throughout the design and development phase, there are likely to be a number
of changes, alterations, modifications and improvements made to the design of
the product and its development processes. It is essential that:

these are identified, documented and controlled;

the effect of the changes on constituent parts and delivered products is 
evaluated;

the changes are verified, validated and approved before implementation.
All changes to the design criteria (input and/or output) should be subject to
strict documentation control and should be reviewed and verified by the
designer and/or the customer, prior to incorporation within the design. All
changes need to be subject to an agreed change control procedure to ensure
that the changes have been fully evaluated, agreed (or concessions made) and
The organisation shall:

identify, document and control all design and

that only the latest versions of design documents are available in work places.
It is essential that the results of the review of changes and subsequent follow up
actions are always documented.
It is essential that all of the design documentation, drawing and notes etc. are
retained in a design project file so that it can be made immediately available
and can be produced for reviews etc. The design output should be reviewed and
approved by top management before being provided to the customer for
approval and use.

Section 7.4
Purchasing
When an organisation has to purchase products, materials and/or services from
suppliers who have not been previously specified in a contract or by a cus-
tomer, they are normally selected on their ability to meet the organisation’s
requirements given due consideration to the quality, statutory obligations,
timescale and cost. A list of approved suppliers and subcontractors needs to be
maintained by the organisation and this should contain the following information:

previous performance in supplying to similar specifications and requirements;

stocking of high-volume standard items conforming to relevant national
and/or international standards (or supplied with a statement of conformity);

compliance with an approved third-party product or quality registration
scheme;

recommendation by other similar purchasers or manufacturers of equipment;

trial order and evaluation of performance.
Purchasing process
The organisation should have available a process to ensure appropriate selec-
tion, evaluation and control of all purchased products. All supplies and subcon-
tracts should be subject to an authorised purchase order that provides full
details of the type and extent of supply.



Suppliers
Having identified their suppliers (usually selected from previous experience, past
history, test results on similar projects or published experience from other users)
an organisation should establish a system by which the supplier/subcontractor is
clearly advised exactly what is required, and by when. This is often achieved by
use of a purchase order system.
Subcontractors
If a supplier uses subcontractors, it is important that they can be relied on to
produce a quality product, have the ability to meet subcontractual requirements,
(including quality assurance) and do not reduce the quality of the final product.
The supplier (who is normally referred to as the prime contractor) must ensure
that all items purchased from a subcontractor are covered by a purchasing 

document. This document will contain details of the product ordered, type,
class, style, grade and the title/number/issue of the relevant standard, specifi-
cation, drawing, inspection instruction etc. that it must conform to. The prime
contractor should ensure that subcontractors have their own QMS and that the
purchased product or service is satisfactory.
2.7.4.2 Section 7.4.2 Purchasing information

A process should be established to ensure that purchasing documents contain
sufficient details about:

some (or all) of the product will have to be tested by the prime contractor
or via a third party;

Section 7.4.2
Purchasing
information

It is essential that all goods and services received from a third party are
checked to confirm that they are those that were ordered, the delivery is on
time and that they are of good quality. The amount of inspection will depend on
how critical the supplied goods and service is to the end product and the
amount of inspection should be compatible with the risk or inconvenience if
the item is later found to be faulty.
A consumable item (e.g. low-cost items such as lights bulbs, duplicating
paper etc.) are normally only checked for correct identity, correct quantity and
any signs of damage. It would be unwise to perform detailed inspections on
these items which, if found to be faulty, could be replaced within a short time
at little comparative expense. Conversely, detailed inspections should always
be performed on major components, as, if they are faulty, the rectification
could be expensive and time-consuming.
It should also be appreciated that the worst possible time to identify an item
as a reject is when it is handed over to the final customer. If the product (or its
components) can be checked at earlier stages, it is time well spent.
In-inspection
Receiving or in-inspection should be documented to confirm that it has taken
place and that the goods or services are deemed fit for use in the next stage of
the process. This may often be by a completing goods received note, or mark-
ing the supplier’s delivery note. The delivery should also be checked against
the purchase order to ensure that it is complete. Should the inspection identify
the delivery as reject, the items should be segregated, labelled or identified to
avoid them being used in error.
Goods inwards
In industry there are very few suppliers who are not actually purchasers them-
selves. Even the largest companies have to obtain consumables, components

and sometimes complete assemblies from a subcontractor at some stage or
other and therefore the quality of the supplier’s final product, to a considerable
degree, depends on the quality of the subcontractor’s goods.
To be certain that the items purchased, or obtained, from a third party are up
to the required standard, the prime contractor will have to set up some kind of
quality inspection, unless that is, the supplier himself operates a fully satisfac-
tory and recognised QMS.
The term ‘goods inwards’ describes the procedures designed to cover this
type of inspection and it is a very important quality assurance function.
Inspection and testing
It is the prime contractor’s responsibility to ensure that inspection and tests are
always performed on all incoming goods and that no incoming material is used
or processed until it has been inspected or otherwise verified to confirm that it
is up to the specified requirements.
The prime contractor will have to show in their Quality Plan exactly how this
is to be achieved and precisely what inspections and tests are to be carried out
to confirm quality. It is then up to the purchaser to decide if this is enough or
whether they would like to see additional or supplementary inspections carried
out. The amount of inspection will, of course, vary according to the degree of
control exercised by the subcontractor, their past performance and records – for
example, are they assessed to ISO 9001:2000, etc.
This inspection should complement and be in addition to the existing qual-
ity control procedures and must be clearly laid down. Records should detail
who actually carried out the inspection that released the product, the assembly
line and despatch services. The inspection must:

consider that all incoming material where quality is unproved should
remain suspect until proven as satisfactory;

ensure that written control procedures are available to establish a product has:
 not been inspected;
 been inspected and approved or;
 been inspected and rejected;

ensure that any defective material that is received from a third party is sub-
ject to the same controls as defective material that may occur in their own
production.
Inspection procedures
Ineffective or incomplete control usually leads to costly defects. The prime
contractor must, therefore, ensure that all manufacturing operations are carried
out under strictly controlled conditions. These conditions should be covered by
work instructions that define the manufacturing process, suitable manufactur-
ing equipment and if a special working environment is required.
130 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses

Workmanship criteria will have to be fully documented using either written
standards, photographs, sketches or representative samples.
Control of quality
The choice of how quality is controlled and the type of inspection is normally
left up to the prime contractor who may decide on a stage inspection, sampling
inspection, final inspection or perhaps even a combination of all methods as
being more appropriate. The method chosen should, however, cover every
phase of manufacture, assembly and installation and the instructions should
include the following details:

identification of material;

detailed operations to be performed;

tools or test equipment required;

requirements for operational checks, calibration and equipment availability;

methods of inspection;

environmental conditions to be maintained during operation or inspection;

criteria for passing or failing the test;

sampling techniques and related decision criteria if applicable.
Non-compliance
Inspection and testing is normally carried out on completion of installation and
maintenance activities, with results being documented. If items fail to comply
with agreed contract criteria, then they should either be repaired, replaced or
identified for subsequent evaluation and decision. All repaired items need to be
re-inspected to ensure their acceptability prior to being used.

Where the resulting output cannot be verified by subsequent measurement or

processes to achieve their planned results.
The organisation should have procedures available to ensure that these
processes are completed under controlled conditions especially with respect to
special processes, and for defining work to be carried out where no previous
procedure exists.

outputs and to use objective evidence to confirm that outputs meet design input

be documented and reviewed for its continued applicability on a regular basis.
If required, organisations can also establish a system for identifying individ-
ual products or batches.
As previously mentioned (see Goods inwards in Section 2.7.4.3) all received
goods should be inspected, their status defined and be located in stores. Non-
conforming items should be placed in a reject area or marked as ‘reject for
review’. The status of work in progress should be clearly indicated by markings
or associated documentation recording the inspections undertaken and their
acceptability.

2.7.5.4 Section 7.5.4 Customer property
134 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses
Customer supplied products are goods which have been provided by the cus-
tomer (or his agent), normally free of charge, for incorporation into the product.
The existence of ‘free issue’ products will only be relevant to certain organisa-
tions. However, it should be remembered that items returned to the organisa-
tion for repair or rectification are also within this category.
Any goods received from customers need to be visually inspected at the receipt
stage and any undeclared non-conformance immediately reported to the customer.
The organisation should ensure that all property belonging to the customer
(including its intellectual, property rights) is protected and that care is taken to
ensure that it is well maintained, used in accordance with the manufacturer’s
instructions and safeguarded at all times.
Should the items become lost, damaged or unserviceable, while in the organ-
isation’s control, the problem should be recorded and the customer advised.
Purchaser supplied product
In some circumstances material, sub assemblies or components may have been
supplied to the organisation by the purchaser as part of the contract. In these
cases it is important that the organisation has a goods inward inspection
process to assure themselves that the item they are receiving is the correct one,
has not been damaged in transit and is suitable for its purpose.
Note: ‘Customer property’ can include ‘intellectual property’!

Preservation of
product

Part numbers and labels
A manufacturer’s/supplier’s part number or description label should identify
any material or equipment that cannot be obviously identified. This identifica-
tion can be on the packaging or on the item itself and should remain in place
for as long as possible provided it does not hamper effective use of the item. If
items have a serial number then this number should also be recorded.
Product protection
All materials and goods that are received, whether they are the property of the
organisation or others, should, as far as practicable, be protected and their qual-
ity preserved until such time as they are transferred to a customer, disposed of to
a third party or utilised. The overall objective should be to prevent deterioration
and damage whilst in storage, or in the process of transportation, installation,
commissioning and/or maintenance. Written instructions and procedures for the
handling, identification and storage of materials, components, parts, sub assem-
blies and completed items will have to be established and made available. These
instructions must contain details of quarantine areas or bonded stores, how they
should be used, together with methods of cleaning, preserving and packaging.
Documented procedures
As previously mentioned, ISO 9001:2000 recommends organisations to main-
tain documented procedures for identifying products (e.g. hardware, software,
documents and/or data) throughout all stages of production, delivery, receipt
and installation. If required, organisations can also establish a system for iden-
tifying individual products or batches and consider the need for any special
requirements (i.e. associated with software, electronic media, hazardous mate-
rials, specialist personnel and products or materials) arising from the nature of
the product which are unique or irreplaceable.
In some cases (e.g. toxic contamination), in order to prevent damage and
deterioration of the product (and harm to the product user!), it might even be
necessary to refer to another document, regulation or standard to ensure that
the items are correctly handled, stored and delivered.
Storage
All QMS standards emphasise the importance of having satisfactory storage
facilities and stipulate that these must be available for all materials, consumables,
components, sub assemblies or completed articles. In a similar manner, the
standards specify that materials should always be properly stored, segregated,
handled and protected during production so as to maintain their suitability.
The supplier will thus have to provide secure storage areas or stock rooms so
that the materials can be isolated and protected (e.g. from harmful environments)
The structure of ISO 9001:2000 135

pending use or shipment. Storage areas will have to be protected and kept tidy
and the supplier must ensure that material only leaves the storage areas when it
has been properly authorised.
Procedures for rotation of stock will need to be established and special con-
sideration should always be given to items with limited shelf life and items that
might require special protection during transit or storage. This is usually
referred to as deterioration control. Where corrosive or toxic materials are
stored in quantity, these items must be kept in a separate storage area.
Delivery
The supplier must make arrangements to ensure that the quality of the product
is protected following final inspection and test. Where contractually specified,
this protection can even be extended to include delivery to the final destination.
Some of the factors that should be considered by suppliers when delivering
their product to the purchaser are:

the nature of the material;

the type(s) of transport to be used;

environmental conditions during transit;

time in transit;

handling methods en route;

storage en route and at the destination.
2.7.6 Section 7.6 Control of measuring and 
monitoring devices
136 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses
The control of measuring and test equipment (whether owned by the supplier,
on loan, hired or provided by the purchaser), should always include a check
that the equipment is exactly what is required, has been initially calibrated
The organisation shall ensure that all measuring and
monitoring devices are:

calibrated and adjusted periodically or prior to use;

traceable to international or national standards;

safeguarded from adjustments that would invali-
date the calibration;

protected from damage and deterioration during
handling, maintenance and storage.

before use, operates within the required tolerances, is regularly recalibrated
and that facilities exist (either within the organisation or via a third party) to
adjust, repair or recalibrate as necessary.
In particular, measuring and monitoring devices that are used to verify
process outputs against specified requirements need to be maintained and cal-
ibrated against national and international standards. The results of all calibra-
tions carried out must be retained and the validity of previous results
re-assessed if they are subsequently found to be out of calibration.
All production and measuring equipment that is held needs to be well-
maintained, in good condition and capable of safe and effective operation within
a specified tolerance of accuracy. Test and measuring equipment should be 
regularly inspected and/or calibrated to ensure that it is capable of accurate
operation, by comparison with external sources traceable back to national stan-
dards. Any electrostatic protection equipment that is utilised when handling
sensitive components should be regularly checked to ensure that it remains
fully functional.
Control of inspection, measuring and test equipment
All production equipment including machinery jigs, fixtures, tools, templates,
patterns and gauges should always be stored correctly and satisfactorily pro-
tected between use to ensure their bias and precision. They should be verified
or recalibrated at appropriate intervals. Special attention should be paid to
computers if they are used in controlling processes and particularly to the
maintenance and accreditation of any related software.
Software
Software used for measuring and monitoring of specified requirements should
be validated prior to use. 
Note: also see ISO 10012:1992 ‘Quality Assurance Requirements for Measuring
Equipment – Metrological confirmation system for measuring equipment’.
Calibration
Without exception, all measuring instruments can be subject to damage, dete-
rioration or just general wear and tear when they are in regularly use in work-
shops and factories. The organisation’s QMS should take account of this fact
and ensure that all test equipment is regularly calibrated against a known work-
ing standard held by the manufacturer.
Of course, calibrating against a standard is pretty pointless if that particular
standard cannot be relied upon and so the ‘workshop standard’ must also be
calibrated, on a regular basis, at either a recognised calibration centre or at the
UK Physical Laboratory (or similar) against one of the national standards.
The structure of ISO 9001:2000 137

The supplier’s QMS will thus have to make allowances for:

the calibration and adjustment of all inspection, measuring and test equip-
ment that can affect product quality;

the documentation and maintenance of calibration procedures and records;

the regular inspection of all measuring or test equipment to ensure that they
are capable of the accuracy and precision that is required;

the environmental conditions being suitable for the calibrations, inspec-
tions, measurements and tests to be completed.
The accuracy of the instrument will depend very much on what items it is
going to be used to test, the frequency of use of the test instrument, industry
standards of acceptability, etc. and the organisation will have to decide on the
maximum tolerance of accuracy for each item of test equipment.
Calibration methods
There are various possibilities, such as:

send all working equipment to an external calibration laboratory;

send one of each item (i.e. a ‘workshop standard’) to a calibration labora-
tory, then sub-calibrate each working item against the workshop standard;

testing by attributes – i.e. take a known ‘faulty’ product, and a known
‘good’product; and then test each one to ensure that the test equipment can
identify the faulty and good product correctly.
Calibration frequency
The calibration frequency depends on how much the instrument is used, its
ability to retain its accuracy and how critical the items being tested are.
Infrequently used instruments are often only calibrated prior to their use whilst
frequently used items would normally be checked and re-calibrated at regular
intervals depending, again, on product criticality, cost, availability etc. Normally
12 months is considered as about the maximum calibration interval.
Calibration ideals

Each instrument should be uniquely identified, allowing it to be traced.

The calibration results should be clearly indicated on the instrument.

The calibration results should be retained for reference.

The instrument should be labelled to show the next ‘calibration due’date to
easily avoid its use outside of the period of confidence.

Any means of adjusting the calibration should be sealed, allowing easy
identification if it has been tampered with (e.g. a label across the joint of
the casing).
138 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses


If the instrument is found to be outside of its tolerance of accuracy, any
items previously tested with the instrument must be regarded as suspect. In
these circumstances, it would be wise to review the test results obtained
from the individual instrument. This could be achieved by compensating
for the extent of inaccuracy to decide if the acceptability of the item would
be reversed.

Section 8.1 
General
Under ISO 9001:2000 the organisation is required to determine and implement
procedures to ensure product and QMS conformity and improvement.
The use of statistical techniques can help to understand the variability of a
product and in so doing, help organisations to solve problems and improve effi-
ciency. Basically, statistical techniques:

make better use of available data to assist in decision making;

help to measure, describe, analyse, interpret and model variability;

help to provide a better understanding of the nature, extent and causes of
variability;

help to solve and even prevent problems that may result from such variability;

promote continual improvement.
Details of the application of statistical techniques are given in ISO TR
10017:1999 – Guidance on Statistical Techniques for ISO 9001:1994.

Section 8.2 
Monitoring and
measurement

To enable an organisation to measure customer satisfaction, evaluate its prod-
uct and the efficiency of its processes, they need to establish a method to mon-
itor, measure, collect, analyse and record the relevant data using statistical or
other appropriate techniques such as:

customer satisfaction measurement;

internal audits;

financial measurements;

self-assessment methodologies.
Collection of this data should not be purely for the accumulation of informa-
tion. This process should always be aimed at progressive improvement of the
organisation’s QMS. The results of this analysis will then be one of the inputs
to the management review process.

Section 8.2.1
Customer satisfaction
The organisation should establish processes to gather, analyse and make effective
use of all customer-related information as one of the measurements of perform-
ance of their QMS. This information can come from many sources such as:

customer requirements and contract information;

feedback from the delivery of a product;

market needs;

service delivery data;

information relating to competition.
The organisation’s process should address conformance to requirements, meet-
ing the needs and expectations of customers, price and delivery of product and
overall customer satisfaction. Examples of sources of information on customer
satisfaction include:

customer complaints;

direct communication with customers;

questionnaires and surveys;

focus groups;


reports from consumer organisations;

reports in various media;

sector studies.
2.8.2.2 Section 8.2.2 Internal audit
142 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses
An organisation should establish an internal audit process to assess the
strengths and weaknesses of its QMS, to identify potential danger spots, eliminate
wastage and verify that corrective action has been successfully achieved. The
internal audit process should also be used to review the efficiency and effec-
tiveness of other organisational activities and support processes including:

existence of adequate documentation;

effective implementation of processes;

identification of non-conformance;

documentation of results;

competence of personnel;

opportunities for improvement;

capability of processes;
The organisation shall plan and conduct periodic
internal audits to determine whether the QMS:

continues to conform to the requirements of ISO
9001:2000;

has been effectively implemented and maintained.
The organisation shall plan the audit programme 
taking into account:

the status and importance of the activities and
areas to be audited;

the results of previous audits.
The organisation shall have a documented procedure
which includes:

the responsibilities and requirements for conduct-
ing audits;


the method for recording results and reporting to
management.

To be effective, an ‘internal audit’ must be completed by trained personnel and
where possible by members of the quality control staff – provided, that is, that
they are not responsible for the quality of that particular product and they are not
associated with the activity being audited. In addition to documenting non-
conformances, internal audit reporting should also indicate areas for improve-
ment (with recommendations), as well as areas of outstanding performance.
There are three basic types of audit to choose from:

First-party audits – conducted by, or on behalf of, the organisation itself
for internal purposes and can form the basis for an organisation’s selfdec-
laration of conformity.

Second-party audits – conducted by customers of the organisation or by
other persons on behalf of the customer.

Third-party audits – conducted by external independent audit service
organisations. Such organisations, usually accredited, provide certification
or registration of conformity with requirements such as those of ISO
9001:2000.
It is essential that management shall take timely corrective action on all deficien-
cies found during the audit. Follow-up actions should include the verification of the
implementation of corrective action, and the reporting of verification results.
Financial approach
As part of their overall management system, organisations should establish a
methodology for linking financial considerations with the QMS. This could
include:

prevention, appraisal and failure costs analysis;

costs of conformance and non-conformance;

life-cycle approach.
Self-assessment
Organisations should consider establishing and implementing a self-assessment
process. The range and depth of the assessment should be planned in relation
The structure of ISO 9001:2000 143

to the organisation’s objectives and priorities. Self-assessment can be a very
useful tool to evaluate improvement and ISO 9004:2000 helps organisations by
providing an annex containing ‘Guidelines for self-assessment’. For the assis-
tance of small businesses, I have also included a section (see Part Seven) on
‘self assessment’ which includes check sheets against the requirements of ISO
9001:2000 and examples of Stage Audit checklists.
2.8.2.3 Section 8.2.3 Monitoring and measurement of
processes
144 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses
The organisation should identify measurement methodologies, perform meas-
urements to evaluate their process performance and use the results obtained to
improve the product realisation process. Examples where process performance
measurements can be used to improve processes include:

timeliness;

dependability;

reaction time of processes and people to special internal and external
requests;

cycle time or throughput;

effectiveness and efficiency of people;

utilisation of technologies;

cost reduction.

Section 8.2.3
Monitoring and
measurement of
processes

The organisation should establish, specify and plan their measurement require-
ments (including acceptance criteria) for its products taking into consideration the:

location of each measurement point in its process sequence;

characteristics to be measured at each point;

documentation and acceptance criteria to be used;

equipment and tools required;

inspections and tests that need to be witnessed or performed by the 
customer, statutory and/or regulatory authorities;

possible requirements for qualified third parties to perform type testing, 
in-process inspections, product verification and/or product validation;

necessary qualification requirements of material, product, process, people
or the QMS;

requirements for final inspection;

outputs of the measurement process of the product;

conformance to customer, statutory and regulatory requirements.
Typical examples of product measurement records include:

inspection and test reports;

material release notices;


certificates as required;

electronic data.
To be of any use it is very important that the inspection and test status of a
product is immediately clear. The QMS will have to show exactly how this will
be achieved (using such methods as markings, stamps, tags, labels, routing
cards, inspection records, test software, physical location or other suitable
means) to indicate the conformance or non-conformance of the product, and
whether it has been inspected and approved, or inspected and rejected.
Production control
To reduce the possibility of manufacturing or design errors causing production
line and product delays, the quality status of the product, process, material or
environment must be checked at various stages during the production sequence.
The use of control charts, statistical sampling procedures and plans are some
of the techniques that are used for production and process control.
Product testing
Product testing (i.e. final inspection and testing), are methods of testing
whether the product is acceptable or not. These methods have to be developed
by the supplier in conjunction with the purchaser and should be included in the
suppliers QMS, Quality Manual and/or Quality Plan. These methods would
normally contain:

confirmation that all the relevant inspections and tests have been carried
out during manufacture, are fully documented and are recorded in accor-
dance with the Quality Plan or agreed procedure;

details of the acceptance and rejection criteria that are to be used;

the measurement and acceptance criteria;

the quantity to be inspected;

the sampling plan;

who is to complete the inspection processes;

details of the equipment that requires statistical analysis.
Special processes
Occasionally during manufacture, the supplier will be required to perform an
inspection on components or activities that cannot normally be verified or
inspected at a later stage. The purpose of these inspections is to detect, at an
early stage, non-conforming material. If these inspections are required, then
the prime contractor will have to establish ‘special manufacturing processes’
(such as welding, forging, plastic and wood fabrication, heat treatment and the
application of protective treatments) and inspection and testing processes
(such as temperature and humidity cycling, vibration, radiography, magnetic
particle inspection, penetrant inspection, ultrasonic inspection, pressure test-
ing, chemical and spectrographic analysis and salt spray tests).

The organisation shall define procedures to ensure
that:

products which do not conform to requirements
are prevented from unintended use or delivery;

Control of non-

2.8.3 Section 8.3 Control of non-conforming product
The structure of ISO 9001:2000 147
Material control and traceability
To ensure that a non-conforming or hazardous product is not delivered by mis-
take to a customer, the organisation must establish and maintain procedures for
identifying the product (from drawings, specifications or other documents),
during all stages of production, delivery and installation. This also ensures that
all parts of the product are capable of being traced and recalled if necessary.
Control of non-conformity
To cover the possibility of confusing an acceptable quality product with a
defective, non-conforming or unacceptable product (and accidentally using
this material or despatching it to the purchaser!), all non-conforming articles
must be clearly identified and kept completely separate from all other accept-
able (conforming) products. Non-conforming products can then be:

documented and steps taken to see that they do not occur again;

reworked so that they meet the specified requirement;

accepted with or without repair by concession;

regraded for possible use elsewhere;

rejected or scrapped.
Since most production processes inevitably yield some kind of defective mate-
rial, the organisation must investigate methods for preventing this from 
happening again and arrange for their immediate disposal. The most obvious
method of disposing of a non-conforming material is to scrap it. First making

sure, of course, that it cannot be confused with any other material or acciden-
tally used again!
Whatever the choice, details about the non-conformance must be fed back
into the system so that action (where economically feasible) can be taken to
establish and correct the cause of the non-conformance and hopefully prevent
its recurrence.
Supplier responsibility
BS 6143–2:1990 ‘Guide to the Economics of Quality – Prevention, appraisal
and failure model’ provides detailed information concerning the procedures
that should be adopted. In precis form they stipulate that the supplier must:

investigate the cause of any non-conforming product and have a corrective
course of action available to prevent its recurrence;

analyse all processes, work operations, concessions, quality records, service
reports and customer complaints to eliminate the causes of non-conforming
products;

initiate preventive actions;

change any designs, specifications or work methods that may be unsatisfac-
tory; ensure that the responsibilities for corrective action are clearly
assigned to personnel and that these responsibilities are carried out correctly;

apply controls to ensure that corrective actions are taken and that the exist-
ing (as well as the modified) work, methods and designs are effective and
suitable;

implement and record changes in procedures that result from this correc-
tive action.
BS 6143–2:1990 emphasises that this control of quality is not only limited just
to the design, manufacture or installation facilities under the supplier’s direct
control. They also extend to those services, parts, materials or products that are
provided by subcontractors. In some circumstances, if a subcontractor’s work
is found to be unsatisfactory this could mean dispensing with that particular
subcontractor and having to find another one. This can, however, cause addi-
tional problems such as finding another one capable of supplying the same
service and the materials before the lack of those materials (or service) causes
product delays.
Permanent changes
If there are any permanent changes resulting from this corrective action, then
they should be recorded in work instructions, manufacturing processes, product
specifications and in the organisation’s QMS. In some cases it might even be
necessary to revise the procedures used to detect and eliminate potential problems.
148 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses

Customers may often require confirmation that the organisation is capable of
continuing to produce a quality article or process. One of the methods frequently
used to provide this sort of confirmation is statistical analysis. Nowadays there
are many methods of statistically analysing whether the product is:

what the market requires;

the correct design;

derived from a reliable specification and one that can be relied upon to last
the test of time (i.e. durability);

subject to the correct process control and capabilities;

covered by relevant quality standards, specifications and plans.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis can also include data analysis, performance testing and
defect analysis. Other forms of analysis are design process review and design
verification. Statistical analysis is, of course, a subject on its own and vast
amounts of information about statistical methods, reliability and maintainabil-
ity data are readily available. An exceedingly good overview of Statistical
Analysis is provided in Statistical Process Control by John Oakland and other
sources of information such as Quality and Standards in Electronics (details of
which are provided in the reference section).
With the use of statistical methodologies, the organisation should analyse
data in order to assess, control, and improve the performance of processes and
products and to identify areas for improvement. Analysis of data can help
determine the cause of many problems and the results of this analysis can be
used to determine:

trends;

operational performance;

customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction;


economics of quality and financial and market-related performance;


Records
In order that the statistical significance of a failure can be properly assessed
and that the correct retrospective action may be taken, it is essential that the
design section has access to all the records and other pertinent data failure
reports gathered in the design office and on the shop floor.
The storage, maintenance and analysis of reliability data will require the
design section to follow the progress of the product throughout its productive
life cycle, through its many maintenance cycles and take due note of any cus-
tomer comments. The compilation and retention of design office reliability
data is not only very important, but essential to the reliability of the product
and the manufacturing facility.
Storage of records
Storage facilities should be available to ensure that all stored records are iden-
tifiable and retrievable and that the storage areas are free from damp and other
agents which could cause premature deterioration. If records are maintained on
computer magnetic media, then these should be subject to ‘back-up’ at regular
intervals, with the ‘back-up’information being stored in a protected location to
ensure security from loss or damage of active data. All records are normally
retained for a minimum of two years after contract completion.

Non-conformity
Once non-conforming items have been recognised, they should be identified
by location, associated documents, or specific markings in order to prevent
their inadvertent use. All non-conforming items and customer complaints
should be subject to review and rectification by nominated personnel. The type
and extent of non-conformity needs to be documented in order to establish
trends and identify possible areas for improvement.
Corrective action
The corrective action required to prevent recurrence should be evaluated, doc-
umented, and its effective implementation monitored. All rectification should
subsequently be re-inspected to ensure complete customer satisfaction.
Preventive action
All employees should be encouraged to suggest improvements in methods,
materials, suppliers and subcontractors and organisations should have an
established procedure for review of all activities in order to identify and evalu-
ate all possible improvements in methods/materials and its procedures.

Section 8.5.2
Corrective action
The organisation should plan and establish a process for corrective action, the
results of which shall be included in the management review process. 
The input information for this activity can derive from a number of sources
such as:

customer complaints;

non-conformance reports;

outputs from management review;

internal audit reports;

outputs from data analysis;

relevant QMS records;

outputs from satisfaction measurements;

process measurements;

results of self-assessment.

The corrective action process should include:

a definition of the causes of non-conformances and defects;

elimination of causes of non-conformances and defects;

appropriate actions to avoid recurrence of problems;

a record of the activity and results.
The necessity for corrective action should be evaluated in terms of the poten-
tial impact on operating costs, costs of non-conformance, performance,
dependability, safety and customer satisfaction.
Concessions and approvals
No matter how much an organisation may pay attention to the control of qual-
ity and no matter how hard they try to avoid problems with both manpower and
the product, all too often things go wrong. There could, for instance, be a prob-
lem in the production shop, an accident could happen, piece-part material
could be damaged or a mistake could be made by an engineer when reading a
drawing or setting up an electrical or electronic machine. Or the print shop
could print the deliverable incorrectly or leave out sections.
In all of these cases there has to be a recognised method of accepting the
problem instead of just trying to hide the blunder through either unofficial
‘modifications’ or, even worse, trying to cover it up! As the saying goes ‘hon-
esty is always the best policy’ and in any case, ‘Murphy’s Law’ says that more
than likely the hidden ‘repairs’ will be found out and the manufacturer will
consequently lose his customer’s trust and any chance of follow on orders.
Concession scheme
The machinery for overcoming these problems is called the ‘concession
scheme’. This will normally consist of a form that has to be completed by the
manufacturer/supplier and the customer. Details of each document, component,
sub assembly, defect or mistake that is identified has to be recorded together
with the action that was taken to rectify, scrap, modify or accept the problem.
The Quality Plan will indicate the acceptance or rejection criteria that will
be adopted. It will describe compulsory methods that must be taken to mark
imperfect or faulty material and indicate how they should be separated from
any other material before it is scrapped, reworked or repaired.
If the problem is the result of a faulty design or specification that originated
from the purchaser any problems must of course be referred back to them. 
If the fault is found to be the fault of the purchaser (e.g. unsatisfactory design)
the manufacturer/supplier may, of course, be able to insist on having an 
exgratia payment to overcome the problem. If the problem originated from the
manufacturer/supplier, then the purchaser is perfectly within his rights to insist
on a reduction in the agreed price.
The structure of ISO 9001:2000 153

In cases where a subcontractor requests a concession, then the prime con-
tractor has to carry out a full investigation and agree to the subcontractor’s pro-
posal before asking the purchaser to consider the request.
A concession system is a very important part of the supplier/purchaser rela-
tionship. It also promotes better discipline within the factory, shows up reoc-
curring problem areas and ensures that the supplier’s standard of workmanship
is maintained.
Defects and defect reports
One of the requirements of the QMS is that signatures shall be required from
inspectors at each stage of the production to show that the product is of the
required standard and assured quality.
When an item fails to meet these criteria, then the inspector must submit a
defect report, showing exactly what is defective, how it affects the product and,
where possible, what steps can be taken to overcome these failures in future
productions.
Bonded store
Owing to the possibility of having unacceptable goods inside their premises,
the manufacturer must also set up some kind of ‘bonded store’ where all
incoming material is placed pending inspection.
Even when goods have left the bonded store it is still necessary to have some
form of marking (e.g. labels or tags) to distinguish between those awaiting

Section 8.5.3
Preventive action
The organisation should use preventive methodologies such as risk analysis,
trend analysis, statistical process control, fault tree analysis, failure modes and

effects and criticality analysis to identify the causes of potential non-
conformances. Examples of sources are:

customer needs and expectations;

market analysis;

management review output;

outputs from data analysis;

satisfaction measurements;

process measurements;

systems that consolidate many sources of customer information;

relevant QMS records;

results of self-assessment;

processes that provide early warning of approaching out-of-control operating
conditions.
Preventive actions should be considered for inclusion in the management
review process.
Note: Corrective actions are steps that are taken to remove the causes of exist-
ing non-conformities, while preventive actions are steps that are taken to
remove the causes of potential non-conformities. Corrective actions address
actual problems, ones that have already occurred, while preventive actions
address potential problems, ones that haven’t yet occurred. In general, the cor-
rective action process is a problem solving process, while the preventive action
process is a risk analysis process.

Part Three
The Importance of
Quality Control and
Quality Assurance
In Parts One and Two of this book, the recommendations, background
and the various uses of ISO 9001:2000 were explained. In Part Three
the reader is introduced to the requirements and benefits of quality control
and quality assurance from the point of view of the manufacturer and
the supplier as well as the purchaser and/or end user.
The significance and the types of specifications are explained, man-
ufacturer’s and purchaser’s responsibilities are defined and a thorough
review of quality during a product’s life cycle enables the reader to appre-
ciate the costs and associated benefits of quality.
Note: Although I have written Part Three primarily from the point of view
of a manufactured product, it is equally applicable for the production of
a document, report or any other form of deliverable.

Quality control and 
quality assurance
The international definition of ‘Quality’ as stated in ISO 9000:2000 is ‘the
degree to which a set of inherent characteristics fulfils requirements.’
But what of quality assurance and quality control?
Although the terms ‘quality assurance’ and ‘quality control’ are both aimed
at ensuring the quality of the end product, they are in fact two completely sep-
arate processes.
3.1 Quality control
The definition of quality control (QC) is ‘that part of quality management
focussed on fulfilling quality requirements’ (ISO 9000:2000). In other words,
the operational techniques and activities that are used to fulfil the requirements
for quality.
It is the amount of supervision that a product is subjected to so as to be sure
that the workmanship associated with that product meets the quality level
required by the design. In other words, it is the control exercised by the manu-
facturer to certify that all aspects of their activities during the design, produc-
tion, installation and in-service stages are to the desired standards.

requirements
Figure 3.1 Quality control

Quality control is exercised at all levels, and, as all personnel are responsible
for the particular task they are doing, they are all quality controllers to some
degree or other.
Section Leaders or Managers, because of their positions and responsibilities,
have more control over their own particular process and therefore have more
control over the final quality. It is true, therefore, to say that all personnel are
quality controllers and that Section Heads are the Principal Quality
Controllers, within their own particular organisation.
3.2 Quality assurance
Quality assurance (QA) is ‘that part of quality management focussed on provid-
ing confidence that quality requirements are fulfilled’(ISO 9000:2000). In other
words, all those planned and systematic actions necessary to provide adequate
confidence that a product or service will satisfy given requirements for quality.

‘Quality’: is fitness for intended use;

‘Assurance’: is a declaration given to inspire confidence in an organisa-
tion’s capability;

‘Quality assurance’: in a product (or service), by consistently achieving
stated objectives is, therefore, a declaration given to inspire confidence that
a particular organisation is capable of consistently satisfying need as well
as being a managerial process designed to increase confidence.
Quality assurance ensures that a product has achieved the highest standards
and that its production, modification or repair (in the case of a manufactured
item) has been completed in an efficient and timely manner.
The purpose of quality assurance is, therefore:

to provide assurance to a customer that the standard of workmanship
within a contractor’s premises is of the highest level and that all products

system quality

leaving that particular firm are above a certain fixed minimum level of
specification;

to ensure that production standards are uniform between divisions/sections
and remain constant despite changes in personnel.
In a nutshell, quality assurance is concerned with:

an agreed level of quality;

a commitment within a company to the fundamental principle of consis-
tently supplying the right quality product;

a commitment from a customer to the fundamental principle of only
accepting the right quality product;

a commitment within all levels of (contractor and or customer) to the basic
principles of quality assurance and quality control.
The main benefits of quality assurance are:

an increased capability of supplying a product which consistently con-
forms to an agreed specification;

a reduction in manufacturing and production costs because of less wastage
and fewer rejects;

a greater involvement and motivation within an organisation’s workforce;

an improved customer relationship through fewer complaints, thus provid-
ing increased sales potential.
3.3 Specifications
Without proper specifications it is impossible to expect a manufacturer or sup-
plier to produce an article, equipment or system that completely satisfies the
purchaser’s requirements. Equally, if the manufacturer and/or supplier does not
work within laid down specifications they will be unable to produce something
that comes up to the purchaser’s required standard.
If a manufacturer does not meet required specifications, then the part, equip-
ment or system will not work as expected or the components will be the wrong
dimensions and not fit properly etc. Worst of all, the article will not be exactly
what the purchaser wanted.
The importance of specifications is, therefore, very much the responsibility
of the purchaser as well as the manufacturer/supplier.
3.3.1 The significance of specifications
Specifications always form the basis of a contract and as such they need to be
a comprehensive and precise description of exactly what the purchaser
requires. The document must, therefore, avoid ambiguous words, mixed systems
Quality control and quality assurance 161

of units (e.g. metric and imperial) and, in particular, avoid over specification
such as listing extremely close tolerances with respect to dimensions, colour,
surface finishes and/or performance which are liable to increase the cost of the
product unnecessarily.
Specifications can be very simple and just covered by a few words, or they
can be extremely rigid and run into many volumes. It all depends on the size of
the assignment and the level of accuracy that the purchaser requires.
3.3.2 Types of specification
There are three main ways in which the purchaser’s requirements can be spec-
ified: general specifications, overall performance specifications and standard
specifications. Although slightly different in content, each of these specifica-
tions closely examines the procedures used by the manufacturer.
3.3.2.1 General specification
A general specification requires the purchaser to produce a detailed written
description of the article, its construction, the materials to be used and the level

of performance that it is required to provide. It is usually written by a member
of the design team and then passed to an experienced engineer (independent of
that particular design team) for final vetting and approval.
To avoid any problems later on, specifications must always guard against
using such words as ‘suitable’, ‘appropriate’ or ‘conventional’. In a similar
manner, inclusion of ‘possible alternatives’ and ‘by agreement’ clauses should
also be avoided.
If in-house specifications are produced in quantity, it is essential that any
amended specification is published and immediately issued to all concerned.
To make life simpler and avoid future problems, it is equally important that
these amendments are numbered, dated and the recipients are made to destroy
all previous copies and issues.
3.3.2.2 Overall performance specification
An overall performance specification tells the manufacturer in comprehensive
terms exactly what the purchaser is looking for. The obvious disadvantage of
this method is that it leaves the design of the product completely up to the manu-
facturer. This can often lead to arguments later on especially when the pur-
chaser realises that the product is either too big, too small, the wrong shape, not
up to (or exceeding) his engineering requirements and, as frequently happens,
is far more expensive than the purchaser really intended.
3.3.2.3 Standard specification
A standard specification is a list that describes, in detail, the items or mater-
ials that are to be used in the manufacture of the product.
Obviously, without any real experience it would take a purchaser a long time
to compile such a list or even be able to express – in technical terms – exactly
what he wants. To overcome these problems, National Standards Organisations
(NSOs) publish lists of all the materials and sub assemblies commonly used by
manufacturers.
In the United Kingdom (UK) the British Standards Institution (BSI) have
produced these lists in the BS 9000 series (not to be confused with ISO 9000!).
In Europe they are made available by the CENELEC Electronic Components
Committee (CECC) and internationally by the Quality Assessment System for
Electronic Components (IECQ).
3.3.3 Manufacturer’s responsibilities
The manufacturer’s prime responsibility must always be to ensure that any-
thing and everything leaving their factory conforms to the specific require-
ments of the purchaser – particularly with regard to quality.
The simplest way of doing this is for the manufacturer to ensure that their
particular office, production facility or manufacturing outlet fully complies
Quality control and quality assurance 163

with the requirements of the quality standards adopted by the country in which
they are manufacturing and the country to whom they intend supplying the
component, equipment or system.
To do this they must of course first be aware of the standards applicable to
that country, know how to obtain copies of these standards, how to adapt them
to their own particular environment and how to get them accepted by the rele-
vant authorities.
Although an organisation can set out to abide by accepted standards, unless
they achieve this aim they will fail in their attempt to become a recognised
manufacturer of quality goods. The main points that they should note are:

that all managerial staff, from the most junior to the most senior, must
firmly believe in the importance of quality control and quality assurance
and understand how to implement them;

that managerial staff must create an atmosphere in which quality assurance
rules are obeyed and not simply avoided just because they are inconvenient,
time consuming, laborious or just too boring to bother with;

that there has to be an accepted training scheme to ensure that all members
of the firm are regularly brought up to date with the ongoing and the latest
requirements of quality assurance;


that there must be a quality assurance team available to oversee and make
sure that quality control and quality assurance are carried out at all times
and at all levels, within their premises.
In addition, the manufacturer will have to provide proof that they are supply-
ing a quality product. This is actually a ‘measurement of their quality control’
and usually takes the form of a supplier’s evaluation, surveillance and/or audit.
National and international QMSs will also require the manufacturer to
establish and maintain a fully documented method for the inspection of their
system for quality control. Procedures must be developed and identified for
classifying lots, cataloguing characteristics, selecting samples and rules for
acceptance and/or rejection criteria, together with procedures for segregating
and screening rejected lots.
3.3.4 Purchaser’s responsibilities
Quite a number of problems associated with a product’s quality are usually the
fault of the purchaser! Obviously the purchaser can only expect to get what he
ordered. It is, therefore, extremely important that the actual order is not only
correct, but also provides the manufacturer with all the relevant (and accurate)
information required to complete the task.

Figure 3.5 Purchaser’s responsibilities

There is little point in trying to blame the manufacturer when an article
doesn’t come up to expectation because of an unsatisfactory design provided
by the purchaser. In certain cases (for example when the requirements of the
item cannot easily be described in words), it could be very helpful if the pur-
chaser was to provide a drawing as a form of graphic order. In such cases, this
drawing should contain all the relevant details such as type of material to be
used, the material’s grade or condition, the specifications that are to be 
followed and, where possible, the graphic order/drawing should be to scale.
If this approach proves impractical, then the order would have to include all
the relevant dimensional data, sizes, tolerances etc., or refer to one of the
accepted standards.
Having said all that, it must be appreciated that the actual specification
being used is also very important for it sets the level of quality required and,
therefore, directly affects the price of the article. Clearly, if specifications are
too demanding then the final cost of the article will be too high. If specifica-
tions are too vague or obscure, then the manufacturer will have difficulty in
assembling the object or may even be unable to get it to work correctly.
The choice of manufacturer is equally important. It is an unfortunate fact of
life that purchasers usually consider that the price of the article is the prime and
(in some cases), even the only consideration. Buying cheaply is obviously not
the answer because if a purchaser accepts the lowest offer all too often he will
find that delivery times are lengthened (because the manufacturer can make
more profit on other orders), the article produced does not satisfy his require-
ments and worst of all, the quality of the article is so poor that he has to replace
the device well before its anticipated life cycle has been completed.
If a manufacturer has received official recognition that the quality of his
work is up to a particular standard, then the purchaser has a reasonable guaran-
tee that the article being produced will be of a reasonable quality – always
assuming that the initial order was correct!
3.4 Quality assurance during a product’s
life cycle
As shown in Figure 3.6, the life of a product is made up of five stages. Each of
these stages has specific requirements that need to be correctly managed and
which need to be regulated by quality controls.
As quality assurance affects the product throughout its life cycle, it is impor-
tant that quality assurance procedures are introduced for design, manufactur-
ing and acceptance stages, as well as in service utilisation.
3.4.1 Design stage
‘Quality must be designed into a product before manufacture or assembly’
(ISO 9004:2000).
166 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses

Throughout the design stage of a product or service, the quality of that
design must be regularly checked. Quality procedures have to be planned, writ-
ten and implemented so as to predict and evaluate the fundamental and intrin-
sic reliability of the proposed design.
It doesn’t matter whether the responsibility for the design of a product rests
purely with the supplier, the purchaser, or is a joint function. It is essential that
the designer is fully aware of the exact requirements of the project and has 
a sound background knowledge of the relevant standards, information and 
procedures that will have to be adopted during the design stages.
This is extremely important, because the actions of the design office will not
only influence the maintenance of quality during manufacture, but also play a

major part in setting the quality level of the eventual product. If there is no
quality control in the drawing office, there is little chance of there ever being
any on the shop floor. When the engineers are trying to manufacture something

that have countless mistakes on them, what chance is there of them ever being
able to produce an acceptable item!
These problems, although not specifically stipulated in ISO 9001:2000
should, nevertheless be addressed. The design office (or team) should produce
some sort of ‘Procedures Manual’ which lists and describes the routine pro-
cedures that are required to turn a concept into a set of functional drawings.
These procedures will cover such activities as the numbering of drawings,
authorisation to issue amendments and modifications, how to control changes
to drawings, the method of withdrawing obsolete drawings and the identifica-
tion, cataloguing and maintenance of drawings.
In addition to these procedures, the design office will also have to provide a
complete listing of all the relevant components, availability, acceptability and
adequacy and be aware of all the advances in both materials and equipment that
are currently available on today’s market which are relevant to the product.
It is imperative that the design team maintains a close relationship with the
manufacturing division throughout these initial stages so as to be aware of
their exact requirements, their problems, their choice of components etc., assist
in the analysis of failures, swiftly produce solutions and forestall costly work
stoppages. One of the main problems to overcome is the ease with which the
design office can make an arbitrary selection, but then find that the size and
tolerance is completely inappropriate for the manufacturing or assembly
process.
In order that the statistical significance of a particular failure can be
assessed and correct retroactive action taken, it is essential that the design team
has access to all the records, failure reports and other data as soon as it is avail-
able within the design office or shop floor.
The storage, maintenance and analysis of reliability data will require the design
team to follow the progress of the product throughout its productive life cycle, its
many maintenance cycles and to take due note of customers’comments.
The compilation and retention of design office reliability data is not only
very important, but also essential to the reliability of the product and the manu-
facturing facility.
Nowadays, of course, most large design offices are computerised and use
processors to store their records on discs so that these records can be continu-
ally updated and amended. This information (data) can then be used with stan-
dard software such as Computer Aided Design (CAD) programs and computer
aided design facilities to produce lists, graphs and drawings. The possibilities
are almost endless but there are associated problems such as security against
virus attack and computer crashes.
3.4.2 Manufacturing stage
‘Manufacturing operations must be carried out under controlled conditions’
(ISO 9004:2000).
Quality control and quality assurance 169

During all manufacturing processes (and throughout early in-service life),
the product must be subjected to a variety of quality control procedures and
checks in order to evaluate the degree of quality.
One of the first things that must be done is to predict the reliability of the prod-
uct’s design. This involves obtaining sufficient statistical data so as to be able to
estimate the actual reliability of the design before a product is manufactured.
All the appropriate engineering data has to be carefully examined, parti-
cularly the reliability ratings of recommended parts and components. The
designer then extrapolates and interpolates this data and uses probability methods
to examine the reliability of a proposed design.
Design deficiencies such as assembly errors, operator learning, motivational
or fatigue factors, latent defects and improper part selection are frequently
uncovered during this process.
3.4.3 Acceptance stage
‘The Quality of a product must be proved before being accepted’ (ISO
9004:2000).
‘The outputs of design and development shall be provided in a form that enables
verification against the design and development input and shall be approved
prior to release’ (ISO 9001:2000 clause 7.3.3).
During the acceptance stage, the product is subjected to a series of tests
designed to confirm that the workmanship of the product fully meets the levels

of quality required, or stipulated by the user and that the product performs the
required function correctly. Tests will range from environmental tests of indi-
vidual components to field testing complete systems.
Three mathematical expressions are commonly used to measure reliability
and each of these expressions can be applied to a part, component assembly or
an entire system. They are, Probability Function (PF), Failure Rate (FR) and
Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF).
3.4.4 In-service stage
‘Evaluation of product performance during typical operating conditions and
feedback of information gained through field use improves product capability’
(ISO 9004:2000).
During the in-service stage the equipment user is, of course, principally 
concerned with system and equipment reliability.
Although reliability is based on the product’s generic design (and can be eas-
ily proved by statistics), its practical reliability is often far less design depend-
ent. This difference can be due to poor or faulty operating procedures,
operating the system beyond its design capability or operational abuses (e.g.
personal, extended duty cycles, neglected maintenance, training etc.). Each of
these hazards can damage individual components and sub assemblies and each
will, in turn, reduce the product’s dependability.

It is interesting to note that according to studies completed by the British
Chartered Management Institute at the turn of the century, the maintenance
technician (or engineer) still remains the primary cause of reliability degrada-
tions during the in-service stage. The problems associated with poorly trained,
poorly supported, or poorly motivated maintenance personnel with respect to
reliability and dependability requires careful assessment and quantification.
The most important factor that affects the overall reliability of a modern
product, nevertheless, is the increased number of individual components that
are required in that product. Since most system failures are actually caused by
the failure of a single component, the reliability of each individual component
must be considerably better than the overall system reliability.
Information obtained from in-service use and field failures are enormously
useful (always assuming that they are entirely accurate, of course!) in evaluat-
ing a product’s performance during typical operating conditions. But the  ain
reason for accumulating failure reports from the field is to try to improve the
product. This can be achieved by analysing the reports, finding out what
caused the failure and taking steps to prevent it from recurring in the future.
Because of this requirement, quality standards for the maintenance, repair
and inspection of in-service products have had to be laid down in engineering
standards, handbooks and local operating manuals (written for specific items
and equipment). These publications are used by maintenance engineers and
should always include the most recent amendments. It is essential that quality
assurance personnel also use the same procedures for their inspections.

3.5 Benefits and costs of quality assurance
‘An effective QMS should be designed to satisfy the purchaser’s conditions,
requirements and expectations whilst serving to protect the manufacturer’s
best interests’ (ISO 9004:2000).
In practice, some quality assurance programmes can be very expensive to
install and operate, particularly if inadequate quality control methods were
used previously. If the purchaser requires consistent quality he must pay for it,
regardless of the specification or order which the manufacturer has accepted.
However, against this expenditure must always be offset the savings in
scrapped material, rework and general problems arising from lack of quality.
From a manufacturer’s point of view there is a business requirement to
obtain and maintain the desired quality at an optimum cost. The following
represent some of the additional expenses that can be incurred:

salaries for the quality assurance team, planners, quality supervisors, cali-
bration/test equipment staff and Quality Managers;

training for the quality assurance team;

visits by the quality assurance staff to other companies, subcontractors and the
eventual consumer, for evaluation and audit of their facilities and products;

test equipment of a recognised type, standard and quality; regularly main-
tained and calibrated by an accredited calibration centre;

better storage facilities.
But why bother with ‘quality assurance’?! It is all very expensive to set up and
extremely expensive to run – is it really worth it?!
The short answer is, ‘yes’.

Figure 3.12 Quality Management System costs

In order to be part of this enormous European and world market, manufac-
turers, suppliers and sole traders must not merely be aware of the requirements
and need for quality assurance, they must also be able to prove that they are
capable of constantly producing a quality product that is as good as, if not 
better, than any others available.
Hopefully they will take pride in producing an item of equipment or system
that operates correctly and which will fully satisfy the purchaser – as opposed
to something that goes wrong as soon as it is switched on. There will not be
many reorders for that model!
Insisting on an assurance of quality has got to save money in the long run. It
ensures that manufacturing design features are more dependable and efficient,
and built-in quality at every stage will obviously reduce wastage and increase
customer satisfaction.
3.6 Costs of quality failure
With an effective QMS in place, the manufacturer will achieve increased prof-
itability and market share and the purchaser can expect reduced costs, improved
product fitness for role, increased satisfaction and, above all, growth in confidence.
3.6.1 The manufacturer
Lack of quality control and quality assurance can cause the manufacturer to:

replace scrapped material or have to rework unsatisfactory material;

re-inspect and reprocess material returned as unsatisfactory by the purchaser;

lose money by having to send staff to the purchasers premises to sort out
their complaints of unsatisfactory labour;

lose money through a major quality failure halting production;

lose money through field repairs, replacements and other work having to
be carried out under warranty;

lose money by having to carry out investigations into claims of unsatisfac-
tory work;

lose money by having to investigate alternative methods of producing an
article without quality failures;

lose their image and reputation;

lose market potential;

have to acknowledge complaints, claims, liabilities and be subject to waste
of human and financial resources;
But most of all …

lose customers!
174 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses

3.6.2 The purchaser
By not insisting that the manufacturer abides by a set of recognised quality
standards, the purchaser can be involved in:

delays in being able to use the product and the possibility of the purchaser
losing orders because of it;

possible increases in their organisation, operation, maintenance downtime
and repair costs;

dissatisfaction with goods and services;

health and safety aspects (now a mandatory requirement of ISO
9001:2000);

lack of confidence in the manufacturer.
Quality control and quality assurance 175
So far we have detailed some of the requirements and benefits of
quality control and quality assurance from the point of view of the
manufacturer, supplier, purchaser and the end user. Terms have
been explained and specifications defined.
Having discussed the pros and cons of an efficient quality sys-
tem, in Part Four we will see how by adopting a properly structured
Quality Management System we can meet these requirements.

supply at a cost that will still bring a profit to that organisation.
They must, above all, provide a quality product that will promote further procure-
ment and recommendations.
So how can your organisation become a quality organisation? Well, I can assure
you that it is not just a case of simply claiming that you are a reliable organisa-
tion and then telling everyone that you will be able to supply a reliable product
or service! Nowadays, especially in the European and American markets, pur-
chasers are demanding proof of these claims. Proof that you are the organisation
that they should be dealing with.
How can anyone supply this proof? Well, up until the end of 1994 the standard
that was most often called up in UK contracts was BS 5750:1987. Within the
Single European Market, tenders required the equivalent European Union
(EU) standard EN 29000:1987 or the equivalent International standard (ISO
9000:1987). In America these are included in the ASQC Q90 series.
Nowadays, of course, these requirements are covered under the common
ISO 9001:2000 and ISO 9004:2000 standards (see Part One). These standards
provided the requirements and guidelines for organisations wishing to establish
their own QMS and in doing so control the quality of their organisation – from
within their organisation.
You may also find that some contracts stipulate that the product ‘must comply
with the requirements of (such and such) a standard’(for example, for a British
component manufacturer it might be BS 3934:1992 ‘Mechanical standardisation
of semiconductor devices’, or ANSI A137-1:1988 ‘Ceramic Tiles’).
But perhaps we are moving on too fast. Before an organisation is even quali-
fied to tender for a contract to produce something, they must first prove their
organisation capability by showing that they can operate a Quality Management
System.
To satisfy these requirements an organisation’s QMS has to encompass all the
different levels of quality control that are required during the various stages of
design, manufacture and acceptance of a product and be capable of guaranteeing
quality acceptance.
180 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses

These requirements are covered by national, European and international
standards. But although these standards may vary slightly from country to
country, basically they are very similar and cover the following topics:

organisational structure;

measurement of quality assurance;

the contract;

design control;

purchasing and procurement;

production control;

product testing;

handling, storage, packaging and delivery;

after sales service.
4.2 Quality Management System principles
The first thing that ISO 9000 requires is for an organisation to set up and fully
document their position with regard to quality assurance. These documents
comprise the organisation’s QMS and describe their capability for supplying
goods and services that will comply with laid down quality standards. It contains
a general description of the organisation’s attitude to quality assurance and spe-
cific details about the quality assurance and quality control from within that
organisation.

Figure 4.2 Quality Management System – organisational structure

To be successful an organisation must be able to prove that they are capable
of producing the component, product or service to the customer’s complete sat-
isfaction so that it conforms exactly to the purchaser’s specific requirements
and that it is always of the desired quality.
An organisation’s QMS is, therefore, the organisational structure of respon-
sibilities, procedures, processes and resources for carrying out quality man-
agement and as such must be planned and developed in order to be capable of
maintaining a consistent level of quality control.
The QMS must be structured to the organisation’s own particular type of busi-
ness and should consider all functions such as customer liaison, designing, pur-
chasing, subcontracting, manufacturing, training, installation, updating of quality
control techniques and the accumulation of quality records. In most organisations
this sort of information will normally be found in the organisation Quality Manual.
The type of QMS chosen will, of course, vary from organisation to organisa-
tion depending upon its size and capability. There are no set rules as to exactly

how these documents should be written. However, they should – as a minimum
requirement – be capable of showing the potential customer exactly how the
manufacturer or supplier is equipped to achieve and maintain the highest level
of quality throughout the various stages of design, production, installation and
servicing.
As an example, some of the determinants and measures of the quality of a
service are shown in Figure 4.4 whilst those effecting the quality of a product are
shown in Figure 4.5.
4.3 Quality Management System approach
Customers require products that continually meet their needs and expectations
and in order to be profitable, an organisation must be able to offer products that
continually achieve customer satisfaction and satisfy their customers’ require-
ments. As well as providing a framework for providing customer satisfaction, 
a QMS also provides confidence (to the organisation and to its customers) 
that the organisation is capable of providing products that consistently fulfil


determining the needs and expectations of the customer;

establishing the quality policy and quality objectives of the organisation;

determining the processes and responsibilities necessary to attain the quality
objectives;

establishing measures for the effectiveness of each process towards attaining
the quality objectives;



determining means of preventing non-conformities and eliminating their
causes;

looking for opportunities to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of
processes;

determining and prioritising those improvements which can provide optimum
results;

Any organisation that adopts the above approach will create confidence in 
the capability of its processes and the reliability of its products. It will also 
provide a basis for continual improvement and can lead to increased customer
satisfaction.
4.3.1 What is a quality system?
In terms of the ISO standard, ‘quality system’and ‘Quality Management System’
mean one and the same thing. A ‘quality system’, however, is neither a manual
(i.e. a document) nor a computer program (which is an information system as
opposed to being a real quality system), it is a system that contains all the things
that are used to regulate, control, and improve the quality of your products and/or
services. It is a network of interrelated processes with each process being made
up of people, work, activities, tasks, records, documents, forms, resources, rules,
regulations, reports, materials, supplies, tools, equipment etc. that are required
to transform inputs into outputs.
4.3.2 What is the difference between a quality manual and
a quality system?
Basically, a quality manual is all about paperwork and is just a document whereas
a quality system is about a network of processes. Your quality manual is not
supposed to be your system, it merely documents your quality system.
4.4 Quality Management System structure
An organisation’s QMS defines the policy, organisation and responsibilities for
the management of quality within that organisation.
It ensures that all activities comply with an agreed set of rules, regulations
and guidelines and that the end product (i.e. the deliverable) conforms to the
customer’s (i.e. the user’s) contractual requirements.
Quality Management System 185

4.4.1 QMS documentation
‘A QMS can only be effective if it is fully documented, understood and followed
by all’(ISO 9000:2000).
Within the ISO 9001:2000 quality model, there are four levels of documen-
tation and these are structured as shown in Figure 4.6 above.
When trying to work out which processes should be documented, the organ-
isation may wish to consider factors such as:

effect on quality;

risk of customer dissatisfaction;

statutory and/or regulatory requirements;

economic risk;

competence of personnel;

complexity of processes.
Where it is found necessary to document processes, a number of different
methods (such as graphical representations, written instructions, checklists,
flow charts, visual media, or electronic methods) can be used.

4.5 Quality Manual
The Quality Manual is at the very heart of an organisation’s Quality Management
System and describes the interrelationships between:

A Process – an outline of its objective, scope and key performance indicators;

Quality Procedures – an enlargement of the process explaining how it is
controlled;

Work Instructions – the ‘fine print’ required to perform a specific activity.
It is the main policy document that establishes the QMS and how it meets the
requirements of ISO 9001:2000. It provides general information on the system
(i.e. objectives, goals, roles, organisation and responsibilities).
The Quality Manual (see example in Part Six) is the formal record of that
organisation’s QMS. It:

is a rule book by which an organisation functions;

is a source of information from which the client may derive confidence;

provides consistent information, both internally and externally, about the
organisation’s QMS;

is a means of defining the responsibilities and inter-related activities of
every member of the organisation;

is a vehicle for auditing, reviewing and evaluating the organisation’s QMS.
To be effective, the Quality Manual:

will have to include a firm statement of the organisation’s policy towards
quality control;

must contain details of their quality assurance section, its structure and

The Quality Manual will describe how the organisation:

documents and records inspections;

how their goods inwards facility operates;

how they monitor quality.
The Quality Manual will identify the organisation’s business-critical processes
and their associated Quality Procedures (QPs) and Work Instructions (WIs). The
Quality Manual will also provide examples of the various forms and documenta-
tion used by the manufacturer – such as production control forms, inspection
sheets and documents used to purchase components from subcontractors.
For a complete description and guidance on how to develop a Quality Manual,
the reader is referred to ISO 10013 – Guidelines for developing Quality
Manuals.
4.6 Processes
Processes describe the activities required to implement the QMS and to meet
the policy requirements set out in the Quality Manual.
Typically, the organisational processes making up a company’s QMS will
normally comprise a Core Business Process supplemented by a number of sup-
porting processes which describe the infrastructure required to produce the

process
It commences with the definition of corporate policy and 
ends when the product is manufactured and marketed.
The Core Business Process is then supplemented by a
number of supporting processes that describe the
infrastructure required to manufacture (or supply) the
product on time.
Note: All businesses revolve around taking inputs and putting
them through a series of activities that turn them into useful
outputs, be that a product or service. These activities are the
supporting processes.

supporting
a logical sequence, takes you from receipt of an order

(or marketing opportunity) through to the realisation of
the finished product or service.
Secondary 
The purpose of secondary supporting processes is
supporting 
to document those activities that are essential for 
processes
supporting and achieving the primary supporting 
processes.
Secondary supporting processes will have an identical
structure to the primary supporting processes, and 
will also have their own associated supporting
documentation [e.g. Quality Procedures (QPs) and
Work Instructions (WIs)]. Secondary supporting
processes may include such things as:
 identification and provision of suitable staff;
 management and support of staff;
 identification and provision of information;
 identification and provision of materials;
 identification and provision of equipment and facilities;
 management of the QMS;
 continual improvement.
Note: A process owner with full responsibility and authority for managing the
process and achieving process objectives should be nominated.

For each process there will be an organisation document detailing:
 Objective – what the process aims to achieve;
 Scope – what the process covers;
 Responsible owner – who is ultimately responsible for implementing the
process;
 Policy – what the organisation intends doing to ensure quality is controlled;
 Key performance indicators – those items of objective evidence that can
be used as a way of monitoring performance of the process;
 Cross reference to supporting system documentation (QPs and WIs).
All processes should be documented to give a complete picture of how to per-
form the activity to a consistent level of quality. The level of detail varies from:
 Process – an outline of its objective, scope and key performance indicators;
 Quality Procedures – an enlargement of the process explaining how it is
controlled;
 Work Instructions – the ‘fine print’required to perform a specific activity.
4.7 Quality Procedures
QPs are formal documents that describe the method by which the Core Business
and supporting processes are managed. They describe how the policy object-
ives of the Quality Manual can be met in practice and how these processes are
controlled. They contain the basic documentation used for planning and con-
trolling all activities that impact on quality.
There are two types of procedures namely:

system level procedures that are used to detail the activities needed to
implement the QMS;

procedures that describe the sequence of processes necessary to ensure the
conformity of a product or service.
4.7.1 What documented procedures are required by 
ISO 9001:2000?
In section 4.2.2 of ISO 9001:2000, the standard requires the organisation to:
‘establish and maintain a quality manual that includes the documented
procedures established for the quality management system’.
There is no restriction about how many of these documented procedures an
organisation should have to cover, ISO 9001:2000 does, however, contain a manda-
tory requirement for formal documented procedures to be produced for the:
1. Control of documents (4.2.3);
2. Control of quality records (4.2.4);
190 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses

3. Internal audits (8.2.2);
4. Control of non-conforming products (8.3);
5. Corrective actions (8.5.2);
6. Preventative actions (8.5.3).
Note: Where the term ‘documented procedure’ appears within this
International Standard, this means that the procedure has to be established,
documented, implemented and maintained.
By implication documented procedures should also be included for:
1. Customer Communications (7.2.3)
(which states: ‘The organisation shall determine and implement effective
arrangements for communication with customers’).
2. Purchasing process (7.4.1)
(which states: ‘Criteria for selection, evaluation and re-evaluation shall be
established’).
Note: Procedures can take any suitable form. They can be a narrative, a flow
chart, a process map, or indeed any other suitable structure. As long as the 
procedure is effective, it really doesn’t matter what it looks like.
4.8 Work Instructions
WIs describe in detail how individual tasks and activities are to be carried out,
e.g. what is to be done, by whom and when it has to be completed.
Work Instructions describe:

the physical operating practices and controls within each process;

in detail, how individual tasks and activities are to be carried out.
In other words what is to be done, by whom and when.
They provide examples of the various forms and documentation used by the
manufacturer or supplier. For instance:

production control forms;

inspection sheets;

documents used to purchase components from subcontractors.
Note: Work Instructions, similar to the remainder of the QMS documentation,
can take any appropriate form. However, one of the best ways to document a
work instruction is probably to use a flow chart associated with a form which
can then become a record once they are filled in.
Quality Management System 191

4.8.1 What is the difference between a Work Instruction
and a record?
Work Instructions describe how tasks should be done and are used before the task
is performed. Records document how tasks were actually done and are used after
the task has been performed. Work Instructions come before the fact, while
records come after the fact.
4.9 Quality Plan
When complex assemblies or multi-part contracts are required, separate instruc-
tions may have to be included in the Quality Manual in order to cover individual
parts of the contract. These types of instructions are called Quality Plans.
The accepted definition (as provided in ISO 9000:2000) of a Quality Plan is
that it is ‘… a document specifying which procedures and associated resources
shall be applied, by whom and when to a specific project, product, process or
contract’. In setting out the specific quality practices, resources and sequence
of activities a Quality Plan, therefore, ensures that specific requirements for
quality are appropriately planned and addressed. It should state its purpose, to

what it applies its quality objectives (in measurable terms), specific exclusions
and, of course, its period of validity.
Quality Plans describe how the QMS is applied to a specific product or con-
tract. They may be used to demonstrate how the quality requirements of a par-
ticular contract will be met, and to monitor and assess adherence to those
requirements. While a Quality Plan usually refers to the appropriate parts of
the Quality Manual, it can be used in conjunction with a QMS or as a stand-
alone document.
Quality Plans provide a collated summary of the requirements for a specific
activity. They include less information than the organisation’s QMS but, with
all the detail brought together, the requirement for performance should be more
readily understandable and the risk of non-conformance and misinterpretation
of intentions should be reduced.
Quality assurance for the manufacture of complex assemblies can be very
difficult to stipulate in a contract especially if the most important inspections
have to be left until the assembly is almost complete – and by which time many
of the sub assemblies and components will have become almost inaccessible!
In these cases it is essential for the organisation’s Quality Manager to develop
and produce a Quality Plan that details all the important information that has
to be provided to the shop floor management.
The Quality Plan will cover all of the quality practices and resources that are
going to be used, the sequence of events relevant to that product, the specific
allocation of responsibilities, methods, QPs and WIs, together with the details
of the testing, inspection, examination and audit programme stages.
The Quality Plan should, nevertheless, be flexible and written in such a way
that it is possible to modify its content to reflect changing circumstances.
At all work places, QPs and WIs must be readily available. These will include
the specifications that must be obeyed, particulars of the drawings, documen-
tation, tools and gauges that are going to be used, the sampling method, the tests
which have to be made, the test specifications and procedures, the acceptance/
rejection criteria – and so on.
The main requirement of a Quality Plan, however, is to provide the customer
(and the workforce) with clear, concise instructions and guidance as well as the
appropriate inspection methods and procedures; the results of inspections
(including rejections) and details of any concessions issued for rework or
repair. All these must be clearly recorded and available for a purchaser’s future
(possible) examination.
A well thought out Quality Plan will divide the project, service, product or
assembly work into stages, show what type of inspection has to be completed
at the beginning, during, or end of each stage and indicate how these details
should be recorded on the final document. The Quality Plan should be planned
and developed in conjunction with design, development, manufacturing, sub-
contract and installation work and ensure that all functions have been fully
catered for.
Quality Management System 193

One of the main objectives of quality planning is to identify any special or
unusual requirements, processes, techniques including those requirements that
are unusual by reason of newness, unfamiliarity, lack of experience and/or
absence of precedents. As ISO 9004:2000 points out, if the contract specifies
that Quality Plans are required, then these Quality Plans should fully cover the
following areas and ensure that:

design, contract, development, manufacturing and installation activities are
well documented and adequate;

all controls, processes, inspection equipment, fixtures, tooling, manpower
resources and skills that an organisation must have to achieve the required
quality, have been identified, recorded and the necessary action taken to
obtain any additional components, documentation etc. that is required;

quality control, inspection and testing techniques (including the develop-
ment of new instrumentation) have been updated;

any new measurement technique (or any measurement involving a meas-
urement capability that exceeds the known state of the art) that is required
to inspect the product, has been identified and action taken to develop that
capability;

standards of acceptability for all features and requirements (including those
which contain a subjective element) have been clearly recorded;

compatibility of design, manufacturing process, installation, inspection
procedures and applicable documentation have been assured well before
production begins;

as each special requirement is identified, the means for testing and being
able to prove successfully that the product or service is capable of success-
fully complying with the requirements has to be considered.
The integration of special or unusual requirements into the QMS must be care-
fully investigated, planned and documented.
As a Quality Plan is effectively a sub set of the actual Quality Manual. The
layout of the Quality Plan is very similar to that of the Quality Manual and
refers (other than system-specific QPs and WIs) normally to the QPs and Work
Instructions contained in that Quality Manual.
The following briefly describes how each of the ISO 9000 elements is 
covered in a Quality Plan.
4.9.1 Management responsibility
The Quality Plan should show who is responsible for:

ensuring activities are planned, implemented, controlled and monitored;

communicating requirements and resolving problems;

reviewing audit results;
194 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses


authorising exemption requests;

implementing corrective action requests.
Where the necessary documentation already exists under the present QMS,
the Quality Plan need only refer to a specific situation or specification.
4.9.2 Contract review
Contract review should cover:

when, how and by whom the review is made;

how the results are to be documented;

how conflicting instructions or ambiguities are resolved.
4.9.3 Design control
Design control should indicate:

when, how and by whom the design process, validation and verification of
the design output is carried out, controlled and documented;

any customer involvement;

applicable codes of practice, standards, specifications and regulatory
requirements.


what is provided and how it is controlled;

how related documents will be identified;

how and by whom access to the documents can be obtained;

how and by whom the original documents are reviewed and approved.
4.9.5 Purchasing
Under the heading of purchasing the following should be indicated:

the important products to be purchased;

the source and requirements relating to them;

the method, evaluation, selection and control of subcontractors;

the need for a subcontractor’s Quality Plan in order to satisfy the regulatory
requirements applicable to purchase products/services.
4.9.6 Customer supplied product
Customer supplied products should refer to:

how they are identified and controlled;

how they are verified as meeting specified requirements;

how non-conformance is dealt with.
4.9.7 Product identification and traceability
If traceability is a requirement then the plan should:

define its scope and extent (including how services/products are identi-
fied);

indicate how contractual and regulatory authority traceability requirements
are identified and incorporated into working documents;

indicate how records are to be generated, controlled and distributed.
4.9.8 Process control
Process control may include:

the procedures/instructions;

process steps;

methods to monitor and control processes;

service/product characteristics.

Quality Management System 197
The plan could also include details of:

reference criteria for workmanship;

special and qualified processes;

tools, techniques and methods to be used.
4.9.9 Inspection and testing
Inspection and testing should indicate:

any inspection and test plan;

how the subcontractors’ product shall be verified;

the location of inspection and test points;

procedures and acceptance criteria;

witness verification points (customers as well as regulatory);

where, when and how the customer requires third parties to perform:
– type tests;
– witness testing;
– service/product verification;
– material, service/product, process or personnel certification.
4.9.10 Inspection, measuring and test equipment
Inspection, measuring and test equipment should:

refer to the identity of the equipment;

refer to the method of calibration;

indicate and record calibration status and usage of the equipment;

indicate specific requirements for the identification of inspection and test
status.
4.9.11 Non-conforming service/product

given:

of how such a service/product is identified and segregated;

the degree or type of rework allowed;

the circumstances under which the supplier can request concessions.
Details should also be provided with respect to:

corrective and preventive action;

handling, storage, packaging, preservation and delivery.

4.9.12 Other considerations
Quality Plans should:

indicate key quality records (i.e. what they are, how long they should be
kept, where and by whom);

suggest how legal or regulatory requirements are to be satisfied;

specify the form in which records should be kept (e.g. paper, microfilm or
disc);

define liability, storage, retrievability, disposition and confidentiality
requirements;

include the nature and extent of quality audits to be undertaken;

indicate how the audit results are to be used to correct and prevent recur-
rence of deficiencies;

show how the training of staff in new or revised operating methods is to be
completed.
Where servicing is a specified requirement, suppliers should state their inten-
tions to assure conformance to applicable servicing requirements, such as:

regulatory and legislative requirements;

industry codes and practices;

service level agreements;

training of customer personnel;

availability of initial and ongoing support during the agreed time-period;

statistical techniques, where relevant.
Note: For further information I would recommend looking at ISO 10005:1995
which provides the reader with guidance on how to produce Quality Plans as well
as including helpful suggestions on how to maintain an organisation’s quality
activities.
4.10 Quality records
Quality records provide objective evidence of activities performed or results
achieved.
Records of QMS inspections and tests concerning the design, testing, sur-
vey, audit and review of a product or service are the evidence that a supplier is
capable of and is indeed meeting the quality requirements of the customer.
Records such as QMS audit reports, calibration of test and measuring equip-
ment, inspections, tests, approvals, concessions, etc., ensure that an organisa-
tion is capable of proving the effectiveness of their QMS.
Records, therefore, are important parts of quality management and the QMS
will have to identify exactly what type of record is to be made, at what stage of
198 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses

the production process they should be made and who should make them etc. 
To be of any real value it is essential that these records are covered by clear,
concise instructions and procedures. Above all, the storage of records should
be systematic and capable of being easily and quickly accessed.
Having agreed and decided on the necessity for records, the next step is to:

establish methods for making changes, modifications, revisions and additions
to these records;

establish methods for accounting for the documents;

show their retention time;

lay down methods for the disposal of those that are superseded or become out
of date;

show how they should be stored.
These procedures would be written up as QPs and will normally form part of
the Quality Manual. WIs should also be available to show how important it is
to keep records of defects, diagnosis of their causes and details of the correct-
ive action that was carried out together with the success or failure of this cor-
rective action.
If this information is stored in a computer, then it is essential that the
integrity of that system must also be satisfactorily assured.
The retention of records is an aspect that is far too often overlooked by
organisations. Records are very important, not only from an historical point of
view, but also as a means to settling disputes about bad workmanship, identifying
faults and settling production problems whether this be internally, by the supplier,
or externally, by the organisation.

In Part Four of this book we have addressed the basic require-
ments for a Quality Management System and shown how ISO
9000 can be structured to suit a particular business or profession.
In Part Five, quality control techniques, the organisational
structure and the duties of quality assurance personnel plus their
resources are discussed.

Part Five
Quality Organisational

Having seen the basic requirements for a Quality Management System,
Part Five will cover quality control techniques, organisational structure
and duties of quality staff.
Then in Part Six a complete example of a Quality Manual is provided
which can be easily customised to suit any organisation’s business.

Quality organisational
structure
As previously described in Chapter 4, the QMS is an organisation’s rulebook
which defines the policy, organisation and responsibilities for the management
of quality within an organisation. The following tables are an indication of the
sort of tasks that senior management would be responsible for in a typical
organisation (see Table 5.1 below).
For a manufacturing organisation, these responsibilities will then probably
be further subdivided as shown in Table 5.2 overleaf:
Table 5.1 Organisational responsibilities – senior management
Title
Responsibility
Managing Director
• Establish, document and define the
organisation’s policy and objectives;
• approve the QMS;
• management reviews;
• design control.
Quality Manager
• Internal audit;
• resolution of QMS discrepancies;
• control & maintenance of the QMS;
• quality documentation & (quality) change
control procedures;
• quality training.
Financial Director
• Control of budget and finance;
• supplier selection and purchasing;
• contract management, control and review;
• management & co-ordination of sales and
support functions.

5.1 Management
The main requirement of the organisation’s management is that they establish,
define and document their organisation’s policy, objectives and commitments
to quality. This documented system is then presented as a Quality Manual,
quality programme, or as a controlled documented system.
Whatever system is chosen, the document must include details of the organisa-
tion’s Quality Management System (QMS) and the aims, policies, organisation

and procedures that are essential to demonstrate that they are in agreement
with the requirements of ISO 9001:2000.
Note: Suppliers having difficulty in establishing their own particular level of
managerial responsibility with regard to organisation quality assurance should
obtain a copies of BS 6143:1992 ‘Guide to the economics of quality’ Parts 1
and 2. These standards are available from the BSI and are a user-friendly 
guide to:

the costs for continuous improvement and Total Quality Management
(TQM) (Part 1);

the costs of defect prevention and a study of the various activities and
losses due to internal or external failures (Part 2).
Having established their overall position, the management will then have to:

develop, control, co-ordinate, supervise and monitor their corporate 
quality policy and ensure that this policy is understood and maintained
throughout the organisation;


ensure that the organisation’s QMS always meets the requirements of the
national, European or international standards that that particular organisa-
tion has chosen to work to and where this fails to happen, see that correc-
tive actions are carried out;

define objectives such as fitness for use;

ensure that the performance, safety and reliability of a product or service is
correct and make sure that the costs associated with these objectives are
kept to a reasonable figure.
5.2 Quality assurance personnel
As previously described in Part Three, quality assurance is concerned with a
consistency of quality and an agreed level of quality. To achieve these aims the
organisation must be firmly committed to the fundamental principle of consist-
ently supplying the right quality product. Equally, a purchaser must be com-
mitted to the fundamental principle of only accepting the right quality product.

Figure 5.2 Quality assurance – typical organisation structure

Thus, a commitment within all levels of an organisation (manufacturer, sup-
plier or purchaser), to the basic principles of quality assurance and quality con-
trol is required. It is, therefore, essential that a completely separate and
independent division is formed to deal solely with quality matters. In a large
company the organisation and duties of this section would usually look some-
thing like that shown in Figure 5.2.
5.2.1 Quality manager
The first requirement is for the organisation to nominate an individual who will
be solely responsible to top management for the implementation and maint-
enance of the QMS. This person is called the ‘Quality Manager’.
The Quality Manager will answer directly to the Managing Director and will
be responsible for all matters regarding the quality of the end product together
with the activities of all sections within the organisation’s premises.
In small organisations this requirement might even be part of the General
Manager’s duties, but regardless of who it may be, it is essential that this per-
son must be someone who is completely independent of any manufacturing,
production or user function and has a thorough working knowledge of the
requirements and recommendations of ISO 9000.
In addition, owing to the importance of quality assurance, it is essential that
the Quality Manager is fully qualified (both technically and administratively)
and can quickly exert (show) his position and authority.
As can be seen from Figure 5.3, the Quality Manager’s job is usually a very
busy one (even in a small organisation!) and the Quality Manager’s respon-
sibilities are spread over a wide area which covers all of the organisation’s
operations.
5.2.1.1 General functional description
The Quality Manager is responsible for ensuring that the organisation’s QMS
is defined, implemented, audited and monitored in order to ensure that the
organisation’s deliverables comply with both the customer’s quality and safety
standards together with the requirements of ISO 9001:2000.
5.2.1.2 Tasks
The Quality Manager reports directly to the General Manager and his tasks
will include:

ensuring the consistency of the organisation’s QMS;

ensuring compliance of the organisation’s QMS with ISO 9001:2000;

maintenance and effectiveness of the organisation’s QMS;

ensuring that the quality message is transmitted to and understood by
everyone.

5.2.1.3 Responsibilities
The Quality Manager is responsible for:

ensuring that the Quality Manual and individual Quality Plans are keptup
to date;

assisting and advising with the preparation of the organisation’s proce-
dures;

producing, reviewing and updating the organisation’s QMS;

ensuring compliance with the organisation’s QMS by means of frequent
audits;

maintaining the organisation’s quality records;

producing, auditing and maintaining division, section and project Quality
Plans;

identifying potential/current problem areas within the organisation’s life
cycle through analysis of organisation error reports;

holding regular division quality audits.

5.2.1.4 Co-ordination
The Quality Manager shall:

act as the focal point for all of the organisation’s quality matters within the
organisation;

co-ordinate and verify that all internal procedures and instructions are in
accordance with the recommendations of ISO 9001:2000;

operate the QMS as described in the Quality Manual and ensure that its
regulations are observed.
Above all the Quality Manager must always ensure that the customer’s interests
are protected. Even if this means, at times, that he and his division become very
unpopular with the rest of the organisation and sometimes they even have to
assume the mantel of organisation ‘scapegoat’!
5.2.2 Chief Quality Assurance Inspector
There may be more than one Chief Quality Assurance Inspector (QAI) in an
organisation depending upon its size and activities.
The duties of the Chief QAI are to:

plan, co-ordinate and supervise all pre-shop, in-process, and out-going
inspections within their area of responsibility;

ensure that the product or service is in agreement with the customers’require-
ments and conform to the established quality standards and specifications;

be responsible for scheduling and controlling inspections, designating
inspection stations, setting up local inspection procedures and statistical
inspection controls;

oversee the maintenance of inspection records, control charts and the
preparation of inspection reports;

ensure that all test equipment is maintained, properly calibrated and readily
available at all inspection stations;

be responsible for reviewing the maintenance of quality inspection stations;

co-ordinate on-the-job and cross training within sections;

establish and maintain inspection systems and controls to determine the
acceptability of a completed product;

be responsible for detecting deficiencies during manufacture, initiate cor-
rective actions where applicable and prevent defects;

compile quality and feedback data, quality history and statistical results to
help quality control development, refinement and management;

advise management and key maintenance personnel on all aspects con-
cerning quality trends.

5.2.3 Section Quality Assurance Inspectors
Two assurers are normally nominated for each section, a principal and an 
alternate. The principal is always the assurer, the alternate assumes the duties
when asked to do so by the principal and during the absence of the principal.
When not engaged on QA duties, the QAIs are employed on normal everyday
activities.
The task of the Section QAI is to:

review (and make recommendations) to the Chief QAI on all things con-
cerning engineering change proposals, waivers, deviations and substitution
of parts, materials, equipment and processes;

compile quality feedback data and quality history sheets;

supply technical data and assistance to the design office.

5.2.4 Quality assurance personnel
Quality assurance personnel are members of the organisation judged compe-
tent to carry out quality assurance duties. They are nominated by the Quality
Manager in consultation with the QAIs and are directly responsible to the
Quality Manager when engaged in QA work.
Quality assurance personnel are:

not to allow their own judgement to be influenced by others;

not to allow equipment to leave the premises below the desired standard;

to ensure – by close liaison with Section Heads – that a section’s work is not
unreasonably delayed because of quality assurance;

to ensure that when a job (system, module or equipment etc.) fails their
inspection that the respective Section QAI is informed and that the Section
Head (and engineer responsible) are made fully aware of the reasons for the
failure;

to advise the Section QAI of any problems associated with quality assur-
ance, particularly anything that is likely to effect production or harmony
between any of the sections and the quality assurance division.

5.2.5 Quality assurance resources
It is not enough for management to supply just the personnel for a quality
assurance section. Resources, appropriate for the implementation of the qual-
ity policies, must also be available.
These shall include:

management budget;

design and development equipment;

manufacturing equipment;

inspection, test and examination equipment;

instrumentation and computer software.
Parts One to Five have provided complete details of the back-
ground and requirements of ISO 9001:2000. Having understood
this material, it is now time to move on to the next stage – to
design your own Quality Management System!
Part Six contains a complete example of a Quality Manage-
ment System which can be used as a template to design your own
Quality Management System.

Part Six
Example Quality
Management System
Prior to the reissue of the ISO 9000 series in 2001, the majority of
organisations wrote their Quality Manuals to show how they met the 20
individual requirements of the 1994 standard. Although this made it
easier for the manual’s authors to show the auditors that all of the
requirements of the standard had been covered, quite often (especially in
a very small business), the manual was of little use to the organisation
itself in actually running their own business.
ISO 9001:2000 now requires the Quality Manual to ‘include the scope
of the system, any justifications for exclusions, refer to established proced-
ures and describe the interaction between processes’. A Quality Manual
that simply echoes the requirements of ISO 9001:2000 will, therefore,
not be compliant, as certain sections of the standard’s content may not
be applicable.
The Quality Manual should serve a useful purpose and so simply para-
phrasing ISO 9001:2000’s requirements will not represent the best
approach. Thus, an organisation should no longer use an ‘off the shelf’
generic Quality Manual to show compliance unless, it has been suit-
ably customised to suit that particular organisation.
The whole reason for my book is to try to help small businesses (who
probably have insufficient time to thoroughly read, understand, extract and
implement all of the requirements of ISO 9001:2000 – and who quite likely
cannot afford to employ a consultant to do the job for them) with a fully
worked example. Although this generic QMS is based on one particular
type of company (i.e.Stingray who are a ‘paper producing’company) it can
be used as a template to describe the way that your particular organ-
isation does business by leaving out those bits that are not particularly
relevant to you and/or amplifying/writing new policies, processes and
procedures to cover the organisation-specific areas that I have not 
covered in my book.
Although a lot of consultants say that there is now no need to address
each requirement, clause by clause, I tend to disagree because if you

214 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses
are having to identify the requirements that are not applicable to your
organisation (i.e. the ‘exclusions’) and then say why they are permitted
exclusions, surely there is less chance of missing a possible sub-
requirement by actually listing all of them and showing whether they are
applicable or not?! If you are having to describe the interaction between
processes (which probably result from different requirements or sub-
requirements scattered within ISO 9001:2000), then why not list them all,
so as to ensure that you don’t miss any? I have sought ISO’s advice on this
matter and they said that ‘Although ISO 9001:2000 does not state that
there needs to be any reference to the requirements of the standard, if an
organisation chooses to list all of the requirements, then that is its choice’.
As I understand it, the Quality Manual should be an overview of the
organisation’s QMS and show how the organisation runs its business.
The Manual is primarily intended for the Managing Director (to docu-
ment his policy for running that organisation), the Quality Manager (to give
him a set of rules with which to ensure that the organisation meets the pol-
icy requirements of the MD) and the auditors (to quickly identify which
of the standard’s requirements are applicable to that organisation and
how they have been met).Depending on the individual organisation, there-
fore, the Quality Manual could be just a few A4 sheets of paper simply list-
ing the exclusions, procedures and interaction of processes. Or, similar
to my generic example, it could be more of a reference document aimed
at assisting internal and external auditors in understanding the organ-
isation’s policies and how it completes its business – as well as provid-
ing a checklist for the Quality Manager.
The same thing can be said about the Quality Procedures contained
in Part 3.These again are meant as examples of the sort of QPs that will
be needed by an organisation to show how they implement their policies
and processes.They are based around Stingray (who are a paper produc-
ing consultancy as opposed to a manufacturing facility) and the inten-
tion is that purchasers/users of my book can take these QPs and then
modify, adjust and customise them to replicate what they actually do.
For example, the Document Control procedure, whilst covering the
requirements for a very large organisation would probably be over the top
for a small organisation.You do, however, need to have some form of docu-
ment control and at the very least be able to identify where your docu-
ments are located or where they are saved on the server.You may also
want to show who is responsible for these documents, their revision sta-
tus and their date of issue. In some circumstances (especially when
dealing with foreign countries) you might even need to know who was
responsible for translating a specific document.
One of the main advantages of ISO 9001:2000 is that it encourages
organisations to develop systems that are specifically tailored to their
own needs. The QMS is an integral part of the business processes but

you should not lose sight of the fact that it still has to meet the require-
ments of ISO 9001:2000.
ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses (Third Edition) is meant to save
you time from having to constantly refer to the standard to see that you
have covered everything. My generic example covers all of the standard’s
requirements and similar to the actual standard itself, the intention is that
organisations pick and choose what bits they need for themselves.
Note: To save you having to copy this QMS ‘unlocked’, fully accessible,
non .pdf, soft copies of all of these files (as well as a selection of audit
checklists etc. from the sister publication ISO 9001:2000 Audit
Procedures) are available, on a CD (for a small additional charge) from
the author in Word format. See p. xviii for further details.

1 Quality assurance at Stingray
This Quality Manual has been issued on the authority of the Managing Director
of Stingray Management Services Ltd (Stingray) for the use of all staff, sub-
contractors, clients or regulatory bodies to whom Stingray Management Services
Ltd may be required to provide such information.
This Quality Manual defines:

the overall quality policy adopted by Stingray;

the organisation that has been developed to implement this quality policy;

the documentation (i.e. Quality Processes, Quality Procedures & Work
Instructions) that has been designed to enable Stingray to carry out that
policy.
Other than the permissible exclusions shown in the relevant parts of the text,
Stingray’s Quality Manual conforms to the requirements of ISO 9001:2000 (Ref
1). It takes into consideration the requirements of Stingray’s Memorandum and
Articles of Association (Ref 3), together with all other applicable national,
European and international standards and procedures [e.g. ACP8 and ACP9
(Refs 4 and 5) written for the aircraft industry]. If there are any discrepancies
between the Stingray Quality Manual and these other directives/standards, the
requirements of the Stingray Quality Manual shall prevail.
Changes in the organisation of Stingray or the environment, in which it oper-
ates, may necessitate modifications, amendments, insertions and/or deletions
to the overall quality management adopted by Stingray and its associated docu-
mentation (e.g. Quality Processes, Quality Procedures and Work Instructions).
The contents of this Quality Manual may, therefore, be altered on an as
required basis. All changes shall be subject to QP/1 – Document Control.
Changes shall be deemed operational following approval by the authorised 
person(s) and published as updated sections of the Quality Manual.
Certain technical terms and usage in this Quality Manual, although only
reflecting the masculine gender, are, in fact, the parlance of the field and
should be interpreted to apply equally to both sexes.

ationship with our customers at every level, ensuring that they receive a qual-
ity product and service. Nothing is considered too small. Indeed Stingray have

quality infrastructure) in establishing their own Quality Management System
in accordance with ISO 9001:2000 and working towards becoming an ISO
9001:2000 certified company.
1.2 Costs
Each deliverable budget is carefully prepared taking into account the type of
product and the market to which it is aimed. Emphasis is placed on producing a
quality product at a realistic cost thereby giving the customer value for money.

1.4.2 Objectives
The main objective of the Stingray QMS is to ensure that company activities,
whether they are organisational (e.g. management and infrastructure) or tech-
nical (e.g. specification work, testing and simulation) comply with the Quality
Manual and its associated Quality Plans.
1.5 Implementation
Quality management at Stingray is based on the Quality Management System
described in ISO 9001:2000. The purpose of the Stingray QMS is to define the
policy, organisation and responsibilities for the management of quality within
Stingray.
The most important aspects of Stingray’s QMS are to be found in the
Stingray Quality Manual (i.e. this document) which describes, in detail, how
the main elements of ISO 9001:2000 are catered for. The Quality Manual
is then supported by individual Quality Plans (for each section or major 
contract/document) which in turn are supported by Quality Processes, Quality
Procedures and Work Instructions.
All Stingray personnel shall have access to a copy of this Quality Manual (see
Section 3.10 page 239) and as part of personnel induction training, the objectives
of the manual shall be explained to them by the Stingray Quality Manager.
1.5.1 Overall responsibility
The responsibility of ensuring that Stingray has a quality policy and for ensur-
ing that an organisation with the necessary resources is in place to implement
the policy, lies with the Managing Director.
1.5.2 Responsibility for quality system
The Managing Director has appointed the Quality Manager to have overall
responsibility for implementing and maintaining the Stingray quality system.
As Quality Manager he has the responsibility and the authority to ensure that
adequate processes, procedures, plans and instructions are drawn up so as to
provide a common approach to quality assurance throughout Stingray and 
to ensure that the quality system is continuously monitored and improved by
means of internal audits and management reviews.
1.5.3 Responsibility for contract quality
The responsibility for the development of contract quality rests with Stingray’s
Managing Director via the Company Managers.

Part One – Quality Manual
1.5.4 Responsibility for product quality
The responsibility for ensuring that the product conforms to the defined qual-
ity requirements in this manual lies with all Stingray personnel.
1.5.5 Responsibility for subcontractor(s) quality
Specialised areas of operation and technical expertise may be required to meet the
needs of Stingray. In many cases these shall have to be provided externally via a
subcontractor. These subcontractors will need to supply and prove that their QMS
is in accordance with the requirements of the principles of ISO 9001:2000.
1.6 Registrations and approvals held
Stingray is a Registered Organisation certified by an Accredited Certification
Body and verified as having quality documentation and effective practices in
operation which are in accordance with the requirements of the international
Quality System ISO 9001:2000.
2 Stingray’s Management System
2.1 Requirements
Stingray’s QMS is the organised structure of responsibilities, activities,
resources and events that together provide procedures and methods of imple-
mentation to ensure the capability of Stingray meets the quality requirements
of our customers.
Stingray has to develop, establish and implement a Quality Management
System in order to ensure that the overall objectives and policies stated in
Stingray’s Memorandum of Articles and Association are met.
To achieve these requirements, Stingray involves all phases of a quality loop
(see Figure 6.1.2) that is derived from the requirements of ISO 9001:2000 and
covers the initial identification of the requirement to the final satisfaction of
the customer’s needs and expectations.
Within Stingray an effective QMS ensures that all activities are fully under-
stood, controlled and documented and that everyone knows exactly what they
are supposed to be doing and how they should be doing it.
There are four main requirement sections making up the ISO 9001:2000 stand-
ard ranging from how to control a design process to how to audit an activity – but
the most important element is the first one which demands that everyone shall
be involved in quality in order for it to succeed and that it must be management
led and that there must be a commitment to quality – at the highest level.

Quality Management System
Part One – Quality Manual
Within Stingray we have this commitment. It stems from Stingray’s decisions
in this respect and manifests itself throughout Stingray’s management, at all
levels.
2.2 Organisational goals
The primary goal of Stingray shall, at all times, be the quality of the end prod-
uct and service. To succeed, Stingray must be able to offer products and ser-
vices that:

meet the need, use and purpose as defined in Stingray’s Memorandum and
Articles of Association;

satisfy the customer’s requirements and expectations;

comply with applicable international, European and national quality stand-
ards and specifications.
In order to meet these objectives, Stingray shall organise itself in such a way
that the technical, administrative and human factors affecting the quality of
Stingray products and services are always under control.
It is imperative that this control is orientated to the reduction, elimination
and – of paramount importance – the prevention of quality deficiencies. The
Stingray QMS, therefore, has to be developed and implemented for the pur-
pose of accomplishing the objectives set out in Stingray’s Memorandum and
Articles of Association.
Above all (and to achieve maximum effectiveness) it is essential that the
Stingray QMS is designed so that it is appropriate to the type of contract and
services being offered by Stingray.
Demonstration of the continued success of the QMS shall be achieved via
regular audits and reviews.
2.3 Purpose
The purpose of a QMS is to ensure that the end product (i.e. the deliverable)
conforms to the customer’s (i.e. user’s), contractual requirements.
Stingray’s QMS, therefore, involves all Stingray’s functions, wherever and
however instigated (e.g. Director level, Section Manager level, etc.) that directly,
or indirectly, affect Stingray deliverables and contracts.
In essence, Stingray’s QMS essentially consists of the documented rules, pro-
cedures and instructions prepared in accordance with ISO 9001:2000. These are
stated in the Quality Manual (QM) as well as the associated Core Business
Process (CP), Supporting Processes (SPs), Quality Procedures (QPs) and Work

Instructions (WIs). The Stingray audit team (consisting of the Managing
Director, Quality Manager and Company Secretary) plus Section Manager
may decide if additional documents are required for individual sections. In
these cases, the requirement for an additional document shall be clearly stated
and rules developed. This following section of the manual describes Stingray’s
quality policy for meeting the requirements of ISO 9001:2000.
3 Quality policy
3.1 Introduction
This section of the manual defines the Stingray quality policy and outlines the
main responsibilities for its implementation.
3.2 Quality Management System requirements
‘A Quality Management System (QMS) is the organised structure of responsi-
bilities, activities, resources and events that together provide procedures and
methods of implementation to ensure the capability of an organisation meets
the quality requirement of the client.’ (ISO 10011:2002).
Quality is an objective concept. It is something that the whole workforce can
understand and measure and for which they accept responsibility.
As an indicator, some of the determinants and measures of Stingray’s qual-
ity of a service are shown in Figure 6.1.3 below, whilst those appertaining to
the quality of a product are shown in Figure 6.1.4.
3.3 Company requirements
As described in the company policy statement, within Stingray we are totally
committed to setting and achieving quality standards that will enable the com-
pany to provide its customers with a high quality product and service.
To meet this commitment, Stingray shall develop and maintain a QMS that
meets the requirements and the recommendations of ISO 9001:2000.
Total Quality Management (TQM) shall be applied to every aspect of our
activity and quality shall be the responsibility of everyone, in every activity,
throughout Stingray.
To achieve these objectives, everyone’s involvement and commitment is
vital in adhering to the system adopted and in fully appreciating their quality
responsibilities. Everyone connected with Stingray shall be supported accord-
ing to their individual needs for personal development, training and facilities.

3.4 Company quality policy
Quality management within Stingray is based on the quality system described
in Section 4 of ISO 9001:2000. The purpose of the quality system is to define
the policy, organisation and responsibilities for the management of quality
within Stingray.
Quality management forms an integral part of our overall company manage-
ment and the role of quality management within our company is an essential
requirement. It provides confidence that application of company management
(as described within this Quality Manual) is efficient, comprehensive and
effective in ensuring that every stage of the product (or service) development is
delivered:

on time;

to the agreed product specifications;

within budget.
The main objective of Stingray’s QMS is to ensure that all activities, whether
they are managerial (e.g. organisation) or technical (e.g. specification work)
comply with the Quality Manual and it is incumbent on all staff to have a day-
to-day responsibility for ensuring conformance to the requirements and rules
as stated in this Quality Manual.

Quality Management System
Part One – Quality Manual
In cases of non-compliance (e.g. if part of the specified work is not carried
out in accordance with the product and/or service requirements) a problem
solving process shall be executed by the first responsible manager. This
process shall include the location of root causes, remedial action, review of
Stingray’s QMS and, if necessary, its adjustment and modification.
The Quality Manager plays an important part in this process. His role will be
to suggest alternative solutions and help the First Line Manager to take the necess-
ary remedial action. If no effective corrective action is taken, the Quality
Manager has the duty to inform the Managing Director.
Summarised, Stingray’s QMS shall ensure:

clear responsibilities for all activities and tasks;

confirmation that all activities are defined and controlled by a Quality
Procedure or Work Instruction;


staff are trained to the requirements listed in the Quality Manual and 
contract Quality Plans;

compliance with Stingray’s Quality Procedures detailed in the Quality
Manual and Contract Quality Plans are audited;

remedial action is taken whenever appropriate;

the Quality Processes, Quality Procedures, Work Instructions (contained in
the Quality Manual) and contract Quality Plans themselves are regularly
reviewed.
3.5 Adherence to standards
Stingray’s Quality Manual is based on the requirements of ISO 9001:2000 and
takes into consideration the requirements of all other applicable national,
European and international standards, procedures and directives. If there 
are any discrepancies between Stingray’s Quality Manual and these other 
directives/standards, the requirements of Stingray’s Quality Manual shall prevail.
3.6 Purpose of a Quality Management System
The purpose of having a QMS is to ensure that the end product or service con-
forms to the customer’s (i.e. user’s) contractual requirements. Stingray’s Quality
Management System, therefore, involves all Stingray functions, wherever and
however instigated that directly, or indirectly, affect deliverables and contracts.
Demonstration of the continued success of our Quality Management System
shall be achieved via regular audits and reviews (for details see QP/6 – Internal
Quality Audits).
3.7 Quality in performance
The system adopted by Stingray to achieve quality in performance with
accountability is based on the following four main items or activities:
1. Quality Manual – the Quality Manual (as the primary control document)
which defines the policy, processes, responsibilities, procedures, etc. that
are to be used;
2. Quality Manager – the appointment of a Quality Manager within a
defined organisational structure, who is responsible for operating the sys-
tem and ensuring that the Quality Manual and its associated documentation
is fully and effectively implemented;
3. Documented Processes and Procedures – the use of documented processes
and procedures to define all activities which could lead to variability of 

Document Ref: S-51-029RLT05
Version: 02.02
Date: 01.01.05
Quality Management System
Part One – Quality Manual
execution with consequent loss of quality attainment, performance or
safety if not rigorously controlled;
4. Quality Management System reviews – regular reviews of the Quality
Manual (and its supporting documentation) together with auditing its effect-
ive implementation to ensure that the most suitable and effective methods
and procedures are still prescribed and used.
3.8 Organisational goals
The primary goal of Stingray shall be, at all times, to ensure that the quality of
the product and/or service:

satisfies the customer’s requirements and expectations;

meets the need, use and purpose as defined in the approved product and/or
service specifications;

complies with the requirements of ISO 9001:2000;

complies with applicable international, European and national quality stan-
dards, specifications and directives.
In order to meet these objectives, Stingray has to be organised in such a way
that the technical, administrative and human factors affecting the quality of
Stingray products and services are always under control. It is imperative that
this control is orientated to the reduction, elimination and – very importantly –
the prevention of quality deficiencies.
A Stingray QMS, therefore, has to be developed and implemented for the
purpose of accomplishing the objectives set out above.
To achieve maximum effectiveness, it is essential that this QMS is designed 
so that it is appropriate to the type of contract and services being offered by
Stingray.
3.9 Structure for quality management
Stingray’s QMS defines the policy, organisation and responsibilities for the
management of quality within Stingray. It ensures that all activities comply
with an agreed set of rules, regulations and guidelines and that the end product
or service (i.e. the deliverable) conforms to the customer’s (i.e. the user’s) con-
tractual requirements. A QMS can only be effective if it is fully documented,
understood and followed by all.
Within the ISO 9001:2000 Quality Model, there are four levels of documen-
tation, and these are structured as shown in Figure 6.1.5.

Figure 6.1.5 Quality Management System
The Stingray QMS relies on the eight quality management principles con-
tained in ISO 9001:2000 to provide and enable a continual improvement of our
business and our overall efficiency and to make us capable of responding to
customer needs and expectations. These eight principles are:
1. Customer focused organisation – Stingray depends on our customers and
is committed to understanding, anticipating and responding to every 
customer requirement with product and service excellence.
2. Leadership – leaders establish unity of purpose and directions create the
environment in which people can become fully involved in achieving
Stingray’s objectives.
3. Involvement of people – Stingray have created an environment, which
makes every employee a team member and encourages participation in
achieving our goals.
4. Process approach – the desired result is achieved by relating resources and
activities to managed processes.

Document Ref: S-51-029RLT05
Version: 02.02
Date: 01.01.05
Quality Management System
Part One – Quality Manual
5. System approach to management – identifying, understanding and man-
aging a system of interrelated processes for a given objective contributes 
to the effectiveness and efficiency of Stingray.
6. Continual improvement – continual improvement is a permanent object-
ive of Stingray.
7. Factual approach to decision-making – effective decisions are based on
the logical and intuitive analysis of data and information.
8. Mutually beneficial supplier relationships – mutually beneficial rel-
ationships between Stingray and its suppliers enhance the ability of both
organisations to create value.

3.10 The Quality Manual
The Quality Manual is a statement of the managerial policy and the objectives
for each element of ISO 9001:2000. For Stingray this is included in Section 4
and, having been established in response to the specified system requirements,
it provides a statement of commitment to customers (or external approval
and/or regulatory bodies) to which Stingray may be required to provide such
information.
Stingray’s Quality Manual describes a number of systematic controls and
procedures for the staff in fulfilling their duties and responsibilities. It defines
the lines of traceability, accountability and responsibility and whilst it exists
primarily as an internal management control document, the Quality Manual
also provides a definitive statement of the policy, objectives, operating sys-
tems, processes and procedures established by Stingray. The system recognises
the established elements of modern formalised quality management as

expressed in national and international standards and as appropriate to the
nature of the work undertaken.
3.11 Quality Processes
Stingray’s QMS is founded on the requirements of ISO 9001:2000, with a com-
mon structure based on a Core Business Process (CP) (describing the end-
to-end activities involved in Stingray’s project management and the production
of contract deliverables) supplemented by a number of Supporting Processes
(SPs) which describe the infrastructure required to complete Stingray’s pro-
jects on time and within budget.
To ensure achievement of process objectives, a process owner with full
responsibility and authority for managing the process and achieving process
objectives is nominated.
From the initial identification of the task through to the final customer sat-
isfaction all steps in Stingray’s Core Business Process are supported by Quality
Procedures that ensure that all activities are fully understood, controlled and
documented and that everyone knows exactly what they are supposed to be
doing and how they should be doing it.
Current Stingray processes are listed in Part 2 of the QM.
3.12 Quality Procedures
Quality Procedures (QPs) form the bulk of Stingray’s QMS and describe how
the policy objectives of the Quality Manual can be met in practice and how
these processes are controlled. A list of the current Stingray Quality Procedures
is shown in Annex C to this Quality Manual.
QPs shall cover all the applicable elements of ISO 9001 and shall detail pro-
cedures that concern Stingray’s actual method of operation. They shall be used
for planning and controlling all activities that impact on quality.
Each QP shall cover an easily identifiable and separate part of the quality
system and shall be capable of being easily traced back to the policies dictated
by senior management.
QPs should not normally include technical requirements or specialist proced-
ures required for the manufacture of a product. This type of detail will gener-
ally be included in a Work Instruction.
The generation and control of QPs is defined in QP/2 – Production of a Quality
Document. In addition to a descriptive title and a file number, each procedure is
dated and is subject to regular review (during an internal audit) for possible
updating. These documented procedures are made available as uncontrolled

copies via a link on Stingray’s Intranet Home Page and can be used as separate
documents outside the Quality Manual in places of work.
A number of forms are used in the application of certain procedures, which
mainly relate to the communication of data or instructions for keeping records.
Copies of theses forms are included in the relevant procedures and Work
Instructions.
Some procedures may contain data or information, the knowledge of which
must remain restricted to Stingray. These procedures shall not be included in
the Quality Manual, beyond their title and reference number. If these proced-
ures are required for contractual purposes, the Managing Director must autho-
rise their release.
Current Stingray Quality Procedures are listed in Part 3 to the QMS.
Note: If a particular project requires additional quality controls for a specific
product or service then project specific QPs shall be written by the Quality
Manager (in conjunction with the department or section concerned) as part of
a separate project Quality Plan.
3.13 Work Instructions
Work Instructions (WIs) describe, in detail, how Stingray implements its pro-
cedures such as, what is to be done, who should do it, when it should be done,
what supplies, services and/or equipment are to be used and what criteria have
to be satisfied. They describe how to perform specific operations and are pro-
duced for all of the relevant activities of Stingray so as to ensure that the whole
company can work to the same format.
In order that Stingray Management can be sure that everything is being car-
ried out under the strictest of controlled conditions, it is crucial that all 
WIs referring to a product activity or service are clear, accurate and fully 
documented.
In summary a Work Instruction shall, as a minimum, define:

the manner of production (and installation) where the absence of such con-
trols would adversely affect quality;

measurable criteria for workmanship to ensure the required level of quality
is being adhered to;

monitoring and quality control requirements;

the approval processes by which compliance can be identified;

who can carry out this procedure.

Document Ref: S-51-029RLT05
Version: 02.02
Date: 01.01.05
Quality Management System
Part One – Quality Manual
The generation and control of WIs is defined in QP/2 – Production of a Quality
Document. In addition to a descriptive title and a file number, each instruction
is dated and is subject to regular review (during an internal audit) for possible
updating. These documented instructions are made available as uncontrolled
copies and can be used as separate documents outside the Quality Manual in
places of work (see QP-01 ‘Document Control’).
Current Stingray WIs are listed in Part 4 of the QMS.
Note: If a particular project demands further detail then project specific Work
Instructions shall be created. These project specific WIs shall appear in the
Quality Plan applicable to that particular project.

3.14 Records
Records provide objective evidence of and demonstrate conformance to spe-
cified requirements contained in the QMS. Normally records are retained for
five years – except as required by local or national law.
3.15 Project quality plans
For larger and more complex projects/contracts, project-specific Quality Plans
may have to be produced. These are effectively a subset of the QM and describe
additional procedures and controls that will have to be applied. The production
of these Quality Plans shall be co-ordinated between the Quality Manager and
Project/Contract Manager concerned.
4 Quality Management System 
(ISO 9001:2000 – 4)
Subsequent sections of this QM are modelled on ISO 9001:2000 and describe
the arrangements or systems that have been established to meet the specified
requirements of this standard. As far as possible, the following sections 
(i.e. 4–8) have been structured in a similar manner to those in ISO 9001:2000
(i.e. each section, sub-section, etc. directly corresponds in terms of number and
content with the ISO equivalent number). The correspondence between the
Quality Manual and the requirements of ISO 9001:2000 is shown at Annex B.
Conformance with ISO 9001:2000
Other than the permissible exclusions shown in the relevant parts of the text
and at Annex B, Stingray’s QMS conforms to the requirements specified in
ISO 9001:2000.
Quality Manual administration
The Quality Manager shall review the effectiveness and suitability of the
Quality Manual at least twice a year. Where the system is found to be ineffect-
ive as a result of changed requirements, amendments shall be made to the QM.
Confidentiality
This QM is the intellectual property of Stingray and may not be copied in
whole or part, or transmitted to any third party without the express written per-
mission of the Quality Manager.

Quality Management System
Part Three – Quality Procedures
1 Documentation
Stingray Management Services Ltd (Stingray) has four levels of documentation
within our Quality Management System (QMS) which is structured as shown
in the table below. This document is Part 3 and describes the Quality
Procedures that have been designed to meet Stingray’s Quality Processes.
The Work Instructions associated with these Quality Procedures are detailed
in Part 4.

Part 4
Work Instructions

carried out.
2 Quality Procedures
Quality Procedures (QPs) form the bulk of Stingray’s QMS and describe how
the policy objectives of the Quality Manual (QM) can be met in practice and
how their processes are controlled.
QPs contain the basic documentation used for planning and controlling all
Stingray activities that impact on quality and each QP is unique and contains
details of procedures directly applicable to Stingray. By design, the QPs con-
form to the specific requirements contained in ISO 9001:2000 although (in
reality) they often cover more as they are an efficient method of controlling
every aspect of Stingray business.
These documented procedures can be made available and used in either hard
copy or electronic format and may be used as separate documents outside the
QM in places of work.

The approval procedure for all QPs is as follows:

The Quality Manager evaluates the requirement for a new QP, researches
all available information (e.g. existing work procedures, work practices,
standards etc.) and produces an ‘Initial Background Draft’. This is then
issued, for comment, to selected Stingray staff who are directly involved in
the procedure.

The Quality Manager evaluates all comments received; co-ordinates all the
necessary alterations, amendments, proposed modifications etc. and pro-
duces a draft to the Managing Director for comment.

Upon approval (or after modification) by the Managing Director, the QP is
then issued as official Stingray policy.

Part Three – Quality Procedures
QP/1 – Document Control
1.1 Scope
In conformance with the requirements of ISO 9001:2000, document control is
essential for the overall efficiency and quality of Stingray and its documents.
Stingray document control procedures shall apply to all documents that are
produced by and for the company, irrespective of where they originate.
QP/1 describes the document control procedures for Stingray. It details the
allocation of document codes and the procedures for distributing these docu-
ments. It describes the procedures for translating (if required) and for filing
(electronic and manual) these documents, how document changes are managed
and the type of word-processing software and other software to be used.
The Quality Manager (in consultation with the Company Secretary) is respon-
sible for the overall planning of document control procedures throughout Stingray.
A centralised filing system shall be retained in the main office.
Approval procedures for all Stingray documents are in section 5.24.
1.2 General
The term ‘document’ includes all Stingray documents, deliverables, letters,
faxes, copies of e-mails, reports, minutes and contracts etc.
1.3 Document administration number
All documents which are received, despatched or processed by the main office
shall receive a document administration number. A list of document adminis-
tration numbers used by individual Stingray consultants shall be maintained by
them. Personnel based at the Head Office shall share one book, which shall be
maintained by the Company Administrator. This is also the number by which
the document is stored in the company computer. The number reverts to ‘001’
at the beginning of each year.
All documents despatched by the Office shall be entered in the ‘MAIL
OUT’ letterbook, while all documents received shall be entered in the ‘MAIL
IN’ letterbook (for examples see Annex A).
1.4 File numbering system
All Stingray personnel shall make use of the company filing and numbering
system when originating Stingray documents, particularly where documents
are to be distributed externally.

1.6 Letters produced by Stingray
All letters produced by Stingray should be produced using the letter template
available from the server. The reference number shall be in the relevant space
on the first page and this number shall be repeated in the footer of every page,
to the right, regardless of whether the page is single or double-sided. The for-
mat of this reference number is the same as the example in 1.5:
S-53-029-RLT05
All letters shall also have a reference indicating the person/persons, who dealt
with the letter. This reference will consist of the initials of the involved persons
separated by slashes (…/…/…) and shall be placed underneath the document
reference number (on the front page only).
The first initials in the reference will be the person who initiated the letter.
The middle initials are optional and are intended to indicate the person who
actually wrote the letter. The last initials are the person who typed the letter.
Example: MD/QM/ANO, where:
MD
means that the Managing Director originated the document;

1.24.1 Introduction
To achieve conformity and inter co-operation, all Stingray documents (whether
these are managerial, quality related, financial or technical) require some form of
approval procedure. Stingray documents shall be presented in the form of an ‘offi-
cial’Stingray document, which will require the approval of the Managing Director.
The following Approval Procedure details the requirements for all, manage-
ment and contract-related documents within Stingray.

The list of person(s) required to approve a document before it achieves ‘pub-
lished’ status is a function of the area of the server in which the document is to
be stored. For example, the approval list for documents stored in the folder
‘Business Plans’ may contain the Managing Director, the Marketing Manager
and the Financial Manager. That for documents stored in the folder ‘Expense

QP/1 Annex C – Identification of changes to a
document
In addition to being ideal for controlling the quality of manufactured
goods, Quality Plans are equally suited to the delivery of processes
and/or services. The main requirement of a Quality Plan, however, is to
provide the customer (and the workforce) with clear, concise instruc-
tions. These instructions must be clearly adequately recorded and be
made available for examination by the customer. It They must leave no
room for error but equally they should be flexible and written in such 
a way that it is possible to modify its their content to reflect changing 
circumstances.

prepared using Microsoft Visio and may be supported (if required and to ease
understanding) by a small amount of text.
2.6.1 Flowchart
The flowchart should follow the sequence of events needed to enable the user
of the Work Instruction to fulfil the task. Details should include:

step-by-step instruction for carrying out the task;

how to deal with problems that may arise, particularly those that may affect
quality;


Quality Management System
Part Three – Quality Procedures
The author shall circulate (via e-mail) the draft quality document to the
Quality Manager and any other relevant members of staff for review.
When an e-mail is received by the member of staff it will show that there is
a document awaiting their comment and/or approval. They should then:

check out the document and review it;

enter into discussions via e-mail with other staff members;

send an e-mail to the author giving their views and/or approval.
Note: If it assists the reviewer, the draft document may be ‘marked up’ using
the MS Word Tracker facility and reference to this made in the replying e-mail.
Upon return of the reviewed document, the Quality Manager and/or author shall:

evaluate and assimilate the reviewers’ remarks;

resolve conflictions, by convening meetings if necessary.
Note: Final arbitration shall always rest with the Quality Manager and shall be
documented accordingly:

incorporate the comments into the revised document, dating affected page(s);

repeat the review process if it has been necessary to make major changes to
the document.
The Quality Manager shall then (with the assistance of the author – if
appointed) complete the review and publish the final document.
2.8 Issue authority
A quality document shall not be issued formally until the review procedure
described above has been satisfactorily completed.
Each quality document shall be issued in accordance with QP/1 – Document
Control.
2.9 Amendments to a draft document
Amendments to a draft quality document shall be controlled in accordance
with paragraph 2.7 above.

Document Ref: S-53-029RLT05
Version: 02.02
Date: 01.01.05
Quality Management System
Part Three – Quality Procedures
2.10 Amendments to approved documents
Amendments to an approved quality document may arise from:

an individual applying formally to the Quality Manager (with sufficient
information to support the case);

the results from an internal quality audit;

the results from a company biannual QMS review.
Each proposed amendment shall be considered in accordance with 2.7 above.
2.11 Cancellation
Cancellation of a quality document may be proposed by applying formally
(with sufficient background to support the case), to the Quality Manager.
Each proposal for cancellation shall be processed in accordance with QP/1 –
Document Control.
Cancellation of a quality document shall be approved and authorised in
accordance with QP/1 – Document Control.
2.12 Quality records
To ensure traceability and quality control, the Quality Manager shall retain
records of all quality documents (new, revised, amended or destroyed) in sep-
arate Quality Files.
2.13 Document quality procedure
As the production of a document will normally require considerable time and
effort, it is important that the documents themselves are of the required quality
and reflect this.
Whilst confirming that the technical and operational content of a document
is most important, it is also important to ensure that these documents are cor-
rectly formatted and their content and quality is acceptable. This can only be
achieved by monitoring and confirming each stage of the document’s production
process, from acceptance of a task to the actual distribution of the document.
The following flowchart and descriptive table shows the various points dur-
ing the production of a document that require formal approval. Formal
approval is indicated by e-sign off.
In producing and finalising Stingray documents, the procedures contained
in QP/1 – Document Control shall be observed, especially those concerning the
layout of documents.

QP/3 – Design Control
3.1 Scope
The primary function of Stingray is to:

provide advice and guidance on all quality matters;

produce either complete Quality Management Systems, Quality Manuals,
Quality Processes, Quality Procedures or Work Instructions (to suit indi-
vidual customer requirements);

provide qualified advice on environmental requirements (particularly for
the electronic industry) and expert advice in fuel conservation, manage-
ment and safety issues.
Although this is not a design activity in the true manufacturing sense, the prin-
ciples described in ISO 9001:2000 for design are, in general, also valid for
Stingray Quality Procedure No. 3 which details the requirements for design
control within Stingray.
3.2 Resourcing
The Managing Director shall assign system specification development respon-
sibilities to Section Managers. Section Managers, in their turn, are responsible
for ensuring completion of these tasks, for assigning the work to suitably trained
and experienced specialists and for overseeing and supervising their output.
3.3 Planning
The Quality Manager is responsible for ensuring that the planning of all inter-
faces between the different activities is appropriate and that verification points
are allocated and taken into account.
The Quality Manager shall approve the planning after each change and,
where necessary, liaise with the Managing Director to ensure that more
detailed plans are made in order that interfaces between the development activ-
ities are properly handled. The main objective is to see to it that the appropri-
ate information concerning the requirements and specifications already
developed and agreed on, is available to all parties – at any stage.
To facilitate this process, the Quality Manager shall use advance design
planning and decision techniques (e.g. such as ‘Teamwork’) to control this
requirement wherever appropriate.

Version: 02.02
Date: 01.01.05
Quality Management System
Part Three – Quality Procedures
To ensure overall task effectiveness, a time plan shall be maintained by the
Company Secretary, throughout each individual contract’s life and for all main
Stingray activities.
3.4 Input
The input data for each stage of a contract shall (in consultation with the
Quality Manager) be identified by the Section Manager, documented by the
Company Secretary and agreed with the Managing Director.
For each contract the same structure shall apply and the Quality Manager is
responsible for ensuring that this actually happens.
3.5 Output
All documents shall be presented in the form as described in QP/1 – Document
Control.
3.6 Verification
Verification of all Stingray documents shall be in accordance with (when avail-
able) the relevant project or contract-specific Quality Plan and shall be 
documented.
Note: The Quality Manager will advise the Managing Director on this subject
on an as required basis.
Verification that documents are of the required format, content and quality
shall be achieved via the procedures described in QP/1 – Document Control.
Approval shall be in accordance with QP/1 – Document Control.
3.7 Changes
All changes that could fundamentally influence the company scope, targets,
organisation, budget, overall work breakdown structure, work packages and
time plans shall be subject to the formal change control procedures described
in QP/7 – Change Control.

4.1 Scope
In accordance with the principles of ISO 9001:2000, biannual Stingray QMS
reviews are required in order to ensure that:

Stingray is effective in attaining its objectives as described in the QM;

the QM remains effective and suitable for the requirements of Stingray (in
other words that it ‘really works’ in practice);

the requirements and rules as described in the QM remain workable and are
in accordance (as far as possible) with the way Stingray personnel prefer to
work – without losing the assurance that Stingray delivers quality;

Stingray requirements are met and that the relevant rules are agreed on and
are adhered to.
QP/4 details the requirements for Quality Management System Reviews
within Stingray.
The Quality Manager is responsible for overseeing the operation of the
QMS; for ensuring that the QM is fully and effectively implemented and for
co-ordinating the writing as well as the availability of the necessary processes,
procedures and instructions.

QP/5 – Customer Feedback
5.1 Scope
The successful completion of any report or specification relies on the customer
commenting on the technical and operational contents of these reports and
specifications.
QP/5 has been designed to ensure that any customer feedback and com-
plaints raised against Stingray reports, documents or specifications are 
adequately reviewed, appropriate action is taken and trends analysed.
The Quality Manager (in consultation with the Company Secretary) is
responsible for maintaining quality records demonstrating conformance to the
requirements and the effective operation of the QMS.

Part Three – Quality Procedures
5.3 Initiation and assessment
All customer feedback including complaints received by the company office
shall (following registration) be directed to the appropriate Section Manager
for assessment.
Unless the issue raised by the customer is of a minor nature (e.g. a grammatical
or typographic error) or a request for information that can be dealt with directly,
the Section Manager shall initiate a Customer Feedback Form (see Annex A).
The Section Manager initiating a Customer Feedback Form shall ensure that:

there is sufficient detail in Part A for the problem to be self-explanatory;

customer details are included;

any related documents are attached.
The form shall then be signed, dated and forwarded for review.
5.4 Initial review
The review shall be made either by the initiating Section Manager or referred
to an internal section or QMS review meeting for discussion. The review pro-
cedure shall ascertain if the problem can be resolved locally and if so, to agree
the appropriate action required.
5.5 Local action
If it is agreed that action shall be taken locally, then the Section Manager is
responsible for ensuring that it is carried out and the results are detailed in Part
B of the Customer Feedback Form. In taking action, full consideration shall be
given to the root cause of the problem and how this may be resolved.
This form shall then be signed and dated, with copies being forwarded to the
Quality Manager.
If it is agreed that action shall not be taken locally, the original of the form
shall be forwarded to the Quality Manager. Local recommendations may be
made in Part B by the Section Manager if considered necessary and relevant.
5.6 Action taken by the Quality Manager
The Quality Manager shall review all forms received. Where action has been
taken locally, the Quality Manager shall check that the action taken:

is adequate;

has no implications for other sections;

has no implications on the Stingray QMS.

Quality Management System
Part Three – Quality Procedures
Where action has not been taken locally, the Quality Manager shall review
the problem and decide if it necessitates action through a change control pro-
cedure (as described in QP/7 – Change Control) or consideration by the
Managing Director.
The Quality Manager shall ensure that at all times the review considers the
root cause of the problem and how this may be resolved.
Upon completion of the appropriate action, the Quality Manager shall
ensure that Part B and Part C of the form are completed and that the original
(or copy) is returned to the Section Manager who initiated the form.
5.7 Analysing non-conformances
The Quality Manager shall regularly review all Customer Feedback Forms to
detect any trends that may have a detrimental effect on a project. When such a
trend is found, the Quality Manager shall raise a Corrective Action Report
(available from the Company Secretary) for review by the Managing Director.
5.8 Customer interface
The Quality Manager and/or Section Manager shall ensure that the customer,
having made an enquiry, is kept informed of progress. They shall also seek
comments from the customer on any action implemented.
5.9 Quality records
To ensure traceability and quality control, all records appertaining to customer
feedback (and/or complaints) shall be retained by the Quality Manager in a
separate quality file.

Part Three – Quality Procedures
QP/6 – Internal Audits
6.1 Scope
Although Quality Management System reviews are scheduled every six
months (see QP/4), other internal quality audits shall be completed at key
points throughout the company’s life cycle.
These quality audits are completed so as to ensure that all activities within
Stingray are carried out according to the requirements, rules and procedures pro-
vided in the QM and its associated Quality Processes, QPs, WIs and Quality Plans.
QP/6 details the requirements for internal quality audits within Stingray and
describes the differences between a sectional quality audit and other internal
quality audits.
6.2 Sectional quality audits
6.2.1 Frequency of audits
During each financial year, all sections shall be subject to at least three 
complete quality audits covering all relevant procedures. These audits shall be
initiated by the Quality Manager and shall be scheduled at key points in rela-
tion to the status and importance of the various activities of a section.
It is the Quality Manager’s responsibility to prepare (in consultation with the
Section Managers) an audit schedule for the Managing Director’s approval to
cover the next 12 months.
6.2.2 Audit preparation and organisation
All audits shall be carried out by an audit team consisting of the Managing
Director, Company Secretary and the Quality Manager (who will normally
perform the function of lead auditor – but this need not always be the case).
The Quality Manager shall decide on the minimum number of attendees for
convening that meeting and whether it is necessary to invite additional mem-
bers and if so, who shall be involved. The exact number of attendees may vary
according to circumstances applicable at that time.
In addition to agenda items, the audit team shall review, for adequacy, 
the Section’s Quality Plan together with its associated procedures. They shall
resolve all concerns where the Section Quality Plan or the section’s organisa-
tion is inadequate or inappropriate to meet Stingray objectives as stated in 
the QM.

Quality Management System
Part Three – Quality Procedures
6.2.3 Agenda
The Quality Manager shall organise an agenda for each audit which shall include:

scope and objectives of the audit;

review of all actions raised at previous meetings and progresses at subse-
quent meetings;

minutes of and actions arising from the last meeting.
6.2.4 Actions
If the results of the audit are such that corrective action or actions are neces-
sary, the audit team shall:

consider solutions and agree on the corrective action(s);

agree on responsibility for the implementation;

agree on a timescale for the implementation and review of corrective
action(s) to be taken.
The review and the agreed corrective actions shall be recorded in the company
quality file and a copy shall be retained by the section concerned.
6.2.5 Meeting records
The Quality Manager is responsible for ensuring that minutes of the meeting
are prepared and distributed promptly.
The minutes shall clearly state the:

actions agreed on;

person responsible for implementing these actions (i.e. the Action List);

agreed completion date (i.e. the time plan).
The minutes of the meeting shall be kept in the Stingray quality file, by the
Quality Manager, with a copy being circulated to all members of the audit team
plus the section concerned.
6.3 Internal quality audits
Internal quality audits are initiated by the Quality Manager and shall be sched-
uled in relation to the status and importance of the various activities.
When deemed necessary, an internal quality audit may be completed by
invited personnel (independent of the activity being audited), such as invited
specialists from other ISO 9001:2000 certified companies.
The audits and all agreed corrective actions shall be recorded and these records
shall be maintained in the company quality file by the Quality Manager.

Part Three – Quality Procedures
6.3.1 Frequency of audit and audit schedule
Internal quality audits are either scheduled by the Quality Manager or com-
pleted at the request of a company officer (e.g. Managing Director, Company
Secretary, Section Manager etc.).
The Quality Manager shall organise an agenda for each audit which shall
include:

scope and objectives of the audit;

persons having direct responsibilities for the procedure(s) to be audited;

reference documents;

name of lead auditor and name(s) of assigned auditor(s);



audit report distribution.
6.3.2 Audit preparation and organisation
Depending on the complexity and the size of the audit, the Quality Manager may
perform the audit himself, or he can assign a lead auditor and a team of auditors.
Note: This may be required when sections are too large, or when activities
from other sections are integrated or are co-operating.
The lead auditor and the assigned auditor(s):

shall examine all earlier audit reports on the same subject;

shall prepare an audit check list (containing all of the topics/items to be
covered and an audit programme).
The lead auditor shall report to the Quality Manager.
6.3.3 Audit execution
All audits shall be completed in accordance with the recommendations of ISO
10011.
An initial meeting between the auditor(s), the auditee(s) and the Quality
Manager shall be held. During this meeting:

a brief summary of the methods and procedures being used to conduct the
audit shall be provided;

the method of communication between auditor(s) and auditee(s) shall be
agreed;

the audit programme shall be confirmed.
The auditor(s) shall collect evidence via interviews, examination of documents
and observation of activities. If possible information provided at interviews
shall be checked for accuracy by acquiring the same information through 
independent sources.

observations of non-conformity shall be acknowledged by the manager (e.g.
Section Manager) responsible for the activity being audited.
A closing meeting of auditor(s), auditee(s) and Quality Manager shall be
held during which:

audit observations are clarified;

the critical significance of observations are presented;

conclusions drawn about compliance are presented;

system effectiveness in achieving the quality objectives are presented;


Part Three – Quality Procedures
QP/7 – Change Control
7.1 Scope
When a contract document reaches the stage where the information that it con-
tains is being used (or relied on) by other sections, it is imperative that any 
proposed changes to the original document are not completed without the
knowledge of all concerned.
In order to prevent this sort of situation occurring, a decision will be made (by
the Managing Director, endorsed by the Section Managers) that at a particular
stage no further changes, alterations, modifications, insertions or deletions will
be made without the Change Control procedure described below being adopted.
QP/7 details the requirements for Change Control within Stingray and is a
requirement.
7.2 Procedure
All changes to Stingray documents, procedures and specifications are, in prin-
ciple, subject to a formal Change Control procedure.
Changes that could fundamentally influence the scope, targets, organisation,
budget, overall work breakdown structure and time schedules (in addition to
changes to approved Stingray documents and other official documents), will
have to be agreed by the Section Managers and approved by the Managing
Director.
Proposals for changes shall be submitted to the Managing Director, in writ-
ing, using the Change Proposal Form shown at Annex A (the template for this
form is available from the server).
The Managing Director will ask the Company Secretary to distribute the
proposals for changes to all Section Managers for discussion. The proposal for
change will have to be distributed and received by all Section Managers at least
four weeks prior to the next Section Managers’ meeting.
Depending on the importance and impact of the proposed change(s) the
Managing Director can decide to discuss the proposal in a scheduled Section
Managers’ meeting or call a special meeting.
A description of the types of impact and relevant approvals are listed in
Table 6.3.3.
7.3 Impact assessment
Depending on the classification of the proposed change, an ‘impact assess-
ment’ may be required. The change classification (and, therefore, the need for

Document Ref: S-53-029RLT05
Version: 02.02
Date: 01.01.05
Quality Management System
Part Three – Quality Procedures
an impact assessment) will ultimately have to be sanctioned by the Managing
Director. If the time, resources and budget required for an impact assessment are
expected to be significant, formal approval by the Managing Director for carry-
ing out this assessment is required. An example of an Impact Assessment Form is
included at Annex B (the template for this form is available from the server).
When the Section Managers have agreed to the proposed change it will be
submitted to the Managing Director for final approval.
The Managing Director shall be responsible for implementing approved
changes and shall make sure that all aspects which are affected by these
changes are taken into consideration.
The Company Secretary shall be responsible for:

incorporating the approved changes into existing technical documents;

distributing these documents to the appropriate people;

incorporating the approved changes into existing non-technical documents.

QP/8 – Meetings and Reports
8.1 Scope
QP/8 describes how Management Review Board and Section Manager meetings
are convened, the proposed agenda and how minutes should be produced. QP/8
also lays down the guidelines for the reporting procedure adopted by Stingray.
8.2 Meetings
8.2.1 Management Review Board meetings
Management Review Board meetings shall normally take place twice a year in
order to discuss important issues and to approve final documents. The
Managing Director may convene additional meetings if required.
8.2.2 Section Managers’ meetings
The Managing Director shall hold regular Section Manager meetings to dis-
cuss the methods and program to be adopted for the results, reports or other
documents that have to be published. The preparation and detailed editing of
reports and technical documents shall be carried out by section working groups
or by small editing groups set up for that purpose.
Normally subcontractors and/or consultants shall only attend these meetings
when their presence is deemed necessary by the Managing Director.
8.3 Discussion documents
The dates set for these meetings should allow sufficient time for the documents
being discussed to be distributed far enough in advance of the meeting so as to
enable members to consider them beforehand. In practice this means not later
than two weeks prior to the meeting.
8.4 Agenda of meetings
In addition to those items covering technical aspects/problems, the agenda
shall be established by the Company Secretary and the Section Managers (in
agreement with the Managing Director) and shall contain the following points:

approval of the minutes of the previous meeting;

matters arising from the minutes of the last meeting;

status report (verbal or written);

budget and costs;

date by which the work is to be completed;

Document Ref: S-53-029RLT05

Quality Management System
Part Three – Quality Procedures

decision list and action list;

place and date of the next meeting.
8.5 Guidelines for meetings
It is to be expected that a frank and objective atmosphere should prevail at all
Stingray Management Review Board and Section Manager meetings, as well
as with a mutual willingness to overcome problems so as to arrive, whenever
possible, at a valid agreed solution.
The chair of the meeting shall direct the discussions towards a rapid solution
of the problem raised without, however, sacrificing the liberty to exchange
views, experience and ideas amongst the participants.
8.6 Minutes
The minutes of the Management Review Board and Section Managers’meetings
shall be concise and only contain the essential points, the conclusions of the dis-
cussions and distribution of tasks between the members (i.e. the Action List).
The minutes shall, special cases excepted, normally only be sent to the
Managing Director, the participants of the meeting and the Quality Manager. The
minutes shall always be distributed within two weeks following the actual meeting.
8.7 Reporting
8.7.1 Company Status Report
Every six months a Company Status Report shall be written by the Quality
Manager. This report will then be presented at the next Management Review Board
meeting.
Following approval by the Managing Director, the Company Status Report
will then be distributed to the members of the Management Review Board.
These reports will contain an update of:

overall progress;

technical status;

contractual status;

financial status;

liaison with the railways;

liaison with industry;

outstanding actions.

QP/9 – Training
9.1 Scope
In conformance with ISO 9001:2000, one of the requirements of a QMS is to
ensure that all Stingray personnel are provided with training that will assist
them in acquiring the skills and knowledge to perform effectively and to com-
ply with Stingray Quality and Safety Management Systems.
QP/9 details the requirements for training within Stingray.
9.2 Responsibilities
Section Managers are responsible for ensuring that project tasks and activities
are only assigned to staff qualified for that particular task or activity. This is on
the basis of appropriate education, training and experience, in relation to
staffing levels and Stingray’s current recruitment policy.
Top management identifies the need for staff training to handle the expected
workload where special techniques or items of equipment are involved.
The Managing Director is responsible for ensuring that appropriate training
is carried out so as to ensure that all staff involved are aware of the require-
ments, rules and procedures to which they are to conform and against which
they will be audited.
The Managing Director is also responsible for ensuring that tasks and activ-
ities are only assigned to staff qualified for that particular task or activity and
that this is on the basis of appropriate education, training and experience.
9.3 Identification of training needs
A training review may be carried out at any time, as necessitated by any of the
following:

appointment of new personnel;

new equipment or working practices;

change of duties or responsibilities;

as a result of an audit or management review.
9.4 Training review
The Section Manager or manager undertaking the review shall, with the 
post-holder:

review training completed since the previous review;

review and reschedule, where necessary, uncompleted training since the
previous review;

review the training needs of individual positions;

Document Ref: S-53-029RLT05


review and identify current training requirements and ensure that the qual-
ity and safety requirements are fully covered;

review and identify career development (where appropriate);

ensure that the results of the review are recorded on the appropriate forms
and forwarded to the Quality Manager.
9.5 Planning of training requirements
The Managing Director (with the assistance of the Company Secretary and the
Quality Manager) shall budget and plan the training programme for all person-
nel under his responsibility. This shall also include any on-the-job training
requirements.
9.6 Implementation of training requirements
The manager (e.g. Section Manager) responsible for planning training require-
ments may either arrange training locally or subcontract formal external
courses via the Company Secretary.
9.7 Training of new personnel
The Company Secretary shall ensure that all new personnel receive a local
introduction briefing as detailed in the appropriate administration procedure
(being prepared).
9.8 Training of subcontractors and consultants
The manager (e.g. Section Manager) employing subcontractors or consultants
is responsible for either ensuring that they are already fully competent or that
they can be trained to meet the contracted specification. The manager is also
responsible for ensuring that all contracted personnel are made aware and
understand the local arrangements for both quality and safety.
9.9 Quality training
The Quality Manager is responsible for providing Stingray QMS induction and
refresher training courses.
9.10 Training courses and records
If external training is required then it shall only be obtained from established
and recognised courses for which documented course content is available.
The appropriate Senior Manager shall retain records of all training. This
shall include details of attendance, achievements, course content, scope, per-
sonnel who provided the training and those who received it.

10.3 Financial management
10.3.1 Delegation of financial authority
The Managing Director each year approves the Stingray budget and delegates
part of his authority to the Company Secretary.
The table in Annex A shows the delegation of authority for signing contracts
and initiating orders, accepting deliveries (i.e. approving invoices), authorising
payments and signing bank transfers. The amount each person is authorised to
sign for is also indicated in this table.
Contracts, material orders or services may only be signed, or ordered, by the
persons for whom an amount is listed in the columns ‘Initiate orders and accept
deliveries’ or ‘Sign contracts’. In cases where the Managing Director has to
sign, the Section Manager is required to co-sign first.
Deliveries and invoices may only be accepted and approved by the persons
for whom an amount is listed in the column ‘Initiate orders and accept deliv-
eries’. In cases where the Managing Director has to sign, the Section Manager
is required to co-sign first.
In some circumstances a staff member’s signature might be required prior to
the Section Manager’s signature.
Authorising payment and signing the bank transfers for invoices shall be
limited to the persons for whom an amount is listed in the column ‘Sign bank-
transfers and approve invoices’. This action can only be completed after the
delivery has been accepted.
10.3.2 Stingray budget forecast
The Stingray budget forecast shall consist of detailed financial budget plan-
ning for each contract and activity. The budget forecast shall include the fol-
lowing information:

description;

account;

approved budget for each individual year and grand total;

committed cost for each individual year and grand total;

paid cost up to and including the cut-off date;

result (i.e. difference between committed total and approved budget total);

forecasted cost for succeeding years.
The budget forecast shall provide full details of all expenditures related to each
contract and activity.
From the Stingray budget forecast it shall be possible to extract the financial
information for any particular year. The Company Secretary is responsible for
this activity and shall provide details to the Managing Director.

2. Procedure
The approval procedure for all WIs is as follows:

The Quality Manager evaluates the requirement for a new WI, researches all
available information (e.g. existing work procedures, work practices, stan-
dards etc.) and produces an ‘Initial Background Draft’. This is then issued, for
comment, to selected Stingray staff whom are directly involved in the WI.

The Quality Manager evaluates all comments received, co-ordinates all the
necessary alterations, amendments, proposed modifications etc. and pro-
duces a Draft to the Managing Director for comment.

Upon approval (or after modification) by the Managing Director, the WI is
then issued as official Stingray policy.

WI/2 – Time sheets and Expense sheets
2.1 Scope and objectives
To enable Section Managers to properly account for the hours spent by
Stingray staff (including Management), it is necessary for this information to
be freely available to them.
WI/2 describes the procedure for keeping track of all man-hours spent and
shall be used by all Stingray staff.
2.2 Time and expense sheets
The purpose of the time and expense sheets (see Annexes A and B) is to indi-
cate the actual time spent on company and contract work as well as recording
the actual travel cost (i.e. transport charges, meals, hotel and other authorised
expenditure), incurred in connection with company and contract work.
During the agreement/contract period subcontractors and consultants shall
(having first obtained the signature of the Section Manager concerned) send their
time and expense sheets to the Company Secretary on the last day of each month.
The Company Secretary shall check the consistency of these reports before
submitting them to the Managing Director for approval.
Note: This WI should be read in conjunction with QP/10 – Budget and
Finance.
2.3 Time sheets
The time sheet shall contain the following information:

actual office hours (hours or days, depending on what is stated in the agree-
ment or contract);

travel time (for official Stingray business);

productive travel time (normally 50% of travel time).
The Company Secretary shall compare the time sheets with the budget and
adjust the forecast when required.
2.4 Expense sheets
Travel costs (i.e. transport charges, meals, hotel, telephone charges and other
authorised expenditure) may be charged to the company in accordance with the
agreement/contract.

Document Ref: S-54-029RLT05
Version: 02.02
Date: 01.01.05
Quality Management System
Part Four – Work Instructions
All costs shall be in the same currency as per the agreement/contract unless
otherwise stipulated and/or agreed.
The Company Secretary shall compare the expense sheets with the budget
and adjust the forecast when required.
The Company Secretary shall check and sign the expense sheets if he agrees
with the contents. The expense sheets will then require approval by the
Managing Director.
Personal expenditure incurred by a subcontractor/consultant is considered to
be the responsibility of the subcontractor’s/consultant’s parent organisation.
They are, therefore, responsible for reimbursing the subcontractor/consultant
directly.
2.5 Time and Expense Reports
On a monthly basis, Stingray staff shall consolidate the details contained in 
the Time and Expense sheets into a monthly Time and Expense Report (see
Annex C).

WI/4 – CD-ROM Distribution
4.1 Scope
Stingray is frequently requested to provide copies of contract deliverables to
clients, section team members and third parties. The simplest and most cost
effective way of distributing this information is via CD-ROM. WI/4 describes
this process.
4.2 Procedure
Section Managers and specified individuals are responsible for (and shall
decide on) the external distribution of all approved deliverables, working
papers, reports and documents outside the project. (Also see QP/1 – Document
Control.)
Section Managers (and specified individuals) shall determine:

the requirement (need) to distribute copies (or parts of) Stingray deliverables;

the manner in which Stingray deliverables may be distributed to clients,
project team members and third parties;

their availability and distribution.
4.2.1 Distribution list
The distribution of all Stingray CDs shall be completed by the Company
Secretary who shall maintain a distribution list, which will be updated every time
a new delivery is made. The list shall include details of the person to whom the
CD was distributed, its contents, the date of distribution and the selling price.
4.2.2 Updating previous distributions
Section Managers shall advise the Company Secretary every time a new ver-
sion of a CD is issued and the Company Secretary shall inform all persons hav-
ing received a previous version of that CD that a new version is available and
(on request) provide replacement (i.e. updated) copies of that CD.
4.2.3 Price guidelines
The price charged by Stingray for a CD shall depend on:

the type of contract;

the method of transmitting (i.e. sending) this information to the company;

Document Ref: S-54-029RLT05
Version: 02.02
Date: 01.01.05
Quality Management System


the type and amount of information contained on the CD;

the time spent preparing the CD.
4.2.4 CD type
All Stingray deliverables shall be distributed using electronic files formatted
onto a CD-ROM which is readable by any standard CD-ROM reader.
4.2.5 CD Labelling

Part Seven
Self-assessment
Assuming that by now you have your own organisation-specific Quality
Management System up and running, how do you monitor its 
effectiveness?
Part Seven covers the often-overlooked topic of self-assessment.
Methods for completing management reviews and quality audits (inter-
nal or via third party assessment) are discussed.
Also included are:

self-assessment checklists against the requirements of ISO 9001:2000;

examples of audit stage checklists;

annexes listing:
 the headings of ISO 9001:2000;
 the likely documentation that an organisation would need to meet
the requirements of ISO 9001:2000;
 a complete index to the ISO 9001:2000 standard.
Note: For a more comprehensive explanation about the concepts of
auditing may I suggest that you have a look at my associated publica-
tion ISO 9001:2000 Audit Procedures.
This book follows on from where ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses
leaves off and is a guide to assist auditors in completing internal, exter-
nal and third party audits of all existing and newly implemented ISO
9001:2000 Quality Management Systems, as well as organisational
(non-registered) QMSs. It also includes background notes for auditors
as well as lots of checklists and example audit forms etc.

Self-assessment
7.1 How ISO 9000 can be used to check an
organisation’s Quality Management System
Having set up your own Quality Management System (QMS), how can you
prove to a potential customer that it fully meets the recommendations, require-
ments and specifications of ISO 9001:2000? Indeed, how can you check a sub-
contractor’s or a supplier’s QMS?
If management have complied with the requirements for QMS standards as
they have been described so far, then they will be well on their way to running
a quality organisation. The requirements of QMS do not rest there, however.
The organisation must continually review their QMS as to its continuing suit-
ability and success, reveal defects, danger spots or irregularities, suggest 
possible improvements, eliminate wastage or loss, check the effectiveness of

effective and achieving the desired result. Above all an organisation must be pre-
pared to face up to an audit of their quality procedures from potential customers.
Note: Also see Annex 7C for ISO 9001:2000; requirements of management.
7.2 Internal audit
The purpose of an internal quality audit is to identify potential danger spots,
eliminate wastage and verify that corrective action has been successfully
achieved. The procedures with which to carry out these audits should always be
documented and available.

Figure 7.2 Internal audit

An audit plan determines whether the QMS is effectively achieving its stated
quality objectives and should be established as soon as possible. Indeed, it is a
requirement of ISO 9001:2000 that an assessment is regularly completed by
the organisation of all the production and manufacturing techniques that they
use together with the elements, aspects and components belonging to that
organisation’s QMS.
The type and content of an internal audit varies with the size of the organi-
sation. In some circumstances it can even mean going as far as having to
review the statistical control methods that are used to indicate or predict the
need for corrective action being carried out.
Another very important reason for carrying out an internal audit is obviously
that it provides a comparison between what the QMS or Quality Plan stipulates
should be done and what is actually being done.
The main aim, however, of an internal audit is to confirm that everything is OK.
This verification activity will, depending on the size and activities of the organ-
isation, include testing and monitoring the design, production, installation and
servicing processes, the design reviews and the method of auditing the QMS.
The audit should be capable of identifying such things as non-compliance
with previously issued instructions and deficiencies within the QMS. In addi-
tion the audit should recommend any corrective actions that can be achieved 
to improve the system.
It is essential that management shall take timely corrective action on all 
deficiencies found during the audit. Follow-up actions should include the veri-
fication and implementation of corrective action, and reporting of results.
7.2.1 Audit plan
To be effective, an ‘internal audit’ must be completed by trained personnel and
where possible by members of the quality control staff – provided, that is, that
they are not responsible for the quality of that particular product.
This does not, of course, stop the management from using an outside agency
(i.e. a third-party certification) if they wish to, and in so doing gain a com-
pletely unbiased view of the general success of their QMS.
The selection of the department to be audited should always be conducted on
a random basis and normally these internal audits will be completed every
three months or so. In an ideal world the audit should be pre-planned so that it
covers all aspects of quality control within one calendar year.
There are many reasons why an internal audit should be carried out, and pro-
vided they are completed by qualified personnel, they are usually successful.
The audit plan should:

cover all the specific areas and activities that are to be audited;

cover the reasons why an internal audit is being completed (e.g. organisa-
tional changes, reported deficiencies, survey or routine check);
Self-assessment 373


stipulate the minimum qualifications of the personnel who are to carry out
the audit;

describe how the audit report should be finalised and submitted.
7.2.2 Internal audit program
As shown in Figure 7.3 an internal audit program normally consists of 8 sepa-
rate (but interrelated) steps:

Step 1 – Audit schedule
Internal quality audits are usually planned and initiated by the Quality
Manager in relation to the status and importance of the various activities of a
section and/or deliverable. For large organisations, it would be quite normal for
all departments and sections to be subject to at least three complete quality
audits every year as shown in the example below.

Note: For smaller organisations (e.g. those only employing a handful of

sufficient.
Annual quality audit schedule
Step 2 – Audit preparation and organisation
Depending on the complexity and the size of the audit, the Quality Manager
may perform the audit himself, or (when sections are too large, or when activ-
ities from other sections are involved) he can assign a lead auditor and a team
of auditors to complete the task.
The Quality Manager (or lead auditor) is then responsible for organising an
agenda which will include the:

scope and objectives of the audit;

persons having direct responsibilities for the procedure(s) to be 
audited;

reference documents;

name of lead auditor and name(s) of assigned auditor(s);

date when audit is to be concluded.

Following a review of earlier audit reports on the same section or the same sub-
ject, the lead auditor and the assigned auditor(s) will prepare an audit check list
containing all of the topics/items to be covered together with an audit program
(see example below).

Step 3 – Audit execution
An initial meeting between the auditor(s), the auditee(s) and the Quality
Manager is held during which:

a brief summary of the methods and procedures that will be used to conduct
the audit is given;

the method of communication between auditor(s) and auditee(s) is 
agreed; and

the audit program confirmed.
In accordance with ISO 9001:2000 (Section 8.2.2) all organisations are required
to have a documented procedure for conducting internal quality audits.
Normally this procedure will distinguish between two kinds of internal quality
audits, namely a ‘standards audit’ and a ‘procedures audit’.

Audit program

Note: The standards audit evaluates how well the ISO standard is being
applied, while the procedures audit evaluates how effective the organisation’s
quality procedures, policies, plans, and instructions are.
Using the standards audit the auditor will begin collecting evidence of compli-
ance by interviewing auditee personnel, reading documents, reviewing manu-
als, checking records, examining data, observing activities and studying
working conditions. As the evidence is collected the auditor will answer each
audit question and record his observations as either:
Yes
means that this activity is in compliance with the 
standard;
No
means this activity is not in compliance;
Not applicable
means that this question is not applicable in this 
activity’s situation.
Once the auditor has completed the audit questionnaire, he makes a list of all
the non-conformities (i.e. the ‘No’s’) and summarises his evidence.
Similarly, using the procedures audit each applicable quality procedure, pol-
icy, plan and work instruction will be looked at from the point of view of Is it
documented? Is it being followed? Is it effective? On the basis of evidence col-
lected, the auditor will record his observation as:
Yes
means that this activity is in compliance;
No
means that this activity is not in compliance.
Auditors will record all their observations on the Audit observation sheet (see
example on facing page) and all non-compliances will then be listed on a 
‘non-compliance worksheet’ which will eventually form part of the final audit
report.
Step 4 – Summarise audit results
Auditors will then meet to discuss all of their observations (particularly any
non-compliances that they may have found) with the Quality Manager.
Note: All observations of non-conformity must be formally acknowledged by
the manager responsible for the activity being audited.
A closing meeting of auditor(s), auditee(s) and Quality Manager will then be
held during which:

audit observations will be clarified;

the critical significance of observations will be presented;

conclusions drawn about compliance will be presented;

system effectiveness in achieving the quality objectives will be presented;
378 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses


corrective actions will be agreed;

the date for completion of the audit report will be agreed.
Note: Minutes of all relevant meetings, decisions and agreements must be
attached to the audit report.
Step 5 – Prepare audit report
The lead auditor now needs to prepare an audit report using an Audit report
form similar to the one shown on p. 380.
The report must be signed by all members of the audit team, plus the Quality
Manager, and copies sent to auditee(s) and company management as required.

The audit report will list all non-conformities discovered, observations made

mendations that should be implemented in order to correct or prevent non-
conformities occurring and to make improvements.
Step 6 – Corrective action
After the closing meeting, the lead auditor will prepare a Corrective 
action request (similar to the example on p. 379) for each agreed corrective
action.
Note: Corrective action requests should always state who is responsible for
carrying out the corrective action and the timescale for its completion.

Step 7 – Take remedial action
The section/department that has been audited is then responsible for ensuring that
the agreed corrective actions are implemented and that any observations, com-
ments and recommendations made by the audit team have been taken into account.
Step 8 – Follow up
Finally, the lead auditor is then responsible for ensuring that corrective action
has been carried out and for notifying the Quality Manager of the status and/or
completion of corrective actions.
7.3 External audit
Although the supplier may have been able to convince the purchaser that their
QMS is effective, it is in the interests of the purchaser to conduct their own
evaluation (i.e. audit) of the supplier. This is usually done on an irregular basis.
The supplier must, of course, agree to the principle of purchaser evalua-
tions being carried out and it is usual to find this as a separate clause in the 
contract.
Normally these audits are pretty simple, but – particularly when the mate-
rial, product or service being purchased is complex – the purchaser will need
to have a reasonably objective method of evaluating and measuring the effi-
ciency of the quality control of the supplier’s promises and be certain that the
system established by the supplier complies with the laid down standards and
is, above all, effective. This method is known as the ‘supplier evaluation’.
7.3.1 Supplier evaluation
Part of the initial contract will stipulate that the supplier provides access to the
purchaser’s inspectors and sometimes even accommodation and facilities to
enable the purchaser’s representatives to conduct their activities and evalua-
tions. These facilities depend upon the level of surveillance, but could require
the supplier to provide:

suitable office and administrative facilities;

adequate work space for product verification;

access to those areas where work is in progress or to those which affect the
work;

help in documenting, inspecting and releasing material and services;

the use of inspection and test devices and availability of personnel to 
operate them are necessary.
382 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses

7.3.1.1 Evaluation team
Two or more inspectors from the purchaser’s organisation will form the evalu-
ation team. These inspectors must be thoroughly skilled in the requirements of
quality assurance and are normally drawn from the purchaser’s own quality
control section.
7.3.1.2 Pre-evaluation meeting
Before the evaluation team visits the supplier’s premises they must first be
given the chance to:

meet the supplier’s staff to discuss the procedures being used;

identify the supplier’s divisions that will be tested;


decide which representatives of the organisation will be required to accom-
pany the evaluation team during their inspection;

agree dates and outline timetables, etc.
7.3.1.3 Study of the quality manual
The purchaser must then be given a copy of the supplier’s Quality Manual. The
Quality Manual will be inspected not only for its accuracy and clarity but also
its position compared to national and international standards and to see that it
conforms to the relevant sections of ISO 9001:2000.
When the manual has been thoroughly examined, the purchaser will then be
able to send a team of inspectors to the supplier’s premises to fully scrutinise
every aspect of the supplier’s design office, purchasing, storekeeping, manu-
facturing, assembly and test facilities to see that the work carried out complies
with the procedures (promises!) made in their Quality Manual.
7.3.1.4 The evaluation
Having completed the pre-evaluation, the purchaser is now able to visit the
supplier’s premises for a complete inspection.
During the actual evaluation, the department heads will first be required to
describe to the team exactly how their quality control system works. They will
have to provide examples of their quality control documentation and possibly
even be required to prove that certain divisions have the correct documentation
and that it is up to date. The department heads will then have to show how stock
is received, accounted for and withdrawn from stores, how the appropriate
drawings are issued, updated and eventually disposed of.
Note: Quite often the evaluation team will want to see the route cards and/or
‘travellers’ that accompany partially completed work.
The purchaser will, as part of their QMS audit, possibly carry out an evalu-
ation of the sampling procedures used by the supplier – to ascertain whether
they conform to those laid down in the Quality Plan for that particular product.
During their evaluation it is also possible for the purchaser’s team to ask for
a previously inspected batch to be rechecked so that they can see if a similar or
comparable result is obtained.
Other aspects of the manufacturer’s facilities that the inspectors might well
want to look at (particularly if the supplier is an organisation actually manufac-
turing a product) could include:

evidence that their test equipment and other instruments have been regu-
larly maintained and calibrated against a known source;

that rejected or unacceptable components and assemblies are clearly marked
and segregated to avoid any chance of their accidental inclusion with other
items that have already been accepted.
384 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses

At the end of this evaluation, a meeting will be arranged between the evalu-
ation team and the factory organisations to discuss their findings and to be sure
that there are not any misunderstandings, etc.
The eventual evaluation report will then be formally presented at a meeting
with the management. The result of this meeting could be one of the following:
7.3.1.4.1 Acceptable system control
This means that the evaluation has shown that the supplier has a satisfactory
QMS, there are no deficiencies and the supplier has been able to give an assur-
ance of quality. When this happens, there should be no reason why the pur-
chaser should feel it necessary to demand any radical changes to the supplier’s
system.
Note: But even though the supplier may have proved that they are up to a sat-
isfactory standard, the purchaser will still have the right to (and often does)
insist on making further inspections throughout the duration of the contract.
7.3.1.4.2 Weak system control
This covers the situation where the evaluation team find several significant
weaknesses in the supplier’s system.
If this happens, the supplier will have to take steps to overcome these fail-
ures and improve their QMS. Having done this, the supplier can then ask for
another evaluation to be carried out to confirm that their quality now meets the
required standards.
7.3.1.4.3 Unacceptable system control
This is the result of an evaluation team finding that the number of deficiencies –
or the lack of quality discipline at the supplier’s premises – mean that the supplier
Self-assessment 385
THE
EVALUATION

control
Acceptable
system control
Unacceptable
system control
Figure 7.5 The evaluation

will have to make radical changes to improve their overall QMS before they are
anything like acceptable to the potential purchaser.
When the supplier has completed the necessary changes, they will then require a
second evaluation to see that their improvements are satisfactory. Unfortunately
this could be as much as a year later, by which time the purchaser may well have
found an alternative source or decided that the initial organisation’s quality is
definitely not up to standard – and virtually blacklisted that particular supplier!
Having been inspected, it is important that the records of this inspection are
safely filed away in case they may be required to reinforce some point at a later
stage or to provide statistical data for the analysis of a supplier’s performance.
This is sometimes referred to as ‘vendor rating’.
In the UK, the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) publish comprehen-
sive lists of manufacturers and suppliers who have proved that their QMS fully
satisfies the requirements of ISO 9001:2000.
7.4 The surveillance or quality audit visit
Although an organisation may well have successfully passed an initial evalua-
tion of their facilities and the purchaser may well be satisfied that the supplier
is capable of providing an assurance of quality, it cannot be assumed that the
supplier will be able, or even capable of, retaining this status forever. Many
things can happen to change this situation such as staff moving through promo-
tion or natural wastage, changes in the product design that may or have been
necessary, or perhaps even a new man-management philosophy.
The purchaser needs, therefore, to be informed of any changes in the organ-
isation and personnel that might affect the overall quality of the product.

SURVEILLANCE AND
QUALITY SYSTEM AUDIT
Figure 7.6 The surveillance

It is quite possible that the purchaser might also want to make irregular sur-
veillance visits of the supplier’s premises to examine a particular aspect of their
QMS. These surveillance or audit visits by the purchaser will be run on exactly
the same lines as the supplier evaluation and are aimed at providing the pur-
chaser with a confidence in the supplier and an assurance that they are capable
of in fact still providing the purchaser with the quality of goods that they
require. The aim of these audit visits should be that all the important aspects of
the quality control system are checked, in rotation.
7.4.1 Multiple evaluations and audits
It is possible that some suppliers might well be providing the same product to
several different customers and it could just happen that all of these customers
ask to have an audit – at the same time! This obviously cannot be allowed to
happen as the manufacturer would forever have people visiting their premises
and disturbing, not only the labour force, but also the production line! Thankfully
there are quite a number of ways around this problem such as secondary audit
or third-party evaluation.
7.4.2 Secondary audit
If a purchaser indicates that they want to carry out an audit, the supplier can
offer to provide the details of another customer’s audit that has recently been
carried out at their premises. If this does not quite cover the problem area suf-
ficiently, then the supplier could offer to check in more detail the appropriate
points raised by the purchaser.
7.4.3 Third-party evaluation
As an alternative to the secondary audit, a third-party evaluation team (i.e. one
that is not directly involved in either the supply or purchase of the article) could
be employed to carry out an audit.
There are several firms that have been specifically set up to do this and these
are capable of determining if a supplier’s product, premises and management
are capable of meeting (and still meet) the laid down standards.
Probably the most famous of these (especially for British firms) is the
British Standards Institution. BSI regularly produce a certified list of all sup-
pliers whose products meet the requirements of ISO 9000. This list is also pub-
lished by the Department of Trade and Industry.
7.4.4 Conformity assessment
In these days of international markets and cross-border trading, many national
regulations require that a product or deliverable is first tested for compliance
Self-assessment 387

with an internationally agreed specification for safety, environmental and/or
quality conformance before they can be released to the market.
This sort of testing is referred to as ‘conformity assessment’ and in its sim-
plest form means that a product, material, service, system (or in some cases)
people has been measured against the specifications of a relevant standard –
which, in most cases, will be an internationally agreed standard.
Although some conformity assessment can be completed using internal facil-
ities, when a product has health and/or environmental implications, national 
legislation will probably stipulate that testing is carried out by an independent
Registrar, Notified Body or specialist organisation; in other words, by a third party.
There exist many testing laboratories and certification bodies which offer
independent conformity assessment services performed either as a commercial
venture, or under mandate to their national government.
Note: For details of availability in your area try the DTI website www.dti.gov.uk
or perhaps one of the search engines (e.g. www.google.com).
7.5 ISO 9001:2000 checklist
Self-assessment can be a very useful tool to identify possible areas for improving
an organisation’s capability and ISO 9004:2000 helps organisations by providing
an annex containing ‘guidelines for self-assessment’. As this is an important
consideration I have included a number of annexes to this chapter specifically
aimed at helping small businesses complete a self-assessment of their QMS and
cost-effectively work in conformance with the requirements of ISO 9001:2000.
These consist of:
7.5.1 ISO 9001:2000 headings
A complete list of the sections and sub-sections making up ISO 9001:2000
requirements (Appendix A).
7.5.2 ISO 9001:2000 explanations and likely documentation
A brief explanation of the specific requirements (i.e. the ‘shalls’) of each elem-
ent of ISO 9001:2000 together with a description of the likely documentation
that an organisation would need to have in place to meet the requirements, as
well as an outline of this content (Appendix B).
7.5.3 ISO 9001:2000 requirements of management
Another list of the sections and sub-sections that make up ISO 9001:2000, but
this time identifying the areas that management need to address when they
document their Quality Management System (Annex 7C).
388 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses

Note: Most independent Registrars and Notified Bodies will use a similar
‘check sheet’ to determine whether an organisation’s QMS complies with the
requirements of ISO 9001:2000.
7.5.4 Example of an external auditor’s checklist
A list of the most important questions an external Quality Auditor (e.g. BSI,
TÜV, Yardely, etc.) would be likely to ask when completing an external or con-
formity audit. If an organisation can honestly answer ‘yes’ to all these ques-
tions then they would be quite entitled to say that they ‘fully comply with the
requirements of ISO 9001:2000’ (Appendix D).
Note: Parts of these checklists could also be used when conducting internal
quality audits.
7.5.5 Example stage audit checklist
Lists of the most important questions that an external Quality Auditor (e.g.
purchaser) is likely to ask when evaluating an organisation for the:

design stage;

manufacturing stage;

acceptance stage;

in-service stage.
(Appendix E).
Note: These checklists could again be used for internal audits.

Annex A
Documentation
requirements
In addition to providing a simplified set of standards that are equally applicable
to small as well as medium and/or large organisations, the main objectives
behind the 2000 revision of the ISO 9000 series of standards were that:

they would be much less prescriptive than the 1994 version of the standard;

organisations would be allowed more flexibility in the way it chose to 
document its management system;

the amount of detailed documentation that was required by the standard
would be limited;

the amount of documentation required by individual organisations would
be significantly reduced – provided that it was still capable of demonstrat-
ing the effective planning, operation and control of their processes as well
as the implementation (and continual improvement) of its QMS;

the type and extent of the documentation would depend on the nature of the
organisation’s products and processes.
Note: It has to be stressed that whilst ISO 9001 requires a ‘Documented qual-
ity management system’, it does not require a ‘system of documents’!
To achieve these aims, organisations will need to document – either electronically
or on paper – their quality policy, objectives, procedures, planning and operations.
They will need to describe how they control quality in these areas and will also
need to retain quality records to prove that these procedures have been followed
(i.e. inventory control listings, travellers, work orders, signed contracts, etc.).
There are no specific requirements on the actual type or form documenta-
tion. It can differ from one organisation to another depending on size, type of
activities, or complexity of processes.
A.1
The requirement
ISO 9001:2000 clause 4.1 General requirements requires an organisation to
‘establish, document, implement, and maintain a quality management system
Annex A
Documentation requirements 

454 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses
and continually improve its effectiveness in accordance with the requirements
of this International Standard’.
The standard then goes on to explain that the QMS documentation shall
include:

documented statements of a quality policy and quality objectives;

a quality manual;

documented procedures required by this International Standard;

documents needed by the organisation to ensure the effective planning,
operation and control of its processes; and

records required by this International Standard;
and that these documents may be in any form or type of medium such as:

paper;

magnetic;

electronic or optical computer disk;

photograph;

master sample.
Note: For additional advice on documentation see ISO/TR 10013 Guidelines
for quality management systems documentation.
A.1.1 Documented statements regarding quality policy and
quality objectives
These will normally be included in the Quality Manual (see A.1.2 below).
A.1.2 Quality Manual
Clause 4.2.2 of ISO 9001:2000 specifies the minimum content for a quality
manual. The format and structure of the manual, however, will vary between
organisations depending on the organisation’s size, culture and complexity. For
example, a small organisation may find it appropriate to include the descrip-
tion of its entire QMS within a single manual, including all the documented
procedures required by the standard. On the other hand, large, multi-national
organisations may need several manuals at the global, national and/or regional
level together with a more complex hierarchy of documentation. Alternatively,
some organisations may choose to use the quality manual for other purposes
besides that of simply documenting the QMS.
Note: The Quality Manual is a document that has to be controlled in accor-
dance with the requirements of clause 4.2.3.
Annex A
Documentation requirements 

Self-assessment 455
A.1.3 Documented procedures required by ISO 9001:2000
ISO 9001:2000 specifically requires the organisation to have ‘documented
procedures’ for the following six activities:

Control of documents (4.2.3);

Control of quality records (4.2.4);

Internal audits (8.2.2);

Control of non-conforming products (8.3);

Corrective actions (8.5.2);

Preventative actions (8.5.3).
Note: The term ‘documented procedure’ means that the procedure has to be
established, documented, implemented and maintained.
By implication documented procedures should also be included for :

Customer communications (7.2.3) – which states ‘The organisation shall
determine and implement effective arrangements for communication with
customers’ and;

Purchasing process (7.4.1) which states ‘Criteria for selection, evaluation
and re-evaluation shall be established’.
Procedures can take any suitable form. They can be a narrative, a flow chart, a
process map, or indeed any other suitable structure. As long as the procedure is
effective, it really doesn’t matter what it looks like.
Whilst some organisations may find it convenient to combine the procedure
for several activities into a single documented procedure (for example,
Corrective action and Preventive action), others may choose to document a
given activity by using more than one documented procedure (for example,
Internal audits). Both are acceptable.
Some organisations (particularly larger organisations, or those making use of
more complex processes) may also require additional documented procedures
(especially those relating to product realisation processes) in order to implement
an effective QMS. This will clearly vary depending on the size of the organisation,
the kind of activities in which it is involved and their complexity.
A.1.4 Documents required by the organisation to 
ensure the effective planning, operation and control of 
its processes
The two main objectives of an organisation’s documentation should be to pro-
vide communication of information (as a means of disseminating information
Annex A
Documentation requirements 

456 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses
about the aims, objectives and requirements for quality management) and evi-
dence of conformity (i.e. the availability of evidence that all planned activities
are being achieved in an efficient and effective manner).
Although the only documents specifically mentioned in ISO 9001:2000 are
for quality policy, quality objectives and the actual quality manual itself, there
are also several requirements in the standard where an organisation can demon-
strate conformity by preparing additional documentation such as:

process maps, process flow charts and/or process descriptions;

organisation charts;

specifications;

work and/or test instructions;

documents containing internal communications;

production schedules;

approved supplier lists;

test and inspection plans;

quality plans.
A.1.5
Records required by ISO 9001:2000
Records specifically required by ISO 9001:2000 are as follows:

8.5.3
Results of preventive action.
There is, of course, no restriction on an organisation developing other records
that may be needed to demonstrate conformity of their processes, products
and/or quality management system.
A.2 Control of documents
‘Proper control of documents’ is required by the standard which means that
you need to ensure that all your QMS documents have been correctly identi-
fied, reviewed, authorised, issued and distributed. You need to take care that old
(i.e. obsolete) documents are not being used and that they are stored in a secure
location if they are required for future reference. You also need to make sure
that any external documents that you use in your QMS are identified within
your system and that the access to these documents is controlled.
Annex A
Documentation requirements 

458 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses
A.3 Software programs for document control
With the acceptance of ISO 9001:2000 as the principal standard for integrated
management has come the requirement to see the business in process terms.
One method of achieving this is to use a process mapping software tool
which not only describes the organisation’s business processes (through a
series of multi-layer maps) but also provides direct access to existing docu-
mentation sitting below the process maps. This enables staff to have immediate
access (i.e. through an intranet desktop PC) to the relevant documents, rather
than having to cope with searching through a forest of printed documents. It
also ensures that only the latest issues of these documents are available to staff.
The benefits of using software to manage your documentation and processes
are numerous and is the reason why more organisations are now turning to an
IT solution whose advantages include:

ease of use

error reductions

cost savings on print, paper and distribution

improved functionality

space and environmental savings and

time no longer wasted on searching for hard copies.
Annex A
Documentation requirements 

Self-assessment 459
Annex B
Customer 
satisfaction
Customer satisfaction is not just a perception, it is also a question of degree
which can vary from high satisfaction to low satisfaction. If customers believe
that you have met their requirements, then they experience high satisfaction. If
they believe that you have not met their requirements, then they experience low
satisfaction.
B.1 The requirement
Section 8.2.1, ISO 9001:2000 requires an organisation to ‘monitor information
relating to customer perception as to whether the organisation has met cus-
tomer requirements’ and requires ‘the methods of obtaining and using this
information to be determined’.
As you can see, the emphasis here is on monitoring customer perception
(systematic checks on a periodic or continuous basis) rather than measuring
customer satisfaction during a one-off event. Whilst customers may accept a
product, they may not necessarily be entirely satisfied with either that particu-
lar product or the service they have received and, quite legitimately, believe
that you have not met their expectations. To overcome this possibility, you
should always strive to provide a service or product that exceeds the customer’s
stated requirements – provided that it can be kept within budget.
Satisfied customers are always good for business for not only will they
return but they will also recommend your organisation to other people. Getting
your customers to tell you what’s good about your products or services and
where there is room for improvement, helps you to ensure that your business
meets or exceeds their expectations. You obviously want your customers to be
happy with the products and services that you provide and if they feel they have
received good value for their money, then your business will prosper.
Market research can help you to track and monitor customer satisfac-
tion. But first you must consider which form of market research you want to
employ.
Annex B
Customer satisfaction

460 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses
B.2 Brief overview of market research
Within market research there are two main methodologies – Quantitative and
Qualitative.
Quantitative Research – is the gathering of data from a large sample group
to create statistically viable data. It is the basis for monitoring customer satis-
faction but needs to be completed systematically and regularly in order to moni-
tor and track changes effectively.
Qualitative Research – is an in-depth investigation of topics using a small
sample group. Although this will provide an indication of how the target mar-
ket is feeling and how they will react to a given topic, it cannot be relied upon
as statistically viable data.
Often both methodologies will be used in the monitoring and evaluation of
customer satisfaction. Each has its place, each will deliver important and use-
ful information but, in order to make best use of these research tools, you must
have a clear idea of what you want to achieve in the first place and then use the
most effective tool to deliver the results you want.
It must be remembered that customer satisfaction surveys will only give you a
status quo and an indication of what customers would like to see changed.
Unless you react and respond to these customer needs, things will never change.
Research can give you a quick way to see whether your changes are impacting
on them, positively or negatively.
B.3 Qualitative research
In general, qualitative research is used by researchers at the beginning of a sur-
vey to give a snapshot of the general trends that may come up when they com-
plete the main survey and which will help them to ensure that they ask the correct
questions in the main survey. Qualitative research may also help to establish
some possible solutions to customer issues which can then be tested in the main
survey and the results evaluated before radical changes are made in the way a
business is run, product produced or service undertaken.
Qualitative research can also be used in the middle stage of a research pro-
gramme to re-investigate general trends, explore whether things have changed
in the consumer’s mind and evaluate whether different questions should now be
asked. Finally it will often be used at the end of the programme to gain a clear
understanding of how customers are feeling and if anything changed for them.
Qualitative research can be divided up into a number of different methodolo-
gies, but the main methodologies that you will probably encounter are:

Focus Groups; and

Depth Interviews.
Annex B
Customer satisfaction

Self-assessment 461
B.3.1 Focus groups
Focus groups are effectively a brainstorming session. They are usually small
groups comprising 10 or less people who are tasked to examine a particular
product, service, policy or idea by ‘focussing’ on a comparatively short list of
issues and then thoroughly exploring every aspect of it.
Focus groups are especially good at generating ideas early in the product
development cycle, when it’s too expensive or too complex to develop multiple
prototypes. Whilst the conclusions of a focus group can sometimes be very
revealing, it should nevertheless be remembered that a focus group only repre-
sents a small sample of the population and should, therefore, not be relied upon
to be statistically robust.
Choice of membership of a focus group is unlimited. It can include all types
of professional, managerial, as well as a working level of expertise to encour-
age interactive thinking and enables all aspects of an issue or problem to be
investigated.
Generally speaking, however, certain people should not be asked to partici-
pate in the same focus group. These include managers and subordinates, direct
competitors, family members, experts and novices, and those who hold drasti-
cally different opinions from the other participants. Members won’t fully
engage with the rest of the group if they’re intimidated or unduly influenced by
some of its members. To ensure that the participants are able to interact con-
structively, it is often better to choose people with somewhat similar back-
grounds and/or demographics.
For most types of research it is also advisable to recruit people who do not
previously know each other. This will avoid the possibility of divisions within
the group and friends ganging up on others! Sounds crazy, but it happens!
Note: Sometimes strongly opposing views can be very useful in raising and
discussing challenging topics. However, caution should be taken if considering
a ‘conflict’focus group as the moderator of the group will have to be very expe-
rienced and capable of controlling and managing the situation, which could 
easily get out of hand.
In order to control and manage the focus group a moderator (often referred to
as the ‘facilitator’) is used to preside over the session. Their main task is to
ensure a free-flowing discussion that continues to move in the right direction
and to ensure that all pertinent details are recorded.
Moderation of focus groups is a tricky business and should be left to those
with experience – it certainly isn’t the same as chairing a meeting with col-
leagues or clients! It is, therefore, advisable to employ the services of a moder-
ator, either through a research agency or employ a freelance moderator to work
directly for you.
Annex B
Customer satisfaction

462 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses
To avoid anybody coming to the session with preconceived ideas or a closed
opinion on a topic, generally speaking participants will not be informed of the
topics to be discussed prior to the start of the focus group because if they have
already considered a topic, they could be quite fixed in their views. It has been
statistically proven that advance research can often influence a participant’s
thoughts and opinions during the group discussion which will inevitably result
in flawed information for the researchers. You want responses and thoughts to
be spontaneous and honest.
Typical topics and lines of questioning could include:

What do you like about this product/policy/idea?

What do you dislike?

How does it compare to other products/policies/ideas?

What would you change about it?
Focus groups are generally held in a relaxed setting, with a circle of seats, cof-
fee table in the middle, with refreshments available. All this will help to relax
the participants. Participants will become comfortable with the topic and with
each other and this will enable them to focus on the details.
Note: It is important not to let a focus group last more than two hours as par-
ticipating in a lively discussion can consume a considerable amount of energy.
In order to ensure that all the topics and areas that need to be covered are 
covered, the moderator will need to have some form of agenda to work to. This
is commonly known as a topic guide and it is just that, a guide. The topic guide
should not be seen as a strict guide to be followed, however. The discussions
may veer off and circle around but as long as all the topics are covered eventu-
ally, then that is fine.
Note: If the moderator was to stop the participants mid-flow and pull them
back to their agenda this could embarrass them and maybe stop them from
speaking out again.
In normal circumstances a moderator will not make any notes themselves as
this will only act to stop the free flow of the discussions, and can remind the
participants that the moderator is noting down everything they are saying.
Nevertheless, some form of record should be kept of the meeting and this can
be either a manual record or some form of electronic means. Nowadays focus
group’s discussions are almost always recorded using audio recorders and/or
video camera as they are particularly useful for recording the emotions, opin-
ions, interactions and ‘hot topics’ that the group uncovers.
In order to ensure that you achieve a good mix of your customer sample, a
number of different focus groups may be required and your customer base will

Self-assessment 463
need to be split accordingly. This could include doing focus groups separately
for men and women, old and young, regionally or nationally to ensure that no
biases exist, and if they do, you will discover them.
B.3.2 Depth interviews
Depth interviews follow the same pattern as focus groups (i.e. they are in a
relaxed setting, they use a topic guide, they are recorded etc.), but they are car-
ried out with smaller numbers of people. Generally a depth interview will be a
one to one discussion between a moderator and a selected individual and can
be used in cases where you either have a small number of very important cus-
tomers to interview, or where the topic is of a confidential or sensitive nature
and participants would not open up in a general conversation. In all other ways
depth interviews follow the same pattern as focus groups.
B.4 Types of quantitative survey
Quantitative (often known as ‘Quant’) surveys are probably the best way of
gathering vital information on customer satisfaction. There are many different
Quant methodologies that can be employed, but of these, the main ones are:

postal/e-mail;

telephone;

on street;

house to house; and

mystery shopping.
Some of these will be more appropriate to your market and customer base than
others; all have their advantages and disadvantages and below are the key pros
and cons to each methodology.
B.4.1 Postal and telephone surveys
Sometimes these two methodologies are referred to as ‘impersonal surveys’,
because by their nature they have less of the human touch to them. Postal sur-
veys are, however, recognised as being the most impersonal of them all, as you
are asking your customer to go through the questionnaire completely alone.
With a telephone you do at least have a member of your staff (or an agency
working on your behalf) interacting with the customer. The main benefits to
both of these methodologies are the relatively low cost per response.
Postal (and e-mail) surveys are cheap to produce, with only printing costs,
postage and reply postage to consider before you get to the point of analysis. 
Annex B
Customer satisfaction

464 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses
In addition a postal or e-mail survey can be an ideal way of communicating
with your customer base if you have a wide spread of customers across the UK
(Europe or the world) and where face-to-face work would not be cost effective.
In general terms, apart from the set up and form of delivery, most of the pros
and cons of a postal survey will hold true for an e-mail study too. An added
benefit, however, is that as you are conducting an electronic survey, you can
thank everyone who responded by only having to send one multi-addressed 
e-mail!
Note: Currently there are a wide number of specialist software packages and
specialist research companies who can assist in the setting up of an e-mail sur-
vey (for details try one of the search engines such as www.google.com or the
Market Research Society www.mrs.co.uk).
The main things to remember when compiling a  postal/e-mail survey is that
the questionnaire itself must be very user friendly and self explanatory and
mustn’t be too long or you will not get your customers to even consider answer-
ing the questions. In addition, as with all postal marketing activity, the response
rate to a postal survey could be very low indeed and in general times you should
only anticipate a 5–10% response rate to this type of survey. Some types of busi-
nesses may well get a better response than this, especially where businesses have
a very good and close relationship with their customers, or where their product
or service is of vital importance to them. In these cases, customers will want
to contribute, but if your product has low importance to a consumer, is a com-
modity or service that is seen as the norm, then you will probably get a very
apathetic response.
Postal surveys can and will take time to complete as they have to be posted
out (anticipating potential delays in delivery!), then you have to allow cus-
tomers time to complete and send back their survey forms (again allowing time
for the post) before any analysis can commence. E-mail surveys, on the other
hand, are increasingly being used as they have two distinct advantages over the
old traditional postal surveys, response time (i.e. e-mail surveys can be turned
around in days if not hours) and ease of completion. E-mail surveys are also
much easier to complete and less confusing than paper questionnaires which
often include advice (i.e. routing) such as ‘if answered YES go to Qxx’ and ‘if
answered NO go to Qx etc’. An electronic survey, on the other hand, will auto-
matically route the respondent in the correct way, ensuring that they answer
fully and correctly. More information on routing and single and multiple
response questions etc. are explored in Section B.5 Writing a questionnaire.
Another consideration with this type of survey is that they are, of course, self
selecting in nature. You have no control over who responds, thus you cannot
ensure that you achieve a good and representative sample of your customer
demographics. This sort of problem does not occur with telephone surveys.
Annex B
Customer satisfaction

Self-assessment 465
B.4.2 Telephone surveys
Telephone surveys are not dissimilar to the postal or e-mail route discussed
above. The main difference of course is that they are conducted over the 
phone by a member of your staff or a person employed by you to complete the
survey.
The three main advantages to this type of survey over postal are the speed of
response, accuracy of response and control of the sample profile.
By using a telephone methodology you can ensure that you get to the right
people at the appropriate time, but it is important that you target them in the
right place and at the right time. For most general customer surveys, this means
that calls should be made in the evening, in their home, when they are available
and where they will be in a (hopefully!) relaxed atmosphere and more respon-
sive. The opposite of course applies if you are contacting them about a business
related product or service, then you can get them at their office during working
hours.
Secondly, accuracy of response can be assured. By using trained staff to fill
in the survey with the customer you can ensure that all the right questions are
answered and explanations given are relevant – as far as possible that is, because
you will always get some people who will start a questionnaire and then get
bored and just hang up half way through! This is especially true if you are employ-
ing a research company who will no doubt use a computerised system of record-
ing the information called CATI (Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing)
which like e-mail ensures that all the correct questions are asked and answered.
Again the data is automatically captured and analysis can begin immediately,
in fact some analysis can be done ‘on the fly’ during the research to give you an
emerging picture.
Thirdly, and this is very important to ensure your data is statistically viable,
by controlling those who answer your survey you will ensure that you get the
correct cross sample of customers answering the questions. This will ensure
that the results you get give you the correct indicators and directions for your
business. This is explored further in Section B.6 Sample profile.
B.4.3 On-street or house-to-house surveys
On-street or house-to-house surveys (often referred to as ‘face-to-face’ sur-
veys) are to all intents and purposes, one and the same thing. It is just the loca-
tion that changes! The most appropriate methodology will depend on the type
of product or service you offer, who your customer is, how easy is it to find
these people on the street or in a specific location, town, road, estate, etc. In
addition, this kind of survey will be necessary if you need to show your cus-
tomers something.
Annex B
Customer satisfaction

466 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses
Whereas postal, e-mail and telephone surveys will be ideal if you have a 
customer base that is widely dispersed, on-street and house-to-house are more
relevant if you know your customers are easy to find and/or you can be in one
spot and get them as they pass you by. You will need to consider if this is the
case before you go for the on-street or house-to-house option, because if you
get it wrong and find yourself chasing for days to get one or two people to
answer your questions, then costs will soon mount up.
One of the main advantages of on-street and house-to-house surveys is 
that you can generally have a longer survey. This is more true of house-to-
house, when you can sit down and chat to the customer over (possibly!) a cup
of tea!
As previously described, quantitative studies are a way of discovering what
customers may want in the future. If you discover that they would like an add-
itional service, revised packaging etc., then a pictorial representation of this
(called a show card) will help the customer to understand what you are suggest-
ing and therefore help them to make a more informed decision on the possible
benefits of this (a picture is worth a thousand words!).
Being face-to-face with the customer may or may not be an advantage,
depending on your product or service and the relationship customers have with
it. Customers may want to tell you face-to-face, however some may be embar-
rassed to. Even if you employ a third party company to complete the research
for you, customers will often consider that they represent your company. Again
you should know your customer and be able to judge whether this will be an
advantage or a disadvantage.
The main disadvantage about on-street and house-to-house surveys is the
time and expense of carrying it out. Fieldworkers (i.e. the staff to carry out the
interviewing) need to be organised and their locations agreed. 
Note: If you are carrying out on-street interviews in shopping centres, high
streets etc., permission may need to be sought from the council or centre 
management.
Surveys need to be sent out to fieldworkers along with all their instructions,
show cards and so on. Fieldworkers then need to be given time to familiarise
themselves with the survey before they go out. Then the fieldwork (i.e. the sur-
vey itself) is then carried out, usually over the space of a few days to ensure that
a correct sample is obtained. After this, the surveys need to be posted back to
the research company before analysis can begin. Again some of the larger
research companies will have automated systems for collecting data which is
then downloaded, but these do come with a price tag attached – and let’s not 
forget the fieldworkers’ travel and subsistence expenses!
The following flow chart and accompanying table describe a typical proced-
ure for this process.

1
Select and assemble the survey team (use people who have 
a good telephone manner, are knowledgeable about the
organisation and its business and who are capable of
remaining neutral at all times), either from your own
organisation or by employing a specialist research company.
2
Collect customer contact data (i.e. name, address, 
telephone number).
3
Select a random sample of customers for the survey
(geographical as well as according to the size of the
customer’s business) using quotas – see section B6 Sample
profile.
4
Contact the customers (via e-mail is probably the cheapest
method) telling them about the forthcoming survey, the
reasons for the survey, why they have been selected and ask
for their support. This is a nice thing to do, but may not be
appropriate for all types of businesses and could in some
instances have a detrimental effect on the outcome of the
main survey, because you could put people off from doing the
survey in the first place.
5
Provide interviewer training for staff and volunteers. (Prior to
beginning the telephone interviews, team members should
review the role of the interviewer, explore interview scenarios,
review fall back statements and role-play an interview to
obtain a ‘feel’ for how the interview will work and review the
record keeping procedures for the survey.)
6
Contact the customers and complete a Customer satisfaction
survey for each person. (The interviewer should be as natural
as possible. Do not apologise for the call; it’s better to make
the person feel they are contributing to something important
rather than suggesting it is unimportant with an apology.)
7
Send the completed survey and call sheets to an evaluator for
analysis.
8
Summarise survey results and prepare a report.
9
Consider communicating the key findings of the survey in an
executive overview to your customers. This may not always be
necessary or indeed appropriate.
Finally
Review the process to see where improvements can be made
for future surveys.

Self-assessment 469
Note:A customer satisfaction index or ACSI (American Customer Satisfaction
Index) uses data obtained from customer interviews, to produce an independ-
ent measure of performance that is useful to economists, investors and poten-
tial customers. It is frequently used in North America, Sweden and Germany.
B.4.4 Mystery shopping
Although not strictly a tool to measure customer satisfaction, mystery shop-
ping is a revealing way to experience the reality first hand. Mystery shopping
is where someone impersonates a customer on behalf of the organisation, pay-
ing close attention to product or service quality. The undercover customer’s
findings are often very beneficial and frequently reveal patterns about the
effectiveness of the organisation’s processes.
The mystery shopper can be an employee of the organisation or someone hired
specifically for this sole purpose and should focus on the organisation’s system,
processes and procedures. The sort of areas that could be investigated include:

courtesy of personnel;

degree of knowledge;

accuracy of information received;

adherence to organisational policies;

timeliness of service;

efficiency of processes;

conformity of the final product;

past results.
There is no set rule to the type of questioning that can be used by a mystery
shopper. Generally there will be a questionnaire of sorts, but this will be com-
pleted after the mystery shop is over as obviously writing up notes whilst in the
shop would give the game away somewhat! Generally the mystery shopper will
be given a ‘scenario’ (or story) of why they are there and this scenario will
allow them to ask all the relevant questions required.
Whilst the mystery shop is normally unscripted, the data is generally cap-
tured on predefined questionnaires with some elements of free text to allow
them to include any exceptional information. This is again relayed back to the
research company for analysis.
Mystery shopping is an expensive but valuable tool in the quest to fully
gauge the reality of the service you are offering. Expensive because a statistic-
ally robust sample must be achieved in the same way as with any other Quant
study, and seasonal and regional variations also need to be considered.
Note: This technique is widely used in the retail industry (e.g. restaurants,
hotels, mail order businesses and car dealerships) and can produce some very
interesting results!

B.5 Writing a questionnaire
There are a number of considerations that must be made when setting out to
write a questionnaire.
Firstly you must be very clear what your objectives are. What do you want to
find out, what are you going to do with information once you have it. How will
you judge whether you are succeeding or failing? It sounds simple, but until
you know what you want to find out, there is no point moving on.
Next create yourself a logical question plan. Start with the general and get
more specific as you move through the questionnaire. It may be that you do not
want your customer to know it is you asking the questions and, therefore, you
will need to start with general questions about your marketplace before getting
down to the specifics of your product and service later. It can help to remain
anonymous and leave it to the customer to work it out. In this way they can have
no preconceived ideas of how they ‘should’answer the question and will respond
more honestly, and not answer how they think you will want them to answer.
Types of questions are vital. In the majority, the questionnaire you should
keep to closed questions and avoid open questions. With closed questions you
will ensure that all customers answer exactly the same question, if you give 100
people an open question you will probably get 100 different answers and how
will you be able to analyse that?! By all means let your customers have their
say, but in a controlled way (i.e. by including an ‘any other comments’ after
each section of questioning).
Example of open and closed questioning:
Closed question – ‘Do you agree or disagree with the following statement’ …..
Open question – ‘How do you feel about the following statement’ ….
The length of the questionnaire is also important. There is no such thing as a
short survey that is too short but there is such a thing as a survey that is too long!
However is there any point in only asking one or two questions? You have, after
all, a captive audience so why not ask them at least 10–12 questions?!
A survey that is too long is a waste of time from a postal point of view because
many people will look at it and not even bother to start, or they may start but
then give up half way through.
Whether the customer is expected to answer the questionnaire on their own or
with the help of a researcher, the questions should be easy to understand and
logical. Avoid unnecessary use of jargon (you may understand it, but will they?).
B.5.1 Routing
Routing is a vital part of any quantitative survey. This allows you to have 
all eventualities covered. If they say ‘yes’ to a question, then ask them more, 
if they say ‘no’ to a question, move them on to the next section (we’ve all seen
it on tax returns!). Routing is very usual but it is essential to get it right. 
Annex B
Customer satisfaction

You don’t want to confuse your customers and you want all the relevant people to
answer all the relevant questions, not miss swathes out of important parts of the
questionnaire by a previous routing error. This is why planning of the question-
naire is vital, and why starting with the general and honing into the specific is key.
B.5.2 Rating scales
For many closed questions (and in order to gauge levels of agreement to state-
ments) rating scales are important. There will be very few questions which you
will want just a yes/no answer as opposed to a lot of maybe/sometimes answers!
Rating scales will allow you to capture this information. There are a number of
schools of thought on the rating scales, how many levels should you allow,
should you have an odd or an even number of scales. In general terms the answer
will fall to you to decide what is best for your particular company, but it is most
normal to see an even number of levels in a rating scale usually of 4 or more.
Again this will depend on what information you expect to find out and what you
will do with that incremental information. Odd numbers are generally avoided as
this would allow people to choose the middle number to sit on the fence. Below
is an example of a rating scale question and how you could use the information.
Q – On a scale of 1–10 (where 10  agree completely and 1  disagree com-
pletely) would you agree that the service that company X offers is better than
the competition?
Say you asked 10 people this question, you may get the following data:
1 person said ‘1’– disagree completely;
3 people said ‘4’;
1 person said ‘7’;
4 people said ‘8’;
1 person said ‘10’.
That would mean that 60% of people agreed to some degree with the question,
of that 50% agreed to some degree (e.g. they rated it 7–9), and 10% of people
categorically agreed, whilst 40% disagreed to some degree and 10% categor-
ically disagreed.
This information is giving you degrees of agreement. If you did not have the
scale how would those who answered ‘4’ have answered, if they could only
choose agree or disagree? This could have skewed your data all of a sudden and
you would have had 40% disagreeing with your statement, instead of only 10%
strongly opposed, with a 30% wavering.
B.6 Sample profile
Sample profiles are a complex issue and are only described here in the briefest
and most broad brushstroke of ways. Sampling, at its most complex, is a highly
Self-assessment 471
Annex B
Customer satisfaction

472 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses
sophisticated process of statistics and demographic profiling. However there
are some basics that we should look at.
Essentially the sample profile is a definition of your customer base. The
sample should be a direct representation of the breakdown of your customer
base, in all aspects (for example to reflect the split of male to females, old to
young, home-owners to those who rent properties etc.). When national polls
are undertaken they don’t ask every member of the population, but a represen-
tative sample of that population.
Although sample profiles should cover all elements of your customer base
don’t try to get too sophisticated with it, stick to exploring the views of the major-
ity not the minority. When establishing the profile you will want to set broad
‘quotas’ for each of your main profile groups – for example you may need to
achieve 70% male and 30% female respondents to reflect your customer base.
Note: Some quantitative methodologies (i.e. such as postal surveys) will not
allow you to control the quota and you should consider whether this will pose
an issue for you. If the majority of your customer base is broadly the same, then
this will not be an issue at all. If, on the other hand, you have a wide diversity
in your customer base then you need to be able to control the sample.
Whilst undertaking your research, the sample breakdown should be monitored
to ensure you are covering all of the vital groups and so that a plan of action can
be put in place if you find you are missing a vital group at this stage – it is 
difficult to do this later on.
B.7 Areas suitable for analysis
The possibilities for analysing customer satisfaction can vary from one organ-
isation to another but probably the three most important areas are:

B.8 Analysis of customer satisfaction data
Customer satisfaction is not something one can monitor directly by simply
installing a sensor. One has first to collect the data and then analyse it in order
to draw conclusions, to identify the key areas where action is necessary and
where major opportunities for improvement are indicated. This data can be
collected from a number of sources (see table below) and the results can then
be used as the basis for business and process development plans for current
and future products and services.

(continued)

Self-assessment 475
When analysing your customer satisfaction data you can compare your data
with industry norms to evaluate whether your company is performing above or
below the norm for your sector. This is achieved through a Customer satisfac-
tion index or ACSI (American Customer Satisfaction Index) which uses data
obtained from customer interviews, to produce an independent measure of 
performance that is useful to economists, investors and potential customers.
Note: ISO10002 (Quality Management, Customer Satisfaction – Guidelines for
complaints handling) is part of a forthcoming trio of international best practice
codes of conduct (the others being ISO 10001 for complaints handling and ISO
10003 for an external customer disputes resolution system) which are currently
working drafts scheduled to be published as International Standards in 2006.
This new standard will provide guidelines for handling complaints in a way that
will not only benefit the organisation but also the unhappy customer. In addition
to meeting the requirements of ISO 9001:2000, ISO 10002 will also be capable
of being used as a stand-alone process in support of other quality management
and customer satisfaction tools such as Customer Relation Management, Six
Sigma and the EFQM Models.
B.9 Other considerations


Respond to complaints quickly and courteously – a speedy response can
add 25 per cent to customer loyalty.

Resolve complaints on the first contact – reduce the cost of unnecessary
additional contacts.

Use your computers to develop a database of complaints – an electronically
compiled customer complaint system enables an organisation to better
align their services and products to meet customer expectations.

Recruit and hire well motivated, front-line employees, to deal with cus-
tomer complaints – it is important that all personnel who come into contact
with customers should have a non-intrusive method for conveying to the
customer that the compliment is appreciated and will be passed on to the
staff involved.

Be sure to keep your customers informed about any change in procedure
that you have introduced because of the survey.

Document and follow up on all the comments you receive. If you have to
change a procedure, then you need to ensure that everyone involved in that
procedure is aware of the changes.

Advertise the fact that you are doing things differently and in a more quali-
tative manner.

Above all the survey process needs to be free from bias, prejudice and
political influence.
Annex B
Customer satisfaction

Self-assessment 477
Annex C
Guidance on
non-conforming products
By definition, a non-conforming product is a product that does not conform to
the agreed product requirements when subjected to a planned (or unplanned)
verification and which fails to meet:

specified customer’s requirements;

intended usage requirements;

stated or implied needs;

customer expectations;

the organisation’s own requirements.
Note: A product that becomes damaged or fails at any other stage is normally
considered unserviceable.
C.1 Identifying non-conformities
Identifying and controlling non-conforming products is a fundamental quality
control discipline whose purpose is to prevent unacceptable items or services
from reaching customers in the first place.
This discipline is covered by ISO 9001:2000 clause 8.3 which states that 
‘The organisation shall ensure that a product which does not conform to prod-
uct requirements is identified and controlled to prevent its unintended use or
delivery’. In simple terms this means that an organisation must identify prod-
ucts that don’t conform to requirements and probably the most common method
of carrying this out is just to stick a label to the product warning people of this
fact, but there are other ways such as:

fixing barcodes, or other means of electronic identification, to the product;

using coded markings on the product (e.g. paint spots);

writing remarks directly on the product;

fixing tags, signs or stickers to the product;
Annex C
Guidance on non-conforming products

478 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses

wrapping tape or ribbon around the product;

storing the product in specially marked areas (e.g. quarantine areas).
Note: Whilst products are often capable of operating even though they do con-
tain certain non-conformities, a service is usually withdrawn once the non-
conformity has been detected (no matter how trivial the fault) and this is 
usually achieved by using notices such as ‘Out of Order’ or by announcements
such as ‘Normal service will be resumed as soon as possible’.
C.2 Controlling non-conforming products
The prime aim for any organisation, of course, is that they should prevent any non-
conforming products from reaching the customer in the first place and to remove
the root cause of non-conformance. Whilst the most obvious way of achieving this
aim is to actually scrap or destroy the product, it might also be possible to elimi-
nate the non-conformity by amending an existing procedure or to repair (or
rework) the offending item. This process would, of course, have to be covered by
a specific documented procedure which would include requirements for:

defining responsibilities for the control and maintenance of these docu-
mented procedures;

training employees on the use of these procedures;

segregating non-conforming products from conforming products;

securing non-conforming products in locked or protected areas.
C.3 Documented procedures
In addition to section C.2 above, a documented procedure will have to be writ-
ten for the control of a non-conforming product should specify:

the responsibilities for authorising a product (or service) as a non-conformity,
where this is to be recorded and what information should be provided;
Note: This should also include:

who can identify non-conforming products?

who can move or handle non-conforming products?

who can authorise remedial action to deal with non-conforming 
products?

who is responsible for completing this action?

how the product should be scrapped or recycled (together with the forms to
be used and the authorisations to be obtained);
Annex C
Guidance on non-conforming products

Self-assessment 479

the various repair procedures that should be used (and how they should be
produced, selected and implemented);

how modifications should be defined, identified and implemented;

how production permits (deviations) and concessions (waivers) should be
requested, evaluated, approved or rejected;

products should be returned to its supplier (the forms to be completed and
any identification requirements etc.);

how regrading a product is to be carried out (product markings, prior
authorisation and acceptance criteria etc.);

the records that must be maintained.
C.4 Dealing with non-conforming products
When a product is found to be non-conforming there are three decisions that
should be made based on the following questions:

can the product be made to conform?

if the product cannot be made to conform, is it fit for use?

if the product is not fit for use, can it be made fit for use?
In clause 8.3, ISO 9001:2000 suggests that one of the following methods
should be used to control non-conforming products:

application.

480 ISO 9001:2000 for Small Businesses
If you need to recall a product that is suspected as being defective you will
need to devise a Recall Plan, specify responsibilities and time-scales and put
the plan into effect.
Note: Product recall is a remedial action not a corrective action because it does
not prevent a recurrence of the initial problem.
C.5 Records
ISO 9001:2000 requires ‘that records of the nature of non-conformities and any
subsequent action taken, including concessions obtained, shall be maintained’.
These records should contain:

a description of the non-conformity;

action taken (usually referred to as ‘disposition’);

action taken to re-verify the non-conforming product after it has been 
corrected;

details of any concessions made or given.
C.6 Re-verifying non-conforming products
When non-conforming products are corrected, they must be re-verified before
being delivered to the customer. This re-verification should be completed using
the original (or a modified version of the original) and the records must include:

evidence of conformity (i.e. actual measurements or observations);

identification of the person authorising the release (i.e. the person perform-
ing the verification or responsible for seeing that the task is carried out).
C.7 Non-conformities detected at a later date
Occasionally non-conformities will be detected after delivery or after the cus-
tomer has used the product and in these cases ISO 9001:2000 requires that the
organisation ‘shall take action appropriate to the effects or potential effects of
the non-conformity’.
Normally this is achieved by the organisation having a procedure to cover a
returned goods process. This procedure will include:

Identifying the non-conforming product (see section C.1 above);

Initiating corrective action is initiated to determine and eliminate the root
cause of the non-conformity (see section C.4 above).
Annex C
Guidance on non-conforming products

Self-assessment 481
Annex C
Guidance on non-conforming products
C.8 Corrective action
ISO 9001:2000 states that ‘The organisation shall take action to eliminate the
causes of non-conformities in order to prevent recurrence’ which basically
means that all non-conformities will be submitted for corrective action and 
that this corrective action should be appropriate to the type of non-conformity
found.
Action to remove the detected non-conformity is a remedial action and can
include the completion of operations, rework, repair or modification.

Glossary of terms
As international trade increases, it is becoming more important than ever to
know the exact meaning of some of the basic definitions when referred to the
quality of a product or service – especially when used in the vernacular! To
overcome this problem an international standard (ISO 8402:1994 – Quality
management and quality assurance – vocabulary) was published in three 
languages (English, French and Russian).
ISO 9000:2000 was then developed within ISO/TC 176. It was developed by
first screening existing quality standards (e.g. ISO 8402:1994) and publica-
tions that were available to determine the quality terms that could be included
and then producing internationally acceptable definitions of them. Because of
this “international acceptability” many of these definitions and terms have 
specific meanings and applications as opposed to generic definitions that are
normally to be found in dictionaries.

2nd party – A subcontractor or supplier under a direct contract to the main
contractor, both for manufacture or services, and for installation, repair and
maintenance.

independent 3rd Party Certification Body (e.g. BSI, NQA).
4th party – Term, sometimes used to describe an independent but approved
agent, e.g. a company who is authorised by a computer manufacturer to repair
computers returned directly from the retailers under guarantee and then
invoice the computer manufacturer directly, is called a 4th party repairer.
