Introduction
1	 Introduction
The simplest drilling fluid is a dirty mixture of water and clay, often referred to as mud. The drilling fluid 
in the drilling process can be seen as the equivalent to the blood in the human body, the mud pump 
is the heart, and the drilled out shale (cuttings) represent the slag products. At the surface, we find the 
mud cleaning system which corresponds to the kidney and the lungs. In the mud cleaning system the 
cuttings are removed by means of a sieve, the shale shaker.
Mud is basically a fluid (water or oil) circulated to bring cuttings out of the wellbore. Two important 
qualities of the fluid are needed for mud to achieve all its tasks:
--
Viscosity: Water and oil has a viscosity of around 1 cP (centiPoise), which is far too little 
to transport the cuttings out. A component is needed to increase the viscosity. The main 
viscosifyers are clay and polymer, presented in Chapter 3.
--
Density: Water and oil have a density of around 1 kg/l, which in most cases is too little to 
counter high pore pressure. It may in fact become necessary to increase it to twice the pressure 
of a water column. The main density giver is Barite (BaSO4), a mineral often found as evaporites 
(with a specific density of 4.2 kg/l), or, soluble salts (brines).
Clay and polymers react with water, while Barite does not, and is therefore referred to as the inert phase.
1.1	
Nine distinct mud systems
For mud to manage its many tasks, a broad range of different fluid systems have been developed. The 
July issue of World Oil (a list of general references are found in Chapter 9) presents all drilling fluids and 
additives (approximately 5000 different additives). Nine distinct mud systems are defined here. The first 
seven are water-based, while the eighth is oil-based. The ninth category is a specialized one in which air 
or gas is the continuous fluid. The 9 categories are:
1.	 Non dispersed. These may consist of spud muds, natural muds and other lightly treated systems 
generally used for shallow wells or top-hole drilling.
2.	 Dispersed. At greater depths or where hole-conditions may be problematic, muds are often 
dispersed, typically by means of lignosulphonates or other deflocculants. These and similar 
products are also effective filtrate reducers.
3.	 Calcium treated. Divalent cations such as calcium and magnesium, when added to a mud, 
inhibit the swelling of formation clays and shale, and are therefore added to control sloughing 
shale, hole enlargement and to prevent formation damage. Hydrated lime, gypsum (calcium 
sulphate) and calcium chloride are principal ingredients of calcium systems. Gyp systems (note: 
Gyp = gypsum) usually have a pH of 9.5 to 10.5 and an excess gyp concentration of 2 to 4 lb/
bbl; Lime systems have an excess lime concentration of 1 to 15 lb/bbl and a pH of 11.5 to 12.0.

Introduction
4.	 Polymer. Muds incorporating long-chain, high-molecular-weight chemicals are effective in 
increasing viscosity, flocculating muds, reducing filtrate loss and stabilizing the formation. 
Various types of polymers are available for this purpose, including Bentonite extenders. Bio 
polymers and cross-linked polymers are also used and have good shear-thinning properties 
at low concentrations.
5.	 Low solids. This includes systems in which the amount and type of solids are controlled. 
Total solids should not range higher than about 6% to 10% by volume (and clay < 3% by 
volume). One primary advantage of low-solids systems is that they significantly improve the 
rate of penetration.
6.	 Saturated salt. Include several groups: Saturated salt systems have a chloride ion concentration 
of 189 000 ppm. Saltwater systems have a chloride content from 6 000 to 189 000 ppm, and at 
its lower level are usually referred to as brackish or seawater systems.
7.	 Workover. Completion and workover fluids are specialized systems designed to minimize 
formation damage, and be compatible with acidizing and fracturing operations (acid soluble) 
and capable of inhibiting swelling clays that reduce formation permeability. Density is obtained 
through dissolved salt to avoid long term settling.
8.	 Oil/synthetic. Oil-based fluids are used for high temperature wells, deviated holes and wells 
where pipe sticking and hole stabilization is a problem. They consist of two types of systems:
1)	 Invert emulsion muds are water-in-oil fluids and have water as the dispersed phase and 
oil as the continuous phase. They may contain up to 50% water in the liquid phase. 
Emulsifier (commonly fatty acids amine derivatives, high-molecular-weight soaps), and 
water concentrations are varied to control rheological and electrical stability;
2)	 Synthetic fluids are designed to duplicate the performance of oil-based muds, without the 
environmental hazards. Primary types of synthetic fluids are esters, poly alpha olefins 
and food grade paraffin. They are environmentally friendly, can be discharged offshore 
and are non-sheening and biodegradable.
9.	 Air, mist, foam and gas. Four basic operations are included in this specialized category according 
to the IADC. These include:
1)	 Dry air drilling, which involves injecting dry air or gas into the wellbore at rates capable 
of achieving annular velocities that will remove cuttings; 
2)	 Mist drilling involves injecting a foaming agent into the air stream, which mixes with 
produced water and lifts drill cuttings; 
3)	 Stable foam uses chemical detergents and polymers and a foam generator to carry cuttings 
in fast-moving air stream; 
4)	 Aerated fluids rely on mud with injected air (which reduces the hydrostatic head) to 
remove drilled solids from the wellbore.

Introduction
1.2	
The five main tasks of a drilling fluid
Mud has many important functions and corresponding necessary properties. Chapter 5, 6, 7 and 8 will 
take you through the four most important ones.
Task 1 and 2: The single most important function is to 1) remove the cuttings away from under the bit 
and 2) transport them from the bottom to the surface, studied in Chapter 5 and 6. Flushing the cuttings 
from the bottom require a high flushing effect. This is achieved by inserting small jet nozzles in the 
rock bit and thereby creating a large pressure drop. Typically 50% of the pump pressure is placed here 
for this very purpose. The other 50% is pure friction loss through the thin, long drill string, and the 
concentric hole between the wellbore and the drill pipe. The wellbore is made up by the drilling bit, and 
the concentric hole is referred to as the annulus.
Friction loss is an important part of Task 2, and is studied separately in Chapter 4. Here it will be revealed 
that the viscosity of drilling fluids is not a constant parameter for a given drilling fluid; it varies with 
shear rate (which is created by the pumping action of the mud pump). Viscosity of the mud is in fact 
surprisingly high at low pump rates, but decreases with increasing pump flow rates. 
Task 3: Pump pressure loss in the annulus has an additional importance compared to other friction drops. 
Annular friction pressure adds itself onto the hydrostatic wellbore pressure, and may create difficult 
conditions from time to time. This topic will be discussed in Chapter 7.
Task 4: Maintaining a stable wellbore. This task includes many sub tasks, like chemical stability, mechanical 
stability and filtration control. Chapter 8 will reveal the details.
The drilling fluid must be designed to take care of other tasks also, such as;
--
Cool and lubricate the bit and the drill string
--
Avoid losing mud into natural or induced cracks
--

Mud circulation loop and its components
2	 Mud circulation loop and 
its components
Mud is circulated through a wellbore to bring the cuttings to the surface. Here cuttings are separated 
out so that clean mud can be reinserted into the well.
2.1	
The mud loop and solids control
A typical circulation system is presented in Figure 2-1 as an example from a fixed drilling platform, while 
Figure 2-2 presents the circulation system from another view; on a floating drilling unit. Here mud is 
mixed and prepared in the mud pits consisting of several large tanks, each typically 60 m3large. One or 
two of the tanks are in active use for mud circulation, while the others are for transfer and storing. One 
reserve pit is for kill mud, where density is kept typically at 0.25 kg/l above the density in the active pits. 
Both density and rheology are maintained in the active mud pits. Typical total volume of a mud pit is 
200 m3, with a surface area of typically 50 m2. A vertical height of two cm corresponds to a volume of 
1000 liters! In the surface mud system in Figure 2-1, we see two pumps in parallel. On offshore rigs it 
is more common with three.
From the pumps, a high-pressure output line leads up to the drill floor, where, on the standpipe, a multy 
purpose junction is made, called the standpipe manifold. Here the driller can read the standpipe pressure, 
which as almost identical with the pump pressure, reduced only by pipe friction in the short distance 
between the pump and the standpipe manifold.
On its return to the surface, the mud is directed through a wide settling tank, where the largest particles 
are allowed to settle out: On other rigs this tank is called the sand trap, positioned in front of the shale 
shakers as an over flow tank.

Each method exhibits certain advantages and disadvantages. The most efficient form of solids control 
is a combination of several methods. Settling can remove particles down to colloidal size, but settling 
is time consuming and impractical. Mechanical separation can remove particles of sizes down to 5 mm 
as shown in Table 2-1.
Shale shaker

Desilter

Centrifuge

Table 2-1: Mechanical cleaning equipment
Shakers are the most common cleaning method. With the quality and fineness of shaker filter screens 
available today, other cleaning methods have become almost obsolete. With a 60 mesh and a 300 mesh 
filter screen in series, 99% of the cuttings are removed. A 60 mesh filter screen removes the largest 
cuttings and protects the extremely fine second filter screen from wear and tear. The Mesh-size system 
is presented in Table 2-2.
Low gravity solids (LGS) enter the mud through dispersed or disintegrated cuttings and has a density of 
1.8–2.8 kg/l. If its content (LGSC) is increasing above a certain limit, solids control must be intensified.

The mud pump
Pumping drilling fluids through kilometre long pipe systems will result in large hydraulic friction, and 
correspondingly powerful mud pumps are required. One typical pump is shown in Figure 2-3.

When it comes to hydraulic friction and to Task 1, removal of crushed cuttings, it will be necessary to 
know the characteristics of a mud pump. Figure 2-4 shows the pumps characteristics. The pump is limited 
by its maximum pressure, pp,max, for each liner size, its maximum flow rate for each liner size, qmax, and 
its maximum effect, Ep,max (the latter parameter is the same for all liners). The pump characteristics are 
divided into two different operating ranges: Range I is defined through the pump’s smallest liner, and 
range II includes the rest of the liners. Table 2-2 presents a typical pump characteristic for large sized 
mud pumps.

Drilling fluid viscosity control
3	 Drilling fluid viscosity control
Clay and polymers play an important role in drilling fluid viscosity control and are therefore given special 
attention here. Clay plays in addition a central role for wellbore stability (Chapter 8).
3.1	
Clay chemistry
The group of minerals classified as clays can be described chemically as aluminium silicates. Since the 
elements that constitute the clays account for more than 80% of the earth mass (aluminium 8.1%, silicon 
27.7% and oxygen 46.6%) it can be readily accepted that every stage of drilling a hole brings us in contact 
with clay. Clay and shale thus account for more than 75% of all sediments. Type and quantity of clay 
minerals is one of the most important features for chemical and mechanical properties of sedimentary 
rock. A compositional example of sediments vs. depth is shown in Table 3-1.

Mineralogy is presented in % (CEC is a relative measure of water-shale reactivity).
The selection of the drilling fluid is often related to the reactions between the fluid and the rock, as 
these reactions can influence the stability of the bore hole. Thus, an understanding of clay is important 
both in the selection of a drilling fluid system and for the optimization of bore hole stability. The most 
important clay properties for a drilling fluid engineer are shown in Table 3-2.

Drilling fluid viscosity control
Bentonite is the generic name applied to a mixture of minerals that predominantly contains the mineral 
Montmorillonite. The associated minerals are typically other clays, such as mica, kaolinite and quartz. 
Clay is often formed by the in-situ alternation of volcanic ash in the presence of water. The salinity and 
chemical composition of water and ash can give rise to different types of clay.
3.1.1	
Structure of Montmorillonite
Montmorillonite is an aluminium silicate, in which the silicon-oxygen sandwich is a layer of aluminium 
hydroxide, as shown in Figure 3-1.

Drilling fluid viscosity control
Three essential characteristics of this crystal are responsible for the special properties of Montmorillonite:
1.	 Some of the aluminium in the lattice structure are, during creation, replaced with ions of a 
lower charge (electron valence) such as magnesium (from 3 to 2). The substitution, without 
any other change of structure, creates negative surface charges in the lattice. 
2.	 The negative charge sites created in the clay sheet by magnesium substitution are partly 
balanced by close association of positively charged ions (cations), normally Na+. When the 
negative charge arises in the aluminium layer, the silica layers act as a barrier that prevents 
effective neutralisation of either the cations or the charge sites on the clay surface. The creation 
of these charged ions and charged clay surfaces creates very strong attractive forces for polar 
water molecules that readily force themselves in between the unit layers. The unique feature 
of Montmorillonite is thus potential for the individual sheets to separate as more water is 
attracted. In other clay minerals, the bonds formed between unit layers are stronger and they 
do not separate. One clay particle consists normally of hundreds of stacked unit layers.
3.	 The loosely held cations give rise to the property known as the cation exchange capacity. The 
attached ions can be exchanged or replaced by other ions present in the surrounding water. The 
ability of one type of cation to replace another depends on the nature of the involved cations 
and their relative concentrations. The common cations will replace each other (when present 
in equal concentration) in the following order:
	
Al3+>Mg2+>Ca2+>H+>K+>Na+
The cation exchange capacity (CEC) is easily determined by measuring the adsorption of a 
cationic organic dye called methylene blue.
The nature of the cations in the exchange positions can affect the hydration properties of the 
mineral. The most common exchangeable cations are sodium and calcium. The sodium ion has 
only one single positive charge. In a Montmorillonite only containing sodium exchangeable 
ions, the clay has a capacity for infinite expansion and even separation of the sheets down 
to single sheets, which are only 10 Angstroms thick. A multivalent ion, such as calcium 
(valence = 2), associates with two sheets, so the expansion is limited to a maximum spacing 
between the sheets of about 17 A, see Figure 3-2.

Interaction between clay particles
The forces acting on the clay particles can be described as either repulsive or attractive forces. The 
particles may interact due to Brownian motion. Whether they will agglomerate or not will depend on 
the summation of the repulsive and the attractive forces.
Repulsive electrical forces
The clay particles have been described as small crystals that have a negative surplus charge (a partly 
compensating charge is provided by the ions in solution that are electrostatically attracted to the surface). 
When two negatively charged particles approach each other, there will be repulsion between the particles 
that will become larger the closer the particles approach each other.
However, since thickness of the electrostatic layer can be compressed by electrolytes, then, as the 
electrolyte (dissolved salt) level is increased, the particles can more easily approach each other, as shown 
in Figure 3-3.

Attractive van der Waals forces
van der Waals forces arise through the attraction of the spontaneous dipoles being set up due to distortion 
of the cloud of electrons around each atom. This is illustrated in Figure 3-4. For a large assemblage of 
atoms, such as in a clay platelet, this force can be significant as it is additive. The attractive force decays 
very rapidly with distance; inversely proportional to the distance cubed (l/d3), but it is essentially 
independent of the electrolyte concentration.
Two atoms with symmetrical clouds of electrons 
and hence no attractive force between the atoms.
Spontaneous distortion of the electron 
cloud sets up dipole attractive forces. 
Figure 3-4: Illustration of the origins of van der Waals attractive forces in any two materials close to each other.
Resulting associations
The associations between clay particles are caused by repulsive/attractive forces and are important as 
they affect important properties, such as viscosity, yield and fluid loss, exemplified in Figure 3-5. The 
terms describing the associations are as follows:

Drilling fluid viscosity control
The molecular weight (MW) or chain length can be impressively long, up to 50 millions! Assuming a 
typical monomer diameter is 7 A, a 50 million MW polymer is 3.5 cm long. Polymers can be divided 
into three groups; non-ionic, anionic (-) and cationic (+). More than one type of monomer group may 
be present in the same molecule. Since the groups are either weakly basic or acidic, the charged nature 
of most of the groups is dependent on the pH value of the drilling fluid and will change from non-ionic 
to cationic or anionic respectively (just like charged clay).
The ionic strength of the fluid affects the electrostatic repulsion between the charges. An increased level 
of electrolyte will change the balance between the repulsive and attractive forces and allows molecules of 
equal charges to approach each other. A negatively charged polymer will change its configuration from 
an extended polymer in fresh water, where charge repulsions are stretching the molecule, to a tightly-
coiled structure in a saline solution, where the repulsive forces are lower. This is shown schematically 
in Figure 3-7. The change in molecular shape will change the physical properties of the polymer in the 
solution. The coiled up polymer will present a smaller surface for interacting with the water or with 
other polymer molecules, and thus produce lower viscosity. A non-ionic polymer should be essentially 
unaltered by salt.
Multivalent ions can act as bridging agents by reacting with more than one charged group on the molecule. 
Unhydrated cement will feed the drilling fluid with soluble calcium ions and a high alkalinity (pH > 7). 
Calcium ions (Ca++) react with anionic (-) polymers such as CMC and cause bridging or flocculation. 
The extent of the reaction is a function of the concentration of the double valens ions and of the pH of 
the solution.

Drilling fluid viscosity control
The most common applications of polymers are viscosity building: Polymers are applied as viscosifyers 
simply by dissolving high-molecular-weight-polymers in water. Natural polymers will start to degrade 
when exposed to heat. Already at 80 oC biocides are required to slow the decomposition rate down. Above 
100 oC, natural polymers are difficult to apply, since the rate of adding polymer to maintain viscosity 
becomes intolerable. As wells become deeper, thermal stability becomes an important performance 
characteristics of polymers. Synthetic polymer-chemistry has made its most significant contribution to 
the drilling industry in high-temperature/high-pressure applications. From the early 1990s, numerous 
synthetic polymers proved technically capable and cost effective at high bottom hole temperatures 
and pressures. Synthetic polymers specifically formulated for deflocculating, fluid-loss-control, and gel 
inhibition at high temperature proved to have a wide utility. Using WBM at these hostile conditions 
would have been impossible without natural, modified, and synthetic polymers.
The application of polymers is described more detailed in Chapter 3.5.
3.3	
Rheology of drilling fluids
Rheology models and rheology measurements in the drilling industry has been influenced by the 
2-speed rotational viscometer (Fann VG meter), which has been applied in the oil field. The objective 
behind the use of this viscometer was to simplify rheology control in the field. Today, however, as the 
petroleum industry has evolved in all aspects, the need for higher quality rheology control has arisen. 
Now a 6-speed viscometer is the norm. Therefore, three different approaches to determine rheology 
constants are presented:
--
2 data points oil field approach
--
2 data points standard approach
--
6 data points regression approach
Flow curve or rheogram is a plot of shear stress readings vs. shear rate, obtained in a rotational viscometer. 
Table 3-3 presents an example of readings, with the corresponding flow curve in Figure 3-9. Due to the 
geometry and calibration of the Fann VG viscometer the true shear stress, tw, is obtained by multiplying 
the obtained readings with the correction factor of 1.067. This constant is ignored and thus the readings 
(q) are incorrectly assumed equal to the shear stress (tw).
The test results in Table 3-3 will be used to exemplify different rheology models,

The viscosity of a fluid expresses its resistance to flow. Fluids with a constant viscosity for all shear rates 
are called Newtonian fluids. Non-Newtonian fluids are those in which the shear stress is not linearly 
related to the shear rate J. Shear rate expresses the intensity of shearing action in the pipe, or change of 
velocity between fluid layers across the flow path:

Herschel Bulkley model; 3 data points, oil field approach
Since this model contains 3 unknowns we need minimum 3 data points. The yield point is found through 
either reading ty from the flow curve plot after extending it to g = 0, or simply assuming
ty = t3 = 3 Pa
(3.13)
The equation can now be solved in a log-log plot with 3 + 1 (ty) data points. The slope of the line defines 
n and K can be found from:
K = (τ2 – τy) / (γ2
n – γy
n) = (71.5 – 3) / 10220.5 = 0.6
Herschel & Bulkley model; 3 data points, standard approach
Select three data points and apply standard iteration procedure to solve the tree equations.
6 data points, regression approach
One reason for using the two upper data points is the remarkable quality of the Bingham model. It turns 
out that after long periods of still standing, the gel strength of the fluid approaches the yield point, ty 
(obtained through the two upper readings). This is clearly demonstrated through Table 3-3. After 10 
minutes the gel strength has climbed to 48 lb/100 ft2, whereas the yield point is 56 lbs/100 ft2. But the 
yield point is therefore true only under such conditions; long stationary periods.
Nowadays there is no excuse for not applying all six readings to determine the constants through curve 
fitting (regression analysis). A detailed description of how to do this is presented in Chapter 10.6.

Filtration control
Darcy’s law governs filtration of liquids through porous media. However, fluid loss from the wellbore 
will decrease with time, since the permeability decreases continuously as particles make a tighter filter. 
In Figure 3-10, the spurt loss occurs at the start of a filter test, a test which is made on an initially clean 
filter paper, mimicking porous sandstone. After the spurt loss, the filtrate volume becomes proportional 
to the square root of time.
Figure 3-10: Filter press test results.
It is common to simplify laboratory procedures by decreasing test duration to ¼ of the standard 30 
minutes. The accumulated filtrate volume can be predicted from eqn (3.17);

In the well, spurts loss may be large when drilling through highly permeable rocks, unless the mud 
contains particles of the size required to bridge the pores of the rock, and thus establish an improved 
filter somewhat ahead of the bit. Only particles of a certain size relative to the pore size can make bridges. 
Particles larger than the pore opening cannot enter the pores, and are swept away by the mud stream. 
Particles considerably smaller than the opening invade the formation unhindered. Particles of a certain 
critical size are caught in bottlenecks in the flow channels (which vary enormously along the flow paths), 
and form a bridge inside the porous wall. Once a primary bridge is established, successively smaller 
particles are trapped, and thereafter only the filtrate (liquid) may invade the formation. The spurt loss 
period is very brief; it is a matter of seconds.
As a result of the process just described, three zones of mud particles are established in a permeable 
formation. This is shown in Figure 3-11.

In the context of building a tighter filter it is important to supply the mud with a particle size distribution 
in relation to the pore size distribution of the porous formation to be drilled through. Mean particle 
size should be 1/3–1/7 of mean pore throat size as indicated in Figure 3-12. Barite and drilled particles, 
classified in Table 3-4, will always be available and prefect for filter building. However, at the same time 
these particles will interfere with the filter cake building process.

In the context of building a filter cake, a dispersed mud is the preferred mud state. Bentonite in flocculated 
state will experience high water loss and lead to a thick, soft filter cake. By the addition of a thinning 
agent (deflocculator or thinner) a thin, strong and low permeable cake will form. As a generalization, it 
may be said that cake permeability of flocculated muds are in the order of 10-2 mD, those of untreated 
fresh-water muds are in the order of 10-3 mD and filter cakes of muds treated with dispersants are in 
the order of 10-4 mD.

Viscosity control
Important viscosity control additives are:
Bentonite extender: A simple method to increase the viscosity of Bentonite suspensions is to extend the 
Bentonite into a partly flocculated state. Anionic polymers mixed into WBM will react with Bentonite as 
indicated in Figure 3-13 (Flocculants). For the polymer to function as an extender the molecular weight 
must be medium high and the concentration in the ultra low range (0.05–0.10 PPB).

1.	 Easier to control the viscosity
2.	 Fluid loss becomes optimal 
To maintain a system in a dispersed (deflocculated) state the repulsive forces must be maximised. The

Drilling fluid viscosity control
A pH above 8.0 will increase the number of negative groups on the clay edges. Thus, maintaining 
an alkaline pH condition with caustic soda will stabilize the clay system. At high pH level, 
negative charges will predominate.
b)	 Adding deflocculant or thinner:
There is a wide range of chemicals known as deflocculant or thinner, which have a wide range 
of chemical structure. However, they can all be described as negatively charged polymers. 
Figure 3-13 illustrates the mechanism whereby a short chain of negatively charged polymer 
can neutralise a positive charge on the edge, and increase the negative charge density on the 
clay platelet. Some common chemicals are chrome lignosulphonate, tannin and lignite. Since 
the deflocculants are reacting with the positive sites on the edges, and the edge surface area is 
a relatively small proportion of the total, the chemicals can be effective at low concentrations. 
c)	 Fine particles act as dispersants:
Other fine particulate solids, such as calcium carbonate, barites or drilled out fines, are all 
inert, and will act essentially as physical hinders for clays to flocculate. Such particles are 
called dispersants.
Flocculants (Clay free/clear water drilling): The process is initiated by creating larger lumps of clay particles 
as illustrated in Figure 3-13. Then the particles are separated out by means of gravity. Conditions are 
similar to those mentioned under Bentonite Extension, but polymer concentration must be in the low 
range (0.1–0.3 ppb), added after the shale shaker.
3.5.2	
Fluid loss control
Fluid loss to permeable formations is reduced through increasing the viscosity of the fluid phase. Non-
ionic, low MW polymers are applied, and will therefore become an integrated part of the fluid phase. 
They do not interact with the solids. The filtrate from filtration tests in the filter press is a surprisingly 
clear fluid, consisting of water and the fluid loss additives, which are in the size range of molecules. The 
practical topic of fluid loss is presented in Chapter 3.4.

3.5.3	
Hydraulic friction reducers
Some special polymer suspensions provide much lower friction than the base fluid’s rheology predicts. 
This is explained by a layer of base fluid being formed along the pipe wall during flowing. When small 
molecules like polymers are suspended in liquids, they will perform a stochastic movement referred to 
as Brownian movement. The suspended particles have 6 degrees of freedom, and will normally diffuse 
equally in all directions. However, close to the wall one freedom of movement is removed, only diffusion 
away from or along the wall is possible. An additional effect is caused by the shear stress field. The 
shear stress in the fluid reaches a maximum at the wall, leading to stretching effects of the polymers. 
The resulting viscosity near the wall will approach the base fluid’s viscosity under certain conditions. 
Figure 3-14 illustrates the phenomenon, while Table 3-5 summarises the features and friction effects of 
these special polymer solution.

Summary of additives
In addition to viscosifyers and to rheology control agents, there are several more groups of additive. We 
refer to the classification of additives published by World Oil once a year as presented below. They also 
publish the name and characteristics of more than 3000 additives.
Alkalinity, pH control:	
	
Lime, caustic soda and bicarbonate of soda, control the degree of acidity 
of a fluid.
Bactericides:	
	
	
Para formaldehyde, caustic soda, lime and starch preservatives are 
commonly used to reduce bacteria count.

Calcium removers:	
	
Caustic soda, soda ash, bicarbonate of soda and certain polyphosphates 
make up the majority of chemicals designed to prevent and overcome 
the contaminating effects of anhydrite, gypsum and calcium sulphates.
Corrosion inhibitors: 	
	
Hydrated lime and amine salts are often added to check corrosion. 
Defoamers: 	
	
	
Products designed to reduce foaming action, particularly in brackish 
and saturated saltwater mud.
Emulsifiers: 	
	
	
Surface active agents create a heterogeneous mixture of two liquids.
Filtrate reducers: 	
	
Filtrate, or fluid loss reducers – such as Bentonite clays, CMC (sodium 
carboxyl methyl cellulose) and pre gelatinized starch – reduces the 
tendency of the liquid phase of the drilling fluid to pass into the formation.
Flocculants: 	
	
	
Salt, hydrated lime, gypsum and sodium tetra phosphates are used to 
cause colloidal particles in suspension to group into bunches, or “flocks”, 
causing solids to settle out.
Foaming agents: 	
	
Surfactants (foamers) permit air or gas drilling through water-bearing 
formations.
Lost circulation materials: 	
Lost circulation additives plug the zone of loss in the formation.
Lubricants: 	
	
	
Oils, graphite, powder and soaps reduce torque and increase horsepower 
transmitted to the bit by reducing the coefficient of friction.
Pipe-freeing agents: 	
	
Detergents, soaps, oils and surfactants are intended to be spotted in an 
area of suspected pipe sticking to reduce friction, increase lubricity and 
inhibit formation swelling.
Shale control inhibitors: 		
Gypsum, sodium silicate and calcium lignosulfonate, as well as lime and 
salt, are used to control swelling or hydrous disintegration of shale.
Surface active agents:	
	
Reduce the interfacial tension between contacting surfaces (water/oil, 
water/air, etc.).

Hydraulic friction in the circulating system
4	 Hydraulic friction in the 
circulating system
The objective of estimating hydraulic friction in the circulation system is three-fold:
1.	 Determine the total frictional loss at its maximum design flow rate, so that the required pump 
size can be selected
2.	 Determine pressure loss thorough the nozzles in the bit to enable determination of optimal 
nozzle size and thus achieving proper cleaning effect on bottom
3.	 Establish ECD in the annulus in order to stay inside the pressure window
To reach these goals we rely on three types of knowledge:
•	 The fluid flow system and drilling engineering operations (Chapter 2)
•	 Rheology of drilling fluids (Chapter 3)
•	 The governing equation of fluid mechanics (this Chapter)
We will therefore now go through hydraulic friction losses in pipes and annuli, for laminar and turbulent 
flow, for three different rheology models;
•	 Newtonian
•	 Bingham plastic
•	 Power law 
Not only losses in pipe flow will be covered, but also singularity losses, i.e. losses through sudden 
expansions or restrictions, like in the rock bit nozzles. Since we are dealing with pipe flow, we apply 
cylindrical coordinates. The basic equations will initially also be presented in Cartesian coordinates. 
Cartesian velocity components in the x, y and z direction are denoted vx, vy and vz, while resultant axial 
flow is simply denoted v, sometimes vz or vx. Governing equations of fluid mechanics are summarized 
in Chapter 10.4, in microscopic and macroscopic views. The microscopic view is characterized by 
observing the flow behaviour as it develops inside the pipe, and thereby allowing us to observe from one 
position in the flow profile continuously, referred to as the Langrangian view. The macroscopic view or 
the Eularian view involves a control volume and keeping track of what is entering and what is leaving 
the control volume.

Laminar flow
We start with the simplest case; laminar pipe flow. Since our analysis will assume steady state flow, it 
will either be laminar or turbulent flow (Figure 4-2 demonstrates the significance of it). Flow regime is 
determined through the Reynolds number:

Hydraulic friction in the circulating system
The flow turns from laminar into a transition flow at 1800, and fully turbulent flow is developed at 2100.
Below NRe = 1800, laminar flow will prevail in slick steel pipes, while above 3000 turbulent flow is fully 
developed. Figure 4-10 in Chapter 4.3 demonstrates how the flow lines behave in the transition zone. 
If the pipe wall is not slick but has a certain roughness, turbulent flow will develop at a much lower 
Reynolds number.
High mixing energy causes high mechanical energy loss. The mixing length or entrance length, Le, before 
flow is fully developed (has obtained a constant flow profile), is given through eqn. (4.2b) and (4.2c):

4.2.1	
Pipe flow
The simplest rheology model is the Newtonian model.
Newtonian model
In this chapter the complete derivation is carried out for the Newtonian rheology model. The complete 
sets of resulting equations for all three types of rheological models are gathered in Chapter 10.5.
Hydraulic flow problems are solved by solving the five basic equations:
1.	 Equation of state relates fluid density to pressure and temperature. For practical purposes liquids 
are incompressible, we therefore assume that the density is constant.
2.	 Constitutive material equation characterizes fluid behaviour in laminar flow. Fluids subjected 
to shear rate will resist deformation resulting in shear stress:

3.	 Continuity equation is the law of conservation of mass. A general form of the continuity equation 
states the difference between the input and output of mass to a small volume element:

5.	 Energy equation or law of conservation of energy is interesting only for problems involving 
temperature change.
Except for the energy equation, all the other four equations are needed. By assuming that an incompressible, 
Newtonian fluid is flowing at steady-state in a horizontal pipe, the term ∂2vx/∂q2 becomes 0 in the 
momentum equation since the flow is symmetrical about the pipe axis. Under these circumstances the 
state, continuity and momentum equations simplify to:

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Eqn (4.21) is known as the Hagen-Poiseuille equation for laminar pipe flow. The pressure loss Dp is due 
to viscous stress only, and is linearly proportional to flow rate or average velocity and to length of pipe.

Annular flow
Newtonian fluids
Flow in between two concentric pipes can be treated either as flow in true concentric pipes, or in a 
simplified manner, as flow between two parallel plates. For narrow annuli the deviation between true and 
parallel flow is highest, and here the losses may become a large portion of total loss, significant errors 
are introduced. By presenting both solutions we can pursue this difference.

Shear rate and effective viscosity
In some situations it may be useful to find the shear rate at the pipe wall, to compare with a rheometer

It is also possible to apply the Newtonian pressure loss equations for other rheological models when 
expressing them through the equivalent Newtonian viscosity. The equivalent viscosity is often referred 
to as effective or apparent viscosity. For Bingham plastic, the equivalent viscosity for circular pipes is 
found by comparing eqn. (4.21) with the Bingham fluid loss equation (see Chapter 10.5):

A large difference in result is observed in the two models. This is due to the fact that the Bingham model 
aims too high for the ty. It is clearly seen in Figure 3-8 that at these low shear rates the Bingham model 
gives 3 times higher shear stress than the true readings. From the logarithmic plot of measured rheology 
data in Figure 3-8 it is seen that the 4 upper readings fall into a straight line, while the two lower ones 
do not. It is fair to conclude that the upper 4 points describe the Power law behavior of the mud, while 
the two lower ones point out the Binghamian nature of the fluid.

Turbulent pipe flow
When kinetic energy dominates over shear stress, the flow turns into turbulent flow. A dimensionless 
number called the Reynolds number, NRe, is used for determining the flow regime;
NRe =

Turbulent flow is chaotic flow and the velocity varies continuously both in the x and y direction, resulting 
in high energy consumption, and correspondingly high loss due to friction (head loss). Figure 4-10 
demonstrates the higher loss rate at turbulent flow regime.

For n = 1 and K = µ, eqn (4.52) reduces to eqn (4.2), which is valid for Newtonian fluids. By curve 
fitting the experimental data in the turbulent region of Figure 4-10, several mathematical relationships 
have been suggested, and named after its author:
1.	 Blasius: Eqn (4.53) is valid for smooth pipes and for 103 < Re 105, and Newtonian fluids:

For non-Newtonian fluids the effective viscosity should be applied. It has been found that for Bingham 
fluids the transition to turbulent flow is insufficiently determined by the Reynolds number. The Hedstrom 
number is related to the critical Reynolds number, below which the flow pattern is laminar, as shown 
in Figure 4-13. The Hedstrom number is:

Singularity losses
Valves, bends, tees, pipe entrances, sudden expansions etc. have no length dimension and pressure 
loss through such restrictions are called singularity losses or minor losses. The losses are determined 
experimentally. The flow is always turbulent, and inertia effects will dominate over viscous effects. The 
loss coefficient, KL, is therefore a comparison of how large a part of the dynamic pressure is lost:






S

U
'
 

(4.60)
The loss coefficient is a function of geometry. At the entrances or contractions the head loss is largely 
dependent on how well the entrance is rounded. 
Table 4-2 presents loss coefficients for typical singularity loss geometries. In sudden contractions up to 
50% of the kinetic energy change can be lost, while for sudden enlargements 100% of the change can 
be lost. KL for pipes leading to a submerged tank is always equal to 1.0, independent of geometry. In a 
submerged exit all velocity head is lost due to viscous dissipation. This is in accordance with the second 
law of thermodynamics. Submerged exit losses are independent of geometry.

Table 4-2: Typical loss coefficients for restrictions vs. its geometry.
The most known singularity losses in the drilling fluid circulation system are summarized below.
Bit nozzle. Drilling mud is discharged at the bottom of the hole through the bit nozzles. In order to aid 
cuttings removal from the bottom, the nozzles have a relatively small cross-sectional area so that the 
mud is discharged at high velocities.
By applying the Bernoulli equation, flow of incompressible fluids through a nozzle is written:

Eqn (4.63) is simplified in several ways. The loss of pressure head through the nozzles is composed of 
three parts: loss of kinetic pressure at the entrance of the nozzles, loss of kinetic pressure at the outlet of 
the nozzles to the annulus, and frictional pipe pressure loss through the 0.1–0.2 m long pipe leading to 
the nozzles. Since the nozzle velocity is much larger than the velocity at the entrance and at the outlet, 
the effect of ignoring entrance and end effect plus friction through the nozzle-pipe are compensated 
by including them in the loss coefficient, Kbit. The discharge coefficient Kbit for high-velocity jet bit 
nozzles is equal to 1.0 (the losses at the entrance are small due to the ellipsoidal shape of the entrance). 
By including the other loss effects, the coefficient becomes larger than 1.0. A typical value listed in the 
literature is 1.11. However, the uncertainty of estimating pressure loss through bit nozzles is high. When 
the coefficient is 1.11, the bit pressure loss becomes:

PDM. Positive Displacement Motors (PDM) are characterized by a tortuous internal flow path, comprising 
by-pass valves, stator/rotor, transmission and shaft bearing. In addition an unknown percentage of the 
fluid flow (2–15%) is used for lubrication and passing through the axial bearing. The losses are a function 
of flow rates, WOB and resulting downhole torque. A general model is proposed:

MWD. Pressure losses through MWD tools are simpler to model than losses through PDMs. Pressure loss 
data obtained from the vendor are used to construct a data base of tool-specific pressure loss polynomial 
coefficients. Pressure loss curves can be constructed as a function of flow rate for different mud weights 
and for different additional influencing parameters.

Removal of cuttings from under the bit

the bit 
5.1	
Cuttings removal process
In the rotary drilling process the rock surface is crushed by the drilling bit. In order to provide further 
crushing and progress, the cuttings must be removed instantly and efficiently from the rock surface. 
For this purposes, two forms of energy are brought from the surface to the rock surface, illustrated in 
Figure 5.1 (left).
--
Mechanic energy 
--
Hydraulic energy 
Once at the rock surface, the energy should be applied in an optimal manner: Mechanical energy is 
responsible for the rock crushing process, while hydraulic energy is applied for the purpose of cuttings 
removal. While drilling in soft and medium hard formations, both types of energy play an important 
part in rock crushing and rock removal. Several investigations have shown that drilling rate is increased 
significantly with increased hydraulic energy, expressed either as hydraulic horse-power, jet impact force 
or jet velocity through the bit nozzles. Opinions vary to which hydraulic quantity has the greatest effect 
on drilling rate.
The methods of hydraulic program design can be divided into two groups:
1.	 Determining the level of bottom hole cleaning energy required in order to balance the 
mechanical energy level.
2.	 Maximise criterion of estimation, e.g. jet impact force.
Methods in group 1 require field tests. These tests are based on the theory that the drilling rate is 
proportional to bit weight if bottom hole cleaning is adequate. When this proportionality curve, shown 
in Figure 5-1, at some point starts deviating from its increasing trend, the minimum required bottom 
hole cleaning energy to avoid bit balling at that level of WOB is determined.

are called the bit balling point.
For methods in group 2, optimum hydraulics is the proper balance of the hydraulic elements (flow rate, 
bit nozzles diameter) which satisfy some criterion of estimation (the objective function) e.g. maximizing 
the jet impact force. In this book we select the hydraulic quantity q/dnozzle as a common quantity 
representing the above mentioned bit hydraulic objective function. From experiments and observations 
demonstrated through Figure 5-1, we suggest a mathematical model that relates ROP and the hydraulic 
objective function:

Figure 5-1 demonstrates rather clearly, that there is a general increasing trend of ROP when hydraulic 
energy is increased. Constant A in eqn (5.1) includes the effect of all other parameters (others than q, 
dnozzle, and a8) having an influence on ROP. All these parameters are assumed to be kept constant during 
the experimental phase and assumed to have little influence on the hydraulic parameters. Our task is 
to utilize the hydraulic energy of the drilling fluid to achieve the best possible cleaning below the bit so 
that ROP is maximized.
The performance of the pump and the flow system has several limitations or boundaries. These limitations 
are discussed next.
5.2	
Boundary conditions of the drilling process
First, we have the limitations of the pump itself. Each pump is defined with a maximum recommended 
pressure, pmax, and a maximum flow rate. The characteristics of the pump is presented in Chapter 2, and 
repeated in Figure 5-2 below.

5.2.1	
Friction loss increases with depth
Due to friction in the ever extending wellbore, the pump would at some stage reach its maximum available 
pressure during transmission of hydraulic effect through the circulation system. Previously it has been 
shown that the pump pressure is a mirror image of the pressure losses in the circulating system. For 
hydraulic optimization purposes, we now split the friction losses in two parts; bit pressure losses, Dpbit, 
and remaining pressure losses in the circulation system, Dploss, also called parasitic pressure losses. This 
is expressed through eqn. (5.2):

Figure 5-2 displays both mentioned pressure losses, when they are embedded on to the pump 
characteristics. When the flow rate increases, for a given well length, the pump pressure will be more 
and more consumed as friction, Dploss, and less and less is left for the bit.

Figure 5-2: Hydraulic friction as a function of flow rate, superimposed on the pump characteristics.
The parasitic pressure loss can be estimated according to formulas presented in Chapter 3. For hydraulic 
optimization purposes, we apply a simpler expression, reduced to variables important for hydraulic 
optimization:
∆ploss = K1·D · qm
(5.3)
Parasitic pressure loss varies linearly with depth and is an exponential function of pump rate. The constants 
K1 and m can be found by solving eqn. (5.3). Since there are two unknowns, two data sets are needed, at 
two different pump rates, rate 1 and rate 2. Taking the logarithm of eqn. (5.3) for two rates, we obtain:

Table 5-2: Pressure loss constants in two well sections. Recorded data in left section, estimated to the right.
From Table 5-2 we see that this well consumed extremely many bits. The year was 1985, which was before 
the major improvement of steel quality selection, and in the 1990’s they turned to frictional bearings. 
We also observe from Table 5-2 that bit nozzles were changed equally frequent. Today it may happen 
that they drill one full wellbore section with only one rock bit!
If flow is mainly turbulent in the drill string and the annulus, the exponent m will approach 2.0. When 
the flow is completely laminar in the complete flow system, m will approach the rheological power law 
exponent n. Figure 3-9 demonstrated this fact. Usually m is somewhere in between, although a bit closer 
to 2.0 since turbulent pressure drop (in drill string), dominates over laminar (in annulus).

5.2.2	
Annular flow velocity limitations
Flow velocity in the annulus of vertical wells must be held within two boundaries. The upper one is 
normally designed so that turbulence is not developed around the drill collars. In horizontal wells, 
turbulent flow in the BHA-annulus is normally accepted; it helps largely in removing cuttings from this 
part of the annulus. ECD dictates if this can be accepted. 
Cuttings concentration determines the lower boundary. It must be lower than 0.04, or 4 volume percent 
if it gets higher, problems related to accumulation of cuttings, like struck pipe, show an increasing trend. 
The lowest recommended flow rate is referred to as the required flow rate, and denoted qr. In inclined 
wells the criteria concerning annular flow velocities are different and will result in a different hydraulic 
program compared to vertical wells. Optimal hydraulic parameter estimated for vertical wells can 
probably be used as a first approach for inclined wells. Summarized annular flow velocity limitations 
in vertical wells:

Limitations in vertical vs. horizontal wells
Due to cleaning requirements in horizontal wells the use of maximum available flow rate and RPM often 
precede pressure in importance. Therefore a large range is specified in Table 5-3. These numbers are also 
governed by the annular velocity boundaries:
vmax < vturb 	
(around drill collars)
vmin > qr 	
(cuttings concentration in largest annulus < 0.04)
It must be ensured that these parameters are not in conflict with limitations for top side equipment or 
downhole tools and also that they do not lead to formation fracture pressure.

Optimizing ROP, liner by liner
As indicated by the heading, the hydraulic program is dependent on first selecting the most suitable 
liner of the piston pump, before optimizing. It is the annular flow rate limitation, qr, which determines 
the selection of liners, as indicated in Figure 5-2. The smallest possible liner should be selected since 
this will result in the highest possible pressure available. The hydraulic variables are given by eqn (5.1). 
By requiring pump pressure in eqn (5.2) to be maximum and combining it and (4.63) with eqn (5.3) 
and multiplying by q2 we obtain:

The technique presented in Chapter 5.3 represents the standard method of hydraulic optimization for 
vertical wells. A flow sheet of how to routinely determine the optimal bit nozzle and optimal flow rate 
is presented in Figure 5-4. Within a selected liner, the optimal flow rate will be a function of depth in 
accordance with eqn (5.13), while nozzle size will stay constant in accordance with eqn (5.14). With 
high quality drilling bits and pumps, it is probably sufficient to change liner and bit every time a new 
section is started. This program would suggest which liner, which nozzles and which flow rate is optimal 
at the selected depth.

Optimizing the complete well
To plan the complete well for all sections in one complete hydraulic program requires that the standard 
hydraulic program must be expanded. All the constants must be known before the well is drilled. One 
positive side effect obtained through this technique, is that it will be possible to suggest at what depth the 
pump liners can be changed. A complete hydraulic program would suggest which liner, which nozzles 
and which optimal flow rate should be chosen for every section. 
First we need to define two pump operating ranges, as already suggested in Figure 5-2. In operating 
range I, defined by the smallest liner, the pump pressure can be held constant. In order to utilize the 
pumps full capability, and thereby optimizing ROP, the pump pressure is kept at its maximum pressure. 
In range II, defined by the remaining liners, the pump power, Epump, can be held constant as seen in 
previous Figure 2-2 and from Table 2-3. Summarized we have:
Range I :	
p max = const
Range II:	
E max = const
The optimal solution in range II is found by combining eqn (5.1) and (5.10):

Hole cleaning in vertical wells
In vertical wells, hole cleaning is a question of pumping fast enough to counteract the vertical slipping of 
cuttings, thus causing its concentration to decrease. In horizontal wells it is different, the settling distance 
is short, cuttings will fall quickly to the bottom side of the well, and the particles will form beds and dunes. 
The rate at which cuttings are generated by the drilling process is:

Transport of cuttings to the surface
Cuttings volume concentration can be estimated through eqn (6.2) and exemplified through:
q cuttings = ROP · Abit = 20 m/h ·p/4 · (12 1/4“· 0.0254)2 = 0.00042 m3/s
q = 1000 l/min = 0.0167 m3/s
Under these conditions ccuttings,0 = 0.025. A concentration of 2.5%, produces an f(c) = 1 -5.1 * 0.025 = 0.87, 
reducing the settling velocity of a single particle by 13%. Other hindered settling functions in Figure 6-2 
will give higher or lower results.
6.1.2	
Slip velocity of imperfect spheres
Cuttings are non-spherical and perform strange settling motions. And when the flow regime is not 
laminar, empirical knowledge is necessary. The slip velocity must now be found through an empirical 
drag coefficient, CDrag:
The two forces acting on slipping cuttings are still gravity, Fg, and shear, FDrag, which at turbulent flow is:

When the average mud velocity exceeds the resulting slip velocity, the particles will be transported out 
of the well at the resulting transport velocity;
vtransport = vann – vslip
(6.17)
The differential speed can also be presented through a transport ratio:
Rtrasport = vtransport / vann = 1 – vslip / vann
(6.18)
The interdependency between the transport ratio and annular flow rate is determined through experiments 
as shown in Figure 6-4.

It is of interest to determine the minimum required annular velocity, below which problems related to 
accumulated cuttings become too serious. Practice has proven that this boundary velocity coincides 
with a cuttings concentration of 4 volume %. This realization is expressed through solving Rtrasport with 
respect to ccuttings and set it equal to 0.04. The result is shown in Figure 6-5. The required annular velocity 
is typically 30–60 ft/min.

Figure 6-5: Annular velocity in a 5 * 12¼ “ annulus to keep cuttings concentration above 4 vol %. 
At stationary settling conditions the cuttings concentration in the annulus becomes:
ccuttings = ccuttings,0 / Rtransport
(6.19)
Cuttings size must be determined from samples taken at the shale shaker or from historical default 
values, related to lithology. As a first approach assume a cuttings diameter from the upper quarter of 
the size distribution profile.
6.2	
Hole cleaning in medium inclined wells
A sub problem of directional drilling at depths where mud density is relatively high is barite segregation. 
When rmud > ~1.5 kg/l, the barite concentration is high. At still stand, most mud types quickly develop a 
yield point, and barite is suspended in the gelled mud. During pumping, at flow rates in laminar mode, 
any existing gel is broken, and barite will not be held in suspension as during still stand with gelled mud. 
However, the mud will under these conditions exhibit a high effective viscosity. Agglomeration may also 
effect the settling rate. Barite has a specific density of 4.2, and an average particle size of approximately 
20 mm. In accordance with Stokes’s law of settling, barite particles will settle, but as indicated above, very 
slowly. However, inclination will shorten the settling distance to only a few centimetres, and a stratified 
bed of barite and cuttings are formed. The stratified layers of solids of different densities will, when angle 
of repose is surpassed, slide downwards. Angle of repose is found mainly in the build-up section of the 
well, and here sliding takes place.

Transport of cuttings to the surface
The phenomena described above are called sagging. Sagging takes place even at periods when mud is at 
rest, e.g. during tripping operations. Sliding may occur at any time, independent of stirring movements 
of the mud. But the avalanching barite will create eddies and stir the still standing mud and hence 
break the yield point, and initiate settling of barite and cuttings. There may be other effects also which 
maintain the disturbance of the settling; agglomerating of solids will enhance settling. A continuous, 
dynamic effect of sustainable settling and sliding has a dramatic effect on the operation. When the mud 
pump is started after a round trip, to drill further, and after barite sagging has taken place in the critical 
inclined part of the well, the mud density of this mud, when circulated to surface, can vary as much as 
0.5 kg/l. This effect is shown in Figure 6-6, and can lead to kick, lost circulation and stuck drill string.

Best Practice to avoid Barite sagging
•	 Apply micro barite or equivalent. Such systems have an average particle size of 2 mm.
•	 Use top drive rigs to allow for pipe rotation and redistribution of settling barite and cuttings 
while tripping and drilling (also with downhole motor).
•	 Maximize fluid velocity during drilling and reaming by increasing pumping power and/or use 
large diameter drill string. This improves hydraulic and agitation of cuttings.
•	 Design mud rheology so that it enhances turbulence in the annulus (if ECD allows). Turbulent 
flow will bring the cuttings and barite back into the flow stream if max fluid velocity 
is insufficient.
•	 Use various hole cleaning monitoring techniques including monitoring of drilled cuttings 
retrieval rate, drilled cuttings physical appearance, pressure while drilling, comparison of 
pick-up weight and slack-off weight (drag resistance) etc.
•	 Perform frequent wiper trips.
•	 Design well path so that if critical angles (with respect to optimization of mechanical stability) 
are avoided.

Transport of cuttings to the surface
6.3	
Hole cleaning in highly inclined wells
The economic advantage of drilling directional wells is firmly established and for offshore operations 
only exploratory wells are vertical. The direction of cuttings settling is still vertical, but for inclined wells 
the fluid velocity has a reduced vertical component. This decreases the mud’s capability of suspending 
drilled cuttings, and it results in an increased tendency for particles to settle out of suspension, more 
so with increasing hole inclination. Once reached the borehole floor, the particle has little chance of re-
entering the fluid, because local fluid velocities near the wall are small and insufficient (no slip effect). 
Consequently, particle resident time in the annular space increases significantly, resulting in higher 
concentration of cuttings in the well bore, and, alas, cuttings beds are created. Because of the complexity, 
experimental knowledge is necessary for determination of cuttings movement.
The most common drilling problems related to insufficient hole cleaning occurs during tripping and 
reaming operation. Such problems manifest themselves as small and large restriction. However, when 
not cleared, the situation may worsen and end up in creating stuck pipe, lost circulation and serious 
hindrances during casing running. 
The main objective of cuttings transport predictions is to avoid such operational problems and to operate 
with the most optimum; safe and economical cuttings transport option. High flow rate will always remove 
cuttings. However, in narrow wells like 12¼˝ and smaller, high ECD will limit the flow rate.

Transport of cuttings to the surface
Mechanisms of particle transport in inclined wells are complex, and there are many mechanisms 
involved in transportation of cuttings. There are two main schools of modelling the complex system of 
cuttings transport:
1.	 Mechanistic models
2.	 Empirical models
6.3.1	
Mechanistic model
The mechanistic model explains the physics and defines all forces involved basing the analysis of the 
balance between hydraulic and mechanical forces for a given particle in the bed made up of solids. 
According to this model, two mechanisms are considered responsible for removing protruding cuttings; 
rolling and lifting. The forces required to activate a single cuttings particle determines also the mechanisms 
that dominate the process of removal. Figure 6-7 shows the forces involved in cutting transportation.

Of the five forces defined in Figure 6-7, friction forces are not included in cuttings transport. Friction 
is involved only during avalanching of cuttings bed, initiated when inclination is higher than the angle 
of repose.
Drag force. Drag can be estimated using the drag coefficient CDrag as follows:

where vx is the local relative velocity between the local fluid velocity and that at the center of the particle. 
When the particle is at stationary condition the drag force attains its maximum value.

The drag coefficient for slipping particles is presented in Figure 6-3. Also for stationary particles the 
drag coefficient is a function of shape (see Figure 6-9), size, fluid properties and surface roughness of 
the bed. An empirical correlation for spherical and smooth particles is:
CDrag = 24/NRe,p + 6 /(1 + NRe,p) + 0.4 

Lift force. Drag force is present in all types of flow around a solid particle. However, lift acting on a 
spherical particle is present only if there is asymmetry in the flow field, which is the case for velocity 
profiles in pipe flow due to no slip velocity at the wall. The lift force can be estimated through eqn. (6.23) 
when the lift coefficient is known:

Einstein found that the lift force acting on protruding particles in a sedimentary bed could be estimated 
by using a lift coefficient of 0.09 for bed particles. Another lift coefficient suggested for uneven horizontal

Here dvx/dr is the local velocity gradient or the shear rate.
Cohesive force. Cohesive force is a force of attraction between particles in the mud and the bed and is 
classified as:
--
Attraction forces without contact consist of van der Waals forces and electrostatic forces
--
Attraction forces with contact consist of viscous bridges or solid bridges
One way of estimating cohesive forces is based on the slip-line theory, the start of avalanche, and is given 
by eqn. (6.24) and illustrated in Figure 6-10:

Gravity will bring particles down onto the bed.
Critical velocity of lifting and rolling. When the annular mud velocity is high enough, cuttings in 
the particle bed will start to roll or to be lifted up to join the flowing mud. Generally, the annular mud 
flow velocity needs only to exceed a given critical value, known as the critical mud velocity, to reach 
the condition sufficient to initiate lifting/rolling of cuttings. For a given flow rate, the concept of critical 
velocity leads therefore to the existence of an equilibrium bed height. This height corresponds to the 
incipient condition of cuttings transportation. 
If we now consider a drilling fluid with some amount of cuttings at a given flow rate at sub-critical velocity, 
a cuttings bed will start to build. As it builds up, the mud velocity over the bed increases accordingly 
(assuming constant pump rate), until the mud velocity eventually reaches the critical value. At this 
condition, the bed height remains unchanged. If additional cuttings are deposited on the bed, the mud 
velocity in the neighbourhood of that region exceeds the critical velocity. Consequently, the flow will 
dislodge the cuttings from the surface of the bed. After these extra cuttings are moved downstream, the 
local equilibrium bed height is maintained.
A force balance for a single bed particle in the direction normal to the bed, will increase the local critical 
velocity sufficiently to lift the particles from the surface of the bed.

Transport of cuttings to the surface
The local critical velocity is the undisturbed velocity, i.e. the axial velocity acting above the cuttings bed 
at a point that corresponds to the protruding cuttings centre at the start of lifting.
The other mechanism involved in cuttings transportation is rolling. Rolling of the particles commence 
when the rolling torque resulting from the drag and lift force is able to overcome the counteracting 
torque from gravity and cohesion forces. Rolling can be obtained under this condition:

Usually, these two calculated values of local velocities are different. In such cases, the lower has to be 
taken to estimate the bed shear stress and the critical velocity. 
Estimation of two critical velocities has here been exemplified. However, a through presentation f this 
complex are where deeper knowledge of many interacting processes are necessary is not feasible in this book.
When the rolling torque exceeds the static torque of cohesive and gravity forces, the cuttings tend to 
roll along the bed. This is the most dominant and important transport mechanism in stratified solid 
liquid flow. The rolling torque increases with mud velocity. Rolling is somehow related to the formation 
of ripples. Ripples are formed when particles at a given point are rolled over the stationary part of the 
bed. The formation of ripple changes the drag and lift forces acting on the particles. Here we have to 
note that the random nature of lifting and rolling mechanisms originate from the stochastic behaviour 
of particle size, shape, density, rearrangement and the hydrodynamic forces of lift and drag. Therefore, it 
is ideal to assume a uniform process of cutting transportation over the bed and the formation of ripple 
has to be understood in this sense. Hence, we can say that during cutting transportation both erosion 
and deposition are simultaneously involved. Since only rolling and lifting are involved in this mechanistic 
model, no friction is involved. Dragging of a particle is less likely than rolling.
It is seen that when the inclination a becomes more than 90-F an increase in inclination well have 
appositive effect on the transportation process.
It can therefore be assumed that the most probable cause of restriction during tripping (up or down) is 
when the BHA is passing a washout in the wellbore as illustrated in Figure 6-11.
A1
A2
A1 = A2
Figure 6-11: Cuttings are being filled into a washout. After long periods of circulation during drilling, the hydrodynamic 
equilibrium will dictate a thicker bed inside the washout. When the BHA is shovelling a large quantity of cuttings into 
the normal part of the wellbore, the drill string will experience severe Overpull here.

Empirical model
When it comes to empirical transport models, particle transport can be classified with respect to cuttings 
bed behaviour as illustrated in Figure 6-12. The models are classified into two layer models or, three layer 
models. In the two and three layer models the modelling approach is based on mass, momentum and 
energy balance of each layer. And bed behaviour is to a large part determined by particle size:
1.	 Particles less than 40 m: Homogeneous suspension
2.	 Particles from 40 m to 150 m: Heterogeneous suspension maintained by turbulence
3.	 Particles between 150 m and 1500 m (1.5 mm): Increased rheology will lead to an increase of 
which sizes can be transported in a heterogeneous suspension
4.	 Particles larger than 2 500 m ttransported by saltation. Otherwise stationary bed.

Figure 6-12: Three flow patterns for cuttings transport in deviated wells.
According to Figure 6-12, decreased cutting size leads to increased shear area available to move the 
cutting along the wellbore. And increasing flow rate increases available energy for saltation and maintains 
turbulent cross flow. Higher viscosity reduces the slip velocity and increases the distance traversed 
during one cycle of saltation. Pipe rotation serves a dual purpose in horizontal hole cleaning. The pipe 
can mechanically crush cuttings to reduce cutting size; rig experience has shown that cutting size on 
the shale shaker is often smaller with pipe rotation. Pipe rotation tends to induce cross flow in laminar 
flow profiles. Tools, such as stabilizers, act to break up cutting beds.

Lag time in inclined wells. Experiments of cuttings transport in inclined wells, performed at U of Tulsa, 
it was found that the lag time is, as expected, much lower than in vertical wells. In fact, during pumping 
a moving bed was formed, and its velocity increased with increasing flow rate.

In average the bed velocity was 45% of the average mud velocity at all velocities (above critical moving – 
bed velocity). Simultaneous rotation increased the moving – bed velocity by typically 15% (bed height 
 SPE 109630).
In addition to the flow rate and many other parameters, cuttings transport is also highly dependent on 
string – RPM. We have not seen mathematical relationships on this yet; it is purely based on field and 
laboratory observations.

6.3.3	
Field observed transport mechanism 
Much of the observations are based on the work of K & M (2002). In Figure 6-13 the drill string will 
drag the drilling fluid along due to no-slip conditions at the fluid-drill string interface. The dragged along 
fluid is referred to as the viscous coupling, since the viscous fluid is dragging particles along.
.	
Figure 6-13: The drill string is lifting cuttings from the bed and into the main stream (the red ellipse).
K & M (2002) discovered through their investigations that the cuttings transport theory did not fit well 
with observations. This is described in Figure 6-14. Here it is shown that cuttings transport becomes 
efficient t first when a speed of 110–120 RPM has been reached. The explanation behind this behavior 
is presented in Figure 6-15. There are actually two effects taking place:
a)	 The drill string walk up the hole making the transport up-hill more efficient
b)	 The diameter of the viscous film, and thus the diameter of how far the cuttings will reach, will 
at some RPM become higher than the toll joint diameter

Transport of cuttings to the surface
After the particles have been brought up into the main stream, the particles will slowly drop out due 
to gravity, according to Stokes law. This is true since the flow is normally limited to laminar flow due 
to ECD requirements. A particle will typically move one stand in a horizontal wellbore, and longer in 
inclined ones. Wells are thus cleaned from the rear as indicated in Figure 6-16. The finest particles will be 
picked up first and will move quicker and longer. A sorting process is always involved. At a certain flow 
rate a stationary bed will be established during drilling. To clean better, the flow rate must be increased 
or the drilling rate decreased.

Figure 6-16: The behavior of cuttings entering the flow stream in horizontal wellbores.
In accordance with Figure 6-14 on could argue that flow rate and string-RPM belong together. Figure 6-17 
indicates this relationship. In horizontal wells the ideal flow velocity is typically 1 m/s while in vertical 
wells typically 0.2 m/s.

Another finding in the literature is the importance of the low-end rheology. The 3 and the 6 RPM 
rheological readings are especially important for cuttings transport in horizontal wells, as indicated in 
Figure 6-18.

Sweeps/bottoms up/backreaming
Drilling is easy, while backreaming is difficult. Once started the process cannot be stopped because only 
the rear is fully cleaned. At the surface the cuttings and debris comes in a wave as shown in Figure 8-19. 
After a difficult trip out, including reaming etc., the trip in is easy. The sweeps and backreaming operations 
cause the following problems:
•	 Higher viscosity and higher ECD
•	 Difficult to interpret the PWD
•	 Dunes are formed if the operation is not completed
•	 Difficult to trip-in

On the other hand it is necessary to clean the well before tripping and casing running as indicated in 
Figure 8-20. And the way to do it is to keep a steady, high flow rate and high string-RPM. In the old days 
a viscous sweep consisted of a high viscous pill, where the objective was to glue the particles together. 
Today the solution is as suggested above or to send in a low viscous pill to create local turbulence.

Equivalent Circulating Density (ECD) represents the total actual bottom hole pressure exerted on the 
formation being penetrated and is usually presented in terms of equivalent density. ECD is the sum 
of the static density, the additional density increment due to the weight of drill cuttings contained in 
the annulus and the effect of pressure drop along the annulus. ECD effects are shown graphically in 
Figure 7-1, a figure that will increase the understanding of the phenomenon.

Before discussing the pressure variation in a well, we need to introduce how to produce a specific mud density.
7.1	
Density control
There are two basic ways of increasing the density of water or oil; by adding weight material or salt.
Calcium carbonate: Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) is widely applied as weighting agents in non-damaging 
drilling fluids. Its main advantage comes from its ability to react and dissolve in hydrochloric acid. Hence 
any filter cake formed in productive zones can be easily removed and thereby enhancing production. 
It has a specific gravity of 2.60–2.80 which limits the maximum density of the mud to about 12.0 ppg. 
Calcium carbonate is readily available as ground limestone, marble or oyster shells.
Table 7-1 gives a list of the most common used weight material.

Barite: The mineral barite can appear as an insolvable sediment (evaporites) Barium Sulphate, BaSO4, with 
a specific density of typically 4.2 kg/l. The commercial product Barite is a fine powder with a medium 
particle size of 25 μm, but sieved to an upper particle size of 74 mm. Barite is insolvable in water and 
therefore said to be inert, unlike clay, polymer and salt, and carbonate which all react with water.
Salt: When salt is added to water, its density is altered, and volume conversion tables must be consulted. 
Brines can be formulated over a range of densities as shown in Figure 7-3.
Contain impurities like quartz, chert, calcite, and an hydrates while lower its density.

Mud density vs. temperature and pressure
Mud density is exposed to several effects:
•	 Increasing temperature, especially with increasing well depth 
•	 Increasing hydrostatic pressure with increasing well depth
•	 Formation gas will expand substantially when approaching the surface and lower mud density. 
But the effect is negligible further down in the well since gas here is highly compressed
These density effects are all small and can for practical purposes be ignored. Pressure and temperature 
effects will normally neutralize each other. 
Mud and especially OBM is very responsive to changes in pressure and temperature. This may affect 
the bottom hole pressure in cases whenever the two parameters change independently. Such situations 
do arise when the pump is shut off. Then a general increase in mud temperature will take place (more 
heating in lower part of the well than cooling in the upper part) leading to a decrease in the hydrostatic 
pressure. In static OBM columns, the complete heat transfer from the formation may take as much as 
a day. During tripping such slow density decrease combined with swabbing effects could cause kicks. 
Pressure testing or pressurizing the well during BOP tests or kick circulation cause compressible OBM 
to increase its density.

Keeping wellbore within maximum and 
minimum pressure; ECD-control
The following paragraph presents models for determining the effects of pressure and temperature on 
mud density.
Water and base oil (Clairsol) have been tested at a wide spectre of temperatures and pressures. The 
two fluids were curve fitted with respect to its individual dependency to temperature and pressure. The 
resulting linear curve fit to the measured data gave
ρw	
=

- 2.6 *10-3 T

2.5 *10-5 p
(7.11)
ρo	
=	
7.0	
- 3.0 *10-3 T	
 +	
4.4 *10-5 p
(7.12)
Here T is in ˚F, p in psi and ρ in PPG. When increasing viscosity and solids concentration the constants 
increase by up to 50%.
Oil based fluids are in general twice as compressible as water. The thermal expansion of OBM and WBM 
are less different. Another large difference between the two fluid types is the reaction time to temperature 
changes (due to difference in heat capacity); water reacts slower.
7.2.2	
Annular friction
There is a dispute on which of the following rheological models that best describe the fluid viscosity; 
Newtonian, Bingham, Power law or Herschel Buckley. For the purpose of ECD estimation, we suggest 
simplifying by selecting only one rheological model (the best fitted) and base the estimation of constants 
on the SI approach. This suggestion will increase accuracy. 
7.2.3	
Effect of cuttings
It is an almost impossible task to find the exact effect of cuttings on pressure. How is it possible to guess 
the amount of cuttings in suspension at any given time in an inclined wellbore? A rough guess is here 
suggested: We know how much cuttings is generated:
qcuttings = 
523
GELW 



S

(7.13)
Most of it will settle out from time to time, some of it will be re-injected into the mud stream due to 
the rotation of the drill pipe; some will be lifted by the lift fore created by the mud flow. But how much? 
The following assumptions will bring us closer to the truth:
Cuttings beds occupy typically around 2–6% of the cross sectional area in inclined wellbores. A rough 
assumption is therefore that 97% of the generated cuttings come out at different times, the rest is deposited. 
When more cuttings is deposited, the flow area becomes smaller, mud velocity increases and bed erosion 
increases. There will be an equilibrium bed height (at least locally) for a given pump flow rate.

The original cuttings concentration at the bottom is a function of the flow rate:
ccuttings,o = quttings / (qpump + quttings) |quttings / qpump
(7.14)
In the vertical section (I < 60o) the cuttings concentration increases due to slip, expressed through a 
Transport Ratio:
Rt = vtransport / vann = (vann – vslip)/ vann = 1 – vslip / vann
(7.15)
In the vertical section the average cuttings concentration becomes:
ccuttings,average = ccuttings from the horizontal section / Rt
(7.16)
And the slip velocity is estimated through Stokes law from Chapter 6:
vslip = dp
2  g (rp- rmud) / 6π meff  fcuttings
(7.17)
Eqn. (7.17) includes the effect of concentration of cuttings through the factor fcuttings. At high concentration 
there will be a hydraulic resistance to flow expressed in a satisfactory manner for our concentration 
range through eqn. (7.18):
fcuttings = 1-5 ccuttings,average

In the inclined section (I > 60o) we simplify and assume that the average concentration in the mud 
fluctuates around the initial concentration as shown in Figure 7-4.

If the proposed concentration function becomes too complex, it is better to forget it and rely only on 
measured ECD. However, if measured ECD is not available, then you have to model it.
After constructing an average cuttings concentration function, the effect on well pressure is found by 
assuming that the density of cuttings is 2.3 kg/l. This is a good assumption: At shallow depths, the local 
sediment density may be as low as 2.0 kg/l, due to low compaction and accordingly high porosity. At 
large depths (> 5000 mTVD) porosity approaches zero, at which the matrix density is 2.8 kg/l for most 
sedimentary rocks.
Additional ECD effect in the vertical part of the well then becomes:

Surge & swab
When the drill string is hoisted up or lowered down, mud will flow in the annular space, as indicated 
in Figure 7-5, flow that results in pressure loss. Before applying pressure loss formulas developed in the 
previous sub chapter, the resulting flow rate needs to be determined.
Pipe velocity, vpipe, is the same as the speed of the travelling block with closed pipe-end. The resulting 
annular volume rate becomes in downward motion pr. tim

As indicated in Figure 7-5, the flow volume down is different from the removed volume, and must be 
adjusted. For this purpose we make simplifying assumptions. 
1.	 Closed pipe end: Assume the drill string is closed at the bottom. Displaced volume when 
running-in-hole (RIH) becomes larger than the theoretical one.
2.	 Clinging factor: The no-slip conditions on the pipe surface will cause some of the mud to 
cling to the drill string and move along with it as indicated in Figure 7-5. The effective pipe 
diameter increases.
The first task is to derive the velocity profile. For that purpose we assume Newtonian fluid later we 
introduces the ߤ௘௙௙

Common drilling practice to avoid swabbing is:
•	 Make connection higher up to avoid pulling out 1 m, or pump when pulling up into/out of slips
•	 Pump while POOH in suspicious wellbores

Other effects
Effect of rotation: It is known that drill string rotation may have a significant impact on pressure drops 
in the annulus during fluid transport. During laminar flow, pipe rotation will induce an additional shear 
velocity component. And since drilling fluid is normally shear thinning, pipe rotation will increase total 
shear, reduce viscosity and thereby reduce the pressure drop.
If we solve for the rotational component in addition to the axial we may include the main features of 
these effects in a fundamental way. The transport equation for the rotational velocity for steady-state 
flow becomes:

Keeping wellbore within maximum and 
minimum pressure; ECD-control
The consequence of the solution of eqn (7.24) is that the effective strain rate (see Chapter 3) is increased 
and the effective viscosities are reduced. Hence, rotation will reduce the axial pressure drops. However, 
for laminar developed flows of Newtonian liquids, such effects do not exist, since viscosity is independent 
of shear rate.
Experience indicates that in real drilling operations the opposite often takes place; pump pressure 
increases with increasing pipe rotation. One explanation for this is the development of instabilities. A 
number of vortices develop in the radial-axial plane. Hence, rotation leads to axial-radial mixing which 
will have the same effect on momentum transport as turbulent mixing. Turbulent flow is shear thickening. 
Effect of acceleration: Acceleration is experienced during tripping operations during pump rate 
manipulation, and also when a gas kick reaches the surface where expansion accelerates. High acceleration 
of the pipe should be avoided in critical situation, because of the acceleration pressure it creates in the 
corresponding fluid mass. Acceleration pressure caused by accelerating pipes, apipe, is estimated from 
eqn. (7.25). Figure 7-5 indicates the importance of the effect of cross sectional area. The clinging effect 
is not included in eqn. (7.25).

Its magnitude is exemplified through the running of a 133/8˝ casing into a 171/2˝ hole. Let the pipe, at the

Effect of gelling: One more effect caused by pipe movement or pump start needs to be considered as 
a part of the ECD: Most mud types are time dependent and tend to build up a gelled structure when 
quiescent. By moving the drill sting axially, extra pressure is needed to break the gel that has formed on 
the pipe surface. The surface shear stress relates to pressure:

It becomes much worse if the mud pump is used to break the gel. Then it must be broken first inside 
the drill string and then in the annulus along two surfaces; one surface is the drill string and the other 
is the wellbore. A 1000 m long 5˝ × 4.27˝ drill pipe (= 0.127 m × 0.108 m) has been at rest in a 12½˝ 
(0.216 m) wellbore. The 10 minute gel strength = 50 lb/100 ft2 = 50 · 0.4788 = 23.94 Pa. From eqn (7.26) 
we obtain: Dpgel = 19.6 ·105 Pa. This answer assumes that the fluid is completely incompressible and that 
the shear stress is broken simultaneously over the whole length.

Keeping wellbore within maximum and

However, in practice the drilling fluid is compressible, and compression and the resulting deformation of 
the long mud column would break the gel over a much shorter distance than the complete well length. 
Compressing a mud volume of 1000 l by one bar would compress it typically 0.1 liters. Such a small 
shrinkage would result in a deformation sufficiently large to break the gel locally. The effective length 
over which the gel is breaking simultaneously is shorter the higher the initial pressure. The gel breaking 
pressure is probably small and hidden in the acceleration pressure. Another effective method to break 
the gel structure in the annulus is simply to rotate the drill string.
The same reasoning must be applied when figuring out how high the drill string must be hoisted ∆h 
before gravity force overcomes the gelled shear stress inside the drill string. Theory would show a high 
value, in accordance with eqn. (7.27), where L is length of well:

Temperature variation
7.3.1	
Ocean and wellbore temperature profile
In order to estimate factors such as expansion of drilling fluids, change of fluid viscosity or variation 
in other fluid properties as a function of temperature, we need a model of the temperature variation 
in the well. A steady-state analytical model for computing circulating mud temperature profiles has 
been suggested through the API-model, a model that has gained general acceptance by the industry. 
Nevertheless, the model is not good enough for deep-water wells. The main reason is the cooling effect 
in the riser section in deep water wells as indicated in Figure 7-6.

expresses radially conducted heat from the material in contact with the fluid. The minus signs indicate 
positive flow towards a negative temperature gradient. In pipe flow both convection and conduction is 
involved in heat exchange on the interface between the pipe and the fluid. Our engineering task is now 
to find a heat transfer coefficient that is acceptable for both type of heat transfer

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Mathematical model of pressure surge & swab
Mathematical models give more precise statements of the nature than models formulated in words, and 
they make quantitative predictions (simulations) possible. Mathematical models can be used to describe, 
to explain and to interpret physical systems. Mathematical modeling is an art and the skill must be 
developed through persistent attempts of learning-by-doing. A stepwise approach follows, based on 
the work of Basmadjian (2003). We will exemplify the approach on the problem of surge/swab during 
drilling operations.
In most wells the magnitude of pressure surges is not critical because proper casing design and mud 
programs leave large enough margins between the fracture pressure and the formation fluid pore pressure. 
A certain fraction of wells, however, cannot be designed with large surge-pressure margins. In these 
critical wells, pressure surges, especially while running of low-clearance liners in deep wells, must be 
maintained within narrow limits.
Different approaches to surge and swab pressure are presented in the literature. Three approaches of how 
to treat the friction loss caused by the resulting flow are exemplified below:
1.	 Analytic approach for laminar flow regime, including the effect of fluid cling to the moving 
drill string
2.	 Standard hydraulic friction models
3.	 Advanced approach taking elasticity of fluid and steel pipe into consideration
Approach 1 is the selected method which will be presented here. Approach 3 will be discussed in step 2 
in conjunction with boundary conditions and simplifying limitations. In method 2, which is the most 
straight forward approach, the standard friction factor we already known. It is based on the Darcy-
Weisbak equation:
∆psurge . 0.5 ∆D/∆L = 4fm . 0.5ρvDS
2
(7-39)
Pressure loss in the gap geometry, 0.5 ∆D over the length dl is studied experimentally, and the friction 
factor is adjusted on basis of measured pressure loss during surge/swab tests.
But now to the analytical approach.

Step 1. Understand the underlying physical system.
The major factors contributing to swab and surge pressures in a wellbore are usually the frictional 
pressure drop resulting from flow of drilling fluid. The equation of laminar, steady-state flow in an 
annular geometry is applied. Only laminar flow of Power Law fluids is considered. The flow is caused 
by the axial movement of an inner, concentric pipe, which has a closed end. Pipe movement is causing 
displacement of fluid as indicated in Figure 7-9. Due to no-slip conditions along the pipe wall, part of 
the fluid is accompanying the downward pipe movement. Fluid is being dragged along by the pipe.

Relative parameters are seen to the left of the pipe.
Step 1. Understand the underlying physical system.
Step 2. In order to reduce the complexity, apply as many as possible of all simplifying assumptions.
In Figure 7-9 many simplifying assumptions have already been introduced. They are included in the 
extensive list below:
•	 Concentric inner pipe
•	 Smooth cylinders define annular wall and pipe wall
•	 Closed end pipe. With open pipe an iterative process is needed aiming at satisfying the 
requirement: ∆pinside DP = ∆pann. A float valve or flapper valve assure no-flow through the pipe 
during surge movements.
•	 Swab/surge pressure are significantly reduced due to eccentricity, up to around 40% for 
certain geometries
•	 A clinging factor is often either ignored or just assumed, typically 0.5 (the clinging volume 
exhibits up to 50% of the downward flowing volume, depending on relative slot size). In our 
model it is not ignored
•	 Steady-state process. No fluid acceleration or compressibility is included
•	 Simplified rheology (only Newtonian and Power law fluids are included)

•	 Fluids are both elastic and compressible. A negative pressure surge is often observed at the 
surface when the downward movement of the drill string is brought to rest. At the bottom the 
pressure is increased. This is a water hammer affect
•	 Both pipe elasticity and fluid viscous force are participating in determining pipe displacement 
during tripping, as well as formation and cement elasticity. They all influence pressure surge. 
These issues are discussed by Mitchell (1988).
Balance of mass includes three effects.

All three equations require one for the inside of the drill string and one for annular conditions.

Step 1. Understand the underlying physical system.
Step 2. In order to reduce the complexity, apply as many as possible of all simplifying assumptions.
Step 3. Start with the simplest possible system. Make a sketch. Which forces must be incorporated? 
Insert possible variables, how they attack, and their desired result.
In the most simplified evaluation of surge/swab pressure we assume steady-state flow. The geometry is 
defined in Figure 7-9. Only two forces are involved; frictional pressure pr. length unit and shear forces 
over the same length.
Step 4. List the laws that govern the system’s processes and draw an envelope with ingoing and 
exiting quantities
This problem is relatively simple. In Figure 7-11 the envelope is presented. We have already determined 
that only two forces define the system. At steady state they are in equilibrium with each other:

For laminar flow it is possible to make a purely analytical solution. Alternatives are finite element and 
other numerical methods, or empirical solutions. In present case it seems rather straight forward. We

We have now reached the end of the derivation. Further it can be worked out the exact solutions of the 
integrals in eqns. (7-59) and (7-60), but only for three integers of 1/n; n = 1, n = ½, n = ⅓.
Equivalent Clinging Constant: It has become customary to represent flow of this nature in terms of a 
clinging constant, which describes the apparent contribution of pipe velocity towards pressure drop. The 
clinging constant may be expressed as:
Kc = qcling / qtot
(7-62)
where qcling is the flow rate corresponding to the clinging part in Figure 1. qcling may be obtained by 
rearranging and solving equations (20). It must then be integrated from r = RDS to Rcling. Here v(r) = 0. 
When an acceptable simple system, like the one above, has been defined, a more complex system is a 
natural follow-up.

Keeping the wellbore stable
8	 Keeping the wellbore stable
Many of the problems are related to wellbore stability. It is therefore valuable to first present an overview 
of wellbore stability, mechanical and chemical, as an introduction.
8.1	
Introduction
After drilling a hole in the formation, the previous balance between the rock strength and the in-situ 
stresses is disturbed, and likewise, the equilibrium between pore fluid and the sediments will be affected. 
Wellbore instability problems take many forms, and the most frequent ones are pointed out in Figure 8-1.
Breakout, weakened 
formation and washout
Fracture, balooning
Creeping (slow 
plastic flow)
Sloughing, elevated localized 
pressure, spalling, caving
Figure 8-1: Possible wellbore instability problem during drilling.
Wellbore instability is experienced mainly in shale sections, induced by either high stress concentration 
or physical-chemical interactions of the drilling fluid with the shale, or a combination of both;
1.	  Mechanical stress-induced wellbore stability 
2.	 Chemical related instability
a)	 Time-dependent water interaction with shale
b)	 Time dependent water interaction with chalk, limestone, anhydrite, gypsum etc.

Keeping the wellbore stable
Mechanical related stability problems are, besides minor erosion from turbulent flow and drill string 
interaction with the wall, governed by wellbore stresses. It is related to the tangential stress, radial stress 
and vertical stress. The tangential and radial stresses are governed by mud pressure while vertical stress 
is created by the overburden. The overburden results in vertical compression/deformation, which create 
compressional stresses in the horizontal direction. Mechanical wellbore instability is a topic covered in 
courses of rock physics. In this book, mechanical wellbore instability will merely be pointed at, since 
it is inter-related to its chemical counterpart; water interaction with the sediments will have a negative 
influence on mechanical stability. 
Chemical stability of the wellbore is related to water and its complex interaction with shale. The time 
dependency is related to the time it takes for water to be transported into the shale. 
Reaction with chalk/limestone/anhydrite is related to dissolution of dissolvable material. Chalk, limestone 
and salt are all ionic compounds. Dissolution of them can lead to several problems:
--
Flocculation of the colloidal phase of drilling fluid like clay or polymers lead to increasing 
viscosity, while aggregation of clay after ion-exchange leads to decreased viscosity
--
High solids content (disintegration of weakened cuttings)
--
Hole enlargement (washout of weakened wall)

Keeping the wellbore stable
8.2	
Mechanical stability
Shear and tensile failure mechanisms are the two largest concerns that can lead to mechanical instability 
when drilling in shale. These problems are time-consuming and expensive to fix, especially offshore where 
rig costs are high. In the worst case, mechanical borehole instabilities can annihilate both the drilling rig 
and its personnel. Despite great efforts to reduce borehole instabilities, they remain a serious concern. 
Mechanical instability can be classified into two groups;
--
Stress related instability
οο Mobile formations or Plastic formations or Creep: Wellbores that stays open for a long 
time (weeks), exhibiting a slow “flow”, tending to close the wellbore. It is especially 
claystone and Halite (NaCl) which deform under stress. The Halite in the Zechstein Fm 
in the southern North Sea is found under the Sulphates and the Carbonates: Anhydrite 
on the other hand, is strong and immobile.
οο Tensile failure occurs at too high 
PXG
U
: Fractures are detected at the surface as lost 
circulation. The losses will evolve with increasing mud pressure from minor losses to 
total loss. 
οο Compression failure occur at too low MW: The compressed and crushed wellbore wall 
will evolve with decreasing pressure from cavings, breakouts to total wellbore collapse.
--
Weakness in the formation
οο Faults and stress zones crossing the wellbore. Pre-existing fracture and cracks especially 
observed in limestone, chalk and in brittle shale.
οο Inter-bedded formations (between lithology changes, bedding angle close to wellbore 
angle, anisotropy, heterogeneity, and strength anisotropy).
οο Naturally weak formations (coal beds, conglomerate).
οο Unconsolidated formation (loose sand, gravel, silt).
To evaluate these types of instabilities we are dependent on information that can indicates what type of 
weakness has been encountered. Weakness in the formation, like sand and gravel often lack cementation 
material and are referred to as an unconsolidated formation, a problem that occurs mainly at shallow 
depths. The problem with unconsolidated formations is that they cannot be supported by hydrostatic 
overbalance from the drilling fluid alone. For example, unconsolidated sand and pea gravel often fall into 
the hole and pack off around the drill string. Problems also occur if insufficient filter cake is deposited on 
loose, unconsolidated sand to prevent it from “flowing” into the wellbore and packing off the hole. Solids-
control equipment will be overloaded with large quantities of solids that do not correspond to the rate 
of penetration.

Keeping the wellbore stable
To drill such weak formations, the mud should provide a good-quality filter cake to help consolidate the 
formation so that hydrostatic pressure can “push against” and stabilize the annular wall. It is important 
to control the filtrate loss of the mud so that the water will not destabilize the formation. To minimize 
erosion, avoid any unnecessary reaming or turbulent flow opposite unconsolidated formations.
When drilling deeper one have to consider three types of mechanical stress:
1.	 In-situ vertical (overburden) and resulting horizontal stresses
2.	 Pore pressure (resulting from previous geological and resent chemical processes)
3.	 Forces acting at inter granular contact or at cementation points; cohesive force
In Figure 8-2 a model of all there forces are presented.
Figure 8-2: Forces acting within shale, depicting a single set of clay platelets connected to a pore 
(van Oort, 1997).
In Figure 8-3 the three types of forces are repeated (from earlier chapters). It is the shear force which 
governs when the rock will fail. As shown in Figure 8-3 this may happen when the cohesive strength 
decreases, the pore pressure increases, or when the shear angel decreases. A change in the pore pressure is 
controlled the pore water flow (discussed in next chapter). If a shale yields, its permeability will increase, 
and water will flow easier; a self-accelerating process.

Keeping the wellbore stable
Stress related instability is related to the rock strength, weak bedding plane, pore pressure and the 
hydrostatic pressure in the wellbore. It is also related to extraordinary in-situ stresses in the formation; 
historical tectonic activity in the area. Normally stressed basins are characterized by stresses in the 
vertical direction being the largest one. But under tectonic stress regime, stress orientation is valuable 
information to evaluate failure direction. Too high wellbore pressure leads to fracture at the casing shoe, 
since the weakest point in the formation is located here.
By lowering the formation pressure below its collapse pressure, the formation will experience shear failure 
in the borehole wall resulting from high tangential stress. In older consolidated clay, which is hard and 
brittle, the wall will splinter under compressional stress and cave or slump into the hole. This leads to 
hole enlargement and possibly bridging when combined with inadequate hole cleaning. As the wellbore 
pressure drops further below the collapse pressure during the final stages of a gas blowout, the well will 
collapse and become packed with crushed wall material, and the blowout will eventually come to a stop. 
Instability caused by high tangential stresses around the wellbore while drilling is a function of formations 
pressures /stresses and the geometry of the wellbore and its beds. This can be expressed through a linear 
and plane strain failure criterion, like Mohr-Coulomb’s.

During the initial stage of collapse, the cavings eventually arriving at the shale shaker can indicate what 
is causing the problem. The information that potentially can be gained from cavings is pointed out in 
Figure 8-4:

Chemical stability
Shale makes up for more than 75% of the drilled formations, and more than 70% of the borehole problems 
are caused by shale instability (including mechanical related). Shale properties range from very soft to 
hard, and from very laminated to very compact. Shale destabilize when drilling fluid penetrate existing 
fissures, fractures and weak bedding planes. In addition to shale fluid interaction, fluid invasion will also 
alter the pore pressure or effective stress state. 
The term shale is used for an entire class of fine-grained sedimentary rocks that contain substantial 
amounts of clay minerals. The amount and type of clay content determine the shale’s affinity for water. 
The Smectite shale type called Montmorilonite reacts strongly with water for one main reason; shale 
contains negatively charged clay minerals, and polar water is attracted to the mineral. Shale containing 
Smectite has a greater affinity for water than shale containing Illite, Mica, Chlorite, Zeonites or Kaolinite.
Drilling overbalanced through shale formations with WBM allows drilling-fluid pressure to penetrate the 
formation. Because of the saturation and low permeability of the formation, the penetration of a small 
volume of mud filtrate into the formation causes a considerable increase in pore-fluid pressure near the 
wellbore wall. The increase in pore-fluid pressure may break the cohesive bonds in shale. According to 
Moody and Hale (1993), there are three important chemical factors that affect wellbore stability.
•	 Relative salinity of the drilling mud in relation to the formation pore fluid. This is expressed 
as the water activity Aw which is inversely proportional to salinity.
•	 Change in pore pressure is limited by the membrane efficiency, which describes how easily 
ions can pass from the drilling mud into the formation.
•	 Ion exchange capacity of the shale is important as the replacement of cations such as K+, 
Mg++, Ca++ and Na+, in that order, weakens the shale.

Keeping the wellbore stable
There are three chemical forces in general
•	 van der Waal forces between clay platelets
•	 Electrostatic repulsive forces between clay platelets 
•	 Forces (repulsive/attractive) resulting from hydration/solvation of clay surfaces from ions 
present in interlayer spacing (adsorbed or free)
Latter two forces are usually lumped together to form the hydration or swelling pressure. To better 
understand the topic of chemical stability we introduce two related processes:
•	 Water transport
•	 Swelling pressure
8.3.1	
Transport mechanisms
In Table 8-1 the type of transport and its driving forces are introduced, several of them are discussed 
in detail by Hale at al. (1993).
Flowing material
∆p/∆l 
∆(chem.pot)/Dl 
Water
Convection (direct transmission) 
Osmoses 
Solution/ions 
Advection (indirect transmission) 
Diffusion 
Table 8-1: Four types of driving forces leading to two types of material flow.
The four driving forces are: 
1.	 Convection or Hydraulic pressure: During overbalanced drilling, flow of water into the 
formation is governed by Darcy’s law.
2.	 Advective pressure diffusion:
3.	 Osmotic pressure: Water is transferred from regions of low salinity to regions of high salinity 
to reach equal concentration. The activity of the pore water, Aw,pore, must be equal to that of 
the mud, Aw,mud, achieved through adding the correct amount and type of electrolytes (salt).
4.	 Chemical diffusion: Transfer of specific ions from regions of high concentration to regions of 
low concentration (the opposite of osmotic flow direction).

The resulting flow from the four driving forces can be expressed mathematically. The four most useful 
equations are:
1.	 Convection flow of water driven by hydraulic pressure: 
	
dV/dt = kA/μf . dp/dr
(8.1)
2.	 Advective pressure diffusion ahead of the water front:
	
dp/dt = k/(μf . Øeff) [ d2p/dr2 + 1/r . dp/dr] 
(8.2) 
	
	
Øeff = Ø + 1/bl . (βfm – βgrain (Ø))
(8.3)
3.	 Diffusion (Fick’s law): 
	
dc/dt = D [ d2c/dr2 + 1/r . dc/dr
(8.4)
Diffusion of ions moves in the opposite direction of water flow

4.	 Osmotic pressure: Activity of pore water, Aw, is proportional to the vapor pressure, and is 
controlled through salt concentration: 
	
pswell = RT/V  ln (pvapor,mud / pvapor,fm)
(8.5)
In chemically inactive material the Capillary pressure will dominate and take the place of the 
convective induced flow. Capillary pressure is expressed through: Only OBM can change the 
capillary pressure sufficiently to avoid this type of water entrance. Usually, in shale capillary 
threshold pressure is very high due to very small pore throat.
	
pc = 2 σc  cos θ / r 
(8.6)
In the following paragraphs the transport of materials through shale has been exemplified and illustrated 
by van Oort (2010).
Assuming 
•	 Drilling at high hydraulic overbalance (mechanical stability is taken care of).
•	 Drilling fluid ion concentration > pore fluid ion concentration, but just slightly, sufficient for 
diffusion of ions to take place. 
•	 Assume no coupled flow between the different driving forces.
How will the 3 processes (water content, pore pressure and swelling pressure) look like after some time?
Van Oort (2010) applied the flow-equations at an engineering level. Pressure penetration and ion diffusion 
in shale, obtained by applying expanded solution of the three transport equations and material constants 
for typical shale (kshale = 10-21 m2). The governing equations predicted the development of three fronts 
around a wellbore in shale vs. time as presented in Figure 8-5.
Figure 8-5: Extention of three different material fronts flowing into the wellbore wall while 
drilling in overbalance and with balanced salt contetration (van Oort, 1997).
The estimation revealed that pressure would precede ion-diffusion at 1-2 order of magnitudes higher. 
Shale is so tight it cannot dissipate water fast enough.

Swelling of shale
Swelling is a complex process and osmotic swelling is a too simplistic model. Results from a laboratory 
experiment are presented in Figure 8-6. Here swelling pressure in Na-Montmorillonite as a function of 
interplatelet distance was studied. Stable states are indicated by arrows in Figure 8-6 and are characterized 
by odd numbers of water layers. Density distribution of water- oxygen is a function of the distance from 
the sheet surface. Results are shown for the stable states of 4 different spacing. Osmosis is a powerful 
force and can be compared to congelifraction.
Figure 8-a: Swelling pressure vs. interplatlet distance (left), and number of water molecular layers vs. interplatelet 
distance (right), obtained through Atomic Adsorption Scanning (van Oort, 1997).
Since osmotic pressure is being the most important one in clay, some more details are appropriate: 
Argillaceous rocks experience significant swelling, alteration, and degradation by adsorption of polar 
molecules (such as water) or ions (such as Na+) onto weakly charged clay sites. Water is attracted to 
the surface of the mineral but also enters the opening between unit layers and may cause the distance 
between them to increase, a phenomenon called swelling. Swelling pressure can be predicted through 
the knowledge of the water activity in the shale and basic thermodynamic relationships. Swelling stress 
can be predicted by equation 8.7:

New swelling tests were performed on shale containing 65% Montmorillonite. The swelling index does 
not go to zero, i.e. there is always residual swelling as seen in Figure 8-7.
Figure 8-7: Swelling vs. fluid salinity (van Oort, 1997).
KCl minimizes swelling due to small degree of hydration of K+. But it is more complex: At high c, 
swelling increases again. K+ replaces less inhibitive ions. Also anions are introduced in the interplatal 
spacing. In the field K+ never occur at such high concentration alone. This cation exchange effect takes 
place slowly (diffusion is slow). pswell can never reach zero. However, swelling (expansion) can be zero 
due to cementation bonds. Potassium is generally regarded as the most effective in making the clays 
less hydratable. And the geometry of Potassium ions is well suited for entering the space between 
Montmorillonite unit layers as indicated by Table 8-2.

Inhibitive muds
In the drilling fluids service industry the term “inhibition” has come to mean the suppression of hydration 
of clay, which means inhibit the water to transform the shale into swelled, soft, sticky shale, while her 
ewe mean the inhibition of swelling pressure. After this knowledge it is acceptable to define inhibition 
as Reduction of swelling pressure
Before tending to inhibitive muds we would like to introduce some basic issues concerning swelling 
pressure and hydraulic pressure
Swelling pressure vs. hydraulic pressure: Inhibitors cannot prevent pore pressure increase induced shale 
problems because the inhibitors (in the diffusion front) will always lag behind the pressure front. Swelling 
pressure can therefore not be reduced down to zero. An effective tensile force is remaining supporting 
the shale. When the net tensile forces overcome the shale’s tensile strength (low in shale), yielding will 
occur at the weakest sites, which will trigger subsequent full-scale failure. Pressure fluctuations (from 
S&S) will change hydraulic support, and may deliver the «final blow» to already weakened shale. 
This time-lag in inhibitor transport is regarded as the main reason behind inhibitors shortcomings as 
shale-stabilizers. When inhibitors are arriving together with water they may lead to very small to low 
pswell (as opposed to large pswell if no inhibitor was present).

Keeping the wellbore stable
Under these circumstances something more than inhibition is needed. The answer is: Prevent water flow 
to suppress pressure penetration. This is how to achieve it:
0.	 Apply radial support through proper MW (prerequisite)
1.	 Maintain support by reducing filtrate invasion
2.	 Use inhibitive mud 
Pressure inside the cuttings: Cuttings are exposed to the same mechanisms as the wellbore, except that 
•	 Geometry and stress condition are different
•	 Timing is different. Exposure is typically only 1 hour 
In Figure 8-8 the forces action on a shale cuttings is presented. 
Figure 8-8: In-situ stresses are suddenly relieved and replaced by mud pressure (phydr) when 
cuttings are generated (van Oort, 1997).
The resulting radial forces can be expressed as:
σr = phydr – ppore – pswell
(8.8)
and will be in tension if phydr < ppore + pswell and disintegrate if pcohesion is overcome 
The following will take place:
1.	 phydr will lead to slow invasion and equalize ppore, but normally not within 1 h
2.	 A bigger problem is the phydr reduction as cuttings are transported up the wellbore, combined 
with slow increase of pswell, probably the most detrimental effect

Counter measures:
1.	 Encapsulation 
2.	 Shut off water by enhancing viscosity of filtrate 
3.	 Use inhibitive mud (see later)
Inhibitive muds can be grouped into three types. We will now compare their pressure transmission-ability 
through shale, and present the most common representative mud for each mud type.
8.4.1	
Conventional inhibitive WBM: KCl/PHPA
Reducing pswell in Smectite clay – young reactive gumbo type shale. KCl exhibits the highest inhibitive 
effect of all salts. This is indicated in Table 8-2 above.
Cations exchange place with Na+ ions. But have some shortcomings:
1.	 No filtrate prevention due to low base fluid viscosity, as shown in Figure 8-9.
2.	 Only moderate osmotic pressure due to low membrane effect (1–2%) due to high mobility of 
KCl in shale  unsuitable in older, less reactive shale like Illite and Kaolinite. These shale types 
contain too low pswell –potential for KCl to act upon. The older shale types will fail due to mud 
pressure penetration at prolonged exposure caused by KCl filtrate invasion.
Figure 8-9: Shale’s ability to transmit pressure in the base fluid of conventional inhibitive WBM (van Oort, 1997).
Polymers, like PHPA, with functional groups of positive polarity absorbs onto clay surfaces at multiple 
sites  they are more difficult to exchange/remove. Good inhibitors when low-molecular (< 10 000); 
penetrate pores of the shale. High molecular polymers, like PHPA, latches on to the outer surface of 
shale in a web-like pattern and combat disintegration of shale. Pore blocking is minimal as shown in 
Figure 8-10. Ideal additive for cuttings stabilization.

Figure 8-10: Shale’s ability to transmit pressure in conventional mud (van Oort, 1997).
Figure 8-11 shows changes relative to the properties in the native shale and to non-inhibitive WBM. It 
shows that pore pressure will be enhanced in all three invasion zones, but the water content and swelling 
pressure is reduced. However, both ingredients (KCl + PHPA) fall short when older, less reactive shale 
are drilled.

Osmotic WBM: CaCl2 + methyl-glucose 
CaCl2, CaBr2 are highly soluble  high density. Their ad- and disadvantages are:
•	 High osmotic pressure (but due to low membrane efficiency (1–10%) the osmotic pressure is 
limited to 1/10 – 1/100), can be applied to partially offset the hydraulic overbalance 
•	 High filtrate viscosity 
•	 Leaky membrane  ion diffusion into shale, against the back-flowing water  Na+ 
exchange K+  pswell will again increase 
Poly-glycerol and – glycols are saccharides of low molecular size (< 10 000). They viscosify the filtrate / 
build an internal filter and retard filtrate invasion as shown in Figure 8-12.
Figure 8-12: Shale’s ability to transmit pressure in a sucrose solution.
Resulting mud type behavior is shown in Figure 8-13. We see that the water content and the pore 
pressure are expected to be reduced. But swelling pressure is elevated in the filtrate- and the SI-zone 
due to unfavorable exchange of cations (Na+).

Figure 8-13: Estimated behavior of shale in an osmotic WBM and interpreted wellbore behavior (right)  
(free after van Oort, 1997).
WBM allow water and thereby well pressure to penetrate into wellbore shale. Near wellbore pressure 
increases and thereby reducing the true overbalance. Without it, shear failure may occur. A perfect 
drilling fluid should create a high-osmotic-efficient membrane.
Although shale is almost impermeable, the osmotic flow is determined by chemical potential or water 
activity Aw in the mud and in the pore water. Aw is a measure of water’s salinity 
Aw, distilled water	
 = 1.00
Aw, saturated NaCl	
 = 0.755
Aw, saturated CaCl2	
 = 0.295
When Aw = 1, the water has the highest possible potential.
It is the difference in salinity that causes osmotic water flow, ΔAw = chemical potential. When ΔAw = 0 
between pore water and mud, there will be no osmotic flow of water, hence no swelling and accordingly 
no problems during drilling. Whenever there is a difference in Aw between clay and mud, the swelling 
pressure is defined as:

Salt water muds are able to restrain the flow of water from the mud to the shale. This is accomplishing 
by decreasing the concentration of free water molecules in the drilling fluid. In salt water muds, large 
quantities of NaCl or KCl are added to the mud system, and the water activity is largely reduced. When 
Aw, clay = Aw, mud, the formation will become stable. It has later become evident that also salt type must 
match pore water salt type to completely eliminate swelling. For limestone and salt formations this 
theory holds true. 
Below follows a method of how to determine Aw, pore. We will use eqn. (8.10) to determine pswell.

Typical WBM have activities between 0.85 and 0.95. Typical shale in places like the Gulf of Mexico have 
pore fluid activities between 0.75 and 0.85, based on extrapolations from laboratory measurements. 
Hence, the use of typical muds in typical sales is expected to cause an increase in the pore pressure within 
the shale, leading to shale swelling, weakening, and the development of washouts. Membrane efficiency 
describes shale affinity to WBM and OBM. The membrane efficiency is affected by the mud chemistry, 
solute concentrations and other properties; oil- based mud has nearly perfect efficiency, whereas water-
based mud generally has very low efficiency. Thus, oil-based mud is good for drilling in shale to mitigate 
swelling or contraction problems due to its perfect membrane efficiency, but it can be very expensive to 
implement or precluded by regulatory restriction. 
When exposed to pure water, eqn. (8.9) or (8.10) suggests that tremendous swelling pressures can be 
developed in relatively saline shale. Rupture tests have shown that shale sections exposed to water in a 
borehole can fracture if critical stress conditions exist. 
8.4.3	
Type 3: Non invading WBM/OBM 
For both of the non-invading fluids water is hindered to flow into the shale, but hindered by two different 
techniques. The WBM, shown in Figure 8-16, is applying filter building techniques. Either poly-glycols 
or silicates will hinder filtrate influx. The OBM, shown in Figure 8-17, create a high negative capillary 
entry pressure. Both mud types constitute a highly efficient osmotic membrane. Osmotic membrane 
hinders hydraulic flow of water, ions and particles, but not osmotic transfer of water.

The resulting evaluation of the two fluids of non-invading character, one with balanced water activity 
(will lead to no change in the shale) and one with lower water activity (will lead to no change in the 
shale) is presented in Figure 8-18.

Figure 8-18: Estimated behaviour of shale in non-penetrating inhibitive muds with balanced water activity (upper 
left) and lower water activity (upper right). The lower water activity results in the invasion shown at the bottom 
(free after van Oort, 1997).
In the paragraphs below we would like to present some further knowledge about oil based mud. In spite 
of the environmental related restrictions there are still many occasions when oil based mud of some 
kind is necessary. As yet, water based muds do not provide the levels of shale inhibition and lubrication 
offered by oil based muds. The viability of many offshore field developments depends on the ability to 
drill wells from a single central platform, with high lateral displacement. For many such wells, oil based 
muds are viewed as the only effective mud types to allow the targets to be safely and economically reached.

Oil based mud consists of these components:
1.	 Base oil	
	
- the continuous phase
2.	 Water		
	
- viscosifying droplets
3.	 Emulsifier	
	
- emulsify water in oil
4.	 Wetting agent		
- makes the wellbore oil wet
5.	 Viscosifyer	
	
- like in WBM
6.	 Weighting material	
- like in WBM
The tree first items on the list make up the basic emulsion. When mixed together the result becomes like 
shown in Figure 8-19. Besides of lowering the interfacial tension, the emulsifier stabilizes the emulsion, 
because its molecules are adsorbed at the oil/water interface, forming a skin around the droplets. This 
skin acts as a physical barrier, preventing the droplets from coalescing when they collide with each other. 
The size of the droplets is in the colloidal size range. In order to create oil droplets in water or vice versa 
the surface tension between the two phases must be lowered, so that the droplet curvature increases and 
smaller droplets are formed. Two methods of measuring surface tension are presented next.

If two immiscible liquids are juxtaposed on a surface, one liquid has preference over the other in wetting 
the surface, depending on the relative tension between the liquids and the solid, and on the interfacial 
tension. The angle θ indicates the preferential wettability. The interfacial tension between oil and water is 
very high, θ ≈ 0o, so if the liquids are mixed together mechanically they separate soon after the agitation 
ceased, to maximize the interfacial area. Lowering the interfacial tension with a surfactant enables one 
of the two liquid to form very small droplets. The interfacial tension between mineral oil and water is 
about 50 dynes/cm, and a good emulsifier will lower it to about 10 dynes/cm.

Keeping the wellbore stable
To avoid water wetted solids or steel surfaces, add oil-wetting agents to the mud. Figure 8-21 presents 
the resulting condition in the wellbore.
The emulsion stability is tested with an Emulsion Stability Tester. The working principle is to determine 
at which voltage the currency will be short cut when immersed into the emulsion. As a rule of thumb, it 
is necessary with around 3 volume% of the emulsified phase to reach a maximum voltage. The stability 
of an emulsion increases with increasing viscosity (of the continuous phase) because the number of 
collisions between the droplets is decreased. Similarly, the stability decreases with increasing temperature 
because the number of collisions increases. The lower the interfacial tension can be made, the smaller 
the droplets become, and the more stable the emulsion.

Pseudo oil based mud (POBM): The restrictions on the discharge of cuttings contaminated with mineral 
oil, led to the development of synthetic or natural derivative fluids which allowed synthetic oil based muds 
to be formulated with enhanced biodegradability and reduced bioaccumulation and toxicity, but which 
still possessed the high performance of mineral oil based muds. Pseudo-oil-based muds are made from: 
Ester, ether, olefin and other extracts from plants and animals.
All the synthetic mud types have similar properties as mineral oil; they make emulsions (up to 50% water 
in oil) by means of optimal emulsifiers, thus reducing cost and environmental impact; make wide ranges 
of densities and rheologies; tolerate contaminants; provide lubrication properties similar to mineral oil; 
similar compressibility/expansion ability as mineral oil; excellent return permeability; are thermally 
stable and are biodegradable.

Hole problems
Failures are defined as serious incidents, so serious that it becomes necessary to make repair actions. 
The operator is spending non-productive time (NPT) to restore the situation back to normal. As an 
introduction to hole-problems we have decided to group all failures in accordance to where the problem 
is located, and summarized them in Table 8-3:

enough. The errors are presented in Figure 8-22 can be applied as indicative symptoms to the failures.

Keeping the wellbore stable
Bit balling: Attractive forces exist between two solid surfaces but the two surfaces do not normally 
adhere when pressed together, because the attractive forces are extremely short ranged (Angstroms), and 
the area of intimate contact is very small. Even two smooth, highly polished surfaces have microscopic 
irregularities, and contact is obtained only between highs, as shown in Figure 8-34. Two plates of polished 
glass will stick together. It is the attractive van der Waal forces that are activated through the closeness 
of the two plates. And to separate the two plates a wedge must be forced in between them.
*ODVV VXUIDFH
&OD\ VXUIDFH
Figure 8-24: Microscopic view of two polished solid surfaces showing surprisingly small 
area of contact (left). Two clay surfaces have more intimate contact (right).
Solids can bond tighter together if they are ductile enough to be forced into intimate contact. For instance, 
the old-time blacksmith welded two steel bars together by heating them white-hot, and hammering 
them together. For the same reason, shale, consisting of colloidal particles, has the ability of coming in 
intimate contact with the rock bit or the drill collars. Swellable, soft clay stick easily to steel surfaces since 
it is ductile and deformable, thus increasing the contact. One method of dealing with sticky gumbo is 
therefore to use inhibitive mud. Symptoms of bit balling are:
•	 Reduced ROP
•	 Increased SPP – due to reduced dann
•	 Blocked shaker screen (soft clay)
•	 Overpull on tripping-out
Swelling shale: Hydratable shale usually occurs at shallow depths (< 2 500 mTVD). However, swelling 
shale may also be found at larger depth where the diagenesis process has been inhibited (in high pressured 
formations). A typical problem in upper formation is: Shale swelling  weakened wellbore  erosion 
 expansion of the hole. Due to low permeability water penetrate the shale very slowly. The driving 
force behind water transport in shale is, as stated above, either hydraulic pressure or osmosis. Hydraulic 
pressure can often be excluded; the transport rate is extremely slow in shale. Only osmosis, through a 
salinity difference between pore water and mud, can explain water invasion leading to swelling. Swelled 
shale becomes soft and sticky. During tripping operations the expanded wellbore could possibly be 
scraped off by stabilizers and the bit. Material accumulated on the BHA during tripping may be observed 
in surface parameters as overpull and pack off (pack off is seen only when the pumps are on).

Keeping the wellbore stable
At shallow and medium depths: Typical problems at medium depths are weakening of the wellbore – 
erosion of the hole: The swelling process is a slow process. When one layer of shale has swelled, it is 
weakened, and therefore prone to erosion. The erosion could be both of hydraulic and mechanical nature. 
The longer the hole stays open, the higher the probability is that the wellbore has weakened. As soon 
as the wellbore has swelled, the erosion starts on the weakened layers, exposing new layers. Symptoms 
of swelling shale are:
•	 Soft, hydrated cuttings coming over the shaker
•	 Clay balls. Shaker is blocked off
•	 Torque fluctuations
•	 Increased LGSC
•	 Increase of the following mud parameters: filter loss, MBT, PV, YP
•	 Pack off, overpull, took weight on trips
•	 These problems increase with increasing open hole time
•	 Probably not seen in vertical holes!
Enlarged wellbore: The combination of enlarged wellbore and cuttings accumulation leads to many of 
the problems related to poor wellbore cleaning like overpull, took weight, pack off and stuck pipe. This 
problem need therefor especial attention, and is illustrated in Figure 8-25.

Figure 8-25: Cuttings accumulation in hole enlargement.
Enlargements are developing due to mechanical and hydraulic erosion of weakened formations. Enlarged 
holes are also referred to as wash out, and can either be caused by caving production or by erosion of 
weak or weakened wellbore, leading to overpull and took weight during tripping operations, poor control 
of wellbore directions, inefficient hole cleaning, casing running and cementing problems. The borehole 
wall usually varies in hardness. In laminated formations, the hard stringers are composed of calcite 
quartzite, whereas the layers in between may be composed of soft, reactive shale. Softer shale will react 
with the mud and become weakened and gradually hydraulically and/or mechanically eroded, leaving 
an enlarged hole behind. The hard stringers form sharp shoulders and ledges. These enlarged holes are 
eventually filled with cuttings.

Countermeasures to hole-problems
In order to do something about the problems they need to be detected and recognized. For this 
purpose we start the chapter by discussing surveillance and interpretation of observed deviations from 
normal operations.

Best Practice – Drilling Limit
Every oil company/service company develops their own Best Practice. The following summary of Best 
Practical guidelines involves the Drilling Limit. This is an approach where the well is drilled as fast as 
possible, simultaneously ensuring a clean and a stable wellbore. Use best-in-class technology to eliminate/
minimize NPT to make a perfect hole. This principle is based on field experiences and on laboratory 
investigations.
•	 Keep rate of penetration (ROP) to a maximum
•	 High cleaning performance 
οο High flow rate and high RPM of the drill string
οο Learn to drill the dirties holes possible
•	 Ream/circulate only 1–2 minutes prior to cnx (it does not help to do more)
•	 Low mud viscosity will enhance local turbulence
•	 Use mechanical cleaning device

Keeping the wellbore stable
The Drilling Limit is achieved through 5 consecutive steps: 
Step 1:	
Review relevant offset wells
	
	
Reveal typical problems. Find offset wells
Step 2: 	
Analyze formation properties
	
	
Determine the most time-consuming problem. Collect formation data and 
properties and identify operational problems vs. formation. See example of 
step 2 in Figure 8-26
Step 3: 	
Wellbore stability model
	
	
Wellbore stability is probably the most important premise for obtaining trouble 
free wells. Understand and apply the proper procedures. 
Step 4: 	
Focus on additional prioritized areas; tree models are needed.

Some final integrated issues:
•	 Will ECD cross the pressure window?  Change well path or strengthen fm, 
change rheology, change mud type (WBM has a better fracture healing ability 
due to swelling of clay 
•	 High T&D?  Add lubricity 
•	 Long openhole time?  Higher MW is necessary to maintain stability (due to 
slowly climbing ppore)
•	 Nearby well?  Increase fracture propagation resistance

Keeping the wellbore stable
Only long experience and good insight can enable avoiding the problem and tight surveillance:
•	 Days vs. depth against a Technical Limit (# of drilling days spent when no 
hole problems). 
•	 Use latest available techniques at all time. Keep yourself updated
οο Accurate simulators / models, including most realistic assumptions 
οο Integrate all models and assumptions if possible 
•	 Plot the roadmap (torque & drag up/down vs. depth)
•	  Make a cavings log
•	  Log ECD and ESD (equivalent static density)
•	 Watch for pack off, took weight, overpull etc.
When deviations or suspicions signs are seen during surveillance, stop and fix problem in 
accordance with best practice.

Determine Rheological Constants – Regression Analysis
Generally, the best fit is evaluated through the least squares method. In this method, the best fit is 
considered to be that instance of the model for which the sum of squared of the difference between an 
observed value and the value given by the model has the lowest value.
Regression analysis can broadly be divided into two categories – linear regression and nonlinear 
regression. In linear regression, a straight line is fitted to the observed data values while a nonlinear 
model is fitted in case of nonlinear regression.
For the project, linear regression is used for the Newtonian and the Bingham plastic model while 
nonlinear regression is used for the Power Law and the Herschel-Bulkley model to calculate the 
rheological constants.
Tools for Regression Analysis:
Specialist programs such as Microcal Origin, Sigma Plot or Graphpad Prism are available for regression 
analysis. These programs are capable of fitting user-input functions to data. However these programs 
are expensive. Also these programs are difficult for the novice to learn as they are aimed at experienced 
users with mathematical background.

An alternative method to fit non-linear functions is to use Microsoft Excel. Excel is included in the 
computer package as part of the Microsoft Office and hence requires no additional expense.
Excel offers a user friendly interface, flexible data manipulation, built-in mathematical functions and 
instantaneous graphing of data.
Excel also contains the SOLVER function which can be used to fit data with non-linear functions. In 
addition, Excel can directly be used for linear regression analysis.
Linear Regression Using Excel:
For linear regression analysis using MS Excel, the data have to be put in the spreadsheet using two 
columns – one for the independent variable and the other for the dependent variable: shear rate and 
shear stress respectively. Afterwards ‘Data Analysis’ has to be chosen from the ‘Tools Menu’ and the 
option ‘Regression’ has to be selected from the dialog box for performing linear regression.
In linear regression, a linear function is used to describe the relationship between the independent and 
the dependent variables. The linear function can be in the following form:
y = mx + c

The closer the r2 value is to 1, the better the fit. It is to be noted that for determining apparent viscosity 
for the Newtonian model using linear regression provided by the MS Excel the ‘Constant is zero’ box 
in the ‘Regression’ dialog box has to be checked. For the Binghamian model, this need not to be done 
since the intercept in this case is not zero.
Nonlinear Regression Using Excel (this section was written by D. Chowdhury in his MSc)
A method called ‘Iterative Nonlinear Least Squares Fitting’ can be used for nonlinear regression analysis. 
Like linear regression, this minimizes the value of the squared sum (SS) of the difference between data 
and fit. However unlike linear regression, it is an iterative or cyclical process. In this case, an initial 
estimate of the parameter values is made based on prior experience of the data or a sensible guess based 
on knowledge of the function used to fit the data.
The first iteration involves computing the SS based on the initial parameter values. The second iteration 
involves changing the parameter values by a small amount and recalculating the SS. This process is repeated 
many times to ensure that changes in the parameter values result in the smallest possible value of SS.
Several different algorithms can be used in non-linear regression including the Gauss-Newton, the 
Marquardt-Levenberg, the Nelder-Mead and the steepest descent methods. However, SOLVER uses another 
iteration protocol. It is based on the robust and reliable generalized reduced gradient (GRG) method.
All of these algorithms have similar properties. They all require the user to input the initial parameter 
values and use these values to provide a better estimate of the parameters employing an iterative process. 
All of these methods should yield the same parameter values with the same set of data.
For determining the rheological constants using nonlinear regression analysis, the initial values of the 
constants are determined by using the field approach. Nonlinear regression has been used for the Power 
Law and the Herschel-Bulkley model.

The procedure for nonlinear regression using MS Excel is outlined as follows:
¾
¾ Insert the experimental values for shear rate and shear stress in two columns of the spread sheet
¾
¾ Calculate shear stress using the formula for the corresponding model (i.e. Power Law or the 
Herschel-Bulkley model) in the third column using the rheological constant values those 
were calculated by adopting the field approach
¾
¾ Calculate the mean of the experimental shear stress
¾
¾ Calculate the degrees of freedom by subtracting the number of parameters or rheological 
constants in the model from the number of data points
¾
¾ Calculate the standard error in shear stress by using the following formula:

In Excel this formula must be expressed as an array formula by pressing Ctrl+Sift+Enter.
¾
¾ Calculate the R2 value
¾
¾ Calculate the confidence interval (CI) of the fit at a significance level of 95% by inserting the 
following built in formula for the critical t value:
¾
¾ tinv(0.05,df)
¾
¾ Calculate the upper confidence limit by adding CI to ymodel and lower confidence limit by 
subtracting CI from ymodel
¾
¾ Open the solver function and iterate to maximize R2 by changing the parameter values
Figure 10-1, 2 and 3 show images of the spreadsheet which has been used for regression analysis to 
determine the rheological constants taking data for all the six rotational speeds of the Fann viscometer 
into consideration. In addition, it also shows the improved curves obtained from the regression analysis.
