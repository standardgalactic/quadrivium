About the Authors
Douglas Green is an Ontario writer and photographer, in addition to being
a very active gardener. As the proprietor of Simple Gifts Greenhouses, a
specialty greenhouse and nursery growing unusual annuals and perennials,
he learned the secrets of cultivating a huge array of domestic and exotic
plants. The author of Tender Roses for Tough Climates, as well as a contribu-
tor to such publications as Harrowsmith and The Garden (magazine of the
British Royal Horticultural Society), Doug provides readers with his personal
tried and true garden wisdom. He writes a weekly Internet newsletter —
Garden Magic — circulated worldwide to over 4,000 subscribers at
www.simplegiftsfarm.com.
Canadian Gardening is one of Canada’s most popular gardening
magazines. Published since 1990, Canadian Gardening is the industry leader
and has become the deﬁnitive source for novice and expert gardening enthu-
siasts. For more information, check out the Web site at
www.canadiangardening.com.
Lance Walheim graduated from University of California, Berkeley with a
degree in botany and shortly thereafter began writing and researching books
on gardening. He’s contributed to more than 40 books on topics ranging
from citrus growing to rhododendrons. He has authored three previous
books on roses.
The National Gardening Association is the largest member-based, non-
proﬁt organization of home gardeners in the United States. Founded in 1972
(as “Gardens for All”) to spearhead the community garden movement, today’s
National Gardening Association is best known for its bimonthly magazine
National Gardening. Reporting on all aspects of home gardening, each issue
is read by some half-million gardeners worldwide.

Dedication
Doug dedicates this book to his children, Christina, Jennifer, Robert, and
Elizabeth, who did the weeding while he did the writing.
Lance Walheim and the editors of the National Gardening Association
dedicate this book to anyone who can’t walk by a rose without sticking his
or her nose into it.
Authors’ Acknowledgments
Doug thanks the editors at CDG Books Canada, Inc. — Kim Herter and Joan
Whitman — for doing such a great job and smoothing the way to make the
book happen.
He appreciates all those who reviewed the book for accuracy and relevance
to Canadians.
Although rose lovers seldom agree on the best varieties, the best blooming
roses, or the most fragrant roses, we all agree that the rose is a wonderful
ﬂower.
Doug sends a special thanks to Harry McGee for going over the manuscript
with a ﬁne red pen.
Lance Walheim and the National Gardening Association say many thanks to
the American Rose Society for the information obtained from many of their
chapters, members, and publications. In addition, they thank Weeks Roses,
Upland, California; Jackson & Perkins, Medford, Oregon; Sequoia Nursery,
Visalia, California; Garden Valley Ranch Nursery, Petaluma, California; and
the Pasadena Tournament of Roses, Pasadena, California.
They thank Ann Hooper, a special consultant; Tom Carruth of Weeks Roses;
F. Harmon Saville of Nor’East Miniature Roses; David P. Kidger of Primary
Products; and American Rose Society Consulting Rosarians Martha Chapin,
Dr. Thomas Cairns, Robert Ardini, Malcolm Lowe, and Louise Coleman. At
NGA, editors Emily Stetson and Regan Eberhart, as well as Charlie Nardozzi
helped keep the book on track, and thanks are extended to the NGA and
the staff of the magazine National Gardening: David Els, Michael MacCaskey,
Linda Provost, and Larry Somers.
Effusive thanks to the team at IDG Books Worldwide, Inc., which includes in
Chicago: Kathy Welton and Stacy Collins. In Indianapolis, Pam Mourouzis
and Tammy Castleman contributed enormously to this book — many
thank-yous to you both.

Roses For Canadians For Dummies

Introduction
I
f you asked ten people to name their favourite flower, probably nine would
name the rose. Think about it for a second. What other flower offers so
much? There’s the wonderful, almost sensuous way a rose opens — the petals
slowly unfurling, so softly, so gently. And the colours are so intense, so vivid,
and sometimes just so wild. And what about the fragrance? Even though rose
fragrance seems to surround us in perfumes, air fresheners, and what have
you, there’s still nothing more refreshing or revitalizing than sticking your nose
in a rose and taking a deep breath. Oh, the fragrance!
But our meagre attempt at describing the beauty of roses as perfect flowers
can never stand up to those of poets, painters, artists, and writers, who for
centuries have tried to capture that beauty in words and pictures. Even though
roses have been loved for so long and are so popular today, their use and
appreciation as flowering shrubs — hardworking plants that can form the
backbone of a landscape as hedges, ground covers, and sources of season-long
colour — may be only in its infancy.
It is easy to be bewildered by how huge and versatile this group of plants is.
Roses are wonderful landscape plants that are unmatched for the length of the
season in which they bloom and the amount of colour they produce. But who
really thinks of them as utilitarian plants? Not enough people, that’s for sure.
And no matter what you’ve heard, roses are easy to grow. In fact, many roses
are tough plants that fit perfectly into the low-maintenance gardens of the
modern world. Sure, they need a little care, but what plant doesn’t? The
pleasure they give in return is well worth it.
About This Book
This book aims to change the way you think about roses. They are not finicky
plants that need constant attention and a social security pension to keep
them healthy. Roses are plants for the 21st century — blooming unselfishly,
pleasing the eye and nose, and asking only for your appreciation in return.
Even though the rose family is huge, the goal of this book is to make roses
easy to understand. We tell you not only how to distinguish one type of rose
from another, but also how to best use each type and colour, whether you
want one plant for a bouquet or 100 plants for a hedge. This book can help you
make roses work for you.

And you don’t have to read this book cover to cover to understand the wide
world of roses. You’ll find a great deal of interesting and useful information,
but we’ve put it together in a way that is easy to access. If you have a
question, you can answer it quickly and then put the book down until you
need it again.
The first thing we want you to realize is that a rose is not just a rose. Even if
you already grow roses, maybe have for years, you can still find plenty of new
information to excite you.
Before you get your hands dirty, and get to know roses — how the plants
grow, how the flowers form, and what makes them smell so good — you’ll
likely have a lot of questions. They are all answered in this book, and in easy-
to-understand language. All the things you need to know to grow roses in
Canada are right here.
Conventions Used in This Book
Rose gardeners, or any gardeners for that matter, have their own jargon.
Although most words are straightforward and down to earth (most of you
won’t have any trouble figuring out watering, fertilizing, or pruning, for example),
one area is a bit trickier: the names of specific plants. To ensure that we all
know which plant we’re talking about, gardeners have a system of plant naming
based on Latin.
So following conventional garden nomenclature, we list the common names
of plants in normal type, usually lowercased (dog rose, for example). Every
plant is a member of a larger horticultural family, sharing general horticultural
characteristics with other members. For roses, that family is Rosaceae. All
roses share the same family, but, interestingly enough, other common garden
plants are also members of the rose family, including apples, hawthorns, and
potentilla.
Plant families are divided into groups of closer relatives, indicated by a group
or genus name. This genus name is always written in italics with the first letter
capitalized. Thus, the genus name for rose is Rosa and the genus name for
apples is Malus.
The next name is the species name. Like the genus, this name is written in
italics, but the first letter is lowercase. Only some of the oldest roses, such as
Rosa multiflora, are described by species. Most modern roses are grouped by
class instead of species: hybrid teas, floribundas, grandifloras, climbers, and
so on. You’ll find out more about those in Chapter 1. Within each group are
the varieties. We won’t bore you with all the reasons why, but these are usually
enclosed in single quotation marks. These names, like ‘Queen Elizabeth’ and
‘Double Delight’, are types of names that you will become most familiar with.
On a rare occasion, a botanical rose variety, meaning that the rose was found
2
Roses For Canadians For Dummies

flourishing in the wild rather than having been created by a rose breeder, is
listed as the third part of the botanical name, in italics with the first letter
lowercased. But you need not lose sleep over that.
Foolish Assumptions
In writing this book, we’re assuming a few things about you and your
experience with roses:
  You’ve been one of the lucky ones to receive a bouquet of roses from a
florist, or you’ve envied those friends, relatives, or co-workers who were.
  You enjoy gardening or want to give it a try.
  You’ve tried growing roses before, but may not have been very successful
with them, or you heard roses are so difficult to grow that you’ve been
afraid to try them out.
  You’re interested in growing your own roses, or you already grow them
and want to expand your collection of these wonderful flowers.
  You’ve stuck your nose in a rose and enjoyed its exquisite fragrance.
  You think that roses are very colourful and want to bring some of that
colour into your own garden or home.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is organized into parts, each of which contains several chapters. If you
already know a bit about roses, you may want to skip the chapters in Part I
since you’re probably familiar with basic rose anatomy and the various rose
classifications that exist. Use the Table of Contents as a guide to find the topics
that interest you most. Each chapter is designed to be read on its own or in
sequence with the other parts of the book — you don’t have to read or re-read
anything if you don’t want to — decide for yourself what information you want
to look at first. The sections below give you a quick outline of what’s in store.
Part I: Roses 101
Roses are a diverse group of plants. Having a basic understanding of the
different classes of roses, from the beautifully formed hybrid teas to the
floriferous shrub roses to the sprawling climbers, and how they grow and
bloom, helps you appreciate their versatility. Part I tells all about rose plants,
rose flowers, and rose fragrance. It also explains why where you live influences
which roses you can grow and how you grow them.

One thing about growing roses — they grow on you, and fast. You always want
more information about where to find them, tricks for growing them right in
your neighbourhood, even how you can show them off when everything goes
right and you grow the perfect flower.
Rose societies are everywhere — the flowers are that popular. Join one and
you have a wealth of information and expertise at your fingertips. You can
also enter your flowers in rose shows. In Appendix A, we tell you what rose
societies offer and how to sign up.
Mail-order catalogues often sell everything you need, from the most obscure
rose varieties to the latest irrigation technology. And you don’t have to leave
home to shop. In Appendix B, we list Canadian rose growers, many of which
offer mail-order services through catalogues and Web sites. In addition, we list
online sources of rose information and suppliers who specialize in gardening
equipment we think you may want to have. Appendix B also contains useful
provincial contact information for soil testing, insect control, and growing
conditions in your area.

he rose has been called the Queen of Flowers, and
people have treasured it for as long as people have
been in existence. Cro-Magnon man probably brought a
bouquet of roses back to the cave for his mate. And she
was undoubtedly as thrilled to receive them as people are
today.
Rose hobbyists, otherwise known as rosarians, would have
the world believe that roses require more fertilizer, more
water, more love, more attention, more time, and more
money than any other ﬂowering plant — probably because
rosarians usually enter their blossoms in rose shows and
are in a never-ending search for the perfect rose. Although
we admit that rosarians grow some pretty spectacular
roses, we also want to assure you that everyday gardeners
can get great results with very little effort.
This part familiarizes you with the unique language and
culture that have developed around rose culture and tells
you how roses are classiﬁed, how the plants grow, how
the ﬂowers form, what colours they come in, and which
varieties are fragrant and why.
We also have to do some geo-positioning. Most roses grow
and bloom anywhere they get proper care. But one of the
tricks of growing great roses with a minimum of hassles is
to choose varieties that are well adapted to your climate.
And that means knowing a little about your climate —
whether the summers are hot and dry, hot and humid, or
cool and humid, and whether the winters are frigid and
icy or merely almost icy and uncomfortable.
Once you become weather-wise, you can choose the right
varieties — for example, ones that are hardy enough to
survive your cold winters, that resist disease where it’s hot
and humid, or that bloom beautifully despite cool summers.
To give you suggestions, this part also provides lists of
recommended roses for different types of climates.

In This Chapter

W
hether you just want to mix a couple of roses in with your other
perennials or you get so hooked that you want to make roses your
hobby, you won’t find any plant that is more beautiful or as satisfying. Roses
are fun and easy to grow, particularly if you know a little about them before
you start.
Of course, no book can include everything about roses, but we think that this
one comes close to having all you need to know in order to buy, plant, grow,
and care for just about any rose. But then again, we would.
If you want to go out and dig a hole this very minute, stop. Read this chapter
first. But if you’ve already dug yourself into a hole by jumping in without
knowing what you were doing, remember the old adage:
If at first you don’t succeed, read the directions and try again.

Are Roses as Hard to Grow
as Everyone Says?
If you gain one thing from this book, you should be able to answer anyone
who tells you that roses are hard to grow. Plain and simple, roses get a bum
rap in this department, but like many stereotypes, this one does contain a
grain of truth. As you peruse this chapter — and throughout this book — you’ll
quickly gain a sense of how many different kinds of roses you can buy, and
you’ll find out how different from each other they are.
We may be stretching the point, but we’ll make an analogy with cars (any
automobile enthusiast can relate). Some cars are expensive, and some aren’t.
Some look great, and some don’t. Some are easy to maintain, and some aren’t.
Yet they’re all cars. If you were wary of working on cars, you wouldn’t buy an
antique Jaguar or Triumph. You probably wouldn’t buy a new Lamborghini,
either.
If you don’t want to fuss over your roses after you plant them, don’t choose
the fanciest, most beautiful, most fragrant long-stemmed rose. Look for some-
thing a bit more . . . well, practical. And please don’t assume that an “easy” rose
doesn’t look so good. ‘Champlain’ is one of the easiest (and hardiest) repeat-
blooming roses to grow, and it’s also one of the most beautiful red roses. We’re
only saying that out of the thousands of roses available, some are the easiest,
most trouble-free plants you’ll ever meet, and yet some will need the indulgent
fussing that some gardeners love to provide.
Which Rose Should I Grow?
Good question — and exactly the subject of a good portion of this book.
Unfortunately, no one can answer this question for you. You have to become
familiar with what’s available, develop some preferences (for a colour or
fragrance, for example), and give some thought to the type of rose that’s likely
to thrive in your garden (or how much care you’re willing to provide).
We think that colour is a great place to start, and that’s why we organize the
pictures in this book according to the colour of the roses. You can look there
among the roses of a colour you like and then refer to the chapters that
describe the specific roses. Also, you can find lists of roses throughout this
book: ones that look good, smell good, grow well, are cold hardy, and what
have you. Chapter 4 includes several lists of roses for different uses.
12
Part I: Roses 101

Finally, again and again in this book, we recommend that you consult with a
local rose expert (a rosarian) if possible and visit public gardens that offer
substantial displays of roses. Either way, you’ll know for a fact that a particular
rose grows well — or really struggles — in your area.
Where Do Roses Come From?
Botanists believe that roses in some form flourished long before humans
inhabited the earth, and it’s thought that people have cultivated roses for more
than 5,000 years. Many of these early roses, called species roses (you can read
about them in Chapter 14), are still around. But humans have been applying
their genius to rose culture (growing) and rose hybridizing (breeding) for a
long time. Now gardeners can have the best of both worlds — species and old
garden roses as well as modern hybrids.
Most rose plants that you can buy today are grown by commercial rose growers
in huge rose fields in fairly temperate climates. In North America, nearly all
the rose plants are grown commercially in California, Arizona, and Texas, as
well as by smaller nurseries in British Columbia and Ontario. Many Canadian
roses are imported either from the United States or Holland. These plants are
field grown for two years before they’re harvested while leafless and dormant
(their normal winter rest period). They are stored bareroot (a descriptive term
meaning that they have no soil on their roots) in huge, moist, refrigerated
facilities to keep them from growing before being shipped to gardeners, nurs-
eries, and garden centres nationwide in winter or early spring. You can find
out more about all this rose-buying stuff in Chapter 16.
What Are Roses Made Of?
For all their perceived mystery, roses are pretty simple plants, as Figure 1-1
shows. They consist of roots that feed the plant, taking up water and nutrients
from the soil, and canes (or stems). These canes grow from above the bud
union to produce the desired flowers. Note that if the canes come from below
the bud union, they are called suckers and are pruned off. The leaves and
branching canes grow from bud eyes, small buds that sprout at intervals along
the cane. The leaves are usually produced in five-leaf leaflets, although, to
make your life interesting, rose leaflet numbers vary from variety to variety.
As a plant thrives, new canes sprout both from the crown of the plant and
from the junction of the cane and the leaflets.
13
Chapter 1: Everything You Need to Know about Roses

Rose flowers are called roses, flowers, blooms, or blossoms. A rose flower stays
on the plant and looks like a rose for a certain length of time, depending on
the variety. When the flower fades, falls apart, or otherwise dies, it is called a
spent bloom and should be cut off the plant to encourage repeat flowering.
Cutting off dead flowers is called deadheading. The rate at which a rose plant
can form a new flower is called repeat.

Most modern roses — those that have been bred since the late 19th century
— are ever-blooming or recurrent, which means that they are repeat bloomers
and flower continuously throughout the growing season. Many older rose
varieties bloom only once a season. To find out more about rose flowers, see
Chapter 2.
What’s This Budding Thing All About?
Many types of roses are grafted, or, more correctly, budded, onto a rootstock,
as opposed to growing on their own roots as most perennials do. A rootstock
is simply a rose that produces a good, hardy root but not a heavy-flowering
top. We cut off the poor top (replacing it with a bud from a good rose) but use
the excellent root to encourage good growth on the heavy-flowering plants
we want to grow. Not only do some roses (usually the more tender varieties)
perform better on hardy rootstocks, new plants don’t have to take a long
time to establish extensive root systems in your garden. Growers get a larger
percentage of roses to thrive on rootstocks than they do when growing roses
on their own roots.
Commercial growers take canes from the varieties they want to propagate.
They cut the bud eye, or the junction of the cane and a leaf, from the cane
and insert it under the bark on the cane of a rootstock plant. When the canes
and foliage are cut off the rootstock plant, all the plant’s energy goes toward
making the newly budded eye grow. The bud eye from the desired variety has
all the genetic material needed to create a new plant that’s identical to the
original.
The point at which the bud is inserted into the bark of the rootstock plant is
called the bud union. On mature plants, the bud union looks like a knob. As the
plant grows in your garden, new, large canes grow from the bud union.
In cold climates, the bud union is the part of the plant that’s most important
to protect in winter. Plant the bud union up to 15 centimetres (6 inches) below
the ground in cold-winter climates or protect it by covering it with a mound
of soil during the winter months. (For more about growing roses in cold regions,
see Chapter 21, “Protecting Roses Where Winters Are Cold.”)

Chapter 1: Everything You Need to Know about Roses

How Are Roses Grouped?
The plant family Rosaceae is the third largest plant family. This family includes
many ornamental landscape plants, as well as fruits such as apples, cherries,
and raspberries, that are characterized by the shape of the hip (the part of
the flower where the seeds develop) and by having petals in groups of five.
Within the Rosaceae family, roses are members of the plant genus Rosa. Within
that genus, roses can be grouped into seven different classifications based on
their characteristics:
  Hybrid tea
  Grandiflora
  Polyantha and floribunda
  Miniature
  Climber and rambler
  Shrub
  Species and old garden
Each rose classification has its own special qualities. Deciding which rose to
grow depends on how you plan to use it and on your personal preferences.
Some rose gardeners grow only one or two types of roses, and others grow
many types. Our advice is to try growing one or two in each class and see which
rose types you prefer. Here are the basic differences between the various
types of roses, listed in alphabetical order:
  Climbers (see Figure 1-2) don’t really climb like clematis or other true
vines that wrap around or attach themselves to supports. They do, how-
ever, produce really long canes that need to be anchored to a fence, trellis,
or other support. Otherwise, the plants sprawl on the ground. Flowers
bloom along the whole length of the cane, especially if the cane is tied
laterally, such as along a fence. Some climbers bloom only once in the
spring, but many modern climbers produce flowers throughout the
growing season. Climbing roses are described in Chapter 12.
16
Part I: Roses 101
The World Federation of Rose Societies does
not recognize the seven-category system of rose
classifications — preferring instead to use two
classes: 1) large-flowering roses and 2) cluster-
floweringroses.Seemssimpleenoughdoesn’tit?
You won’t see this classification being used in
North American nurseries or catalogues (or this
book), but we tell you about it in case you’re
reading European books or magazines and they
bring it up.
The old-world class system

  Floribundas (see Figure 1-3) have smaller flowers that usually grow in
clusters on short stems. The bush is usually quite compact and blooms
continually throughout the growing season. Most floribundas are budded,
but commercial growers are beginning to grow them on their own roots.
Choose floribundas if you need fairly low-growing plants that produce
great numbers of colourful flowers. Floribundas are featured in Chapter 10.

Part I: Roses 101
The history of roses is obviously a rich one, and
keeping track of new varieties and of new devel-
opments is an important job of rose societies. In
Canada, the Canadian Rose Society maintains a
membership of interested rose growers, pub-
lishes the thrice-yearly Rosarian magazine and
the yearly Rose Annual, holds rose shows, and
provides local rose growers and societies with
information. To keep track of new roses, the
International Registration Authority — Roses
(IRAR) is run by the American Rose Society. It
registers new varieties of roses to ensure that
accuraterecordsarekeptregardingrosenames,
descriptions, and ownership, as well as trade-
mark and patent information.
For more information about the Canadian Rose
Society, and similar groups in other parts of
Canada, see Appendix A.

Chapter 1: Everything You Need to Know about Roses
  Grandifloras (see Figure 1-4) are usually tall-growing plants with hybrid
tea-type flowers that are smaller than hybrid teas. The flowers often grow
in clusters, but the stems on each flower within a cluster are long enough
for cutting. Grandifloras are almost always budded and are a good choice
if you like lots of bloom for colour in the garden and stems for cutting,
all on the same plant. We talk about grandifloras in Chapter 9.
  Hybrid teas (see Figure 1-5) have large flowers that usually grow one to
a long stem. The bush can grow quite tall, with an upright habit (a term
we use to describe the shape or look of a plant). Hybrid tea roses are
usually budded onto a hardy rootstock. The plant flowers continually
throughout the growing season. Hybrid teas are a great choice if you like
large flowers with a real rose form (the centre is higher than outside
petals) and if you like to make rose arrangements or have cut flowers in
the house. Chapter 8 features hybrid teas.

  Miniatures (see Figure 1-6) are small plants, usually between 15 and 90
centimetres (6 and 36 inches) in height. Their leaves and flowers are in
perfect proportion. Extremely popular, they are not usually budded but
grow on their own roots, making them hardier in cold climates. Most mini
varieties bloom profusely and are a great choice if you need lots of colour
in a small space. You also can grow miniatures indoors in pots on a sunny
windowsill or under fluorescent lights. Miniature roses are covered in
Chapter 11.

  Old garden roses (also called heritage, antique, or classic roses) are
divided into two categories — those discovered or hybridized before
1867 and those discovered or hybridized after 1867. The classification
old garden roses comprises many subclasses of roses, including alba,
bourbon, China, hybrid perpetual, damask, and the species roses. By far
the largest percentage of old garden roses bloom only once during the
growing season. Old garden rose aficionados enjoy the history and study
of these lovely and often fragrant plants. We cover them in Chapter 14.
  Polyanthas are the forerunner of modern floribundas. They are usually
moderately sized in Canada, and covered with small, miniature-type
flowers. The usual habit is compact, hardy, and generous-blooming. The
variety we see most often is ‘The Fairy’, which is a wonderful variety,
covered with small pink flowers on a plant that can spread to a few metres
in height and width. Because they are so similar, we group the polyanthas
with the floribundas in Chapter 10.
  Ramblers are the forerunners of today’s large-flowered climbers. The
large, hardy, free-growing plants generally bloom only once in early
summer, although there are several repeat bloomers such as ‘Super
Excelsa’. In warmer parts of the United States they often grow wild, but
unfortunately ramblers are not reliably winter hardy without protection
in most parts of Canada. Although not many garden centres carry them,
you can still find ramblers in specialist rose catalogues. You can find more
about them in Chapter 12.
  Shrubs (see Figure 1-7) have become very popular in recent years
because most are quite hardy and easy to grow. They are generally large
plants, and most, particularly the modern shrubs, bloom profusely
throughout the season. They are great for landscaping. If you have a large
space that you want filled with colour, the shrub category offers a great
deal of choices. For more information, see Chapter 13.

  Tree roses, or standards, aren’t included among the basic categories
because nearly any rose that is grafted (more specifically, budded) onto
a tall trunk is a tree rose. Most often, hybrid teas, floribundas, and minia-
tures are used as tree roses. These plants really aren’t even trees. Most
just have that lollipop tree look, as shown in Figure 1-8, but are only 60
to 180 centimetres (2 to 6 feet) high. They are wonderful either in the
ground or in containers but are very susceptible to winter damage, and
in cold climates you must either bury the entire plant (tops and all) in
the ground or overwinter it indoors in a cool storage area.
When you go to a garden centre to choose your rosebushes, knowing which
classification of rose you want is important. The classification dictates its use
in your garden. You don’t want to plant a once-blooming old garden rose in a
spot where having season-long colour is important. The variety you choose
(see the following section) depends on your personal preference as to colour,
hardiness, and so on.

Chapter 1: Everything You Need to Know about Roses
Where Do Rose Cultivars Fit In?
Within each classification of roses there are many different cultivars. These
differ from each other in colour, fragrance, growth vigour, and hardiness, but
not in the basic flower construction or growth habit. Sometimes you’ll see a
cultivar referred to as a variety. While botanically incorrect, in common usage
they are the same thing. Most of us use the incorrect term variety and only
those who prefer horticultural correctness to plain speaking use cultivar.
Technically, a cultivar is a cultivated variety, while a variety is the category
of plant name that comes between the subspecies and the forma. Having said
that mouthful, unless you have a botanist hanging over your shoulder, don’t
worry about which term you use. While it is technically incorrect, we’ll use
variety throughout this book just to make life easier for us all.
For example, the variety ‘Olympiad’ is classified as a hybrid tea rose. So if
you’re looking for a lovely red rose that has a classic rose form and grows on
long stems for cutting, you may want to consider the hybrid tea ‘Olympiad’.
Cultivars or varieties of all types or classifications of roses are described in
Part III of this book.
Where Do New Roses Come From?
Many new varieties of roses are introduced to the gardening public each year.
Some of them are so fabulous that you can’t resist seeing them grow in your
own garden. But who invents new rose varieties? Rose breeders, more correctly
called rose hybridizers, are unique people. First, there aren’t many of them —
perhaps fewer than 100 in the whole world. Some are amateurs — usually
rosarians (people who are very serious about growing roses) who take their
hobby a step further and try their hand at hybridizing. Some are independent
hybridizers, who develop new varieties and sell them to commercial rose
growers. But the most successful (and financially secure) rose hybridizers are
employed by commercial rose growers who can better afford to support large-
scale hybridizing programs and the years of development needed to bring a
new rose to the market.
Roses are crossbred by pollen exchange. The hybridizer must be an expert in
rose genetics in order to choose existing varieties whose desirable character-
istics will be passed on to a new variety and whose undesirable characteristics
will not.
After pollen is exchanged, the rose hip must be left to ripen. When it is har-
vested, the hip is cut off the plant and broken open, and the seeds are stored for
a few weeks before they’re planted in flats in a carefully controlled greenhouse.

24
Part I: Roses 101
In one hybridizing season, hundreds of thousands, perhaps half a million,
seeds are planted. From the seedlings, eventually only three or four are
deemed worthy of selling to gardeners.
New seedlings are tested for several years to ensure that the new variety
grows well in all climates, is not a haven for every pest and disease that
comes along, and has pleasing flowers and a desirable growth habit. It’s not
unusual for a new rose variety to be tested for ten years or more before it
comes to market.
To further complicate the issue of rose names,
here’s a tidbit of information that won’t affect
you in any way unless you want to grow roses
commercially or want to be a contestant on
Jeopardy!: Each variety of rose has a denomi-
nation, or code name. The denomination identifies
the rose plant no matter what commercial name
the plant is given. Sometimes, roses that are
bred in Europe are introduced into Canada under
another variety name (and vice versa). For exam-
ple, the floribunda ‘Livin’ Easy’ is also called
‘Fellowship’. But the denomination is the same
in Europe and in Canada.
The denomination consists of three capital
letters that indicate the company that owns the
rights to the rose, plus a bunch of usually mean-
ingless lowercase letters that indicate the
particular cultivar. The floribunda ‘Livin’ Easy’
(or ‘Fellowship’ in Europe) is ultimately identifi-
able by its denomination, HARwelcome. HAR
indicates that the rights to the plant are owned
by Harkness & Company in England, and
welcome tells you that the plant is the orange
floribunda you know and love. (Note that
welcome is not part of the rose name but part
of the denomination — just to keep things clear
between us.)
Rose breeders and commercial rose growers go
through all this rigmarole because they patent
their new varieties of roses. In Canada, plant
breeder’s rights last for 18 years, so the owner of
the rights can collect a royalty on each plant
that’s sold here for 18 years. These rights, which
vary from country to country, protect the breed-
ers and encourage new plant development. So,
no matter the name or where it is sold, patents
and international treaties protect the breeder.
Next time you buy a rosebush, notice the metal
tag that’s attached. The denomination is printed
under the variety name, either in parentheses
or after the abbreviation cv (for cultivar). For
example:
  Timeless™
(JACecond)
  Scentimental™
cv. WEKplapep
JAC is the abbreviation for Jackson & Perkins,
and WEK is the abbreviation for Weeks Roses.

Chapter 1: Everything You Need to Know about Roses
Who really thinks up those wild names you see
in catalogues? Most of the time, the breeder
names the rose, but sometimes other consider-
ations come into play.
We asked Joyce Fleming, a rose breeder in
Southern Ontario, how she names her roses.
Most of her rose introductions are named after
her family, but her best rose to date was named
after Canadian astronaut Dr. Roberta Bondar.
This yellow climbing rose was named because
Joyce thinks, “Canadians need to honour their
heroes — especially their women heroes.” Dr.
Bondar agreed to have this rose named after her,
in fact given the choice of two roses, she chose
the yellow climber. After you see the picture of
this yellow rose, you’ll agree that ‘Roberta
Bondar’, a tall-growing, heavily blooming rose, is
well and aptly named. A hero indeed!
Of course large rose nurseries name their roses
so that they will sell well. Which would you be
moreinclinedtopurchase?Arosecalled‘Dream’
or one called ‘Seagull’; a rose called ‘Fragrant
Delight’ or one called ‘Tower Bridge’? In business
terms, a mediocre name can ruin a great rose
just as a good name can sell a mediocre rose.
One of the best-selling roses of all time was intro-
duced immediately after World War II. Its name?
‘Peace’.
Once a new rose’s name is chosen, it is regis-
tered with the American Rose Society to ensure
the name and description is original and correct.
After the name has been accepted as not having
been used before, the breeder can register the
rose under Canadian Plant Breeder’s Rights
legislation. This registration expense is not under-
taken lightly by small breeders such as Joyce
Fleming. In fact, Joyce has not patented any of
her roses due to the cost. Rose growing and
naming can be big business.
How does a rose get its name?

It’s All about Flowers
In This Chapter
 Unveiling rose anatomy
 Presenting the whole gamut of rose shapes and colours
 Examining ever-blooming, once-flowering, and recurrent roses
F
lowers are the reason people grow roses. Rose flowers come in almost all
colours and many shapes. Depending on the kind of rose you buy, the
plant may flower once or all season long. No matter what kind of roses you
like, the flowers are endlessly fascinating. But to make sure that the rose you
buy has the colour, shape, size, and blooming schedule that suits your yard,
your climate, and your expectations, you should know what to look for.
Rose flowers have enthralled human beings through the ages. In fact, the
Empress Josephine — you know, Napoleon’s main squeeze — made rose
gardening the “in thing” for generations of gardeners, right up until today. She
started in 1798 and attempted to collect every known variety of rose for her
garden at Malmaison, near Paris. When she died in 1814, she had collected
250 different varieties.
Today, you can find thousands of rose varieties, all, in one way or another,
descended from the early roses.
What endear roses to people are the colour, the shape, the substance, the
fragrance, the size, and the overall appeal of the flowers. In this chapter we
thought we’d give you a little background to help you understand and
appreciate the huge variety of roses that are available.

Anatomy of a Rose
Like most plants, the flowers of a rose plant are its sexual anatomy. The petals
of each blossom surround the sexual parts of the plant, which include both
male and female organs. Yep, roses have both male and female parts, all in
one lovely flower, making them able to self-pollinate.
Figure 2-1 shows a cross-section of a rose flower. The stamens, which are so
lovely in many varieties of roses, are the male parts of the rose. The anthers,
at the top of the stamens, produce the pollen that fertilizes the ovules, or
eggs, which are at the bottom of the pistils, inside the hip of the flower. Rose
flowers can self-pollinate, but the resulting new plant is rarely as good as the
original. You can find out more about the sex life of roses in Chapter 23.

The sepals are leaf-like structures that protect the rose buds, covering them
before they open. They slowly separate to reveal the colour of the developing
flower and finally pull away entirely, allowing the petals of the bud to unfurl. The
sepals are often a very attractive part of the flower, particularly if their feathery
ends extend above the top of the bud. When they drop, allowing the petals to
open, they can be a very decorative underpinning to a beautiful flower.
Petalling Around Town
You can find much beauty in all the parts of a rose flower, but what most
people consider perfection in a rose bloom is the petals — the colour, the
substance, the arrangement of the petals, and the fragrance.
A rose can have no petals at all, like the famous green rose, Rosa chinensis
viridiflora. Really, what seem to be the petals of the flower are actually lots of
sepals. Many people consider the green rose uglier than several miles of bad
road, but others find a strange beauty in its greenness. The green rose is of
the China family of roses, and, as with all Chinas, has a well-deserved reputa-
tion of being quite frost-tender. This plant will not survive typical Canadian
winters. Bury the entire rose quite deeply or take it indoors to a cool room.
Unlike most other old garden roses, however, the Chinas, including the green
rose, bloom all season long. (See Chapter 21 for details of overwintering.)
Or a rose can have so many petals that it won’t open in anything but the hottest
weather. Sometimes these many-petalled roses are so fabulous that they’re
worth growing, even if you see only a few blooms a year during a heat wave.
The most notorious rose for having so many petals that many of the flowers
end up as squishy rotten balls at the top of a strong cane is the hybrid tea
‘Uncle Joe’. The plant is a large one, often reaching 180 to 210 centimetres (6
or 7 feet) tall, with wonderful, clean foliage. In hot weather, when the flowers
do open, they are among the most beautiful of the red hybrid teas.
Because roses are all about flowers, we couldn’t resist adding pictures of some
of our favourites to this book. They’re easy to find — look for the colour
section of different-textured paper. The photographs are arranged, sensibly
we think, by colour so that you can easily compare features of roses with the
same colour flowers.
The most common petal formations fall into three categories:
  Single: Many beautiful roses have only a single row of petals. Like the
wonderful ‘Dainty Bess’, a single hybrid tea with five large, pale pink
petals surrounding bright red stamens, roses that are single can be very
lovely. ‘Eyepaint’ is another beautiful single rose. See Figure 2-2 for an
example of a single rose.
29
Chapter 2: It’s All about Flowers

  Semi-double: Roses that are considered semi-double may have only two
or three rows of petals, as shown in Figure 2-3. The pink floribunda
‘Simplicity’, which performs well as a hedge rose, has semi-double flowers.

Figure 2-3:

double rose

  Double or fully double: These roses have lots of petals, as Figure 2-4
shows. A rose is considered double if it has more than 35 petals. Double
roses are generally larger and showier than singles or semi-doubles. The
red hybrid tea ‘Mister Lincoln’ has wonderfully double flowers, as do the
Austin roses.
Whether you choose roses with single, semi-double, or double flowers makes
no difference. If you like them, they’re perfect.
Top Form
The way a flower’s petals unfurl is called form. Whether or not a rose is
considered to have good form depends on the kind of rose you’re looking at,
as well as your own idea of what’s attractive. Many people think that the
quartered form that’s often found in old garden roses is very attractive. Other
people prefer the complete lack of form that’s found in other old garden roses,
with floppy petals that jut out in every direction. Many old garden roses with
little or no form are very charming.
31
Chapter 2: It’s All about Flowers
Figure 2-4:
A double
rose has
many petals.

But really, when we talk about rose form, we’re talking about modern roses.
Modern roses, including hybrid teas, floribundas, grandifloras, and miniatures,
can have two types of form:
  Exhibition or formal: Many-petalled rose flowers with great exhibition
(formal) form are often called exhibition roses. They are gracefully shaped,
with the petals symmetrically arranged in an attractive circular outline,
tending toward a high centre. The arrangement of the unfurling petals
should be symmetrical and evenly spaced, with no evident gaps. The
centre of the bloom should be perfect — well defined, high, and pointed.
From the side view, you should notice a symmetry of structure as the
petals unfurl uniformly from the high, pointed centre. The outer row of
petals should be as close as possible to a horizontal plane.
Each variety has its own inherent characteristics. Exhibition roses are at
their perfect phase of bloom when they are one-third to one-half open.
  Decorative or informal: Decorative (informal) form is evident when a
rose does not have a well-defined, high, pointed centre. A decorative rose
may be ruffled or cupped and can have a low centre. Decorative roses
usually have fewer petals. These roses are often referred to as garden
roses, as opposed to exhibition roses.
Climate conditions, culture, and weather can affect rose form. But if you want
to grow roses with consistently good form, you must choose varieties that
are genetically graced with good form. Unless you’re planning to exhibit your
roses at a rose show, however, form really doesn’t matter much, as long as it’s
pleasing to you.
Once you get involved in the rose hobby, though, you may find that form
becomes more important to you. If so, you want to buy varieties that are
known as exhibition varieties. Doing so isn’t as difficult as it sounds. If a rose
has exhibition form, the catalogue description generally says so. Not quite as
many roses with exhibition form are available as roses with decorative form,
but you still have plenty to choose from.
Following is a list of hybrid teas that we think are top-notch in the form
department:
  ‘Royal Highness’: Light pink hybrid tea
  ‘Marijke Koopman’: Medium pink hybrid tea
  ‘Tower Bridge’: Medium red hybrid tea
  ‘Savoy Hotel’: Light pink hybrid tea
  ‘Touch of Class’: Orange-pink hybrid tea
  ‘Victor Borge’: Orange blend hybrid tea
  ‘Warm Wishes’: Orange-pink blend hybrid tea
32
Part I: Roses 101

Miniature rose form is judged like hybrid tea form. Here’s our list of top
exhibition minis:
  ‘Antique Rose’: Medium pink miniature
  ‘Just for You’: Deep pink miniature
  ‘Millie Walters’: Orange-pink miniature
  ‘Rise ’n’ Shine’: Medium yellow miniature
  ‘Rainbow’s End’: Yellow and red miniature
  ‘Work of Art’: Orange blend miniature
But Does It Have Substance?
Substance is a quality in a rose that is extremely important to the stability and
durability of its form and to its keeping quality, or vase life. Substance is the
amount of moisture in the petals, and it is manifested in the texture, firmness,
crispness, thickness, and toughness of the petals. You can determine the
presence of substance in rose petals by feeling thickness in the petals, by an
opalescent sparkle and sheen in pastel-coloured roses, and by a velvety
appearance in red roses.
When you feel substance by touching a rose’s petals, you can’t help but be
impressed with the thick velvetiness of some varieties. They truly are a work
of art. The people we know should have as much substance as some roses do!
A Horse of a Different Colour
Colours of roses! So many exist that we hardly know where to begin. Three
factors affect the colour of roses:
  Hue: The component that gives visual impact to the eye and distinguishes
one colour from another.
  Brightness: The clarity and vividness of the colour, and the absence of
cloudiness or muddiness.
  Chroma: The purity and intensity of the hue. Ideal chroma has the least
amount of grey or white in the hue.
So ideal hue is a combination of ideal brightness and ideal chroma. This really
doesn’t help you pick the rose you like; it just gives you some more ammunition
for your next cocktail party.
33
Chapter 2: It’s All about Flowers

The International Registration Authority for Roses divides rose colours into
18 colour classes. Every rose fits into one of these categories, and when
introducers register their roses with the International Registration Authority —
Roses, they must specify one of these 18 colour classes. Mail-order rose
companies may describe colours of roses in terms that are more accurate or
whimsical, such as “candy apple red” or “salmon orange,” but the official
colour class is one of the 18 listed here:
  White (includes near white and white blend)
  Light yellow
  Medium yellow
  Deep yellow
  Yellow blend
  Apricot (includes apricot blend)
  Orange (includes orange blend)
  Orange-pink
  Orange-red
  Light pink
  Medium pink
  Deep pink
  Pink blend
  Medium red
  Dark red
  Red blend
  Mauve (includes mauve blend)
  Russet
Although these 18 colour categories are the official colours of roses, we’ve
simplified them. In the colour section of this book, we group roses into six
colour groups: red, pink, orange, yellow, white, and multicoloured or blends. In
describing the varieties in Part III of this book, we stick to the same simplified
groups and use adjectives that we hope will help you imagine the rose better.
And as Chapter 4 points out, rose colour can change slightly when a rose is
grown in different climates. That’s why “official” colour descriptions some-
times vary from the colour in a photograph or the colour of the rose in your
own garden.
34
Part I: Roses 101

Oh, and for the record, a blend is a rose that has different shades of one colour,
or two or more different colours, on the same flower. They are usually grouped
by the most dominant colour. If a rose is several shades of one colour, we
describe it in Part III under that colour. If a rose has several colours, we call it
a multicoloured rose in this book.
Where Do Rose Flowers Come From?
So now you know what makes a good rose a good rose, but how do those
naked-looking sticks you plant in the spring get to the flower stage? The process
is nothing short of a miracle.
With the three major fertilizer nutrients, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium,
working in concert with the micro-elements in the soil that plants need to
promote photosynthesis (you remember from high school science: light and
carbon dioxide go in the leaf, and water and oxygen come out), your rose plant
develops new canes from two places:
  From the crown of the plant (the bud union on budded roses)
  From the bud eyes located at intervals along the canes
35
Chapter 2: It’s All about Flowers
When someone develops a blue rose or a black
rose, the International Registration Authority for
Roses will have to add new categories. But we
probably won’t see those colours during our life-
time. Most every hybridizer has about given up
on black because the dark tissue of the petals
absorbs so much heat that the flower dies before
it opens.
As for blue, well, a couple of research groups
send out media releases every year or so saying
that they almost have a blue rose. Then their
funding gets a shot in the arm. It’s pretty unlikely,
though, that a true blue rose will appear in the
foreseeable future. The problem is that roses
have no natural blue pigment. The pigment that
makesmauverosesmauveisreallyaredpigment
that is altered by the pH in the rose’s cells. An
interesting note: The red pigment in mauve roses
doesn’t photograph well, showing up as pink on
film. That’s why the colour of many mauve roses
is not quite accurate in some catalogue photos.
Making a blue rose will require some big-time
gene splicing, and because biologists haven’t
even identified most of a rose’s genes, splic-
ing ’em will be pretty hard. Also, the chemical
response to the pH in the cell, once altered,
would have to react favourably with the process
of photosynthesis and with the plant’s metabo-
lism. A plant scientist could make this project
his or her life’s work. But if the scientist were
successful, he or she would be rich beyond
anyone’s dreams!
Black and blue…

Rose flowers form at the top of a new cane. You can watch the tiny bud as it
forms and grows.
Hybrid tea roses
Hybrid teas usually form flowers one-to-a-stem in early spring, but subsequent
bloom during the summer often produces two or more buds to the sides of
the large main bud. The energy the plant must expend to make the side buds
grow takes vitality away from the larger central bud, so all the flowers are small.
If you want your hybrid tea flower to reach its full size and potential, you must
disbud it when the tiny side buds are forming. You can disbud easily by snap-
ping off the side buds when they are very small. Doing so allows the main bud
to reach its maximum size. If you like a larger quantity of flowers and don’t
care about their size, don’t bother to disbud.
Floribunda roses
Floribundas usually form flowers in clusters, often called sprays. A cluster
forms at the top of a cane, just like a single flower. But instead of only one bud,
there are several. As the buds grow, the centre or terminal bud grows faster
than the others in the cluster and opens several days sooner than the others
in the cluster. If you want all the flowers to open at the same time, you must
nip out the centre bud. From that point on, all the buds in the cluster mature
at the same time. (See Figure 2-5 for an example of a floribunda cluster.)
36
Part I: Roses 101
When Agriculture Canada rose researcher Dr.
Felicitas Svejda wanted to name the new class
of roses she was developing, she thought first
of the nature of our country. She said, “Canada
was developed by rugged people exploring new
and rugged areas; nobody had gone there before
our Canadian explorers.” Her roses, bred for
ruggedness, disease resistance, and summer
blooming, seemed a good fit to match these early
adventurers. So the roses bear names like ‘Cap-
tain Samuel Holland’, ‘William Baffin’, and ‘George
Vancouver’. “I thought about naming them after
painters,” she said, “but for ruggedness, the
explorers had to take precedence.” As an ama-
teur painter, she added, “Besides, anybody can
paint.”

Having all the flowers in a cluster open at the same time is important only if
you’re going to exhibit the spray in a rose show or if you’re going to use the
entire spray in a flower arrangement.
So When Do They Bloom, Anyway?
Few flowering plants are ever-blooming, meaning that the flowers keep devel-
oping and blooming from spring to late fall. But roses do bloom all season,
making them among the most desirable of garden plants. At least, most
modern hybrid teas, floribundas, grandifloras, miniatures, and modern
shrubs are ever-blooming, while the majority of old garden roses are either
once-flowering (per year) or recurrent, which means that they bloom once in
the spring and again in the fall.
You can expect your roses to bloom for the first time about six weeks after
growth starts in the spring. The flower needs that long to form and mature.
The first bloom in the spring, when all your roses are in full bloom, is always
the most spectacular, making that time of year — whenever it may be in your
area — a favourite time for everyone who loves roses. Modern roses continue
to produce flowers throughout the season, and the process for repeat flower
development takes the same six weeks or so. Luckily the plants always have
flowers at different stages of growth, making for a continuous display.

Part I: Roses 101
Roses That Bloom Once a Season
Roses that bloom once a season are called non-recurrent. They are usually old
garden roses — those discovered or hybridized before and a little after 1867.
Some old garden roses, namely the hybrid musks, damask perpetuals, noisettes,
Chinas, teas, and about 60 percent of the rugosas, are repeat blooming. But all
the others, like the albas, centifolias, damasks, and gallicas, bloom only once.
“So why grow ’em?” you may ask. You grow them for the amazing display they
put on when they do bloom. It is as if they’re saving up all their energy for a
whole year and then throwing it all away in an explosion of bloom. Old garden
roses that bloom only once produce 50 times more flowers than ever-blooming
roses, and you have to love them for their exuberance.
Although these roses bloom only once a year in
spring, when they do flower, they’ll knock your
socks off! (See their photos in the colour section,
and go to Chapter 14 for more details.)
  ‘Harison’s Yellow Rose’, Rosa harisonii:
Cupped, soft yellow blooms with golden
stamens.
  ‘Königin von Dänemark’: Alba rose. Flesh
pink flowers with a darker centre. Very full,
medium-sized, fragrant blooms. Vigorous
grower.
  ‘Madame Hardy’: Damask rose. Flowers are

F
ragrance isn’t the main reason people grow roses, but it sure is a nice
benefit. Many of the world’s most beautiful roses have little or no fragrance,
and they’re wonderful to grow and look at. But many people think that
fragrance is an important characteristic and seek out only fragrant varieties.
An estimated 25 percent of all roses have no fragrance or only a small amount,
20 percent are intensely fragrant, and the remainder lie somewhere in the
middle. So if you shop only for fragrant roses, you may be missing out on some
of the world’s best varieties.
This chapter can help you to pick out particularly fragrant varieties and make
the most of their tantalizing fragrance. Just follow your nose!
In recent years, rosarians have asked rose
hybridizers to try to breed fragrance into new
varieties,especiallyhybridteas,whichasagroup
are notoriously scentless. And probably not one
rosehybridizerintheworlddoesn’ttry.Butbreed-
ing for fragrance isn’t as easy as it sounds. It isn’t
a single gene that is responsible for fragrance,
but a series. And that series is elusive. You might
think that if you crossed one fragrant rose with
another, you’d get a fragrant rose. Not so. In fact,
whenyoucrosstwofragrantvarieties,you’rejust
about guaranteed to get no fragrance at all! So
when a hybridizer does come up with a new
fragrant rose, it’s cause for excitement through-
out the rose world.
A quest for scent

Locating Rose Scent
Nearly all the parts of a rose can emit fragrance — even the thorns, although
we rarely put our noses close to them. On moss roses (see Chapter 14 for more
information about them), the fragrance is concentrated in the moss, or the
hairs on the hip and sepals (Chapter 2 explains the anatomy of a rose flower).
But most often, fragrance, or at least the highest concentration of it, is in the
petals of a rose.
Fragrance in roses is, like everything else in the living world, a series of
chemicals. It is determined by the chemicals present in the plant and by their
complex reaction with one another and with the atmosphere. Several chemical
groups are responsible for floral fragrance, including
  Aromatic alcohols
  Aldehydes
  Fatty acids
  Phenols
  Carbonic acid
  Essential oils and resins
Certain hydrocarbons, such as citronellol and phenylethyl, have been identified
as being responsible for certain scents, but this chemical stuff is complicated
(and you probably don’t care, anyway). Better to know how your nose
interprets those chemicals in everyday terms.
Knowing Them with Your Nose
There are just about as many rose fragrances as there are noses. Certainly,
everyone gets something different when they bury their nose in a rose. But
several individual scents have been more or less definitively identified. It is
thought that a connection exists between fragrance and other rose character-
istics, with darker roses being generally more fragrant than lighter-coloured
ones, heavily petalled roses having a stronger or more intense scent, and red
and pink varieties being more closely associated with classic rose scent. Yellow
and white roses more often emit orris, nasturtium, and violet aromas, along
with other flowery and lemony scents, and orange roses are often associated
with a fruity scent. You can, however, count on exceptions to all these “rules.”

Unfortunately, not all these roses are widely available, or even described in
this book. But the next time you go to a public rose garden, you may want to
compare the fragrances of different roses. Doing so is kind of fun, especially
for kids.

Chapter 3: Rose Fragrance

Enhancing Your Sniffing Pleasure
Although fragrance is a genetic characteristic that’s present in some roses
and not in others, other factors affect the strength of the fragrance within a
fragrant variety. Excellent growing conditions, including planting in good soil
and correct soil pH, are vital to ensure that fragrance can reach its full
potential. Even more important is the amount of moisture in the soil. Rose
fragrance is sweetest when plants have adequate water. So that’s just another
good reason why you should read Part IV, “Growing Healthy Roses.”
Temperature, humidity, wind conditions, and time of day also affect fragrance
strength. Scent is more pronounced on warm, sunny days, is significantly
reduced on cloudy days, and is hard to detect when the weather is overcast,
cold, or raining. And roses emit more fragrance later in the day than they do
in the morning.
Chapter 27 tells you how to get the most out of cut roses for bouquets. Once
a rose is cut, its fragrance stays with the petals, but the scent is strongest
when the room is warm and the air is more humid than dry.
Choosing Fragrant Varieties
Because fragrance is a great selling point, mail-order rose catalogue descrip-
tions never keep fragrant varieties a secret. To further narrow your choices,
you can always look for those that have been awarded the James Alexander
Gamble Rose Fragrance Award.
The following list includes all the roses ever to have won the prestigious
Gamble Fragrance Award:
  1961: ‘Crimson Glory’, red hybrid tea
  1962: ‘Tiffany’, pink and yellow blend hybrid tea
  1965: ‘Chrysler Imperial’, red hybrid tea
  1966: ‘Sutter’s Gold’, orange-yellow hybrid tea
  1968: ‘Granada’, red multicoloured hybrid tea
  1970: ‘Fragrant Cloud’, orange-red hybrid tea
  1974: ‘Papa Meilland’, red hybrid tea
  1979: ‘Sunsprite’, yellow floribunda
  1986: ‘Double Delight’, red and white bicoloured hybrid tea
  1997: ‘Fragrant Hour’, orange-pink hybrid tea
42
Part I: Roses 101

You may have noticed that most of these roses are hybrid teas. As we said
earlier, many hybrid teas don’t have strong fragrance, which is true. But isn’t
it also interesting that some of the most fragrant roses are hybrid teas? You
have to love Mother Nature.
Some of our favourite fragrant old garden roses are the following:
  ‘Alfred de Dalmas’: Light pink moss
  ‘Ispahan’: Medium pink damask
  ‘Madame Hardy’: White damask
  Rosa gallica officinalis: Light crimson gallica
  ‘Bishop Darlington’: Pink blend hybrid musk
But don’t for one moment believe that there aren’t a whole bunch of newer
roses that are fragrant and great plants, too. The following varieties are readily
available and wonderfully fragrant:
  ‘Dolly Parton’: Orange-red hybrid tea
  ‘Especially for You’: Medium yellow hybrid tea
  ‘Sheila’s Perfume’: Apricot blend floribunda
  ‘Sweet Chariot’: Mauve miniature
  ‘Royal William’: Medium red hybrid tea

Chapter 3: Rose Fragrance
Roses that have been awarded the James
Alexander Gamble Award will be identified in
catalogues — with the notation Gamble Award
or Gamble Fragrance Award.
No roses won the award between 1986 and 1997
because of the rigid qualification requirements.
Not only must a nominee be fragrant, but it also
must possess a number of other attributes, includ-
ing vigour, pest and disease resistance, form,
substance, colour, and extreme popularity for
more than five years. These qualities are why
almost all the Gamble Award winners are still
available at your local garden centre or favourite
mail-order nursery.

The Climates of the Rose
In This Chapter
 Knowing the right roses for your climate
 Growing roses where winters are cold and summers are humid
 Succeeding with roses where summers are cool
T
here’s virtually no place in the world where you can’t grow nearly any type
of rose you want. Of course, you may have to turn yourself inside out to
keep it alive and thriving, but you can do so if you’re masochistically inclined.
Finding roses that are naturally suitable for the climate in which you live,
however, is a much better idea (not to mention easier and more satisfying).
The rose family is a diverse group of plants that thrive in a wide range of
conditions. For nearly every climate, the list of roses you have to choose from
is a long one.
Like all plants, each classification of rose, and even specific varieties within
a classification, have their own tolerances to high or low temperatures, wind,
and other climate factors that can affect its performance, if not its very
survival.
And equally important, your climate dictates how you care for your roses —
how often you need to water, which diseases you should watch out for, when
to fertilize, and other stuff gardeners do.
So that’s what this chapter is all about — getting to know the climate you live
in and how it affects the roses you choose and the way you care for them. To
start out, we brief you on the climate basics, but we often have to refer you
to other parts of this book for more specifics on cultural (growing) practices.
To finish up, we give you a list of rose types that are recommended for specific
climate regions.

Cold Winters — Canadian
Climate Conditions
The general climate of your region (we talk about localized climates around
your home later in this chapter) — that is, the city or county you live in — is
determined by a complex mix of factors: how cold the winters are, how warm
the summers are, how sunny or cloudy it is, how humid or dry it is, and a whole
bunch of other things you can probably guess. And most of these factors
affect how different types of roses grow or perform. The more you know about
climate factors, the better rose gardener you’ll be. So here’s the scoop on how
different climate factors affect roses.
Getting to know your hardiness zone
Different types of roses have different tolerances to winter cold temperatures.
The lowest temperature a rose can withstand without injury is called its winter
hardiness. Hardiness is not as cut and dried as it sounds, because several
things can influence whether a plant reaches its full hardiness. Consequently,
a plant’s hardiness is generally given in a range. For example, most popular
hybrid teas, floribundas, climbers, and grandifloras can be hardy to –12° to
–6° C (10° to 20° F) without any type of winter protection. Miniatures are a lot
hardier. Many species and shrub roses are hardier still. For example, rugosa
roses are said to be hardy to about –37° C (–35° F). But even within groups of
roses, different varieties can be hardier than others. For example, the lovely
white hybrid tea ‘Pristine’ doesn’t seem to like temperatures much below –1° C
(30° F). Rosarians in Canada who can’t live without ‘Pristine’ treat it like an
annual and replant it each year.
Miniatures are a lot hardier in the cold because they grow on their own roots
and don’t have that vulnerable bud union. However, in most parts of Canada,
they still require winter protection.
So because we mostly live in a cold-winter area, we want to make sure that
you choose roses that can survive the winter with a minimum of injury. But
how do you know how cold it usually gets in your area? Living in Canada, the
easiest way is to look at the Plant Hardiness Zone Map, as shown in the colour
section. (The Quick Reference Card right inside the front cover of this book
includes a zone and temperature conversion chart.)
This system of plant hardiness zones divides Canada into nine regions based
on average winter minimum temperatures. The warmest, Zone 9, has an average
winter minimum above 4° C (40° F) , while zone 1 is something short of tundra
frozen solid. Zones 1 through 9 are further divided into a and b regions to
distinguish zones where minimum winter temperatures differ by five degrees.
46
Part I: Roses 101

Making some Canadian distinctions
The confusing thing for many Canadian gardeners is that the United States
Department of Agriculture (USDA) system is also widely used in gardening
literature. And although it appears there is only a one-zone difference between
the Canadian and U.S. systems, it is unfortunately not so simple. While your
garden in Eastern Ontario may be Canadian zone 5b and USDA zone 4b, sub-
tracting or adding one zone will not work in all parts of the country. Calgary,
for example, is a Canadian zone 3a but a USDA zone 3b. The difference can
range from half a zone up to two full zones depending on where you live.
You should also be aware that the more recently modified USDA zone map
lumps many areas of Canada together under a single zone. Southern Ontario
has many different zones, as does the Vancouver area, but on the USDA maps,
they tend to appear as single zones. Even the Canadian hardiness zone map,
developed in 1967, does not reflect many of the climate changes we are
experiencing today. What’s a gardener to do?
There is a bottom line here and it is quite simple. Unless you live in the coastal
areas of British Columbia or the warmer zones of Southern Ontario, you had
better protect your roses for the winter in a serious way. Or, you have to
grow those roses that are cast iron when it comes to winter hardiness. See
Chapter 21 for information on protecting roses.
Most rose books and some catalogues list hybrid tea roses as being hardy
to between –23° to –29° C (–10° to –20° F), but that’s with some type of winter
protection, such as mounding soil over the base of the plant. Without protec-
tion, modern roses, like hybrid teas, floribundas, and most climbers, are
damaged or killed by temperatures of –12° C (10° F) and colder. When you
think about it, there aren’t too many areas of Canada that don’t see –12° C
winter temperatures at some point in the season.
Rose hardiness isn’t at all precise. In fact, sometimes it’s downright confound-
ing. Early cold snaps in fall, or late ones in spring, can damage plants that you
normally think of as hardy. And different types of cold damage exist. Sometimes
just the tips of the canes die; other times everything above the ground dies;
and occasionally the whole plant ends up deader than a doornail. To further
complicate things, rootstock choice, dry winter winds, bright sunshine, and
even how you care for a rose prior to cold weather affects its capability to
withstand winter weather.
Here are some strategies to make sure that your roses survive the winter:
  Plant hardy types. Many roses, including the ones listed near the end of
this chapter, have good cold hardiness. You may also want to check out
mail-order catalogues that specialize in hardy roses. See Appendix B for
listings.

  Grow own-root roses. They are hardier than budded roses. Roses that
grow on their own roots, like most miniatures, many old garden roses,
and some of the more recent introductions like the ‘Dream’ series, don’t
have that vulnerable bud union that most modern roses have. If winter
kills your own-root rose to the ground (but not below the ground), it is
more likely to resprout in the spring.
  Plant deep. If you don’t buy own-root roses, plant deeper than normal
so that the bud union is well below the soil surface and protected by the
layer of soil above it. For more information about bud unions and planting,
see Chapter 17.
  Use winter protection. For various techniques, see Chapter 21.
A New Meaning for Red Hot
Hot weather during the day and at night has some surprising effects on how
roses perform and how you should care for them.
Probably most interesting is how temperature affects the colour and character
of roses. Red roses with many petals (more than 45 to 50), like ‘Mister Lincoln’,
need heat, especially at night, to open properly. When grown in cooler areas,
(zone 5a or below) or if the summer nights are cool one season, the flower
petals tend to stay in a ball and don’t unfurl completely. This can be really
frustrating for Canadian gardeners in zones 5 or colder, and sooner or later,
Mr. Lincoln will wind up in the compost pile.
If you find your favourite novelty or bicoloured variety performs poorly out
in the hot sun, you may want to move the plant so that it receives a very little
bit of midday shade. Remember, though, that roses require at least six full hours
of full, hot sun every day to bloom well. Only the very hottest of Canadian
gardens will find it necessary to protect heat-sensitive roses from the sun. We
simply do not have Texas weather. Also, before you blame poor performance
on temperature, ensure your feeding and watering are adequate. Most growth
problems are cultural, not temperature related.
The temperature will influence the flower pattern of bicoloured roses. When
summers are warm, their colours meld together and it is hard to tell where
one colour starts and the other ends. When it is cool, their colour patterns are
more distinct with clear divisions between the colours.
Heat can affect your roses in other ways, too. While this has traditionally
been a problem in the southern United States, the last few years have seen
very high and prolonged temperatures in Canada; gardeners might consider
the following information if they are having trouble with some tender roses.
48
Part I: Roses 101

Rose growth (indeed all plant growth) really slows down when the temperature
climbs over 32° C (90° F). Flowers are smaller than they are in the cooler
temperatures of early spring or late fall, and flower production, or reblooming,
takes longer. As well, the petals on some varieties, like the wonderful new
‘Scentimental’, a striped floribunda, may scorch or wilt in super-hot sun.
Varieties like it are definitely worth the extra effort, but they benefit from
being planted where they get partial shade during the hottest hours of the
afternoon.
How hot it is also dictates how you care for your roses. The hotter it is, the
more often you have to water. The soil in which roses are planted should
never dry out, but in hot weather, roses really take a beating if they don’t have
plenty of water. If the heat combines with summer rainfall or high humidity . . .
well, that’s a horse of a different colour.
Sultry Summers and Sweaty Roses
We can’t say it often enough, and it’s certainly worth pounding into your head:
The drier or hotter it is, the more often you have to water.
That said, the level of atmospheric humidity in summer, which is often related
to the amount of rainfall or fog (or just plain mugginess), has an important
impact on the diseases, and sometimes the insects, that attack roses. For
example:
  Where it’s hot, humid, and rainy in summer (Hello, Victoria B.C.!), or
where days are hot and nights are cool, black spot, a fungus that makes
round black spots on rose leaves, will be a problem.
  Where nights are humid and cool (Take a bow, Halifax), powdery mildew,
a fungus that causes twisting shoots and silvery fuzz on rose leaves, may
show up.
  Where humidity is low and summers are hot and dry (Can you say
Saskatoon?), rust, another fungus that looks like orange spots on leaves
and stems, can be troublesome. And red spider mite, a microscopic spider
that sucks the life out of rose leaves, will be more of a problem.
So you need to know which pests and diseases are likely to show up in your
area. When you’re in the know, you can choose varieties that are resistant to
those problems or know when to expect to have to do battle. For more
information, see Chapter 22, “Outsmarting Rose Pests and Diseases.”

Chapter 4: The Climates of the Rose

Tiny Climates Not Just for Tiny Roses
This chapter should give you a pretty good idea of how climate factors such
as low winter temperatures, summer heat and humidity, and the amount of
sunshine can affect the roses you want to grow. But take things a step further.
You know that big block of wood, nails, bricks, and cement that sits in the
middle of your property and you call home? Well, its overwhelming size affects
small areas of your garden and makes their climate just a little different from
the overall climates of your neighbourhood. These little areas are called
microclimates. Microclimates are localized climates that, because of their
proximity to large buildings or trees, or because of the way the land slopes,
differ from the overall climate of an area.
If you walk around your home in the morning and again in the afternoon on a
summer day, you’ll probably see the following microclimates, illustrated in
Figure 4-1:

  The east side is nice and sunny in the morning and cool and shady in
the afternoon.
  The north side is shady almost all day. It’s not the best place for roses.
As you walk, you may also notice that other large objects, especially trees,
create microclimates that change from morning to afternoon. Even a south-
facing slope is warmer than other parts of the garden, simply because it bathes
in sun almost all day. Figure 4-2 shows the ideal planting situation.

Once you identify the microclimates around your home, you can choose just
the right spot for planting roses. In general, roses want sun all day, as shown
in Figure 4-2. And, if you happen to live in a cooler area, you can use the extra
heat generated by the south- or west-facing walls of your house to protect
your roses. At the other extreme, in urban areas the reflections and reflected
heat from absorbed sun on concrete and asphalt creates gardens so hot that
plants are stressed and some rose colours will bleach. That said, plant your
roses where you want them and hope they grow well. If not, move them
about like furniture until they do grow well. See Chapter 17 for planting and
moving advice.
Roses for All
The world is rich with lists of recommended roses for specific areas, and you
should be able to find a variety that can thrive where you live. Most of these
lists are published by local rose societies (for more information about rose
societies, see Appendix A). Many retail nurseries offer lists of recommendations
as well. You can also visit a local public rose garden and see for yourself how
a rose does in your area. 
But to get you started, we’ve compiled some lists of roses recommended
for their hardiness in Canadian climates. We collected them from local 
rose societies and rose experts who have years of experience in growing
great roses.
One thing to keep in mind about these lists is that they may not include some
of the newest varieties. The newer varieties were introduced so recently that
there hasn’t been enough time to evaluate them completely. However, many
of the newer varieties, especially the award winners, grow well in nearly all
climates. Some of them look so great that you may want to throw caution to
the wind and evaluate them for yourself. What a novel idea.
Roses for cold-winter climates
Where winters are really brutal (–34° C or –30° F and colder), you’re best off
with the hardiest shrub roses, particularly any of the Morden and Explorer
series, bred right here in Canada for our winters, and any of the rugosas.
Table 4-1 lists a few of these as well as some other hardy roses that not only
survive winters in Canadian zone 3 without protection but also bloom the 
following season, even when canes that died in the winter were pruned almost
to the ground in the spring.

Some modern roses are hardier than others. We compiled the lists of plants in
Tables 4-2 through 4-7 from recommended lists from cold-winter regions. We
don’t list all the hardy roses recommended for each area, but only ones that
showed up on two or more lists. 
Please understand that although Tables 4-2 through 4-4 list the hardiest of the
tender roses, the sad reality is that they all require winter protection in any
area of Canada other than the mildest of British Columbia’s favourite gardens.
Hardiness is a question of degree. Having said that, these will help you push
the boundaries if you live where overwintering roses is borderline at the best
of times. Some of these roses will be difficult to find, while others are common
fare in garden centres. Check out the mail-order resources in Appendix B.
If you’re looking for some reasonably hardy hybrid teas, here you are. We think
you can make a go of these. Check Chapter 8 for more information.

Climbing roses need winter protection in most parts of Canada. Anyone in zone
6 and warmer can use Table 4-6 as a guideline for hardy climbers. Colder-area
gardeners — zone 5 and colder — should use Table 4-7 as their guide since
the roses in the Explorer series make decent climbing displays and have better

Roses for areas with cool summers
Roses in Tables 4-9 through 4-14 are recommended for areas with cooler 
summers. Varieties marked with an asterisk (*) have exceptional disease
resistance where summers are cool and foggy.
Like most roses, hybrid teas like some good hot sun, but we think you can make
these ones work for you even if you live where summers aren’t so sweltering.

Using Roses in
Your Garden

In this part . . .
T
his is probably the most useful part of this book. Many
people overlook the fact that roses not only are hard-
working garden plants but also are one of the most colourful
ﬂowering shrubs.
Next time you do some landscaping, think of roses instead
of, say, junipers or cotoneaster. When you want summer
colour, use roses along with your marigolds and petunias.
When you want some colour on your front porch, put roses
in a container. Roses work in fantastically colourful ways.

H
ave you ever walked into a garden or yard and thought, “Wow, this is
beautiful — every plant in its place, just the right mix of colours and
textures, and everything so well organized. Someone planned this garden
perfectly!”
Good landscaping does take planning and organization. You can find some
basic landscape techniques, such as drawing plans and laying paths and
patios, described in Gardening For Canadians For Dummies. But when dealing
with roses, we hope that you really take one piece of advice to heart: Before
you plant any rose, think carefully about where you want to plant it and the
impact it will have on your garden or landscape. Of course, you have to pro-
vide the plant with the requirements for healthy growth in terms of sunshine,
soil, and the like, and that’s covered in Part IV of this book. But also think
about how roses can work for you, how they might fill basic landscape roles
as hedges, screens, ground covers, barriers, and more. Even more important,
how will their colours blend with the plants in the rest of your garden? How
will they affect your emotions when you look at them? Will they add excitement
or serenity to your garden?
You may think that we’ve gone over the edge, but don’t be so sure. Roses can
fill traditional landscape roles that you may not have considered. And the
colours they bring to a garden are bright and dramatic — they have an impact
on the look of your yard. Unless you give those colours a little thought, your
garden may end up looking like a box of crayons that’s been left out in the sun
on a hot summer day.

This chapter can help you avoid melted crayon syndrome and show you not
only how to use colours and plant texture wisely, but also how to make roses
work hard as hedges, screens, ground covers, and more.
Painting the Landscape with
Colourful Roses
Taste in colours is a personal thing. If your favourite colour is red and you
want a red rose, who can argue with that? Go for it! But if you want to create
a harmonious display of colour throughout your garden, you want to think
carefully about the colours you choose and how they blend with other plants,
and even with the colour of your home.
Different colours have different effects on people’s emotions. Red and orange
are warm colours that can actually create excitement for viewers. These are
great colours for gardens primarily used for entertaining. Blue and pink have
the opposite effect. They feel cool and soothing and lend a relaxed mood to
the garden. So, if your garden is for relaxing in after the day’s work, emphasize
blues and pinks with the odd accent of yellow, orange, or red. Having said all
that, the best thing to do is choose colours you like. You can’t grow wrong
that way.
In cool climates, you may want to warm things up with red roses. If you want
to attract attention to a certain area of the garden, use bright colours in that
spot — they’re sure to attract the eye. Bright colours can also lead the eye
away from sore spots in the garden.
Choosing Colour Schemes
There are two ways to choose your colour scheme. You can stay with one or
two basic colours and only add plants that flower in shades of those colours;
this is the artistic method of garden colouring. The normal way that most of
us work is to add the plants we like regardless of whether the artists approve
or not. Take it from us, either way works if you like the effect.
Basically, colours combine in two ways:
  Harmonious colours blend together smoothly and have a soothing effect.
They are usually shades of one of the primary colours — red, yellow, and
blue. Pink and red are harmonious colours, as are yellow and orange,
and blue and green.
66
Part II: Using Roses in Your Garden

  Contrasting colours highlight each other, making each colour appear
brighter and stronger than it would by itself. You create the strongest
colour contrasts by putting one primary colour next to another, such as
blue next to red or yellow next to blue. In a garden, contrasting colours
tend to attract the eye and stand out. They also make things appear
closer when viewed from a distance. If used too much, they can be
overpowering and dominate a garden.
If you feel a little uneasy about picking colours, keep your choices simple.
Fewer colours often work better than more. Some of the most stunning gardens
use just one flower colour, such as yellow, or pink. Particularly where you have
a good background of green foliage, a single-colour garden offers a rare beauty.
Stay away from white gardens, though, as they are one of the most difficult
gardens to successfully create. You might even go to a hardware store and
pick up some paint chips and use them to experiment with different colour
combinations. After you find a combination you like, you can go to Part III
and find roses to match.
Often you can get clues about good colours to use from the colour of your
house, from existing plants, or from landscape features. For example, using
roses that combine well with the trim or siding colour of your house can tie
your whole landscape together into one harmonious picture. Or take a cue
from your patio, walks, or walls. Pink ‘Simplicity’ roses around a brick patio are
drop-dead gorgeous, as are red ‘John Cabot’ roses on a brick or wooden fence.
You can also find potential colour combinations in flowers themselves. For
example, say your favourite rose is the pink and white hybrid tea ‘Secret’. If
you combine that rose with other flowers that bloom in shades of white and
pink, such as petunias or hardy geraniums, you have a guaranteed winner.
Mixing Plant Texture and Form
After you have an idea of how to work with colour, think for a minute about
plant growth habit and texture. Basically, a plant’s habit is determined by
how it grows — stiff and upright, low and spreading, rounded, grasslike, and
on and on. You can describe a plant’s growth habit in a million ways.
A plant’s texture is usually described as fine or bold, soft or coarse, or some-
where in between. Texture is most often related to the size and density of the
foliage. Plants with many small or finely divided leaves, such as ferns, have fine,
or soft, texture. Plants with larger or stiff leaves, such as rhododendrons, are
said to have bold, or coarse, texture. Bold plants tend to stand out and appear
closer. Soft-textured plants tend to recede and look like they’re farther away.
67
Chapter 5: Landscaping with Roses

Flowers also vary in texture and form. Most larger roses have to be considered
bold flowers, especially when compared with more diminutive blooms like
those of the annual lobelia or a perennial salvia. But some roses with smaller
flowers are more finely textured. Many roses, especially the crinkly-leafed
rugosas and the ferny moss roses (see Chapter 14), have foliage or stems with
unique texture. They look good even when they’re not in bloom.
Don’t worry about exactly what texture or growth habit a plant has. Just realize
that plants look different. What a news flash! When you’re mixing roses with
other plants, which is the topic of Chapter 6, you can create more natural and
interesting situations by blending plants with different habits and textures, or
even by using roses with different textures. For example, the soft foliage of
miniature roses would get lost among other fine-textured plants. But when
mixed with bolder plants, miniatures stand out and show their real character.
Roses require a higher soil pH than some evergreens, such as rhododendrons
and kalmia. Avoid planting roses in the same beds with such plants if you
expect both to thrive.
Creating a Style All Your Own
On a very basic level, gardens can be described as formal or informal in style.
Formal gardens have a lot of straight lines and geometric shapes and seem
very well organized. Informal gardens are less rigid and more natural, with
plants growing the way they want, without severe pruning or shaping.
Even though distinguishing between formal and informal gardens is difficult
(and who cares, anyway?), you should know that you can use roses to create
either style. If you think that your garden needs a little more formality or
organization, surround your cutting garden of hybrid teas with a low-growing,
neatly clipped boxwood or dwarf alpine currant hedge. Voilà! — the formality
of kings. Planting long rows of floribundas, shrub roses, or miniature roses
as hedges also creates formality, especially if you put a clipped hedge
behind them.
If informality is more your style, plant some old garden or Explorer roses
way in the back of your yard and just let them have their way. They create a
mounding, rolling background with a wonderfully wild look. Mixing shrub and
floribunda roses in perennial borders or combining them with other blooming
plants (the subject of Chapter 6) also results in a more informal style.
68
Part II: Using Roses in Your Garden

Here are some other tips to remember when landscaping with roses:
  Keep short in the front, tall in the back. Seems obvious, but people always
forget. Keep shorter plants in front, adding gradually taller plants, with
the very tallest ones in the back. That way, nothing is obscured.
  Stick to odd-numbered groupings. Roses, or any plants, for that matter,
look more natural when grouped in odd numbers. Don’t ask why this
technique works; it just does.
  Use soft colours in small spaces. Lighter colours tend to recede and make
a small garden look bigger. Darker or contrasting colours can make a
small garden appear even more cramped.
  Use repetition to provide continuity. Even though mixing plants of differ-
ent texture or form adds interest to a garden, repeating certain plants or
groups of plants throughout a garden adds rhythm and order. So try to
do a little bit of both.
Putting Roses to Work
Using roses in traditional landscape situations (that is, a landscape with
hedges, ground covers, edgings, and so on) is becoming increasingly popular.
And it’s easy to see why. Roses offer one of the longest seasons of bloom of
any flowering shrub, and newer varieties have been almost custom designed
for landscape uses such as hedges, ground covers, edgings, and borders.
In the following sections, we list our favourite roses for using in traditional
landscape situations. We include the type of rose and its colour so that you can
easily find that plant in the appropriate section of Part III of this book.
Using roses for hedges
You can plant roses close together to create a continuous hedge. You won’t get
a formal hedge with neatly clipped edges; instead, the hedge has an informal
style — less pruning enables the plants to bloom more. (For more information
about pruning, see Chapter 20.) With the exception of warmer areas in British
Columbia, tender roses used for hedging will have to be well protected over
the winter. Unless the rose used is quite hardy, such as an Explorer, Parkland,
or hardy shrub rose, the rose canes will be severely shortened by winter
damage. Note that floribundas, which are often recommended for hedge use,
require winter protection in most parts of Canada and will have to be pruned
down to 30 to 45 centimetres (12 to 18 inches) tall in the spring. The Explorer
rose ‘John Cabot’ makes one of the most spectacular hedges for a Canadian
garden.
69
Chapter 5: Landscaping with Roses

Most of these roses can also be used for continuous borders or for back-
grounds to other plantings. A border differs slightly from a hedge in that a
border can be viewed from only one side — for example, a row of roses
planted at the base of a fence or wall. A hedge usually separates two areas
and is attractive from both sides.
These plants create hedges that vary in height according to the variety you use
and how often you prune it. But most are in the 1- to 1.8-metre (3- to 6-foot)
range, depending on the climate you live in. Some of our favourite hedge roses
and their heights are listed below.
Explorer roses that require little or no winter protection to zone 3 are good
choices:
  ‘Champlain’: Red, 0.9–1.2 m (3–4 ft.)
  ‘Jens Munk’: Light pink, 1.5–1.8 m (5–6 ft.)
  ‘John Cabot’: Red, 1.8–2.1 m (6–7 ft.)
  ‘Frontenac’: Deep pink, 0.9–1.2 m (3–4 ft.)
  ‘John Franklin’: Medium red, 1.2–1.8 m (4–6 ft.)
These shrub and rugosa (old garden roses), needing little or no winter
protection to zone 4, also make fine hedges:
  ‘F.J. Grootendorst’: Light red, 0.9–1.2 m (3–4 ft.)
  ‘Autumn Bouquet’: Deep pink, 0.9–1.2 m (3–4 ft.)
  ‘Carefree Beauty’: Medium pink, 0.9–1.2 m (3–4 ft.)
  ‘Country Dancer’: Deep pink, 0.9–1.2 m (3–4 ft.)
  ‘Golden Wings’: Medium yellow, 0.9–1.2 m (3–4 ft.)
  ‘Henry Hudson’: White, 0.5–1 m (1.5–3 ft.)
  ‘Hansa’: Purple-red, 1.8–2 m (6–7 ft.)
  ‘Pink Grootendorst’: Medium pink, 1.2–1.5 m (4–5 ft.)
Using roses for edgings
An edging is a continuous planting of low-growing plants at the base of taller
plants, or along a walkway, patio, or other garden surface. Edgings are one of
the best ways to use miniature roses, which have a strong presence in the
following list. To create a continuous edging, plant 30 to 45 centimetres (12
to 18 inches) apart so when they grow, the branches intertwine to create an
edging. All of these will require winter protection in all but the warmest, zone
8 to 9 parts of Canada.

Using roses for ground covers
Although many rose books written for gardeners in warmer climates describe
how to use roses for ground covers, here in Canada most of the hardy roses
are taller, upright forms. Everything else dies back to the ground in zone 5 or
colder, including the otherwise wonderful ‘Flower Carpet’ roses. Roses can
however, make an excellent spreading plant that blooms all summer. (See
Chapter 18 for mulching and weed control suggestions.)
71
Chapter 5: Landscaping with Roses
Please don’t consider roses as a weed barrier
the way gardeners normally use the term “ground
cover.” Because they die back, roses really don’t
stop weeds. We’ve had the best results with
using some unnamed climbing roses obtained
at a plant sale. These roses are planted deeply
(see Chapters 17 and 21) and die back to the
ground every winter. In the spring, they produce
a half-dozen, ground-hugging shoots that are 1.2
to 1.8 metres (4 to 6 feet) long. The rose gives a
magnificent series of blooms repeating for most
of the summer. This could be done with any
climbing rose that blooms on new wood.
Roses that hug the ground

You can create an interesting effect if you secure the ends of long canes to
the ground with wire pegs. This process, called pegging, is initially done when
the plants are dormant, but you generally have to reinforce and repeat the
pegging with new growth throughout the growing season. The long, arching
canes bloom along their entire length and stay close to the ground. You can
make your own pegs by cutting up wire coat hangers into 30-centimetre (12-
inch) pieces and shaping each one into a U shape. Just put a peg over the end
of each cane and push it into the ground. The taller Explorer roses normally
used for climbers are excellent candidates for pegging if you peg the canes
while they are young and soft.
For those of you who live in Canada’s equivalent of the tropics (zones 8 or 9),
there are a few roses that will do a good job as a ground cover. For the most
part, rose varieties that make good ground covers are vigorous, spreading
plants. However, many shrubby roses, such as low-growing floribundas, shrubs,
and miniatures, can be planted en masse to cover a large area.
The following are some of the best spreading roses for use as ground covers.
Most should be planted 90 centimetres (3 feet) apart, depending on the vigour
of the variety. Leave the most space between vigorous roses.
  ‘Alba Meidiland’: White shrub
  ‘Dortmund’: Red and white climber
  ‘Flower Carpet’ series: Pink, white, and the brand-new ‘Appleblossom’
low shrub

Part II: Using Roses in Your Garden

Using roses for barriers
The thorny nature of most roses makes them formidable barriers for keeping
people and animals from going where you don’t want them to. Planting near
windows to deter intruders from approaching your home is a great example.
Although any thorny rose works, some types are nastier than others. ‘Jens
Munk’, one of the Explorer series, is a miserable plant to prune and work with
due to its abundant thorns; it has “bitten” more gardeners more times than we
care to mention. This is an excellent barrier plant! Other good barriers include
many of the species and old garden roses, shrubs, and climbers.
Using roses on fences, arbours, and walls
Training a climbing rose to sprawl on a fence, wall, or trellis is one of the most
beautiful ways to work roses into the landscape and bring their flowers right
up to eye level. (See Chapter 12 for more information about climbers.) How-
ever, you must realize that training is the key word here. Climbing roses are
not true vines. They don’t naturally cling to or wrap around a nearby vertical
object like vines do. You must plant them near a support structure, like a fence,
post, arbour, wall, or trellis, and regularly tie their canes to that structure to
make them stay put.
Following are several types of support structures for climbing roses. In all
cases, the structure must be sturdy. A mature climber can be quite heavy and
can break any support that’s not strong enough to handle the weight.
  Fences: Split rail, chain link, even barbed wire — you can turn any sturdy
fence into a colourful picture when you use it to support a climbing rose.
If you have solid fences with few places to tie to, use a trellis or stretch
wire between eye screws as described in the “Walls” section.
  Walls: Here you usually have to attach some type of support to the wall.
One way is to thread 14- or 16-gauge galvanized wire through eyebolts
attached to the wall. If you have masonry walls, you have to use bolts
with expanding anchors. But your local hardware store can help you make
the right choice. Arrange the wires vertically, horizontally, or in a fan
shape — whatever your fancy dictates. You can even attach the rose
directly to the bolts and skip the wire altogether.
  Trellises: A handsome trellis covered with a climbing rose can be a piece
of art, turning a blank wall into a garden focal point. Trellises come in
many shapes and sizes and are constructed from a variety of materials,
including wood lath, metal, and plastic. They can be free-standing or
attached to walls and fences. A trip to a local lumberyard or garden centre
or a browse through the sources listed in Appendix B of this book can
give you a good idea of the variety that’s available. Or if you’re handy, you
can get a good idea of what you can make yourself.

Lattice, one of the most common types of trellis, is designed for mounting
on walls or fences. You can also attach it to fence posts for an inexpensive
screen. When securing lattice directly to a solid surface, extend the
connecting supports several centimetres beyond the surface so that the
trellis doesn’t lie directly on the surface. This space improves air circula-
tion around the rose, which helps to reduce pest and disease problems.
To make house painting or other maintenance easier, fasten the lattice-
work to hinges at the bottom so that you can lay back the trellis for easy
access to the wall. Use sturdy, construction-grade metal hooks and eyes
to attach the trellis to the wall at the top.
  Arbours and pergolas: Arbours and pergolas differ from trellises in that
they have a horizontal top and are usually free-standing, supported by
posts or trellis-like sides. (See Figure 5-1.) You train a rose up the support
and then over the top. Like trellises, you can make arbours and pergolas
74

from a variety of materials, from wood to plastic to metal. They also
range in size from small enough to frame the entry to a yard or garden to
large enough to cover a patio or entire walkway. Also like trellises, many
arbours and pergolas are quite ornate or whimsical and can serve as the
focal point of a garden.
You can find many styles of prefabricated arbours in the mail-order rose
catalogues listed in Appendix B. Or if you’re a handy carpenter, you can
build your own. You may want to consult a carpenter or builder for advice,
though, especially if you plan to build a large arbour. One other tip: Use
pressure-treated lumber, or rot-resistant wood like cedar or redwood, in
any part of the structure that comes in contact with the soil.
  Pillars: A pillar is a sturdy, rot-resistant wood or metal post set in the
ground. The size and shape of the pillar can vary as long as the pillar
itself is firmly embedded. You then plant a climber at the base and tie it
to the pillar as it grows.

ertain plants just seem to belong together. Maybe their shapes are a
perfect contrast. Or maybe their flower colours blend together just right.
Or possibly the plants share a common history. Whatever the reason, many
plants combine with roses, including other roses, resulting in classic beauty.
That’s what this chapter is all about: specific plants that form classic combina-
tions with roses — plant combinations that give your garden an artist’s touch.
We list many plants here, and you’ll need more information about heights,
habits, and bloom times to combine them effectively. This kind of data is
almost always included in garden catalogue descriptions (or should be), or
you can find it in books about specific types of plants. Refer to the sources in
Appendix B to help you locate the plants you want.
We list just a few of the plants that we know work well as companions for
roses, but hundreds of others exist as well. Besides, to paraphrase Duke

looks good, it probably is.

The Basics of Combining Plants
This chapter covers basic principles of combining colours and plant textures,
and expands on the landscaping ideas outlined in Chapter 5. We’re going to
quickly repeat some of those principles and throw in some new suggestions
as well:
  Choose colours wisely. Select the colours you want to work with, taking
clues from the colour of your house, garden structures, other plants, or
whatever else you have in your yard, and stick with them.
  Mix and match plant textures. Blend bold textures with soft textures,
vertical shapes with horizontal ones, and round plants with arching
plants. Mix plants the way nature would.
  Unite the overall. Repeat some plant combinations to add unity to the
garden.
  Use bright colours to direct the eye. If you want to create a focal point
in your garden, surround the area with bright or contrasting colours.
Even one bright red rose draws the eye to a garden feature such as a
small fountain or bird bath.
  Vary heights. In general, use lower plants in front and taller ones in back.
However, you don’t have to follow this rule religiously. Mixing things up
a bit can be interesting.
  Match bloom times carefully. Most roses have a long bloom season, so
you want to make sure that the other plantings you use also look good
over a long season. Combine plants with a staggered bloom season so that
you have colour in spring, summer, and fall. Use flowering perennials,
shrubs, and annuals.
  Don’t forget the foliage. One way to make sure that your garden always
looks good is to combine roses with plants that have attractive foliage.
We give you some ideas a little later in this chapter.
  Match cultural requirements. Roses like full sun, regular water, and
close to a neutral pH. The plants you combine with them should, too.
Otherwise, one or the other will be unhappy. And so will you.
  Keep it simple. Always the best advice. Don’t get carried away with too
many colours or too many different kinds of plants. Simplify, and
everything will be fine.
Okay, now that you’re an expert, you’re ready to get to the good part: choosing
your plants.

Part II: Using Roses in Your Garden

Plants That Cover the Bases
Many roses, especially hybrid teas and some tall floribundas, tend to get a bit
open and sparsely foliaged at the base of the plant. To alleviate this problem,
you can plant low-growing or spreading plants right in front of them.
An obvious first choice if there is adequate sunshine at the base of the rose
is to use some of the compact miniature roses listed for use as edgings in
Chapter 5. But many other options are available; the following sections list
some favourite perennial and annual plants that you can use. See Figure 6-1
for an example of how perennial and annual plants can fill in around the base
of roses.
Perennials are plants that survive from year to year in your garden, usually at
least three years. Biennials grow leaves the first year; flower, set seed, and die
the second. Annuals are plants that complete their entire life cycle from seed
to seed in one growing season.

Perennials
Here are some perennial plants — ones that live on in your garden from year
to year and combine well with roses.
  Bellflower (Campanula species): Several low-growing species, blues,
pinks, and whites
  Cornflowers (Centaurea species): Rose flowers in midsummer
  Clematis (Clematis many species): A variety of colours for climbing
through larger roses
  Threadleaf coreopsis or tickseed (Coreopsis verticillata, C. rosea and
their cultivars): Yellow or pink, low mound shape, blooms all summer
  Delphinium hybrids: Range of colours, go well with roses
  Cranesbill (Geranium endressi and others): Blossoms range from white
to purple, one of our favourites for colour and foliage
  Baby’s breath (Gypsophila species): White tall form is best to combine
with roses
  Coral bells (Heuchera species): Great foliage and delicate white, pink, or
red flower spikes
  Siberian iris (Iris sibirica): Range of colours for early summer blooms
  Common or English lavender (Lavandula angustifolia, ‘Hidcote’ & other
cultivars): Grey-green foliage with flowers from pink to deep violet,
excellent at the base of non-fragrant roses
  Russian sage (Perovskia atriplicifolia): Violet, likes good drainage so avoid
on clay soils
  Catnip (Nepeta grandiflora or Nepeta ‘Six Hills Giant’): Violet masses —
wonderful
  Speedwell (Veronica longifolia and cultivars): Violets and white
  Wild indigo (Baptisia australis): Blue flowers in early summer
Annuals
Here are some of our favourite annuals to combine with roses.
  Annual mallow (Lavatera trimestris ‘Pink Beauty’): Wonderful pink
hollyhock-like blooms
  Flossflower (Ageratum houstonianum): Great blues
80
Part II: Using Roses in Your Garden

  Cosmos (‘Sensation’ series and ‘Sonata’ series): Choose your colour to
match the roses
  Gazania (‘Dorothy’ and ‘Silvery Beauty’): Yellow blossoms form on a thick
carpet of foliage
  Flowering tobacco (Nicotiana sylvestris): Produces white, evening-fragrant
flowers. Other hybrids in other colours such as pink can be used as well
if the height and colour go well with your rose
  Pansies (Viola hybrida and species): Popular standby with many colours
to choose from
  Sweet alyssum (Lobularia maritima): Covered with pink, purple, or white
flowers
  Sweet peas (Lathyrus odoratus): Pink, white, and purple — grow them as
vines through the rose
  Zinnias (Zinnia elegans): Many colours — use the compact varieties like
the Peter Pan series
Roses and Herbs
Roses share many things with aromatic herb plants — their fragrant flowers
are used to make potpourri (see Chapter 24 for information about making
potpourri), their hips can be used to make aromatic tea, and the fragrance of
the flower can be extracted for perfumes. Hey, maybe roses are herbs!
In fact, roses and herbs are closely linked and have been planted together for
centuries. Many of the very fragrant old garden roses like the ‘Old Blush’
China rose and the autumn damask rose, Rosa damascena, share a long bond
with herbs. But using any fragrant rose variety makes sense.
The family of plants called herbs is huge and includes many attractive
species, so you have much to choose from. Here are some of our favourites:
  Basil (Ocimum basilicum): Variety of foliage colours and fragrances
  Chamomile (Chamaemelum nobile): Low growing with yellow flowers
  Fennel (Foeniculum vulgare): Airy foliage, especially the variety with
bronze foliage
  Lavender (Lavandula): Blue flowers and aromatic foliage. We’ve listed it
twice because some retailers sell it as a herb and some as a flower. It
doesn’t matter what you call it, it is wonderful with roses
  Parsley (Petroselinum crispum): Bright green, ferny foliage
81
Chapter 6: Roses and Their Partners in the Garden

  Rosemary (Rosmarinus): Many shrubby types with blue flowers
  Sage (Salvia officinalis): Look out especially for the varieties with yellow,
purple, or tricoloured foliage
  Santolina (Santolina): Silvery leaves and yellow flowers
  Scented geraniums (Pelargonium): Many to choose from with wonderfully
fragrant, good-looking leaves and pretty flowers
  Southernwood (Artemisia abrotanum): Beautiful silvery foliage provides
unusual backdrop
  Thyme (Thymus): Of the many to choose from, we especially like yellow-
foliaged creeping thyme and silver thyme
Going for Leaves
Plants with attractive foliage can carry a garden through down times when
little is in bloom. But when roses are in bloom, surrounding foliage plants can
really show them off and light up their colours.
Silver-dusted leaves
To start, consider any plant with grey or silver foliage. These colours tie
everything together and combine especially well with white, pink, red, and
blue flowers. Try one of the following plants, for example:
  Artemisia ludoviciana ‘Valerie Finnis’: Wide silver leaves
  Artemisia ‘Powis Castle’: Great texture and colour
  Artemisia stelleriana ‘Silver Brocade’: Low, compact perennial
  Bush germander (Teucrium): Airy shrub with blue flowers
  Dusty Miller (Centaurea cineraria or Senecio cineraria): Great annuals
with purple or yellow flowers
  Lamb’s ears (Stachys byzantina): Silver foliage has wonderfully soft
texture
  Lavender cotton (Santolina): Silvery leaves and yellow flowers, annual
  Silver sage (Salvia argentea): Huge, woolly silver leaves, biennial
  Silver thyme (Thymus vulgaris ‘Argenteus’): Low and aromatic
  Yarrow (Achillea): Silver foliage and colourful flowers
82
Part II: Using Roses in Your Garden

Grassy and spiky leaves
Here’s a list of rose companions that are interesting mostly for their grass or
grasslike leaves. In addition, these plants produce flowers in late summer and
fall — just when roses are putting on their last show of the season.
  Blue fescue (Festuca glauca): Silver-blue leaves on a low, mounding grass
  Daylily (Hemerocallis hybrids): Grassy leaves and mostly orange and
yellow trumpet-shaped flowers
  Feather grass (Stipa): Graceful grasses and soft-textured plumes
  Iris (Iris species): Strap-like leaves and classic flowers in many shades
  Lily (Lilium species): Upright plants and colourful trumpet-shaped blooms
  Lily-of-the-Nile (Agapanthus africanus): Strap-like leaves and bright blue
flower balls, tender in zone 6
  Purple fountain grass (Pennisetum setaceum ‘Rubrum’): Purplish bronze
leaves and soft plumes
  Spiderwort (Tradescantia): Purple, rose, or white blossoms
White for When the Night Is Bright
Remember that whole thing about there being beauty in simplicity? Well, how
about a garden with nothing but white flowers? While this can be a difficult
garden to design, good white gardens are stunning during the day (especially
if you have a lot of green background), and at night with a full moon. With
good outdoor lighting, the garden comes alive. If done poorly, they are hot
and uncomfortable gardens.
If you want to take your best shot at it (and we all do, sooner or later), many
white roses are available to help you on your way. The best are described in
Part III and pictured in the colour section of this book. But do you want the
real truth? Our favourite white rose is ‘Iceberg’, a floribunda. It gives more
bloom for your buck than nearly any other white rose.
Following are other white flowering plants that you can use with roses in a
moonlit garden. Some come in colours other than white, so make sure to
choose the white-flowering varieties. Throw in some of the silvery or grey-
foliaged plants mentioned earlier, too. They also reflect light.
  Snapdragon (Antirrhinum majus): Tall spikes of flowers
  Jupiter’s beard (Centranthus ruber): Tall flower spikes
83
Chapter 6: Roses and Their Partners in the Garden

  Mums (Chrysanthemum): Beautiful fall flowers
  Cosmos (Cosmos bipinnatus): Airy foliage and daisy-like flowers
  Daisies: Many different species with bright white flowers
  Dianthus (Dianthus): Many to choose from, some fragrant
  Candytuft (Iberis sempervirens): Whitest of white on a compact plant
  Sweet alyssum (Lobularia maritima): Ground-hugging carpet of white
  Geraniums (Pelargonium): Great balls of white
  Datura or Angel’s Trumpets (Datura species and Brugmansia species):
Large white or pink trumpets on plants that are 90 to 180 centimetres
(3 to 6 feet) tall
When combining any plants, don’t forget to consider their height, habit, and
growing requirements, as mentioned earlier in this chapter.

Growing Roses in Containers
In This Chapter
 Knowing which roses are best in pots
 Using a variety of containers
 Deciding how big your containers should be
 Uncovering the truth about potting soil
 Planting in containers
 Caring for roses grown in pots
R
oses are great plants for growing in containers. Choose the right pot,
and you turn any rose into a garden feature. Not only that, but growing
roses in containers also makes the plants mobile — you can move them out
front when they’re in bloom and then put them out of the way when they’re
not. And you can cart them off to a protected location when winters get cold.
Growing roses in containers can also solve problems. If you have bad soil, for
example, you can fill a pot with a perfect soil mix purchased from a nursery
and plant in that. And you always have room for a pot or two even if you have
a very small garden, and especially if your “garden” is just a patio, porch, or
balcony.
So gardening in containers really adds a wonderful new dimension to growing
roses. But this kind of gardening is not quite the same as growing roses in open
ground. You need to choose the right rose, the right pot, and the right soil.
And after you plant the rose in a container, you need to care for it properly,
which also has its nuances. That’s what this chapter’s about: turning you into
an expert container gardener.
Putting the Right Rose in the Right Pot
If you really set your mind to it, you can grow any rose in any pot, but after a
while, some of the large types get very hard to care for and keep in bounds.
Smaller, compact roses are really best for growing in containers. These include

miniatures, polyanthas and floribundas, and some shrub roses. You also can
grow any hybrid tea in a container, but to look their best, they usually need
to be combined with other low-growing plants. For suggestions, see the lists
of plants in Chapter 5. We particularly like growing dark blue violas and
pansies with pink rose varieties.
Still, some floribundas and polyanthas (Chapter 10) and shrub roses
(Chapter 13) just fit in a pot better than others. The following are some of
our favourites. Add to the list any miniature rose you like.
  ‘Bonica’: Pink shrub
  ‘Carefree Delight’: Pink shrub
  ‘Carefree Wonder’: Pink and white shrub
  ‘China Doll’: Pink polyantha
  ‘Dream’ series: Pink, yellow, red, and orange small shrubs
  ‘Europeana’: Red floribunda
  ‘Flower Carpet’: Pink shrub
  ‘Iceberg’: White floribunda
  ‘Margaret Merrill’: White floribunda
  ‘Margo Koster’: Coral floribunda
  ‘Regensberg’: White and pink floribunda
  ‘Sun Flare’: Yellow floribunda
  ‘The Fairy’: Pink polyantha
Containing the Roots
You may not realize it yet, but an amazing variety of plant containers exists.
If you don’t believe us, go to a large nursery or garden centre and compare
sizes, shapes, and materials.
The first criterion in choosing a container is whether you like how it looks.
If you want to grow roses in old coffee cans, fine; just don’t invite us over to
take pictures. A nice-looking pot can really turn a healthy rose into something
special. A pretty pot also makes everything else around it look better. A few
nice pots can turn a patio into a perfectly ornamented garden room. Or they
can turn a front porch into an entry that elegantly says, “Welcome.”
After you decide what looks good, you should be aware of some other char-
acteristics of various types of containers. They may or may not sway your
decision on what you buy, but some kinds of containers last longer than
others; some are heavy, some are light; and some dry out faster than others.
86
Part II: Using Roses in Your Garden

Here are characteristics of some common types of containers:
  Clay pots (shown in Figure 7-1) are attractive, relatively inexpensive, and
come in a variety of styles. They break easily, and the larger ones can be
quite heavy. The most common type is the familiar terra cotta pot, which
is porous and allows the soil to dry out quickly. However, you can get
glazed clay or ceramic pots, which are not only colourful but also hold
water longer. They are more expensive, too. The more expensive ones
(hot-fired) do not flake apart if you let them freeze.
  Plastic pots come in many styles, colours, and sizes. Some are even made
to look like wood or clay pots. They’re lightweight, inexpensive, and keep
soil moist longer than clay pots. Some kinds become brittle after being
in the sun for a year or two, and after they break, about all you can do
with them is to ship them off to a landfill, where they stay for eternity.
87
Chapter 7: Growing Roses in Containers
Figure 7-1:
A rose plant
in a clay pot.

  Wooden pots are attractive, relatively inexpensive, and come in many
styles, sizes, weights, and shapes. They include the very popular and
inexpensive half wine and whiskey barrels (shown in Figure 7-2). With a
little carpentry skill, you can even build your own wooden container.
  Hanging baskets are what they sound like — pots that hang in the air
(see Figure 7-3). Some gardeners build or buy hanging baskets lined with
long-fibre sphagnum moss (the natural state of sphagnum moss before it
is ground up and put into bags to be sold) or coco-liners (you can ask at
your garden centre — good ones will have this material). If you use the
larger moss baskets, use this old Parks Department trick. Line the basket
on the inside of the moss with plastic. That way they don’t dry out too
fast. We use an old garbage bag and poke a single hole in the bottom of it
for drainage.
There are other types of containers, including heavy ones made of concrete
and very inexpensive but short-lived ones made of pressed fibres. But those
detailed in the preceding list are the most common and are the best choices
for roses.

The one downside of wood containers is that
they tend to be short-lived — the wood often
rots quickly from being in constant contact with
wet soil. But you can do a few things to prolong
the life of wooden containers:
  Buy containers made of a rot-resistant wood
like redwood or cedar. If you’re building
your own containers, use these rot-resistant
woods or look into pressure-treated woods.
Pressure-treated woods have preservatives
forced into them and are quite long-lived.
However, before you buy them, ask someone
at the lumberyard about safety techniques
that you must follow when handling pres-
sure-treated wood. Although generally safe
if handled properly, the materials used to
preserve wood are often toxic.
  Treat the inside of the container. You can
really prolong the life of a wooden container
by painting the inside with the black asphalt-
like goop used to patch roofs. Ask your
hardware guy; he’ll know the stuff. Use the
goop liberally and let it dry out well before
filling the pot with soil. The roof patch is safer
for you and the plants and is much longer-
lasting than other wood preservatives.
  Keep the containers raised off the ground.
Set wood containers on small pieces of
wood or bricks to create an air space
under the pot. This space helps the barrels
dry out and slows the rotting process of
the wood.
Rottin’ to the core

Bigger is (usually) better
Obviously, containers come in many sizes. Their sizes are usually described
by their diameter at the top — 15-centimetre (6-inch), 25-centimetre (10-inch),
30-centimetre (12-inch), and on up; or by how much soil they hold — 4-litre
(1-gallon), 23-litre (5-gallon), and so on. Even though we’ve switched to metric,
most nurseries in Canada still use either the gallon or inch size for pots.
As a general rule, bigger is better. The more soil a container holds, the more
root space your rose has and the easier the rose is to care for. But bigger also
means heavier and more expensive, so you often have to compromise. Small
roses like miniatures need at least a 30-centimetre (12-inch) or 8-litre (2-gallon)
container. Large plants like shrubs, floribundas, polyanthas, and hybrid teas
can go for a year or two in a 20-litre (5-gallon) or 35-centimetre (14-inch) pot,
but a 60-litre (15-gallon) container or half-barrel is much better. In fact, half a
wine or whiskey barrel is great for growing roses, especially if you want to
include other flowers or more than one rose plant.
Accessories for your pots
You need to consider two other accessories when shopping for pots:
  A saucer for underneath the pot: Saucers are always a good idea. They
collect water that runs out the holes in the bottom of the pot and prevent
the pot from staining whatever it’s sitting on. You can find saucers made
of the same or similar material as your pot, or get invisible ones made of
clear plastic. Plastic saucers are least likely to stain. Saucers can also
help you water your pots, but we’ll get to that in a bit. Just make sure
that you don’t let water stand too long in the saucer; water can rot roots
and wooden pots.
  Wheels for mobility: Most nurseries and garden centres sell wheeled
platforms on top of which you can set pots. These are great if your land-
scape is paved, but they’re hard to push on gravel or grass. Mobility is
freedom, so take a close look at these accessories. Otherwise, you’ll have
to lift heavy pots or cart them around on a dolly. We use a kid’s old wagon
to move our larger pots around.
Potting Soil Simplified
No nonsense here. Rule one and only: Don’t fill your pots with soil from your
garden. It’s too heavy and too dirty (you know, weed seeds, bugs, bacteria —
stuff you don’t want in your pots), and it will not drain properly after it’s in a
pot. After a few waterings, it starts to compact, and compacted soil is hard on
young feeder roots.
90
Part II: Using Roses in Your Garden

Instead, you need potting soil. Now, we could tell you a lot about potting soils:
how they’re supposed to be well aerated, sterile, lightweight, and made of a
good balance of organic matter and mineral particles like sand or perlite. We
could even give you a recipe to make your own. But you’d nod off in a second.
Either that or you’d hurt your back mixing up a batch.
Go down to the local nursery or garden centre and buy whichever packaged
artificial potting soil is cheapest or comes in the prettiest bag. If you need a
lot, many nurseries sell soil in bulk quantities.
Yes, many potting soils are out there, and they have different qualities. So you
may want to try different brands over time to see which one you like best in
terms of ease of wetting and moisture-holding capacity. But don’t have a
personal crisis over which one to buy. Caring for a rose properly after you
plant it is more important than choosing the perfect potting soil.
Planting Properly in Pots
Piece of cake. Just a few things to remember: Plant 2 to 3 centimetres (1 inch)
deeper than you normally would, because potting soil settles quite a bit, and
don’t fill the container to the very top with soil. Leave at least 5 centimetres
(2 inches) of space at the top of the pot (more in large containers) for easy
watering.
Here are the basic steps:
1. Check for drainage holes.
Your pots must, and we mean must, have holes in the bottom so that
water can drain out. Otherwise, the roots will drown. Most pots come
with holes in the bottom. But if you build your own wooden container or
buy half a wine or whiskey barrel, you will probably have to drill holes in
the bottom. Use a 1.25-centimetre to 2.5-centimetre (1⁄2- to 1-inch) drill bit.
Five to seven evenly spaced holes are usually enough for a half-barrel,
but more are better than fewer.
2. Fill the container halfway with potting soil and then thoroughly wet
the soil.
3. Place the rose plant in the pot on top of the soil.
See Chapter 17 for instructions for planting a rose. Plant in the barrel as
you would in the garden. The depth of the rose bud union (Chapter 1) is
not as important in a container as it is in the ground because you’ll be
protecting the pot for the winter.
91
Chapter 7: Growing Roses in Containers

4. Fill the container with soil so that the rose bud union is roughly at the
soil line.
Do make sure there is about 5 centimetres (2 inches) of depth between
the pot rim and the soil line. When you water, you want the water to stay
in the pot — not run out. This is not rocket science. If the bud union is a
tad higher or lower than ideal, relax. It will grow anyway.
5. Water and check for settling.
Wet the soil thoroughly, let the pot drain, and then repeat. Now check
the planting depth. If you need to, add or remove soil around the base of
the plant so that it’s not planted too high or too deep. Remember to leave
some space between the top of the soil and the top rim of the container
so that it has plenty of room to hold water.
Caring for Roses Growing in Containers
Roses grown in containers differ from roses grown in the ground in a few
important ways:
  They need more frequent watering. Potting soils dry out faster than
regular garden soil, so roses growing in potting soil must be watered more
often. In really hot weather, your roses may need water more than once
a day.
You can check to see whether a container is dry in several ways. First,
you can stick your finger in the soil. If your finger comes away dry, you
should water. You can also check soil moisture by lifting or tipping a
container on its side. If the container is dry, it will be lighter than when
wet. When you’re really experienced, you can tap the side of the pot and
hear the difference between a water-filled “thunk” and a dry “thonk.”
  They need more thorough watering. Wetting really dry potting soil can
be tricky. Soils that are composed of peat moss shrink and pull away from
the side of the pot when they are really dry, so when you water, all the
water rushes down the space along the side of the pot without wetting
the soil. To overcome this problem, make sure that you fill the top of the
pot with water more than once so that the rootball can absorb water and
expand. In fact, you should do so anyway to be sure that the rootball is
thoroughly wet with each watering. If you still have trouble wetting the
rootball, place the pot in a saucer and fill it repeatedly with water. The
water soaks up into the rootball and slowly wets all the soil.
A good general rule for watering roses in a pot is to water so that
15 percent of the water applied to the top runs out the bottom. It is
important to thoroughly soak the entire pot, not just the top 15 centimetres
(6 inches). Every time you water, do not stop until water is pouring out
the bottom of the pot.
92
Part II: Using Roses in Your Garden

  They need more frequent fertilizing. The frequent watering that
container-grown roses need leaches the nutrients from the soil, so the
plants need to be fertilized more often, at least every week, to maintain
blooming. Liquid or water-soluble fertilizers are easiest to use and get
the nutrients right down to the roots. A complete fertilizer, including
chelated iron and other micronutrients, is best. For more on fertilizing
roses, see Chapter 19. As a last note, we use fish emulsion on potted
roses to keep them blooming heavily all summer long.

All the Roses You
Need to Know

In this part . . .
A
big, wide, wonderful world of roses is out there with
more to choose from than you can imagine. In this
part, we tell you about the best rose varieties, organizing
them by type and ﬂower colour. Everything you need to
know about each bloom and plant is here. We also note
varieties that have been designated as All-America Rose
Selections (AARS). These varieties were evaluated at test
gardens and judged to be the best of the new introductions
for a particular year.
If you can’t ﬁnd a rose you like here, you’d better check
your pulse.
One other bit of information provided for every rose
variety described in this part is the year the rose was
introduced — but don’t bet your life on the accuracy of
these dates. Published information on that topic is
inconsistent, to say the least. Sometimes, for example,
it’s unclear whether the date given is when the rose was
created or when it was formally introduced for sale. All
you really need is an idea of when a rose was introduced.
If it’s a new variety, it probably possesses all the latest
trendy characteristics, such as disease resistance. If the
variety is old and still around, it has probably stood the
test of time and deserves consideration.

 Choosing your hybrid tea roses — in every colour of the rainbow
H
ybrid teas are the royalty of the rose family — by far the most popular
type of rose, as well as being the most popular flower in the world,
period. Millions of hybrid tea rose plants are purchased and planted every
year by gardeners everywhere. And sales of hybrid teas as cut flowers are a
very important part of the florist’s business. Can you say “Valentine’s Day”?
Their popularity is well earned. The blossoms are exquisite, slowly rolling
open petal by petal from beautifully formed buds. Each flower may have as
many as 60 petals and is often more than 10 centimetres (5 inches) wide.
Supported by long, strong stems, hybrid teas are unmatched as cut flowers,
whether you buy them in the dead of winter or grow them in your own back-
yard. And the fragrance, oh the fragrance — always present but, in some
varieties, strong enough to carry you away.
Making Distinctions: Unique
Qualities of the Hybrid Teas
A hybrid tea is distinguished from other roses by the way it grows. Hybrid teas
produce their flowers one bloom to a long stem, as shown in Figure 8-1, not in
clusters like floribunda or shrub roses. Most hybrid tea plants grow about 0.9
to 1.5 metres (3 to 5 feet) high and tend to be open rather than bushy, with
long, straight, upright canes. Virtually all hybrid teas are repeat bloomers,
producing flowers throughout the growing season.

The hybrid tea rose plants available for purchase are always budded onto
hardy rootstock. (See Chapters 1 and 16 for more information on rootstock.)
Commercial rose growers have found that these plants are more vigorous and
reliable to propagate when they are budded. The point at which they are
budded is called the bud union. This bud union is the magic place where new
canes sprout and grow from the base of the plant.
Although the bud union is a truly amazing part of the rose plant, it’s also the
most vulnerable. If grown without winter protection where winter tempera-
tures reach –12° C (10° F) or lower, the bud union is the first part of the plant
to be damaged or killed by cold and wind. People who don’t grow roses think
that hybrid teas require mysterious culture practices. But the truth is that
although hybrid tea roses may require a little extra work, especially in our
cold climates, nothing is really difficult or mysterious about them.
Hybrid teas are no more or less pest or disease resistant than any other
classification of roses. And every variety of hybrid tea is an individual, demon-
strating a character all its own. Any given hybrid tea may be more or less
floriferous, more or less disease resistant, or more or less winter hardy than
other varieties of hybrid teas.

Hybrid teas are available in almost every colour but true green and blue. Some
red varieties are so dark that they’re almost black. And the mauves are the
closest any rose gets to blue. Many of the loveliest hybrid teas are bicolours
or blends. See the section “Knowing Their Namesakes: Hybrid Tea Types by
Colour” for a colour-by-colour breakdown of the different varieties of hybrid
tea roses.
Although gardeners may grow hybrid teas for their fragrance or their colour,
the characteristic that makes rose growers’ hearts sing is the form. A hybrid
tea’s perfection of form, or exhibition form, is a trait that must be present in
the variety’s genetic makeup to begin with, but excellent culture is required
to encourage the form to reach its pinnacle of perfection.
Hybrid tea flowers with excellent form have long, pointed buds that unfurl in
a perfect spiral around a high, pointed centre. When viewed from the side, the
flowers have a triangular shape, with the outside, or lowest petals, remaining
horizontal rather than falling below the horizontal plane. Because great form
is always associated with the hybrid teas, other classifications of roses that
have really good form are often described as having hybrid tea form.
Flowers with great form usually have substance as well. Substance is the
thickness, or leathery rigidity, of the petals. Roses with substance are usually
better able to withstand the vagaries of weather and last longer in the vase
after being cut. A rose’s capability to maintain its beauty for a length of time
after it’s cut is called vase life. Generally, a rose variety’s vase life is more
important to commercial cut flower growers than to rosarians.
For more information about rose flowers, see Chapter 2.

Chapter 8: Hybrid Teas
The first hybrid tea, ‘La France’, was born in 1867
when a French nurseryman, M. Guillot, cross-
bred two old garden roses and came up with a
whole new kind of rose. Because one of the
roses M. Guillot used for crossbreeding, or
hybridizing, was an old garden rose of the tea
subclass, the classification “hybrid tea” was
christened. ‘La France’ and several of the
early hybrid teas have survived and can be
found at nurseries specializing in old garden
roses. But as wonderful as the first hybrid teas
were at the time, they have been improved by
judicious hybridizing over the years. Today’s
modern hybrids bear little resemblance to their
forebears.
Some hybrid tea varieties have become so pop-
ular that they are synonymous with an era. For
example, the ‘Peace’ rose, hybridized in France
just prior to World War II, was sent to the United
States to be nurtured and propagated by the
Conard Pyle Company during the war years.
‘Peace’ was introduced to the world in 1945 and
is still a favourite symbol of hope for the future.
Called ‘Gloria Dei’ in Europe, ‘Peace’ celebrated
its 50th anniversary in 1995.
Some royal tea history

Lining ’Em Up: How to Plant
Your Hybrid Teas
Hybrid teas are often grown in rows in a traditional rose cutting garden because,
well, because that’s the way Bonaparte’s Josephine grew her rose garden.
Some gardeners think they are easier to care for when planted by themselves,
but they look and grow very well when integrated into a perennial border and
in landscape plantings with other shrubs and flowers. They should be planted
45 to 90 centimetres (18 to 36 inches) apart, depending on growth habit.
Because hybrid teas have little foliage near the base of the plants (see Figure
8-2) and spindly growth in that area should be removed, they may look a little
more naked than other types of roses when used in the landscape. However,
if you plant low-growing perennials or herbs at their base, hybrid teas can
be attractive in flower beds (see Chapter 5 for more information about land-
scaping with roses). Hybrid teas also combine beautifully with other plants in
containers.

Shearing Brutality: Pruning
Your Hybrid Teas
Growing hybrid teas takes practically no more effort on your part than most
other kinds of roses. They need water, fertilizer, and possibly a spray with a
good fungicide. They are, however, usually pruned more severely (see Chapter
20 for pruning information) in spring than are other classifications of roses.
Pruning hybrid teas involves cutting out spindly canes and leaving only four
or five strong canes to grow. With traditional overwintering methods, the
strong canes should be pruned to about 30 to 45 centimetres (12 to 18 inches)
in height in the fall and then any winter damage can be further removed in the
spring. Drastic pruning encourages the plant to produce larger flowers, while
less severe spring pruning results in more but smaller flowers.
Knowing Their Namesakes:
Hybrid Tea Types by Colour
You can choose among hundreds of hybrid tea roses. You can go for colour,
fragrance, cut flowers, or even a wacky name. Roses are named after places
(‘Las Vegas’, ‘Tower Bridge’) people (‘Elizabeth Taylor’, ‘Uncle Joe’) dreams
(‘Lady X’, ‘Perfect Moment’) and even somebody’s old car (‘Chrysler Imperial’).
But most people choose by colour, so that’s how we break them down.
Red hybrid teas
Every garden needs at least one good red hybrid tea. Trust us: You need them
in vases, you need them for their form and fragrance, and besides, what are
you going to give that special someone when you want to say, “I love you”?
Red roses are by far the most popular, but no single variety today can be
considered the “perfect” red rose. Some red roses turn bluish as the flowers
age, some have so many petals that they don’t want to open properly when the
weather is cool (see Chapter 4 for more on the effects of climate), and some
are too small to be considered perfect. If you want to make your everlasting
fortune, read Chapter 23 on propagating roses and hybridize a red rose that’s
big, fragrant, has perfect form, great substance, and is disease resistant.

Orange hybrid teas
Orange is a strong colour; if you’re not careful, it can really mess up the mix
of other colours you choose for your garden or bouquets. Mix orange with
reds, whites, and yellows or use it by itself, but watch out if orange gets around
pink or lavender. Yuck!
Our favourite orange roses include ‘Artistry’, ‘Fragrant Cloud’, ‘Just Joey’,
‘Medallion’, and ‘Tropicana’. Here are more orange (or almost orange) hybrid
teas that you’ll find at the nursery or in catalogues.
‘Artistry’: AARS 1997. Brilliant coral-pink, double blossoms (30 to 35
petals) have a touch of cream on the back sides of the petals. Light

Yellow hybrid teas
Yellow roses are about as sunny as you can get — and they look so good with
green foliage plants. Our favourite yellow hybrid teas include ‘Celebrity’,
‘Graceland’, ‘Midas Touch’, and almost anything in this list after that. Yellow
roses don’t seem to grow as well as other colours in northern climates (sigh),
so the choice in garden centres and catalogues is not as great as other hybrid
tea colours.

petals) borne in abundance. Flowers sometimes pick up a slight reddish
blush. Light, fruity fragrance. Widely adapted to many climates. Vigorous,

Chapter 8: Hybrid Teas
One way to whet your appetite for rose growing
and get your imagination off and running is to
see roses in person. In the summertime, you can
visit rose gardens in almost every province to
get a sense of which rose you absolutely need
in your garden.
On the Web, go to the Canadian Rose Society
site and follow the links to other rose sites and
pictures. Start at www.mirror.org/groups/

Grandifloras
In This Chapter
 Treating grandifloras right
 Placing your grandifloras in a good location
 Taking advantage of the grandiflora palette of colours
A
s a class, grandifloras bear large, long-stemmed, hybrid tea-like flowers,
either in clusters or one to a stem. Grandifloras often grow taller than
hybrid teas, having lengthy stems, so they’re excellent producers of cut roses.
Generally, grandiflora plants are tall, hardy, and vigorous. In this chapter we
point out how to care for, and landscape with grandifloras, as well as listing
some great varieties in each of the colours available.
Treat Them Like Hybrid Teas:
Looking After Grandifloras
As you can see in Figure 9-1, grandifloras have peaked blossoms similar to
hybrid tea roses. Figure 9-2 shows the tall growth habit of grandifloras. Care
for grandifloras as you would hybrid teas — watering, fertilizing, winter
protection, pruning practices, and so on are pretty much the same. (Part IV,
“Growing Healthy Roses,” fully describes all that.)
Grandifloras are often used like hybrid teas and planted in rows for cut flowers.
However, they tend to put on a better show of colour than many hybrid teas
do, so don’t hesitate to use them in the landscape. Tall varieties, especially
‘Queen Elizabeth’, make useful hedges or background plants. Lower-growing
types can be mixed with other flowers in perennial borders or grown in
containers. You can find more on landscaping with roses in Chapter 5.

Grandifloras by Colour
Grandifloras come in many colours and sizes. The following sections list some
of our favourites.
Red grandifloras
Unfortunately, there are only a few red grandifloras to choose from. We
particularly like ‘Love’, but check the other varieties in this list and pick your
own favourite.
‘Carrousel’: Bright red, velvety blossoms with 15 to 20 petals generally
grow in small clusters and singly on long stems. Long-lasting flowers
with colour that does not fade as the bloom ages. Sweet fragrance. Very
tall, bushy, and upright. Leaves are bright green. Likes summer heat.
Introduced in 1950.
‘Love’: All-America Rose Selection (AARS) 1980. Part of a trio of roses
introduced in 1980: ‘Love’, ‘Honor’, and ‘Cherish’ (‘Love’ and ‘Honor’ are
great; ‘Cherish’ is sort of blah). True to the name, the flowers are bright
red with a silvery reverse. 35 petals. Slight, spicy fragrance. Good cut
flower. Medium height and compact bush.
‘San Antonio’: Long-stemmed, pointed buds open to display cardinal-red
blossoms with mild fragrance. 30 to 35 petals. This tall, upright bush with
glossy, dark green leaves produces flowers continuously. Easy to grow.
Prefers warmer summers. Introduced in 1967.
117
Chapter 9: Grandifloras
Grandiflora roses always seem to be having some
type of identity crisis. The class was created in
the U.S.A. around 1954 to accommodate ‘Queen
Elizabeth’, a tall, vigorous hybrid that has large
flowers on long stems like a hybrid tea, but the
long stems grow in clusters like a floribunda.
‘Queen Elizabeth’ was named for the young
Queen of England and won nearly every inter-
national award for roses. In 1980, the World
Federation of Rose Societies declared it the
world’s favourite rose.
Although ‘Queen Elizabeth’ is still very popular,
grandifloras as a class never really made the big
time in the rose world. In fact, England doesn’t
even recognize grandifloras as a true class of
roses. Instead, they are called floribundas with
hybrid tea-type flowers or cluster-flowered roses.
Anyway, North Americans are going to keep
calling them grandifloras, so don’t worry about
all the international debate, just enjoy the
flowers.
The grand controversy

Pink grandifloras
If you can’t make up your mind on a pink grandiflora, go with ‘Queen Elizabeth’
or ‘Tournament of Roses’, but all of these varieties can be delightful in your
garden.
‘Aquarius’: AARS 1971. Light pink flowers with deep pink edges (30 to
40 petals) grow singly on long stems. Long-lasting when cut. Moderate
fragrance. Free-blooming. Long-lasting, even in hot weather. Medium to
tall, slender, upright bush. Large, reddish green leaves. Disease resistant
and hardy.
‘Camelot’: AARS 1965. The largest of the grandiflora flowers, up to 13
centimetres (5 inches) across. Blooms are pale salmon in colour with 50
to 55 petals, opening in a cup shape. The colour changes with the weather
from salmon when it’s cooler to orange when it warms. Light to moderate
fragrance. Tall and spreading bush. Vigorous grower; likes hot weather.
Leaves are large, heavy, and glossy.
‘Pink Parfait’: AARS 1961. Petite buds open into well-formed flowers,
coloured with a blend of deep pink and cream. 20 to 25 petals. Grow singly
on narrow stems. Slight fragrance. Good cut flower. Profuse bloomer.
Colour may fade in hot weather. Medium, upright, and bushy with lots of
branches. Leathery, semi-glossy green leaves. Disease resistant.
‘Prima Donna’: AARS 1988. Deep, fuschia-pink flowers with 27 petals and
a light fragrance. Foliage is large, glossy, and medium green. Spreading
growth. Plant disease resistance. Introduced in 1984.
‘Queen Elizabeth’: AARS 1955. The first grandiflora, and still the finest,
has received top honours in many countries over the years. Clear pink,
ruffled blooms adorn the stately, tall bush in long-stemmed clusters.
Abundant and ever-blooming. Blossoms are high-centred or cup-shaped.
Moderately fragrant, vigorous, and bushy. Leaves are dark green and
glossy. Easy to grow. Disease resistant.
‘Sonia’: A popular florist’s rose in the United States and Europe, but grows
pretty well in the garden, too. Delicate, long buds give way to shapely,
pastel pink flowers on long stems. 30 to 35 petals. Sweet, fruity fragrance.
Glossy green leaves. Medium height and bushy. Disease resistant.
Introduced in 1974.
‘Tournament of Roses’: AARS 1989. Flowers profusely in clusters. Two-
toned pink blooms. 25 to 30 petals. Medium, upright bush with glossy
green leaves. Light fragrance. Highly disease resistant and easy to grow.

31⁄2 inches) compared to most grandifloras. Blooms continuously, and the
colour does not fade. Light fragrance. Stately, upright, tall plant. Foliage
is matte green. Disease resistant. Introduced in 1971.
‘Shreveport’: AARS 1982. Named for the city in Louisiana that is home to
the American Rose Center. Full flowers (45 to 50 petals) of warm, blended
salmon and yellow tones bloom all season. Mild scent. Cut flowers have
a long vase life. Tall, upright plant is covered with dark green, shiny
foliage. Fall conditions bring out the best colour. Easy to grow.

in cool, wet climates.

Yellow grandifloras
We particularly like the following yellow grandiflora roses.
‘Gold Medal’: Gives a nearly constant supply of dark gold buds and richly
fragrant, golden-yellow flowers with a flirtation of red at the tips. 30 to 35
petals. Low-thorned stems. Very tall plant with deep green foliage. Disease
resistant. This rose is a bit more cold sensitive than most, so we advise
that you provide extra winter protection. (See Chapter 21.) Introduced
in 1983.
‘Shining Hour’: AARS 1991. Deep yellow, cup-shaped flowers grow singly
and in clusters or sprays. 33 petals. Moderate fragrance. Upright, bushy,
medium-height plant with shiny, dark green leaves. Introduced in 1989.
White grandifloras
Both of these white grandifloras have won the coveted All America Rose
Society Award and you’ll love either one.
‘Mt. Hood’: AARS 1996. Masses of ivory-white flowers on a bushy plant
resemble snow-capped Mount Hood. Flowers are full and fleshy with 40
to 45 petals. Light fragrance. Full-branching, tall bush with deep, glossy
green foliage. Disease resistant. Flowers open better in warmer
temperatures.
‘White Lightnin’: AARS 1981. Small, white clusters of cupped, very
fragrant flowers burst forth all season on the tall, robust bush. 26 to 32
petals. Disease resistant. Dark green, glossy leaves.
Lavender grandifloras
Here are our picks for the two top lavender (or mauve) grandifloras.
‘Fragrant Plum’: Elegant deep plum with perhaps more true blue than
any rose to date. Vigorous, tall plant with lush, deep green foliage. Buds
are long and pointed; flowers have good form and a strong, fruity
fragrance. Colour brightens in heat; best form comes in spring and fall.
Introduced in 1997.
‘Spellcaster’: A flower with substance. Blooms are deep mauve and
lavender with 26 to 40 petals and intense fragrance. The bush is full,
upright, and uniform in growth. Leaves are large, glossy, and dark green.
Introduced in 1991.

Multicoloured grandifloras
Either of these grandifloras makes a great choice for a spot of zingy colour in
your garden.
‘Arizona’: AARS 1975. High-centred blooms with 35 to 40 petals are full
of powerful perfume. Colours are blended tones of bronzy orange and
mellow pink. Tough, tall, slender plant with glossy emerald-green leaves.
Colour does not fade. Disease resistant.
‘Charisma’: Hard to believe that this rose is real as it throws so many
blossoms. Arriving in changing hues of orange, yellow, and red, each
40-petalled blossom has a light fragrance. A tough, bushy, compact rose
with glossy, dark green leathery leaves.

Polyanthas and Floribundas
In This Chapter
 Revealing the origins of polyantha and floribunda roses
 Using polyanthas and floribundas in the landscape
 Caring for polyanthas and floribundas
 Recognizing great polyantha and floribunda varieties
P
olyanthas and floribundas are the workhorses of the rose garden. They
are the most prolific bloomers of all the different kinds of roses, and they
are useful in the landscape, in perennial borders, and in large groups or mass
plantings. If you can’t find a floribunda you love, you’d better get your eye-
sight checked! Treat them exactly like hybrid teas when it comes to watering,
feeding, and winter protection.
Polyanthas were discovered in France in the late 1800s, and only a few varieties
are still widely grown. But polyanthas are important not only because they
are excellent roses but also because they are the forerunners of the very
popular and useful floribundas. For that reason, we group the two together
in this chapter.
To France, Late 19th Century
The origin of polyantha roses is credited to M. Guillot in 1875 — about the
same time as the first hybrid tea. They can probably claim Rosa multiflora and
Rosa chinensis as their parents, but some kind of hanky-panky must have been
going on somewhere, because no one really knows who mom or dad is.
Anyway, polyanthas are compact plants that usually grow about 60 to 90
centimetres (2 to 3 feet high). And do they ever bloom! They virtually cover
themselves in large, flat clusters of small flowers (usually about 2.5 centimetres,
or 1 inch wide) in shades of white, pink, red, orange, and yellow. (See Figure
10-1.) And they bloom and bloom again, all season long. Polyantha leaves are
small and narrow and the plants are fairly hardy, at least more so than hybrid
teas. The most common polyantha, ‘The Fairy’, is one of the hardiest and
most reliable, thriving without winter protection even to –31° C (–25° F).

Floribundas: Workaholics
of the Rose Garden
Early in the 20th century, someone got the bright idea to cross the generous-
blooming polyanthas with the larger-flowering hybrid teas. The results are
what we now call the floribundas, which, as their name suggests, offer flowers
in abundance.
Today, floribundas are one of the most useful types of roses. The flowers are
borne in large clusters like polyanthas (see Figure 10-2), but the individual
blooms are bigger, often with that beautiful hybrid tea form, and most are great
cut flowers. In the landscape, where they can brighten a dreary corner of the
yard, highlight a garden ornament, or keep a perennial border wonderfully
colourful all season, is where they really shine.
Floribundas come in all the hybrid tea colours, which is probably almost any
flower colour you can think of except blue and black. The plants grow from
0.9 to 1.5 metres (3 to 5 feet) high and can be anything from upright to low
and spreading, as shown in Figure 10-3. Their range in plant shape makes
them versatile landscape plants.
Some floribunda varieties have compact growth habits and are very “tuckable”
into small areas of the garden or for creating a generous show in a container.
Others grow tall and wide and exhibit many of the characteristics of modern
shrubs. “Grow as shrub” is a common description in rose catalogues. Choose
varieties that suit the area in which you want to plant them.

But the amount and persistence of bloom are what really make floribundas so
great. Some varieties, like ‘Iceberg’ and ‘Simplicity’, have almost cult-like
followings because of their generosity of bloom.
Try ’em; you’ll like ’em.

All This and Easy to Grow, Too
Floribundas and polyanthas are among the easiest roses to grow. Most have
good disease resistance and need little care other than water and fertilizer.
Removing spent flowers during the growing season is important if you want
a bush to keep producing flowers. You can just get out your hedge shears to
cut off faded flowers. Spring pruning is equally simple — cut off any part of
the plant that was damaged over the winter. See Chapter 20 for pruning
information and how to recognize winter damage.
Today’s rose hybridizers are working very hard to breed disease resistance into
new varieties of roses. Therefore, many of the newer varieties of floribundas
are naturally resistant to the diseases that attack our favourite flower. Rose
culture, especially for the new floribundas, is getting simpler every year. If a
floribunda variety excels in the disease resistance department, you can bet
that the rose catalogues will say so. So if you don’t care much about spraying
for black spot and powdery mildew, choose disease-resistant varieties. On
the other hand, as is always the case, many of the most unique and desirable
varieties are susceptible to disease but respond nicely to disease-control
measures. It just goes to show you: If it’s not one thing . . .
Even though floribunda and polyantha rose plants tend to be slightly hardier
than hybrid teas, you will need to provide winter protection for most of them.
But protecting roses in winter is no big deal; see Chapter 21. If in doubt,
protect!
Don’t Plant Just One!
If you haven’t already guessed, we really like polyantha and floribunda roses.
The reason is simple: The amount of bloom, clean-looking foliage, and ease of
care make these roses exceptional landscape plants.
Using specific varieties for specific landscape purposes is covered in Chapter 5,
but one piece of advice is worth repeating here: Polyanthas and floribundas
are best used in mass plantings. Don’t buy just one or two plants; get a bunch
and line them up as hedges or edgings for other plants. Or plant several of
them in a bed all by themselves. Season-long colour will knock your neighbours’
socks off! Some of the lower-growing varieties, such as ‘Red Ribbons’, can
even be grouped as ground covers. Or you can spread them throughout your
garden to tie everything else together. These babies are real troopers; they
can carry an entire garden.
126
Part III: All the Roses You Need to Know

There’s another reason to buy these roses in quantity: Many of the mail-order
catalogues listed in Appendix B offer discounts when you buy more than one
of any variety.
Oh yeah, floribundas, and especially polyanthas, are also great planted in
containers.
A Few of Our Favourite Things
The following sections list our favourite floribunda varieties. Also described
is our favourite pink polyantha, ‘Cécile Brünner’.

dark-green leaves. Introduced in 1932.
Orange roses
These floribundas make a stunning statement in bright orange and apricot:
‘Apricot Nectar’: AARS 1966. Tight clusters sometimes obscure the
beauty of this rose. Removing some of the buds enhances the large, pure
apricot blooms. 35 to 40 petals. Very fragrant. Good repeat bloomer.
Does well as a cut flower. Upright and bushy. Glossy, dark green leaves.
Disease-resistant and hardy for a floribunda.

Easy’ practically grows itself. The foliage on this rounded, medium-sized
bush is so glossy and green that the bush looks good without flowers.

blooms with 25 to 30 petals and a moderately fruity scent. Very consis-
tent performer in all climates, but a bit cold-tender compared to other
floribundas.

‘Amber Queen’: AARS 1988. The combination of the soft apricot colour,
sweet scent, and glossy green foliage make this rose a winner. 25 to 30

resistance, making it an ideal choice for the landscape. Best colour in
cool temperatures. Introduced in 1983.

green leaves. Performs best in cooler temperatures. Introduced in 1977.
White roses
Two of our all-time favourite roses, ‘Class Act’ and ‘Iceberg’, are among these
white floribundas. Both are top-of-the-line landscape plants, but these are all
good performers:
‘Class Act’: AARS 1989. One of the most generous-blooming and easy-to-
care-for white floribundas on the market. Produces continuous clusters
of pure white blooms that have a mild fragrance. Semi-double flowers
open flat and bloom continuously on vigorous bushes with glossy leaves.

care. The bush is medium to tall with dark green foliage. Introduced
in 1958.

a hybrid tea-type shape. 28 petals. Introduced in 1977.
Lavender roses
You can count the great lavender floribundas on one hand, and here they are:
‘Angel Face’: AARS 1969. A bit of heaven for the garden. The unusual,
deep mauve flowers send out an ambrosial fragrance that permeates the
air throughout the summer. 35 to 40 ruffled petals. Vigorous, disease
resistant, good winter hardiness with leathery, semi-glossy leaves.
‘Blueberry Hill’: Clear lilac with a sweet fragrance. Flowers grow in
clusters on long stems, perfect for cutting. 8 to 15 petals. Displays all
summer long. Rounded, upright plant. Disease resistant and decently
hardy. Introduced in 1997.
‘Intrigue’: AARS 1984. Absolutely intriguing — red-purple buds give way

resistant but quite tender, it will require excellent winter protection.

Multicoloured roses
Here’s a dazzling collection of multicoloured floribundas:
‘Charisma’: AARS 1978. Ever-changing hues of yellow, orange, and red

Introduced in l978.
‘Little Darling’: A salmon-pink and yellow duo-tone rose with a hybrid
tea shape and a spicy fragrance. 24 to 30 petals. Blooms abundantly in
clusters in early to midseason and reblooms well. The plant is bushy and
spreading. Leaves are glossy, leathery, and dark green. Long-lasting cut
flower. Disease resistant with a good hardiness rating. Introduced in 1956.
‘Peppermint Twist’: The red-, white-, and pink-striped blossoms look
almost like candy canes in flower form. Very full, with over 40 petals, they
open flat or slightly cupped. Borne in small clusters on a medium, upright
bush with shiny green leaves. Slight fragrance. Introduced in 1992.
‘Playboy’: A dazzling red-orange flower stamped in the centre with a
large, golden eye full of orange stamens. Five to seven petals. Blooms are
produced almost continuously in clusters that are excellent for cut flowers.
A bushy, spreading shrub with glossy leaves. Introduced in 1976.
‘Redgold’: AARS 1971. Each of the 25 to 30 petals is deep yellow with a

bushy plant. Leaves are dark green with red new growth. Good winter
hardiness and disease resistant.
‘Regensberg’: From a group of roses known as the hand-painted series, all
of which have flowers that look like they’ve been splashed with different
colours of paint. This one truly looks handcrafted. Bright white flowers
with 20 to 25 petals are splashed with hot pink. At times, the low, compact
plant can be completely covered with blossoms. Sweet fragrance. Flower
size increases in cool weather. Works well as a landscape plant or in a
container. Introduced in 1979.
133
Chapter 10: Polyanthas and Floribundas

‘Scentimental’: AARS 1997. Shocking burgundy-red flowers have swirls
of creamy white on the petals. Each bloom is different — some are
splashed white, others are striped white, and still others are almost all
white with red markings. Cup-shaped flowers have 25 to 30 petals and
a strong, spicy fragrance. The rounded plant has excellent disease
resistance.

Miniature Roses
In This Chapter
 Understanding miniature roses
 Exploring the origin of miniature roses
 Caring for miniature roses
 Landscaping with miniature roses
 Selecting miniature roses
F
ew groups of plants, roses or otherwise, are as versatile and useful as
miniature roses. Miniatures, as you can probably guess, are perfectly
scaled down versions of larger roses, with all the colours, forms, substance,
and often fragrance of full-sized roses. Like other types of roses, each variety
of miniature rose has different characteristics, with plant size varying between
10 centimetres (4 inches) and 120 centimetres (4 feet) and plant shapes that
include bushy, compact, climbing, and cascading.
Looking at Mini Form
Smaller definitely doesn’t mean miniature roses are less attractive or less fun
to grow. Happily, in most cases, smaller does mean easier to grow. Their
smaller habit makes miniature roses ideal for growing in containers, and they
also make excellent landscape and bedding plants.
No matter what the shape or height, a good miniature rose has flowers and
leaves in perfect proportion to each other, as shown in Figure 11-1. The flowers
provide bright and constant spots of colour throughout the growing season,
and their flowers can be cut for mini-bouquets and arrangements. (See Figure
11-2 for a close-up of a miniature rose flower.) As well, the selection of varieties
is awesome, with hundreds of new ones being introduced each year. We’ve
picked some of the best (mostly award winners) for you to start with.

Tracing Their Tiny Origins
Many stories about the origin of miniature roses exist, and it appears that
miniatures have come and gone over many centuries at least. Genetically,
miniature roses have been traced back to the miniature China rose, Rosa
chinensis minima, but the forerunner of today’s miniature roses was discovered

in a window box in Switzerland in 1917. This variety, named ‘Rouletii’ (for
Colonel Roulet, who owned the window box and the rose), was used to
hybridize the first of the modern miniatures.
The very first miniature sold in the United States, ‘Tom Thumb’, was introduced
in 1936. Since those days, hybridizers of mini roses have crossed miniature
varieties with virtually every other type of rose, creating the huge diversity of
colour, form, and habit that you can find today.
Diminutive but not frail:
Protecting and pruning
Miniature roses are actually pretty tough plants. They are almost always
propagated and grown on their own roots, which makes them hardier in cold
weather than many other types of roses. Like most plants, however, they’re
not real thrilled with harsh winter winds and the nasty freeze-and-thaw cycles
that some winters bring. Your miniature roses will suffer less damage and
thrive more readily if you hill them with soil or heavily mulch the base of the
plant with leaves — 45 centimetres (18 inches) or more — for winter protection.
We have also noted the hardier varieties throughout the chapter. For more
information about own-root roses, see Chapter 16.
Smaller plants mean smaller roots. Smaller roots don’t grow very deep in the
soil. Therefore, your mini rose needs more frequent watering if Mother Nature
doesn’t comply and provide water in the form of rain. Also, smaller plants
require smaller doses of fertilizer. A general rule for fertilizing miniatures is
this: half as much, twice as often.
As with full-sized roses, regularly removing faded flowers (called deadheading)
is pretty much all the pruning you need to do during the growing season.
With hilling or mulching, there’s no need to cut back minis in the fall, and in
spring the minimum pruning necessary is to cut away the dead parts.
If you have lots of minis, a hedge trimmer — you know, that tool that looks
like giant paper scissors — does a great job. In any case, shearing plants
back about halfway, meaning that 30-centimetre (12-inch) plants should be
15 centimetres (6 inches) tall after pruning, is an excellent spring task that
will increase the number of summer blooms.
However, many gardeners like to treat their miniatures with a little more
respect, so if you want, you can prune them just like you would hybrid teas.

Chapter 11: Miniature Roses

Small but not less colourful:
Landscaping with miniatures
Miniatures are wonderful landscape plants. Because the plants are so small
when you buy them, it seems like they’ll take forever to grow and put on a
good show. But don’t let that small size fool you. Miniature roses reach full
size in just a few weeks, and they flower big-time all season long.
Miniatures make beautiful up-front plants. Use them to edge a flower border
or walkway, or plant them at the base of taller-growing plants. And don’t forget
about containers. You’ll be hard pressed to beat a good-looking miniature
rose growing in a handsome pot. You can find specifics about using miniatures
in the landscape in Chapter 5. For more on growing roses in containers, refer
to Chapter 7.
Buying Quality Miniature Roses
Miniature roses seem to show up in a lot of places where you don’t usually
see rose plants for sale, like at supermarkets and florist shops. So you don’t
have to look far to find them. But if you want varieties that really have proven
themselves in garden situations, you’re better off buying from a local nursery
or a mail-order catalogue that specializes in roses. You can find their addresses
in Appendix B.
People may try to convince you that growing miniature roses on a windowsill
is easy. Don’t buy it. Although a miniature may stay in bloom for a week or
two inside, eventually the plant needs to go outside where light is sufficient
and conditions are better for healthy growth. Many people do have success
growing miniatures indoors, but they have a greenhouse or provide some type
of supplemental lighting. Like any other rose, a miniature requires at least six
hours of full, direct sunshine per day. Get out those grow lamps!
Giving You the Lowdown on
Miniature Varieties
Many new miniatures are released every year — possibly more than any
other type of rose — so you have many varieties to choose from. The following
sections list some of our favourites. Miniatures that receive the American
Rose Society Award of Excellence have been judged as outstanding in test
gardens and are good plants to start with.

Climbing Roses
In This Chapter
 Understanding how a climber climbs
 Revealing all kinds of climbing roses
 Caring for climbers
 Using climbing roses in the landscape
 Selecting climbing rose varieties
A
pretty amazing variety of climbing roses flourishes throughout the world
— including many shrubs and old garden roses. (We describe some of
those types in Chapters 13 and 14, respectively.) Usually, rose growers train
their climbers’ vigorous growth to follow trellises or other structures.
Throughout this chapter we discuss the diverse range of climbers, give care
and growing suggestions, and list a full range of colourful options to help you
select a good climbing rose for your garden.
So Many Climbers, So Little Time
Climbing roses, as shown in Figure 12-1, represent a diverse group of plants
that produce long, supple canes that can reach over 6 metres (20 feet) long.
The plants are not true vines in that they won’t cling to, climb on, or in any
way attach themselves to an upright support. Left on their own, they tend to
be large, sprawling shrubs.
However, most climbing roses are not left on their own to sprawl shapelessly
in the backyard. You usually tie them in an upright fashion to some type of a
support, such as a fence, arbour, trellis, or wall. They make a beautiful vertical
statement in a garden and are very useful for adding colour to blank walls or
narrow planting areas.

(right).

Most climbing roses fall into one of four categories for our Canadian gardens:
 Large-flowered climbers are the most popular and widely used climbing
roses. They produce clusters of flowers on long, arching canes that gen-
erally reach from 2.4 to 4.2 metres (8 to 14 feet) high. They bloom most
heavily in spring but do produce flowers throughout the growing season.
Large-flowered climbers are generally hardy to –10° to –7° C (15° to 20° F)
and need serious winter protection wherever temperatures regularly
drop lower. (For more information about protecting these plants in winter,
see Chapter 21.)
 Climbing sports result from unusually vigorous canes that grow from
popular hybrid teas, grandifloras, and floribundas. They produce the
beautiful flowers of their shrubby parent but on a more sprawling plant.
Climbing sports don’t usually bloom as heavily as large-flowered climbers,
but they do produce flowers with excellent size and character throughout
the growing season. These plants are generally hardy to –12° to –7° C
(10° to 20° F) and need good winter protection.
Climbing sports are generally named after the variety from which they
originate. Favourites include ‘Climbing First Prize’ from the pink and
silver hybrid tea, ‘Climbing Iceberg’ from the generous-blooming white
floribunda, ‘Climbing Cécile Brünner’ from the pink polyantha, and
‘Climbing Queen Elizabeth’ from the famous pink grandiflora. (You can
find descriptions of these flowers in the chapters describing the class of
roses from which the climber originates.) Some climbing sports, such
as ‘High Noon’, described later in this chapter, are listed as climbing
hybrid teas.
 Ramblers are less popular than other types of climbing roses, primarily
because they bloom only once a year, in spring, and they are not as hardy
as other climbers. These plants are very vigorous and can grow up to
6 metres (20 feet) tall. They are hardy to about –12° C (or about –10° F).
Their height makes them tough to overwinter where the temperatures
are truly Canadian.
 Explorer Roses, bred in Ottawa and Quebec for our northern conditions,
have some varieties that make excellent, and hardy, climbers that
require no winter protection in most parts of Canada. Although many of
them have a single flush of bloom in early summer with sporadic bloom-
ing thereafter, there are some new introductions that promise extended
bloom times. See Chapter 15 for varieties.
 Climbing miniatures are a fifth type of climber. Many are produced by cross-
ing popular miniature varieties with climbing forms of Rosa wichuraiana.
Favourites include ‘Jeanne Lajoie’ and ‘Climbing Rise ’n’ Shine’. (You
can find descriptions of their flowers in Chapter 11.) One other climbing
miniature, ‘King Tut’, is described later in this chapter. These require
extensive winter protection if they are to survive. See Chapter 21.
149
Chapter 12: Climbing Roses

Special Needs: Caring for Climbers
Climbing roses need a little different care than most other roses, particularly
when it comes to pruning, training, and winter protection. You can find more
information about those subjects in Chapter 20, “Pruning Roses,” and
Chapter 21, “Protecting Roses Where Winters Are Cold.”
Otherwise, watering, fertilizing, and controlling pests on climbers are similar
to other types of roses. See Part IV of this book for details.
Up Against a Wall: Planting Climbers
As landscape plants, climbing roses present many opportunities. Following
are some planting suggestions:
 Plant climbing roses in a narrow area, where there isn’t room for
much else.
 Turn a blank wall into living art with a trellis and a climbing rose plant.
 Cover up that ugly chain-link fence.
 Use a climbing rose to increase the shade from your arbour.
You can find more ideas for using climbing roses, including different types of
supports and ways to attach climbing roses to them, in Chapter 5.
Climbers in Every Colour of the Rainbow
Climbers are the high risers of the rose world. They can grow up and over
whatever you can tie them to and produce flowers in all the rose colours, as
you’ll see in the following lists.
Note that when we describe a variety as “hardy” we mean hardier than most.
But hardy is still a relative term. If you grow any of these plants, you have to
protect them in all but the warmest parts of Canada.
Red climbers
All these red varieties are large-flowered climbers. Don’t overlook ‘Improved
Blaze’. It’s a stunner and its one of the hardiest of the red climbers.
150
Part III: All the Roses You Need to Know

‘Crimson Cascade’: Deep red blooms with a medium fragrance cover
this 2.4-metre (8-foot) tall climber. The blooms are long lasting and cover
the plant — a heavy bloomer! Introduced in 1991, this has good winter
hardiness and excellent disease resistance.
‘Don Juan’: Deep red blossoms with an intense fragrance bloom profusely
from midseason on. 35 petals. Dark green, glossy leaves. Climbing canes
reach 3.5 to 4.2 metres (12 to 14 feet). Makes an excellent trellis rose.
Blooms on new and old wood. Disease resistant, but not dependably
winter hardy. Warm night temperatures give the best colour. Introduced
in 1958.
‘Dublin Bay’: Cupped blossoms with 25 true red petals bloom profusely
midseason and follow up with good repeat bloom later. Flowers open in
cool or hot weather. Moderately fragrant. Lots of dark green leaves. Bush
is upright and vigorous. Blooms on old or new wood. Climbing canes
reach 2.5 to 3.5 metres (8 to 12 feet). Disease resistant and winter hardy.
Introduced in 1975.
‘Heidelberg’: Medium red blossoms with good fragrance cover this
2.5-metre (8-foot) grower. Good disease resistance and winter hardiness
make it a candidate for any garden. Introduced in 1959 from Germany.
‘Improved Blaze’: The most popular climbing rose. Large, cup-shaped
flowers of pure red bloom in clusters all season. 20 to 25 petals. Light
scent. Climbing canes reach 3.5 to 4.2 metres (12 to 14 feet). Medium
green, shiny leaves. Blooms on old and new wood. Winter hardy and
disease resistant. Easy to grow. Introduced in 1932.
‘Tempo’: Flowers are deep red and full. 35 to 45 petals. Slight fragrance.
Foliage is dark green, glossy, and large. Good disease resistance and
winter hardiness. Introduced in 1975.
Pink climbers
These are all large-flowered climbers. ‘New Dawn’ is the hardiest of pink
climbers.
‘America’: All-America Rose Selection (AARS) 1976. Large, well-formed,
cup-shaped flowers of coral pink broadcast a spicy fragrance. 40 to 45
petals. Plant is vigorous and bushy with bright green leaves. Climbing
canes reach 3 to 3.5 metres (10 to 12 feet). Blooms on old and new wood.
Disease resistant and winter hardy.
‘Dorothy Perkins’: Rambler. Many-petalled, rose-pink flowers. Fragrant.
Blooms only in spring. Very vigorous plant can grow 3.0 to 6.0 metres (10
to 20 feet) high. Dark green, glossy foliage. Introduced in 1901. Wonderful
if you can overwinter it.
151
Chapter 12: Climbing Roses

‘Dr. J. H. Nicolas’: Large, round, rose-pink flowers with 45 to 50 petals
are heavily fragrant. Blooms profusely. Upright and slender with leathery,
dark green leaves. Climbing canes can reach 2.5 to 3.0 metres (8 to 10
feet). Disease resistant and winter hardy. Introduced in 1940.
‘New Dawn’: Large, pale pink flowers with sweet perfume and glossy, dark
green leaves. 35 to 40 petals. Climbing canes can reach 5.5 to 6.0 metres
(18 to 20 feet). Produces continuously throughout the season. Hardiest
of the climbing pinks. Introduced in 1930.
‘Rosarium Uetersen’: Medium-sized, deep pink flowers with an incredible
number of petals — well over 100. Fragrant. Vigorous growth with dark
green, glossy foliage. Introduced in 1977.
Orange climbers
Some folks can’t do without their orange climbers. If you just have to have
your dose of orange in the garden, here are a few climbers you might try.
‘Spectacular’: An orange-red blend with slight fragrance. Also known as
‘Danse de Feu’, it is a vigorous 2.5-metre (8-foot) grower introduced in
1953 from France.
‘Rosanna’: A heavy-blooming, repeating orange-pink-toned rose with
excellent heavy fragrance. You’ll smell this one! Very large blooms last a
long time on 2.5-metre (8-foot) canes. Introduced in 1982 from Germany.
Yellow climbers
Here are four great yellow climbers. One of them, ‘King Tut’, is a climbing
miniature. Note that the yellow climbers tend to be more tender than other
colours and this means you have to protect them over the winter if you want
them to bloom next summer.
‘Golden Showers’: AARS 1957. Large-flowered climber. Large, bright
yellow, ruffled flowers resemble a star burst when in full bloom. Blooms
abundantly all season. 20 to 35 petals. Fragrant. Climbing canes reach 3.6
to 4.3 metres (12 to 14 feet). Bright green leaves. Cool temperatures give
the best colour and size. Introduced in 1956. Protect well as it is tender.
‘High Noon’: AARS 1948. Climbing hybrid tea. Large, light yellow flowers
with a loosely cupped form bloom all season. 25 to 30 petals. Spicy
fragrance. Leathery, glossy green leaves. Climbing canes reach 3 to
3.6 metres (10 to 12 feet). Disease resistant.
152
Part III: All the Roses You Need to Know

‘King Tut’: Climbing miniature. Golden yellow flowers have a touch of
pink. Small blooms have 20 to 25 petals and appear in abundance. Plant
grows about 2 to 2.5 metres (7 to 8 feet) high with glossy, dark green
foliage. Disease resistant. Great in containers. Introduced in 1995.
‘Royal Gold’: Large-flowered climber. Yellow buds blossom into lasting,
golden flowers with 30 to 40 petals in a hybrid tea-type shape. Borne
singly and in clusters on long, strong stems. Moderate to strong fragrance.
Glossy green leaves. Flowers do not fade, but flower production is not as
prolific as with other climbers. Good cut flower. Climbing canes reach
2.5 to 3 metres (8 to 10 feet). Introduced in l957.
White climbers
Two good ones to choose from, both large-flowered climbers:
‘Lace Cascade’: Full, white flowers with 26 to 40 petals grow in small
and large clusters amidst large, dark green leaves. Fragrant. Tall with a
spreading growth. Disease resistant. Introduced in 1992.
‘White Dawn’: Free flowering and vigorous, this rose delivers loads of
bright white, ruffled flowers and a sweet perfume. 30 to 35 petals.
Climbing canes reach 3.6 to 4.3 metres (12 to 14 feet). Glossy green
foliage. Disease resistant. Introduced in 1949.
Lavender climbers
Few lavender large-flowered climbers exist, but you might be able to find
‘Climbing Blue Girl’, a sort of hybrid tea rose described in Chapter 8.
‘Veilchenblau’ is another lavender climber that blooms on old wood (you
have to successfully winter it to get blossoms — it only blooms on its second
year’s growth).
Multicoloured climbers
Following are four favourite multicoloured climbers, of which ‘Dortmund’,
with its beautiful single blooms, always ranks very highly with us.
‘Dortmund’: Climbing shrub. Nail-polish red blossoms, which have a
small, white eye, bloom in clusters. Five to eight petals. Moderate scent.
Lacquered, deep green leaves. Climbing canes reach 3 to 3.6 metres
(10 to 12 feet). Highly disease resistant and winter hardy. Introduced
in l955.

metres (12 to 14 feet). Bloom improves as the plant gets older. Hardy.
Introduced in 1965.
‘Joseph’s Coat’: Large-flowered climber. Very popular. A kaleidoscope of
colours dance on the petals, often in the same cluster — shades of red,
pink, orange, and yellow. 23 to 28 petals. Light scent. Vigorous, glossy,
bright green foliage. Climbing canes reach 3 to 3.6 metres (10 to 12 feet).
Tender and susceptible to mildew. Introduced in 1964.
‘Rosy Mantle’: A large-flowering hybrid tea form with pink blended
blossoms. A vigorous grower with good disease resistance. Slight
fragrance on the blooms but good repeat blooming all summer long.
Introduced in 1968 from Scotland.

 Landscaping with shrub roses
 Choosing shrub rose varieties
S
hrub roses are a diverse group of plants that don’t neatly fit into any of
the other rose categories. Shrubs, especially the modern ones, are very
popular because of their long season of bloom, pest and disease resistance,
and versatility in the landscape. In this chapter we describe all the forms
shrub roses are available in and how to raise ’em right.
A Splendid Assortment of Shrub Roses
We really mean it when we say — shrubs are a diverse group of plants! In fact,
these rose plants are often more different than they are alike. You can find
shrubs that are neat, compact little plants staying about 90 centimetres (3 feet)
high. (See Figure 13-1.) Others are upright giants that you’d swear would
reach the clouds if you didn’t whack them back once in a while. Still others
are low-growing, sprawling plants able to grow 3 to 3.6 metres (10 to 12 feet)
wide in warmer parts of the country.
To further complicate things, many roses that really don’t need to be called
shrubs, particularly some floribundas and climbers, often are labelled as
such. And to add to the confusion, some rose growers call their shrubs
landscape roses.
Oh well — no matter. Shrubs are great roses with great flowers, as shown in
Figure 13-2. Their diversity translates into versatility in the landscape. But
we’ll get to more examples of growing a bit later in this chapter.

Shrub roses really come into their own as landscape plants. If you’re thinking
about planting any flowering shrubs, think hard before you overlook shrub
roses. Plants like ‘Carefree Beauty’, ‘Dreams Yellow’, and ‘Flower Carpet’ are
tough to top when it comes to amount of bloom and ease of care. And they’re
versatile in the landscape. You can use sprawling types as ground covers and
the upright ones as hedges, and the smaller ones are ideal for pots, perennial
borders, or low hedges. Chapter 5 lists specific varieties of shrub roses for
various landscape uses.

Even though shrub roses are diverse, some that resulted from the same
breeding programs have similarities, such as the following groups:
 Hardy shrubs: Several breeding programs have concentrated on creating
hardy shrubs for cold climates. These shrubs include Buck hybrids,
such as ‘Prairie Princess’, which were bred at Iowa State University, and
the Morden and Explorer (named after famous explorers) shrub roses
from Canada. Most of these hardy shrubs can withstand temperatures
down to –26° to –32° C (–15° to –25° F) and lower and have excellent
disease resistance. See Chapter 15 for more information on Explorer and
Morden roses.
 Meidiland roses: These roses originate in France. Most are sprawling
plants that are useful as ground covers or hedges. They are good repeat
bloomers, have excellent disease resistance, and are generally hardy to
about –23° C (–10° F).
 David Austin English roses: These shrubs are meant to combine the
ever-blooming character and disease resistance of modern roses with
the flower form and fragrance of old roses. The problem is that they don’t
always keep their promise. Although many are beautiful roses, some
varieties do not rebloom and are prone to disease, especially black spot.
But the fragrance! Choose your variety carefully. Most varieties are hardy
to about –18° C (0° F), which means they need protection in most parts
of Canada. Treat them the same as hybrid teas.
Taking It Easy
Most shrub roses are easy-to-grow roses that can get by on little care, other
than regular watering and occasional fertilizer. You can find out more about
watering and fertilizing in Chapters 18 and 19, respectively, of this book.
Many shrub roses can get along fine without much pruning, but you still want
to deadhead them (remove the faded flowers) to keep them blooming over the
entire season. Those that do have repeat blooms benefit from normal pruning
methods. A new series, the ‘Dream’ roses, are pruned thoughout the summer
with hedge shears; whack them back and they rebound with more flowers.
Our kind of rose! Otherwise, prune to keep some of the large varieties in
bounds. For more on pruning, see Chapter 20.
Many shrub roses are grown on their own roots (see Chapter 16 for more
information) and are pretty hardy, if not extremely so. You still want to mound
soil over the base of the more tender ones to protect them from freezing and
thawing and to ensure that not all the aboveground parts are killed if the
temperature gets really cold.

Chapter 13: Shrub Roses

Shrub Roses by Colour
The following sections list the best of the most widely available shrub roses.
Some rugosa roses (considered old garden roses) make useful, very hardy
shrubs, too. See Chapter 14 for more information about rugosas — the newer
rugosa hybrids are often included in the category of modern shrub roses.
Red shrubs
Here are some useful shrub roses with red flowers:
‘Dream Red’: Large 10-centimetre (4-inch) bright red blooms smother
this low-growing shrub rose. The repeat-blooming nature of this shrub
makes up for its lack of fragrance. Classic-shaped bloom with 24 petals.
Dark green, glossy foliage and reasonable hardiness; protect in zone 6
and colder. Produced on its own roots. Introduced in 2000.
‘L. D. Braithwaite’: David Austin English rose. Crimson red, fully double
blooms are cupped and open at the centre. Deeply fragrant. Always in
bloom during the growing season. Vigorous-growing and slightly spread-
ing plant can reach over 1.5 to 1.8 metres (5 to 6 feet) high and 1.8 to
2 metres (6 to 7 feet) wide. Introduced in 1988.
‘Prairie Fire’: Pointed buds open into bright red flowers with a white
base. Eight to ten wavy, heavily textured petals. Almost always in bloom
with enormous clusters — 35 to 50 blooms — on long stems. Fragrant.
The bush is vigorous and tall with dark, glossy foliage. Very hardy and
disease resistant. Introduced in 1960.
‘Red Meidiland’: Rich, red blooms with white centres almost hide the
bright foliage on this graceful bush. Five petals. Starts blooming in late
spring and repeats all season. No fragrance. Orange-red seed hips (rose
fruits that form after the flowers) remain in fall. The vigorous bush has a
mounded shape and is reasonably winter hardy. Grows 30 to 60 centime-
tres (1 to 2 feet) high, 1.5 metres to 1.8 metres (5 to 6 feet) wide. Works
well as a ground cover. Introduced in 1989. Protect in zone 5 or colder.
‘Red Ribbons’: A vigorous, spreading ground-cover rose with bright red,
single flowers. Good bloomer. Grows 60 to 75 centimetres (2 to 2.5 feet)
tall and about 1.2 metres (4 feet) wide. Good disease resistance.
Introduced in 1996.
‘Scarlet Meidiland’: Bright, cherry-red blooms of small, ruffled flowers
(15 to 20 petals) grow in huge clusters on a fast-spreading bush that
makes an excellent ground cover. Slight fragrance. The plant can spread
up to 1.8 metres (6 feet) in the season after planting and attain a height
of 0.9 to 1.2 metres (3 to 4 feet). Glossy, disease-resistant leaves.
Reasonably winter hardy in zone 5. Introduced in 1985.
158
Part III: All the Roses You Need to Know

‘Sevilliana’: A profuse-blooming Meidiland rose. Covers itself with fiery
red, double blooms all season and red hips into winter. The upright,
broad bush, 1.5 metres tall and 1.2 metres wide (5 feet tall and 4 feet wide)
makes an excellent traffic barrier or hedge. Bright, bronze-green foliage.

White shrubs
Here’s an extremely diverse and useful group of white-flowering shrub roses:
‘Alba Meidiland’: Large clusters of pure white flowers loaded with ruffled
petals (over 40). Blooms profusely throughout the summer. The old petals
drop off completely, making deadheading unnecessary. Light scent. The
dark, glossy foliage makes a vivid contrast against the white flowers.
Low, spreading bush, 60 to 90 centimetres (2 to 3 feet) high and twice as
wide, is an excellent ground cover. No pruning required. Disease resistant
and winter hardy. Introduced in 1987.
‘Fair Bianca’: David Austin English rose. Combines the perfume of an
antique rose with the repeat bloom of a modern rose. Large, cupped, fully
double blooms of pure white, satiny petals open into a saucer shape.
Extremely fragrant. The foliage on this bushy, upright plant is shiny and
bright green; new growth is reddish. One of the better English roses for a
small garden, the shrub rarely exceeds 90 centimetres (3 feet) high and
remains about as wide. This rose is an excellent addition to any garden
viewed at dusk. Introduced in 1982.
‘Pearl Meidiland’: Small, double flowers begin as soft pink blooms and
then fade to a pearly white. They grow profusely and continuously in large
clusters. Abundant dark green, glossy foliage covers the low, spreading
plant. Grows about 60 to 90 centimetres (2 to 3 feet) high and twice as
wide. Disease resistant and winter hardy. Excellent ground cover.
Introduced in 1989.
163
Chapter 13: Shrub Roses

blooming plant gets by on a minimum of care. Reaches about
60 centimetres (2 feet) high and equally wide. Hardy in zone 6 and disease
resistant. Good ground cover or container plant. Introduced in 1996.
‘White Meidiland’: Heavily petalled, snow-white blossoms grow in abun-
dant clusters on arching, spreading canes. More than 40 petals. Repeat
bloomer. Lightly fragrant. Lots of glossy, rich green foliage. Grows about
30 centimetres (1 foot) high and 1.5 metres (5 feet) wide. Can be used as
a ground cover. Disease resistant and winter hardy. Performs best in
mild climates. Introduced in 1987.
Lavender shrubs
Shakespeare must have loved lavender roses. Why else would so many of his
characters congregate here? Unfortunately, they brought their love of mild
winters with them and will require protection in zones 6 and colder.
‘Lavender Dream’: Dainty, lilac-pink flowers are produced continuously
in clusters on smooth stems with small, shiny leaves. No fragrance. The
plant is mounded and bushy. Arching canes reach over 1.5 metres (5 feet)
long and spread even wider. Excellent disease resistance. Introduced
in 1984.

Multicoloured shrubs
Colour preference should guide your choices among this kaleidoscope of
shrub roses, but ‘Carefree Wonder’ is one fine plant.
‘Carefree Wonder’: AARS 1991. This rose is amazingly carefree. It has
superb disease resistance and hardiness. The large flowers are bright
pink with a white eye and a creamy reverse. They practically cover the
plant all season long. 25 to 30 petals. Light scent. The 1.2- to 1.8-metre
(4- to 6-foot) bush has abundant, bright green leaves and grows in an
upright, mounding fashion. Performs well everywhere. Introduced in 1990.
‘Evelyn’: David Austin English rose. Full flowers with an apricot-pink
colour open into a rosette form. Over 40 petals. The roses appear in small
clusters and are very fragrant. The plant is upright and bushy with glossy
green leaves. Introduced in 1991.

In This Chapter

 Using species and old garden roses in your garden

 Species and old garden rose varieties
I
n this chapter, we describe mostly old roses and a few species. While these
roses make up only a fraction of all roses, they are among the easiest and
winter-hardiest to grow. If you can’t grow some of these, can we suggest
knitting as a hobby?
Species roses and old garden roses are sometimes referred to as antique roses.
They are an incredibly diverse group of plants, with great variety in plant
habit, flower form, and fragrance. Some have historical importance; others
were useful to hybridizers, who used them as breeding stock to create modern
rose varieties. Still others, such as the rugosas, continue to be bred today to
create better new hybrids.
Species and old garden roses enjoy great popularity for many reasons,
including the following:
 They have a rugged toughness — at least many of them do.
 Their flowers are singularly beautiful.
 Their fragrance is intense.
 They maintain a certain wildness, which sets them apart from the more
well-behaved modern roses.
With these great qualities come some caveats, however. You may also
encounter the following troubles with your species and old garden roses:

 Some varieties can be very vigorous plants that literally take over a
small garden.
 Some varieties are shy bloomers.
 Most varieties bloom only once a season.
 Some varieties are extremely disease prone.
Choose your species and old garden roses with care, especially if you’re just
getting into roses. And that’s what this chapter is all about — selecting old
roses that give you that wonderful antique quality without turning into garden
monsters.
What Cabbage Has to Do with Roses
Many old garden roses are a historical botanist’s dream, with mixed origins
and seemingly untraceable heritages. For the rest of us, their backgrounds
and parentage can be very confusing. Suffice it to say that early rose growers
loved to create new roses by crossing everything they could get their hands
on. The results, although often bewildering, brought about the lovely modern
roses that are grown today.
The following sections list the main types of old garden roses. We describe our
favourite varieties of each type, grouped by flower colour, later in this chapter.
Alba roses
These roses are thought to be hybrids between Rosa damascena and a white-
flowering form of the dog rose, Rosa canina. Though once popular in Europe,
few varieties are widely available today. Flowers are generally white to pink
and very fragrant, blooming primarily in spring. Plants are upright to about
1.8 metres (6 feet) and are generally very hardy. These roses are also candidates
for gardens with a bit too much shade for modern roses. As a rule, most are
hardy into zone 4.
Bourbon roses
Bourbons originated on the island known as L’ Isle Bourbon (now Reunion) in
the Indian Ocean. They are generally vigorous plants with a compact, shrubby,
or slightly climbing habit. Bourbons are useful as hedges. The blooms are pink
to red, cupped, and nicely fragrant. Hardiness is quite variable within this class;
they are best purchased from a catalogue or nursery that can identify which
are hardy. Unfortunately, most of them are very susceptible to black spot.
168
Part III: All the Roses You Need to Know

Cabbage roses
Cabbage roses (see Figure 14-1) are varieties of Rosa centifolia, which have
flowers with very thin, overlapping petals, making them look somewhat like a
head of cabbage. The flowers have a spicy fragrance. The plants bloom once
in spring in pink to purple shades. Their growing habit varies from shrub-like
to spreading. Most are hardy to –26° C (–15° F) without protection.
China roses
China roses have contributed many of their good characteristics, including a
long season of bloom, disease resistance, and a compact habit, to various
modern roses. The variety ‘Minima’, with its dainty leaves and small flowers,
is the forerunner of modern miniature roses. Chinas are excellent in pots and
as edgings. However, they lack hardiness and are tough to grow without a lot
of winter protection. Leave these to those who are compulsive about winter
protection for roses.
Damask roses
These roses date all the way back to early Greek civilization. Their clustered
flowers are intensely fragrant and come in shades of white, pink, and red. The
plants are very hardy and don’t need winter protection until temperatures
drop below –29° C (–20° F). They have thorny stems and are usually not good
repeat bloomers.
169
Chapter 14: Species and Old Garden Roses
Figure 14-1:

rose.

Gallica roses
Various forms of Rosa gallica have been grown for centuries, and some have
interesting histories (see the description of Rosa gallica officinalis later in this
chapter). The red, pink, or purple flowers are intensely fragrant, have showy
yellow stamens, and are followed by bright red hips. The foliage turns red in
the fall. Plants are stiffly upright but have a neat, shrub-like habit. Gallica
roses are candidates for growing in a bit of shade. They are very hardy to at
least –29° C (–20° F).
Hybrid musks
Another group with a confusing background, but most can be traced to the
musk rose, Rosa moschata. The flowers have that strong, musky fragrance
that most people call old rose fragrance. Most hybrid musks are vigorous,
spreading plants that are best treated as climbers, but some are shrubbier.
They bloom most heavily in spring and fall. Most varieties bloom in shades of
pink, and many produce bright orange hips. Hybrid musks tolerate more shade
than many other roses and need winter protection where temperatures drop
below –26° C (–15° F).
Hybrid perpetuals
The heritage of these roses is pretty confusing. Hybrid perpetuals were popu-
lar in the 19th century prior to the development of the hybrid tea. The fragrant
flowers come in shades of pink, purple, red, and sometimes white. They’re
great in bouquets. The best bloom is in spring, but you often get some flowers
throughout the summer. Plants are vigorous with arching canes and are
slightly more winter hardy than hybrid tea roses. Protect in zone 6 and colder.
Moss roses
In their true form, moss roses (see Figure 14-2) are naturally occurring
mutations — called sports — of Rosa centifolia and damask roses. They get
their name from the small hairs on their stems and bottoms of their flowers.
(However, now almost any rose that has mossy hairs is called a moss rose.)
The flowers are double, come in shades of white, pink, and red, and are very
fragrant. Early moss roses bloom only in spring, but newer hybrids are good
repeat bloomers. Hardiness varies and winter protection is recommended
from zone 6 and colder.
170
Part III: All the Roses You Need to Know

Portland roses
These roses have a mixed heritage, with traces of China, damask, and gallica
roses in their background. Although few are grown today, they were once
loved for their repeat bloom and very fragrant, multipetalled flowers, usually
in shades of pink. These are quite variable in hardiness. As a sub-group of the
damask rose, you’ll often find them listed with the damasks in catalogues.
171
Chapter 14: Species and Old Garden Roses
Figure 14-2:
A moss rose.
Noisettes are historically important old garden
roses, having contributed orange and yellow
shades to many modern climbing roses. The
plants usually are best treated as climbers sup-
ported by a trellis or fence. Noisette rose flowers
are fragrant and come in shades of white, cream,
yellow, orange, and sometimes red. They are not
hardy plants and suffer damage when temper-
atures fall below freezing. The canes have a
tendency to not harden off quickly enough; this
leads to extensive winter injury in most years.
Try them only if you live in the warmer parts of
Southern Ontario or British Columbia.
What’s all the noisette about?

Rugosa roses
Rugosas (derived from Rosa rugosa) and their many hybrids are tough,
extremely useful shrub roses valued for their spicy scent, attractive crinkled
foliage, disease resistance, and hardiness. They are among the hardiest roses,
able to withstand temperatures down to –37° C (–35° F) with little protection.
Actually, some of the newer hybrids can be, and often are, included in the
category of modern shrub roses. They are compact plants, 1.2 to 2.5 metres
(4 to 8 feet) high, and bloom in spring and fall in shades of white, pink, red,
purple, and yellow. Many varieties produce colourful hips. (See Figure 14-3.)
Scotch roses
Scotch roses are attractive shrubs with white, pink, or yellow, mostly single
blooms. Many varieties have handsome, finely cut, or crinkled foliage and
colourful hips. These plants may require winter protection in zones 6 or colder.
Some are hardier than others, so check your local supplier for hardiness
recommendations.
Species roses
Various species of rose (a species is a plant that, when crossed with itself,
produces seedlings that are identical to themselves and to each other) are
native from the North Pole to the Equator. They are a diverse group of plants
that have contributed many valuable characteristics to modern roses.
172

Figure 14-3:

rose.

Tea roses
The original tea rose was a cross between a China rose and Rosa gigantea.
Remnants of its free-blooming character and shapely flower buds can be found
in many modern hybrid teas. Fragrant flowers come in shades of creamy
white, pink, and yellow. The bushy plants are best adapted to milder climates,
where winter temperatures stay mostly above –9° C (15° F), because they lack
hardiness. This lets out most of Canada. On the bright side, if you can grow
them (with protection) they do have good disease resistance. (See Figure 14-4.)
Note that these are not hybrid tea roses.
173
Chapter 14: Species and Old Garden Roses
Figure 14-4:
A tea rose.
To make the distinction between species roses
and old garden roses clear (or at least somewhat
more so): A species rose is a rose just as nature
made it. You can still find many of them growing
naturally in various parts of the world. Species
roses have a specific botanical name, such as
Rosa rugosa.
Exactly what makes an old garden rose an old
garden rose is less specific. Usually, these are
simply roses that were popular prior to the 20th
century.
If you crossed a species rose with itself, the
roses that grew from the seed would be identi-
cal, or nearly so, to the parents and to each other.
Old garden roses are most often descended from
a mixed background of natural or man-made
hybrids, and if you planted their seeds, the result-
ing plants would be distinctly different from each
other and from the parents.
Making a difference

Antiques in the Garden
The size and habit of species and old garden roses dictate how you can use
them in the landscape. Vigorous types, like the Portlands, can be trained to a
fence or arbour like a climbing rose, or they can be left to sprawl over a slope
as a ground cover. Shrubbier ones like the rugosas make excellent hedges
or can be mixed in with perennial borders. (See Perennials For Dummies,
published by IDG Books Worldwide, for more information about creating
perennial borders.) Even though many bloom only once in spring, they often
make up for it by producing colourful hips that last long into winter. Others,
like the rugosas and some of the Scotch roses, have attractive foliage that
looks good throughout the growing season.
Most antique roses have very interesting flowers. In fact, in many parts of
this book, you’ll see modern roses, such as the David Austin English roses,
described as having “old rose character.” The phrase is not very precise, but
it usually means that the flower is flat-topped, rounded, and rather cup-
shaped, with many petals. That’s quite a bit different from the high, pointed,
urn-shaped buds and swirling petals of the classic hybrid tea, to which roses
are usually compared.
If you like cut flowers, antique roses are tops. Although most don’t have the
strong, straight stems of modern hybrid teas, their beautiful flower form makes
for a unique bouquet. And, oh, the fragrance. It doesn’t get any more alluring.
Just remember one thing about many species and old garden roses: They
usually grow on their own roots and, as such, often spread like crazy, forming
dense thickets. Make sure that you plant these roses where they have plenty of
room to grow. If you have any doubts, contact one of the mail-order catalogues
that specialize in species and old garden roses, such as Pickering Nurseries,
and ask a few questions. (You can find addresses and phone numbers for
various suppliers in Appendix B.)
Carefree Antiques
Many species and old garden roses need less care than modern roses do. In
fact, many seem to thrive on neglect. However, where summers are dry, regular
watering is necessary to keep the plants healthy. And almost anywhere,
applying fertilizer regularly keeps the plants growing vigorously.
Prune your plants to keep them within bounds and remove dead branches.
Otherwise, less pruning is probably better than more. Roses that bloom just
once in spring should be pruned after they bloom. If you prune in winter or
late spring prior to blooming, you remove branches that would otherwise
produce flowers. Just to confuse the issue, renovation pruning, pruning that
174
Part III: All the Roses You Need to Know

restores an old plant, is best undertaken when the plant is dormant so the
branches you want to remove are not obscured by leaves. This is for two
reasons: The first is that if you can see the plant structure, you can see the
dead or rubbing canes to remove them. The second is that you won’t get stuck
so often by the thorns because no leaves are hiding them.
For more information about caring for species and old garden roses, refer to
Part IV of this book.
Few nurseries and garden centres carry a wide selection of species and old
garden roses. For the best selection, you have to order plants from one of the
catalogues that specialize in antique roses. Several catalogues are listed in
Appendix B, including Hortico Nurseries. Even if you don’t buy anything, these
catalogues make for fun reading.
Roses with Colourful Heritage
The following sections list some of our favourite species and old garden roses
by colour.
Red roses
Here are some of the best species and old garden roses with red flowers. Go
for the ones with strong fragrance.
‘Fellenberg’: Noisette. Bright crimson flowers with 35 petals in a cupped
form. The bush grows vigorously and tends to spread. Grows 0.9 to
1.5 metres (3 to 5 feet) high. Introduced in 1835.
‘F. J. Grootendorst’: Hybrid rugosa. Small, red, semi-double flowers
resembling carnations grow continuously on mounded shrubs that are
1.2 to 1.5 metres (4 to 5 feet) tall and wide. Slight fragrance. 25 petals. The
foliage is bright green and crinkled. Disease resistant, but may develop
some black spot by the end of the season. Winter hardy. Introduced
in 1918.
‘Henry Nevard’: Hybrid perpetual. A rugged, hardy bush that produces
loads of dark red, aromatic flowers all season. Reaching 1.2 to 1.5 metres
(4 to 5 feet) tall, the bush has dark, glossy leaves. 30 petals. Disease
resistant. Introduced in 1924.
‘Hugh Dickson’: Hybrid perpetual. Fragrant, deep crimson, double
blossoms are always in bloom until hard frost on this easy-to-grow bush.
The plant reaches 1.5 to 1.8 metres (5 to 6 feet) tall and is disease resistant.
Introduced in 1905.

‘Linda Campbell’: Hybrid rugosa. Large clusters of deep red, semi-double
flowers with contrasting yellow stamens are borne on arching stems that
are 1.8 to 2.5 metres (6 to 8 feet) tall. 25 petals. Good repeat bloomer.
Foliage is a lovely, textured grey-green. Grows best in heat. Can develop
mildew in coastal conditions. Introduced in 1991.
‘Rose du Roi’: Portland. 100 rich, velvet-red petals make for a regal flower.
Add the intense fragrance and continuous bloom, and you have a prince
of rosedom. The bush is compact and upright with glossy green leaves.
Disease resistant. Introduced in 1815.
Rosa gallica officinalis: Gallica. This flower is the Red Rose of Lancaster,
used as the badge of the Lancasters during the century-long Wars of the
Roses in England. The plant has been in cultivation since before 1300.
Also known as the apothecary’s rose. Used in fine potpourris, preserves,
syrups, and powders. We agonized whether to put it under pink roses
(the blossom is pretty pinkish) or red (it is after all the Red Rose of
Lancaster) but we decided to go with tradition and call it a red rose.
The intensely fragrant flowers are light crimson and have one annual
flowering in late spring. 12 to 18 petals. The bush grows 0.9 to 1.2 metres
(3 to 4 feet) tall with green, rough foliage. Has a tendency to sport. (Sports
are shoots that mutate naturally and produce a different rose — so the
same bush may have one or more variations.) Disease resistant and
winter hardy.
Pink roses
You’ll find more pink species and old garden roses than any other colour.
If you can’t make up your mind, choose by plant habit, capability to repeat
bloom, or fragrance.
‘Alfred de Dalmas’: Hybrid moss. Also known as ‘Mousseline’ because
the petals resemble a delicate French muslin. Light blush pink, cupped
blooms fade to white. 55 to 65 petals. Blooms repeatedly in clusters.
Strong perfume. Compact, spreading bush is 60 to 90 centimetres (2 to
3 feet) tall. Sparse, brownish moss on stems. Disease resistant.
Introduced in 1855.
‘Autumn Damask’: Damask. Medium pink, double flowers with rich
fragrance bloom in clusters in the spring and then again in autumn. The
plant is compact enough to be grown in a container at 0.9 to 1.5 metres
(3 to 5 feet) tall and 0.6 to 1.2 metres (2 to 4 feet) wide. Foliage is dull
green and rough. Winter hardy. Also known as the Rose of Castille,
autumn damasks grow nearly wild in New Mexico and California, where
Spanish missionaries first transplanted it. Introduced in the 1600s.
176
Part III: All the Roses You Need to Know

‘Ballerina’: Hybrid musk. Perpetually blooming clusters are covered
with masses of small, pale pink flowers with white centres. Five petals.

disease resistant. Does not need yearly pruning. Introduced in 1894.
‘Celsiana’: Damask. Pale pink, semi-double flowers with 12 to 15 crinkled
petals. Nice fragrance. Grey-green foliage on a vigorous, upright plant
that reaches about 1.2 to 1.5 metres (4 to 5 feet) high. Introduced prior
to 1750.
‘Empress Josephine’: Gallica. Empress Josephine’s gardener grew this
rose in the Empress’s palace gardens and named the flower after her.
Luminous pink with deeper pink tones toward the centre, the ruffled
blooms have a papery quality. 24 to 30 petals. Slight fragrance. Upright,
compact bush is 0.9 to 1.2 metres (3 to 4 feet) tall with narrow, grey-green
leaves. Winter hardy and disease resistant. One annual bloom. Known to

‘Fantin-Latour’: Cabbage. Loads of petals (maybe 200) range from pale
to deep pink. One profuse annual flowering. Intense fragrance. Upright,
vigorous bush is 1.8 m (6 feet) tall with smooth, light green leaves. Disease
resistant and reasonably winter hardy — protect in zones 5 and colder.
Exact date of introduction unknown, but around 1850.
‘Felicia’: Hybrid musk. Large clusters of pink, double flowers grow
repeatedly on long, arching canes. Very fragrant. Tolerates filtered light
well. The plant is 1.5 metres (5 feet) tall with glossy green foliage. Hardy

178
Part III: All the Roses You Need to Know

‘Paul Neyron’: Hybrid perpetual. Tightly packed with petals in various
shades of pink, blossoms bloom lavishly in late spring and then again in
autumn. 65 to 75 petals. Fragrant. The bush has glossy green leaves and
grows to 1.5 to 1.8 metres (5 to 6 feet) tall. Disease resistant and winter
hardy. Introduced in 1869.
Rosa eglanteria: Species. Light pink blooms with five petals show off
bright yellow stamens in one annual blooming. The flowers and leaves

apple scent. Clusters of bright red hips appear in fall. Upright, vigorous
bush reaches 2.5 to 3 metres (8 to 10 feet). Copious, glossy green foliage.
Disease resistant and winter hardy. In cultivation before 1551 and known
in Europe as the Sweet Briar Rose. Introduced prior to 1551.
‘Sarah Van Fleet’: Hybrid rugosa. Extremely fragrant pink blossoms with
showy yellow stamens bloom repeatedly all summer. 18 to 24 petals. The
1.8- to 2.5-metre (6- to 8-foot) bush is upright and vigorous with dark
green, leathery, patterned leaves. Makes an excellent hedge. Disease
resistant and winter hardy. Introduced in 1926.
‘Souvenir de la Malmaison’: Bourbon. Immense, wonderfully fragrant
blooms start out cupped and then open flat. The flowers are the palest of
pinks — a cream blush — with rose shading at the centre. 65 to 75 petals.
Repeats blooming steadily throughout the season. The bush is compact,
75 centimetres (2.5 feet) tall and wide, with large, leathery leaves. The
climbing form reaches 2.5 to 3.6 metres (8 to 12 feet) tall. Does not like
wet weather. Hardy to –23° C (–10° F). Moderately disease resistant.
Extremely popular rose but difficult to establish in a garden. Introduced
in 1843.
‘Stanwell Perpetual’: Scotch. Light pink, fading to white, blossoms
bloom singly on very short stems. 45 to 55 petals. Fragrant. Blooms
repeatedly after the plant is well established in the garden. The bush is

intensely fragrant. They begin as pink but age to mauve. Bloom occurs
only once in a season. The plant is vigorous, sprawling, and 1.8 to
2 metres (6 to 7 feet) tall. Disease resistant and winter hardy. Introduced
in 1856.
179
Chapter 14: Species and Old Garden Roses

‘Zéphirine Drouhin’: Bourbon. You can safely plant this rose along walk-
ways because it is almost thornless. It is also very fragrant and produces
peppermint-pink, loosely cupped blossoms all season. 20 to 24 petals. The
plant is a climber, 2.4 to 3.6 metres (8 to 12 feet) high in warm climates.
Medium green, glossy leaves. Shade-tolerant. Disease resistant but not
as hardy as other Bourbons. Will likely need protection if used as a
climber in zones 6 and colder. Introduced in 1868.
Yellow roses
The following are the class of the yellow old garden and species roses:
Rosa harisonii: Species. Also known as ‘Harison’s Yellow Rose’. A tough,
hardy, disease resistant, and drought-tolerant shrub. Deep yellow, semi-
double flowers are fragrant and bloom in spring. Rich green, fernlike
foliage covers the spreading plant, which can grow to 3 metres (10 feet)
tall. Can grow in poor conditions, including shade. In cultivation since
1830 and extremely hardy.
Rosa hugonis: Species. Also know as ‘Father Hugo Rose’. Produces
sprays of pale yellow, single flowers in spring. Five petals. Little or no
fragrance. Blooms are borne on arching stems reaching 1.8 to 2.5 metres
(6 to 8 feet) high and covered with fernlike, deep-green leaves. Disease
resistant and extremely hardy. Introduced in 1899.
‘Spring Gold’: Scotch. A mid-yellow, semi-double blossom with heavy
fragrance makes this a delight in almost any garden. One of the hardier
Scotch roses, the 1.8-metre (6-foot) tall canes can be trained as climbers.
Unfortunately, it is a non-repeat bloomer but has good disease resis-
tance. Introduced from Germany in 1937.
‘Topaz Jewel’: Hybrid rugosa. The first re-blooming yellow rugosa rose.
The frilly, light yellow blossoms emerge all season in scented clusters
on the arching, dense bush. Old flowers drop off cleanly. 25 petals. The
1.5-metre (5-foot) tall and 2-metre (7-foot) wide bush has crinkled leaves.
Disease resistant and winter hardy. Introduced in 1987.
180
Part III: All the Roses You Need to Know
We’ve only got one orange species rose to
mention: Rosa foetida ‘bicolour’. This rose’s
orange-red, simple blossoms with five petals
bloom early in the season, giving off a heavy
fragrance. In cultivation since 1590, the upright
plant is irregularly shaped and has rather sparse,
dull green leaves. Prone to black spot and not
reliably winter hardy. If you have to grow it,
protect it in zones 6 or colder.
Orange you going to tell me about orange roses?

Chapter 14: Species and Old Garden Roses
White roses
Here are some of our favourite white old garden and species roses:
‘Blanc Double de Courbert’: Hybrid rugosa. Ruffled, snow-white,
intensely fragrant blossoms appear early in the season and repeat their
performance later. 18 to 24 petals. Spent blooms tend to hang on, looking
a little like dirty white socks. The bush is upright and vigorous. 1.2 to
1.8 metres (4 to 6 feet) tall with light green, leathery leaves. Disease
resistant and very winter hardy. Introduced in 1892.
‘Boule de Neige’: Bourbon. The name means “snowball” in French, and
that’s what these flowers look like when they’re in full bloom. Made up
of about 100 petals, the outer petals curl inward, giving the flower a big
ball effect. Fragrant. Repeat bloomer. The bush is 1.2 to 1.5 metres (4 to
5 feet) tall, upright, and slender with dark, leathery leaves. Disease
resistant and winter hardy. Introduced in 1867.
‘Madame Hardy’: Damask. ‘Madame Hardy’ is a study in style. Elegant,
tight buds open to lush, snow-white flowers with an eye-catching green
point in the centre. The blooms occur in clusters, with the centre blossoms
opening first. The flowers have probably 200 petals. Richly fragrant. The
plant is sturdy and vigorous, covered with grey-green leaves; 1.5 metres
(5 feet) tall. Disease resistant and winter hardy. Introduced in 1832.
‘Madame Plantier’: Alba. Not for a small garden, ‘Madame Plantier’ is a
large, dense, arching bush that you can train as a climber. It sends out
clusters of extremely fragrant, pompon-like blooms once, early in the
summer. Over 200 petals. The plant grows 1.8 to 2.5 metres (6 to 8 feet)
tall with smooth, long, medium green leaves. Disease resistant and winter
hardy. Introduced in 1835.
‘Sir Thomas Lipton’: Rugosa. Double, cupped, white blooms grow
abundantly and repeatedly throughout the season on a vigorous, bushy
plant. Leathery, dark green foliage. 1.8 to 2.5 metres (6 to 8 feet) tall.
Introduced in 1900.
Lavender roses
Of these two lavender antiques, ‘Hansa’ is the most versatile in the landscape:
‘Charles de Mills’: Gallica. ‘Charles de Mills’ has been known to flower in
many variations of purple and red: maroon, crimson, grape, wine, and
violet. The fully opened, fragrant blossoms have about 200 swirling petals
and a flat-topped appearance because the petals are so evenly spaced.
Only one bloom occurs, midseason, on the upright, vigorous bush. 1.2 to
1.5 metres (4 to 5 feet) tall and 1.5 metres (5 feet) wide. Rough green
leaves. Disease resistant and winter hardy. Origin date is unknown,
probably 19th century.

182
Part III: All the Roses You Need to Know
‘Hansa’: Hybrid rugosa. This tall, arching shrub produces plentiful,
intensely fragrant, purple-red blooms in late spring, with good repeat
blooms. The flowers have 35 to 45 petals in a loose, cupped form. Large
red hips appear in late summer, adding to the interest that this plant can
provide in a garden. The shrub grows 1.8 to 2 metres (6 to 7 feet) tall and
wide and is covered with green, wrinkled leaves that turn bronze in the
fall. Disease resistant and winter hardy. Introduced in 1905.
Multicoloured roses
Here’s a kaleidoscope of multicoloured antique roses:
‘Camaieux’: Gallica. Rose-pink-and-white-striped blossoms with 65 petals
decorate this compact, rounded bush in the spring. Wonderfully fragrant,
the flowers are cupped and camellia-like. The bush grows 90 centimetres
(3 feet) tall and wide and is easy to grow. Prone to mildew in warm,
humid regions. Winter hardy. Introduced in 1830.
‘Félicité Parmentier’: Alba. Ivory buds, tinged green, open into fluffy,
flesh-pink and cream flowers of exceptional fragrance. The flowers arrive
in abundance in the spring on a compact, 1.2-metre (4-foot) tall and wide
bush with grey-green leaves. Disease resistant but occasionally susceptible
to mildew. Grows well in a variety of climates. Winter hardy. Introduced
in 1834.

Old roses meet new technology

‘Honorine de Brabant’: Bourbon. Pale lilac blossoms striped in crimson
and violet grow abundantly in spring and autumn on a large, bushy plant.
The flowers are richly fragrant, full, and double. The bush grows to
1.8 metres (6 feet) tall and is covered with medium green foliage. Disease
resistant. Will require winter protection in zone 6 or colder. Date of origin
not known, probably mid-19th century.
‘Léda’: Damask. Soft, fragrant flowers with 200 petals, white edged in
red, bloom once in the summer. The bush is low, 60 to 90 centimetres
(2 to 3 feet) tall, and grows in a spreading, trailing fashion. The bush
can be trained upright as a climber (see Chapter 5 for more information).
Disease resistant and winter hardy. Introduced before 1827.
‘Nymphenburg’: Hybrid musk. A most beautiful and fragrant rose. Flowers
of salmon-shaded yellow at the base are borne in clusters all summer. 18
to 24 petals. The bush has large, glossy leaves and grows 1.2 to 2 metres
(4 to 7 feet) tall and 1.8 metres (6 feet) wide. Vigorous and disease
resistant. Introduced in 1954.
‘Vick’s Caprice’: Hybrid perpetual. Reliable, repeat-blooming rose with
large, pink- and white-striped flowers. Cupped, fragrant blooms. Bush
grows 1.2 metres (4 feet) tall and less wide. Not reliably disease resistant.
Introduced in 1891.
‘York and Lancaster’: Damask. For history buffs, this rose is an interesting
one — named after rival families in 15th-century England. The emblem of
York was the white rose (White Rose of York), the emblem of Lancaster
the red rose. The battles between these two for the English throne came
to be known as the Wars of the Roses. The wars seem to be still going on
in this rosebush — the white and pink petals battle for dominance. Some
flowers may be half pink and half white, and others are almost all one
colour or the other. The fragrant blossoms have 24 to 30 petals formed in
a loose cup shape. They bloom once in the summer on a 0.9- to 1.2-metre
(3- to 4-foot) tall bush with rough grey-green leaves. Not vigorous — a
slow grower. Disease resistant and winter hardy. Originated in 1551.

Explorer and Parkland Roses
In This Chapter
 Winning Canadian roses
 Seeing the benefits of Agriculture Canada’s hard work
 Acquiring all the Explorer and Parkland roses you want
I
f you have trouble growing roses, Explorers and Parklands are the plants
for you. Grown and bred in Canada for the rigours of our Canadian winters,
they’re naturally a little tougher than your average rose — we’re not living in
the tropics, you know.
Breeders working for Agriculture Canada developed the Parkland and Explorer
series of roses, and they continue working on the development of the perfect
all-Canadian rose. Many wonderful plants in the series have been released
to the public and we describe them all here.
What’s So Wonderful about Them?
In our recommendations throughout this chapter, we indicate for each rose
whether it is an Explorer or a Parkland. We think you should just grow the rose
that appeals to you whether it’s an Explorer or Parkland — they’re all great
roses, and here’s why:
 They are extremely hardy: Most thrive to zone 3 and even zone 2 with a
bit of winter protection.
 All new shoots flower: Even if old rose canes are killed to the ground by
winter cold, the new canes can flower in the first year of their growth.
 They are disease resistant: While not immune to problems such as black
spot, they are less likely to be killed by infestations.
 They are heavy bloomers: Some, such as ‘Champlain’, bloom all summer
while others, such as ‘John Cabot’, bloom heavily in July with sporadic
blooms the rest of the summer.

 They are very versatile: Explorer roses are available in three types —
climbers, bush, and semi-miniatures. They make great hardy climbers,
hedges that need little care, or beautiful container roses. A wealth of
possibilities arises.
 They grow easily on their own roots: No rootstock for us hardy Canadians
— we’ll do it on our own roots. (See Chapter 16 for the advantages of
own-root roses.)
If an Explorer is propagated on its own roots, there is no need to plant it
deeply. If it is on a rootstock, plant the rootstock so the bud union is 5 to
10 centimetres (2 to 4 inches) deep to protect the graft from winter damage.
Getting Your Hands on Them
Funny thing is, even though they are wonderful roses for the North, most
garden centres only stock one or two of the Explorers and Parkland roses
each spring. To obtain the newer varieties like ‘Marie-Victorin’ or those that
haven’t been adopted by major propagators (who supply the garden centres),
you’ll have to use specialty catalogues. See the lists in Appendix B.
You’ll also find more success obtaining own-root roses through the specialty
catalogues, such as Corn Hill Nursery, which grow their own roses. (In
Chapter 16 we explain why own-root roses are a good thing.) Major propaga-
tors find it faster and more economical to bud all their roses on rootstocks.
You may have to search a bit if you want to collect all these roses, but
sources such as Corn Hill, Pickering Nurseries, and Hortico are good places
to start. (Appendix B tells you how to find these sources.)
186
Part III: All the Roses You Need to Know
We should tell you that the Parkland roses are
mostly named “Morden” something or other,
after the Research Station in Morden, Manitoba.
While there are a few exceptions to this (don’t ask
us how or why the government plant breeders
choose names), this is the general rule.
The main difference between a Parkland and an
Explorer rose is that the Parkland roses used the
native species Rosa arkansana as the main
breeding parent, while the first Explorer roses
werebasedon Rugosa type roses as their parent
stock. Climbing Explorer roses have a healthy
dose of Rosa kordesii in their genetic makeup
to give long canes. Through breeding, both
Rosa laxa and Rosa spinosissima altaica pass
along their disease resistance to both classes.
Repeat-blooming characteristics were found in
ever-blooming hybrid shrub and tea roses.

Some garden centres are quite good about ordering rose plants for their
customers. If you have a favourite nursery, phone them early in the year (the
earlier the better — like January or February) and ask them to find the rose
you’re looking for and bring it in for you. You might pay a premium for this
service, but at least you’ll get your rose.
A Canadian Mosaic: Explorer and
Parkland Roses by Colour
Because they share the same kind of hardiness and Canadian origins, we
group the Parkland family with the Explorer series in the following lists of
recommendations by colour:
Red roses
Lots of great scarlet numbers to try here — grow any of these for a guaranteed
bright spot in your garden:
‘Adelaide Hoodless’: Parkland. Large clusters of bright red blooms are
produced in July and again in September. It is a good idea to deadhead
this variety to promote the fall rebloom. Grows to 90 centimetres (3 feet)
tall, with arching stems to 90 centimetres (3 feet) wide. Good resistance
to powdery mildew, but black spot resistance is moderate. Introduced
in 1973.
‘Alexander MacKenzie’: Explorer. A tall, upright, and vigorous shrub
reaching 1.5 to 1.8 metres (5 to 6 feet) with a spread of 1.2 to 1.8 metres
(4 to 6 feet). Deep red, cup-shaped flowers produced in clusters with a
single large flush followed by sporadic reblooming. Will die back in zone
3b without protection and some cane damage in zone 4 is not uncommon.
Highly disease resistant. Introduced in 1985.
187
Chapter 15: Explorer and Parkland Roses
You may have a particular gardening project in
mind that requires a good hardy Explorer or
Parkland rose. Keep these suggestions in mind:
 For a container try ‘Royal Edward’ or ‘Morden
Cardinette’.
 For a hedge try ‘Jens Munk’, or ‘Prairie Joy’.
 For fragrance try ‘Louis Jolliet’, or ‘Cuthbert
Grant’.
 For ground cover try ‘Charles Albanel’, or
‘William Booth’.
Looking for something specific?

‘Captain Samuel Holland’: Explorer. Tall, pillar type of rose that grows
up to 1.8 metres (6 feet) tall and 1.2 to 1.8 metres (4 to 6 feet) wide. When

 Rose-buying tips
S
o this rose deal is starting to sound pretty good to you. Maybe you want
to get a couple of plants and give it a try. Good decision, but where are
you going to get them? These days you can buy roses almost anywhere, from
supermarkets to drugstores, not to mention the usual places like nurseries
and garden centres. You can also shop in the convenience of your own
home through mail-order catalogues and the Internet. (You can find a list in
Appendix B.)
But before you rush out waving your credit card in hand, you need a little
background information on how roses are grown and sold.
You can buy roses in three ways: bareroot, potted, or in packages. How you
get them depends on where you buy them. Some nurseries and all mail-order
sources offer bareroot roses early or late in the season. Many garden centres
offer potted rosebushes, and discount stores often sell roses less expensively
in special lightweight packaging. How your roses come to you dictates how
you plant them, so knowing what you’re getting into before you buy is
important.
Whose Roots Are These, Anyway?
To really understand how a rose plant gets its start, you need to read Chapter 1,
“Everything You Need to Know about Roses,” and Chapter 23, “Making More
Roses.” Basically, most rose plants have two parts: the top part that produces
the nice flowers, and the bottom of the plant that produces the roots, called

the rootstock (see Figure 16-1). They are joined at the bud union. During winter,
a small bud from the mother plant, say a ‘Peace’ rose, is slipped into the bark
of a rootstock, another type of rose. In a few months, the two fuse together
and become one plant.
We know why growers want the top of the plant to be ‘Peace’ — it’s a great
rose. But why do they need the rootstock? A rootstock can provide a number
of advantages that wouldn’t exist if a ‘Peace’ were grown on its own roots,
including the following:
  Greater vigour in growing and blooming
  Resistance to certain soil-borne insects and diseases
  Adaptation to certain soil types
Commercial rose growers choose which rootstock to use (they may have 10
or 15 to choose from), but they don’t label them on the plant you buy. Roses
grown in Canada will use hardier rootstocks than many imported roses but
that’s really all you need to know about rootstocks.
Some commercial rose growers propagate rose varieties, especially shrub
and old garden roses, on their own roots and call them own-root roses. These
roses are started as rooted cuttings and grown to maturity on their own roots.
The way an own-root rose sprouts true to type (meaning that it produces the
type of flower you expect it to) is also an advantage when you grow shrub or
landscape roses that need to be sheared. This type of pruning often causes the
plants to sprout at the base, and if they’re on their own roots — you guessed
it — the sprouts are the type of rose you want.

Own-root modern shrubs and floribundas are offered in the same venues as
budded roses. Unless you inspect it very carefully, you don’t know whether a
plant is own-root or budded. It really doesn’t matter, as long as the plant
thrives for you.
Own-root roses have a possible downside, especially when you’re dealing with
a very vigorous shrub or old garden roses. On their own roots, these plants
often spread by root suckers — sprouts that come from the roots, as shown in
Figure 16-2 — and spread is the key word. These sprouts can literally take
over a garden, sprouting everywhere you don’t want them.
197
Chapter 16: Shopping for Roses
Root sucker
Figure 16-2:
Root suckers

of own-root

Own-root roses can be an advantage in our
Canadian winters. Here’s why: Say the weather
gets abnormally cold — so cold that the temper-
ature kills the top of your rose plant. The roots
are insulated by the soil, so they may live on to
resprout next spring. If the rose was budded on
a rootstock, the new sprouts might come from
the rootstock, but you don’t have any idea what
variety that is. So instead of ‘Peace’ flowers, you
get who knows what. If, on the other hand, the
rosewasgrownonitsownroots,thenewsprouts
are ‘Peace’, and you still have the rose you want.
Note that hybrid tea roses on their own roots are
not much hardier than budded roses. Most of
the advantages of own-root roses belong to the
hardier roses, not the more tender types.
Why your own-roots are good choices in Canada

What Are Roots without Soil?
Come winter, when all the roses grown in nursery fields are dormant (resting)
and leafless, they’re pruned and dug out of the ground without any soil on
their roots. These are called — surprise — bareroot roses. Removing all the
soil from the roots doesn’t hurt the plant. As long as the rose plant is dormant
and the roots are kept moist, the plant is in great shape. And the plant weighs
next to nothing — perfect for shipping.
Next, the bareroot roses are either bundled up, packed, usually in moist
sawdust, and shipped off to retail nurseries or stored until the spring shipping
season. Sometimes, they’re packaged individually, with their roots packed in
moist sawdust and enclosed in plastic.
Actually, not all the roses are shipped at the same time. Nurseries try to time
their shipments to coincide with spring’s arrival. Shipments to British Columbia
will be earlier than those to Ontario and the Maritimes.
Back to those bundled roses that go to retail nurseries. Upon arrival, the
bareroot roses are unpacked and displayed for sale, sometimes in large bins
with their roots packed in — you got it — moist sawdust. Actually, the packing
can be any lightweight organic matter that holds moisture, including peat moss
or wood shavings. However, most retail nurseries immediately plant these
bareroot roses in pots. (See Figure 16-3.) A potted rose is easier to take care
of and if they do not sell during the spring rush, they can be more easily
maintained for fall sales.
Bareroot roses from a nursery or catalogue company are fine as long as the
weather is cold and the plants are dormant, but if it warms up and the plants
start growing, you have to plant them — and fast.
Never, ever, allow the roots of roses to dry out. A dry root is a dead root. If
you cannot plant your bareroot rose immediately on receipt, put it in a pail of
water (for up to 24 hours) but never let it sit outside so the roots are exposed.
Some roses, particularly miniatures and old roses, aren’t barerooted. Instead,
they spend their entire lives in containers. The vast majority of miniature
roses you buy are propagated and grown on their own roots in greenhouses
and are offered for sale in leaf or even in bloom. They usually come in
6-centimetre or 10-centimetre (21⁄2-inch or 4-inch) pots, ready for transplanting
into a garden or into containers for outdoor or indoor culture. A huge selection
of miniature roses is sold this way. Larger mail-order rose companies may send
you field-grown bareroot miniatures that arrive looking more like big roses
than minis. You should treat them the same way you do other bareroot roses.
198
Part IV: Growing Healthy Roses

For the most part, roses go from bareroot to you, or they are planted in pots
for retail sale. A few wholesale growers even take bareroot roses, plant them in
peat pots, and enclose them in plastic for shipping. A peat pot is a lightweight
pot made of pressed peat or paper fibre. (Don’t ask why we don’t call them
paper fibre pots.) You plant the rose, pot and all, and the peat/paper fibre pot
breaks down quickly, allowing the roots to grow out into the surrounding soil.
Going Shopping
You now know — because we just told you — that you can purchase roses in
three ways: bareroot, potted, or packaged. Bareroot roses are available during
early spring and late fall. You can buy potted roses at retail nurseries or garden
centres, or, for greater variety, you can purchase bareroot plants from one of
the sources listed in Appendix B.

Buying bareroot has one main advantage. In general, these roses are less
expensive than those sold in containers. Obviously, the pot and the soil add
to the cost of a container plant. So if you’re going to plant a lot of roses, you’re
better off buying during the dormant season and having the nursery ship
these plants to you at the proper time for planting.
Buying roses in containers also has its advantages — the main advantage
being that you can get roses in containers almost anytime. But you can also
buy growing, even blooming plants. These babies are ready to go in the
ground now and give you instant beauty. Wahoo! Instant colour! If you plant
in the middle of summer, make sure you don’t allow the rose to dry out. (See
Chapter 17 for planting and watering directions.)
Getting only the best
Most mail-order nurseries send you top-quality bareroot plants, and the plants
arrive in good condition. If they don’t, you’re entitled to a replacement. But if
you’re shopping in a nursery or garden centre, you get to examine plants
closely before you buy. You want to be able to tell what’s really a bargain and
what isn’t. You need to be able to recognize a plant that’s been hanging around
too long or has been neglected.
Bareroot roses are graded according to standards set by the Canadian Nursery
Trades Association. The grades — #1, #11⁄2, and #2 — are based on the size
and number of canes (main branches) on the plant. A #1 is the highest-grade
rose and represents a more vigorous, sturdy plant that should grow faster and
make more blooms the first year after planting. #11⁄2 and #2 are usually the
roses you find on sale and, in many cases, they may be a good deal. However,
if you want to get off to the best start, we think that you should pay a little
extra for a #1. Most roses have the grade listed on the package.
Other things to look for when buying bareroot roses include the following:
  Make sure that the packaging and the roots haven’t dried out — a sure
sign that trouble is ahead.
  If you can examine the roots, choose a plant that has a moist, well-
developed root system. Avoid those with dry, broken, or mushy roots.
  Look for plants with thick, dark green canes — the more the better.
Avoid plants that look dry, brownish, or shrivelled.

Part IV: Growing Healthy Roses

Going home a happy rose shopper
So you think you know all about buying roses, with bare roots or with roots
in soil, budded or on their own roots? Well, here are a few tips to ensure you
make great rose purchases that flourish in your garden.
When buying potted roses, keep these points in mind:
  The optimal time to buy potted roses is as early in the season as possible
when new growth is minimal, or late in the season just after the rose has
gone dormant.
  If you do buy potted roses later in the season before dormancy has set
in, choose plants with healthy, deep green foliage that is free of insects
and disease. Vigorous new growth — deep red in many varieties — is a
good sign.
  Don’t hesitate to purchase roses late in the fall if they are in good shape
— disease free and with strong canes. Fall is an excellent time to plant
roses. If you plant a potted rose in the fall, water regularly to ensure it
does not dry out before the ground freezes.
  Check the soil in the top of the pot. A pot full of twisting, circling roots
may be a sign the plant has been in the pot too long. Skip this plant unless
it is a really good deal — it will be slower to establish itself.
  Flower buds are a good sign. They mean that the plant has been well kept.
Choose them over plants that have just finished blooming.
When buying packaged bareroot roses, do the following:
  Buy early in the season when packaged roses have no foliage. Avoid
packaged roses that have foliage — they resent transplanting. Never buy
a packaged rose after early spring.
  Try to buy plants with complete root systems rather than those with
pruned, short roots.
  Never buy any package that has dry soil.

Y
ou’re probably ready to get those roses in the ground so that they start
growing and, better yet, start blooming! But wait just a minute. First, we
need to discuss some timing issues. Also, planting means dealing with dirt
— actually, soil in gardeners’ parlance. Because that soil will be your rose’s
home for its entire life, you need to know some things about it before you go
rushing outside with your shovel.
The way you plant your roses is the most important step in growing them.
Because they may be living in the place you plant them for many years, you
really have only one chance to start them off right. You should pay special
attention to soil chemistry, the rose hole, and drainage. If you just skim any
chapter in this book, don’t let it be this one!
If Roses Aren’t Sick, Why Do
They Need Heeling?
Chapter 16 explains the different ways you can buy roses. So when do you
buy ’em? After you get started with roses, you’ll probably find yourself waiting
with anticipation for new rose catalogues to arrive in late fall and winter. You

can order mail-order roses just about anytime — in fact, the earlier the better
to ensure that suppliers are not sold out of the varieties you want. Mail-order
nurseries send the plants when it’s time for planting in your area, or they ask
you when you want to receive them. Planting these bareroot roses when the
forsythias bloom is a good time. Basically, if your springtime garden soil can be
walked on without clumping up and sticking to your boots — you can plant
roses. The same rules hold true for pre-packaged roses.
Buy potted roses all season long — plant them when the roots are well
established in the pot. Having the option of buying a blooming rosebush in a
pot in midsummer to fill in an unplanned space or to replace a winter-damaged
plant has certainly saved a few gardeners’ reputations.
Storing bareroot roses
So you plant your roses as soon as you get them, right? That may seem like
good advice, but it’s not always practical. What if your bareroot roses arrive
in the dead of winter and the ground is frozen solid? Or what if it rains for 40
days and nights? Then what are you going to do?
When you purchase or get your bareroot rose order in the mail, inspect the
plants. Make sure plenty of moist packing surrounds the roots and that the
top canes are green and firm. If the temperatures outside are still too cold to
plant, the rose can be stored in one of two ways. For a week or two, the crisper
of the refrigerator makes a good temporary home. Kept cool without freezing,
the rose canes don’t grow and the plant stays fully dormant. Alternatively, if
the buds start to grow and swell and you can’t plant the rose for more than
two weeks, it can be potted. Just buy yourself a peat pot from a local nursery
and grow your rose plant in a cool, sunny spot. If only rain is stopping you from
planting, wait until it stops and plant, or just do it in the rain. The showers
won’t hurt the plant one tiny bit!
Heeling in is a way to store bareroot roses by packing their roots in moist
(not soggy) soil until planting time. Where and how you heel in your roses
depends on how many roses you have and on the soil conditions outdoors.
  If you have just a few roses, place them in a bucket or box and pack the
roots and top third of the plant with moist sawdust, compost, peat moss,
or soil. Store the whole thing in a cool (1° to 4° C or 35° to 40° F) place
and check the packing often to make sure that it’s moist. Unpack the
roses at planting time, being very careful not to do too much harm to the
tiny root hairs that may have grown along the main roots.
204
Part IV: Growing Healthy Roses

  If you have to store a lot of roses (say until the weekend when you can
spend time doing the planting job properly) and can work the ground
outdoors, dig a shallow trench about 30 centimetres (1 foot) deep, as
shown in Figure 17-1, slightly slanted on one side, in a shady area of the
garden (like the north side of the house). Lay the roses on a 45-degree
angle and pack the roots and the bottom third of the plant with moist
soil or compost. Check the packing often to make sure that it’s moist.
Add water if necessary. Gently remove the roses from the trench at
planting time.
Don’t keep roses heeled in much past the earliest planting time in your area,
because the plants start to develop fragile new roots and fragile new top
growth, both of which can be damaged when you start handling the plants.
Storing potted roses
Potted roses are easier to store temporarily until planting time. Just make
sure to keep the soil moist so that the plants don’t dry out. If you store grow-
ing roses for more than a week or two, you may want to fertilize them with a
liquid fertilizer, following the label instructions. Regular houseplant food
works well.

Of course, you may want to grow your roses in pots or other containers. In
this case, you can rest assured that you’ll need a bigger pot than the one in
which you bought your rose. See Chapter 7 for more information about 
growing roses in containers.
Getting in Touch with Your Inner Soil
We think that any gardener worth his or her salt should have an intimate 
relationship with soil. You need to grab it, squeeze it, smell it — you need to
love it so much that you know everything about it: the good, the bad, and the
ugly. Why? Because healthy soil means healthy roots, healthy roots mean
healthy plants, and healthy plants mean fabulous flowers.
Provided that drainage is good, roses grow well in most soils. But if you wait
until after you plant to find out that your soil has problems, you’ll find those
problems difficult or impossible to correct.
Basically, soil is a combination of mineral particles and organic matter (the
remnants of living things such as leaves, animal waste, and so on). The size of
the particles and the amount of organic matter determine soil texture. And
your soil’s texture determines not only how you plant but also how often you
have to water and fertilize.
The ideal soil, and you probably don’t have it, is well aerated; space for air in
a soil is absolutely necessary for healthy root growth. It also retains some
moisture and nutrients and drains well (water passes through it freely). Poorly
drained soil often becomes waterlogged, suffocating roots and killing the
plants that try to grow in it.
Although many in-betweens exist, you can conveniently break soils into 
three types:
  Sandy soils are made mostly of large mineral particles. Water moves
through these soils quickly and, as it does, takes nutrients with it. Sandy
soils are well aerated, quick to dry out, and often lacking in nutrients
that plants need.
  Clay soils are made mostly of small mineral particles that cling tightly
together. They hang on to water, are slow to dry out, and are poorly 
aerated.
  Loamy soils are a happy mixture of large and small mineral particles,
and they usually contain an abundance of organic matter. They are well 
aerated and drain properly, while still being able to hold water and 
nutrients.
206
Part IV: Growing Healthy Roses

You can get a pretty good idea of what kind of soil you have by grabbing a
moist handful and squeezing. When you let go, sandy soil falls apart and
doesn’t hold together in a ball. Clay soil oozes out between your fingers as you
squeeze and stays in a slippery wad when you let go. A loamy soil usually holds
together after squeezing, but it falls apart easily if you poke it with your finger.
You can also get some idea about your soil by watching what happens when
it rains:
  Water passes through clay soils slowly, so rainfall quickly puddles up
and drains away slowly. As clay soils dry, they often crack and become
hard-crusted.
  Water passes quickly through sandy soils, leaving the soil barely moist.
  Loamy soils maintain just the right amount of moisture — not so little
that your plant dries out quickly, and not so much that the roots are
swimming.
Plumbing for poorly drained soils?
The quality and texture of the soil just a few inches down may be completely
different from the topsoil. So even though you may have good loam on the
surface, something completely different may be 6 to 12 inches (or farther)
below. If a big rock or a compacted or impenetrable layer of soil (called hard-
pan) lurks beneath the surface, it may prevent water from properly draining
away from the root area. And that’s trouble.
Check your soil drainage by digging a 30- to 45-centimetre (12- to 18-inch) hole
where you want to plant. Fill the hole with water, let it drain, and then fill it
again. If the hole takes longer than two hours to drain after the second filling,
you have a problem. You may be able to break through a thin hardpan that’s
near the bottom of the hole, but you’ll probably get a sore back from doing
so. If you’ve won the lottery lately, call a landscape contractor. He or she may
be able to install drainage pipes to carry excess water away. But when we
encounter bad drainage, we either plant somewhere else or plant in containers
or raised beds (see Chapter 7).
Adding the big O
The big O is organic matter — leaf mould, shredded bark, compost, peat moss,
manure, and the like. Organic matter helps to loosen and aerate clay soils. It
also improves the water- and nutrient-holding capacity of sandy soils. If you
don’t have some organic matter lying around, your local nursery or garden
centre should have several different kinds for sale.
207
Chapter 17: Planting Roses

If you’re planting a large area with a lot of roses, you can incorporate organic
matter into the whole area with a shovel or rototiller. Just lay down 5 to 
8 centimetres (2 to 3 inches) of the stuff and turn it in to a depth of at least 
15 to 20 centimetres (6 to 8 inches).
If you’re planting just a few roses, mix in the organic matter with the backfill
soil when you plant. Backfill soil is the soil you take out of the hole while
you’re digging it. If you mix this soil with about 25 percent volume (or more)
organic matter, your roses should get off to a better start.
If you have good loamy soil and no problems with excess clay or sand, you
don’t have to add any organic stuff, but we always add as much as we can, no
matter what the soil looks like. It can never hurt, and it always helps.
Is having acerbic soil an insult?
The chemistry of your soil is the single most important element in successful
rose culture. Before you even think about immersing those rose roots in your
garden, you have to check the soil’s pH.
Soil pH is a measurement of the soil’s acidity or alkalinity. A pH of 7 is neutral.
Soils with a pH below 7 are acidic and become more acidic the lower the
number goes. Soils with a pH above 7 are alkaline and become more alkaline
as the number goes up.
Roses prefer a slightly acidic soil pH. Ideal soil pH for most roses is between
5.8 and 6.2. If soils are overly acidic or too alkaline, adjusting the pH with 
one of several soil amendments is vital. A soil pH that is too high or too low 
interferes with or prevents the chemical reactions that make nutrients 
available to plants.
Your local nursery or provincial soil-testing laboratory (contact the provincial
agricultural ministry for the address) can give you a general idea of what
your soil pH is or perform a soil test using a sample of your garden soil. Your
favourite garden centre may even be able to sell you a small test kit so you
can do the job yourself. While not as accurate as the professional tests, they
will give you adequate results. You can adjust acidic soils by adding dolomitic
limestone. Correct alkaline soils by adding sulphur. Again, a local professional
is the best source of how much and what to add. Be aware that modifying the
soil pH in a small spot such as a single rose-growing area will not work for
very long. You have to modify a large area if you want the effects to last.
You can also test your soil’s pH with inexpensive testing tapes or more
expensive testing monitors that you can get via mail order or from nurseries
and garden centres. See Appendix B for soil testing centres in your area.

Returning Roots to Their Rightful Home
The basic procedure for planting bareroot roses is shown in Figures 17-2
through 17-4. The key idea to remember: Don’t plant a $10 (or more!) rosebush
in a 50¢ hole. Whether you’re planting several roses in a new bed, or just one
in the middle of nowhere, dig a proper hole.
Dig a hole at least 60 centimetres (2 feet) deep and 60 centimetres (2 feet)
wide. Put the backfill into a wheelbarrow or in one pile where you can mix it
with fertilizers or amendments. This is, after all, the best time to add nutrients
that are in short supply. For instance, a friend in Kingston adds one cup each
of ground limestone, blood meal, and triple superphosphate fertilizer to the
backfill soil. We simply mix several shovels of compost to each pile of soil.
Planting at the proper depth is very important. In mild-winter climates of
Southern Ontario and coastal British Columbia, position the plants so that
the bud union is just below to 5 centimetres (2 inches) below the level of the
surface soil. In the rest of the country, plant so that the bud union is 10 cen-
timetres (4 inches) below the soil surface. Plant own-root roses so that the
point where the roots join the branches is just below the soil surface. In areas
that face severe freezing, plant the bud union up to 15 centimetres (6 inches)
below the surface. If you live in a cold area and only plant the bud union 
5 centimetres (2 inches) deep, you will have to add extra insulation during
the winter to avoid killing the rose.
Here are some tips for planting bareroot roses:
  Before planting bareroot roses, we prefer to soak the roots in a bucket of
muddy water overnight. The water moistens the roots and the mud lightly
coats them to slow drying out during planting. Soaking the roots is
optional if you turn the planting hole into a muddy bath.
  Prune all the canes to about half their length. Most bareroot roses have
25- to 40-centimetre (10- to 16-inch) canes to start with, so shorten them
to between 12 and 20 centimetres (5 and 8 inches). This technique forces
the new canes to start lower on the plant — giving a bushier look.
  Before putting the plant in the ground, cut off any broken or mushy roots.
Don’t prune just to shorten them or stimulate their growth.
  Set the roots into the hole and cover with a few inches of soil. Pour water
around the roots to wash the soil into the spaces between the roots. Add
more soil and then turn this into mud by adding more water. Continue
adding soil and watering it until the hole is filled with soil. 
209
Chapter 17: Planting Roses

  If, after planting, the rose settles too deep, grab the main stem (you might
want to wear gloves for this) near the bud union and gently pull upward.
When you let go, the plant should settle slightly higher. If the plant has
settled too high, it’s best to pull it out and start over again.
  After planting, add lots and lots of water to the filled hole. Doing so settles
the soil and eliminates air pockets. After that water drains away, the soil
and rose may settle lower than you want. If so, add more backfill, and
water again.

Figure 17-4:

soil over the

  After you water the rose in, mound the soil over the top of the plant so
all but the last few inches of the cane tops are covered. Doing so helps
to keep the plant from drying out. Once you see new growth, carefully
remove the soil from around the canes.
Here are some tips for planting roses that come in containers:
  Water plants thoroughly before planting. Ensure that water is pouring
out the bottom of the container before stopping. This means that the
entire root ball is well soaked.
  Dig a large hole and add soil amendments just as for a bareroot rose, but
leave the bottom of the hole flat to support the shape of the rootball.
  Place your new rose into the hole, pot and all, so that you can estimate
proper planting depth. Remember to plant the bud union at the proper
depth for your winter area.
  It is best to disturb growing roots as little as possible during planting. If
your container rose is in a wood-fibre pot, use a heavy knife to cut the
bottom off the pot before placing the plant in the hole. When you’ve got
it in just the right position, slit the pot from top to bottom and remove it.
  If your rose is in a metal or heavy plastic container, remove the rootball
from the pot. If the roots form a solid, circling mass, gently loosen or cut
them, or the rose will be slow to adapt to the new soil. If the roots are
really tight, make three or four vertical cuts along the sides of the rootball
with an old knife. The roots will eventually branch at the cuts and grow
out into the surrounding soil.
See Figures 17-5 and 17-6 for the procedure for planting container-grown roses.

Setting a

grown 
rose into a

  If you’re planting in hot weather, don’t let the new plant dry out. Until
the roots grow into the surrounding soil, you have to treat the plant like
it is still in a pot. That means you may have to water every few days, if
not more.
  Water all newly planted roses every few days, or more often if the weather
is hot.
Planting Miniature Roses
Miniature roses are usually sold in 6- to 10-centimetre (21⁄2-inch or 4-inch) pots,
whether you buy them at a local retail nursery or by mail order. They should
have fully developed root systems. In fact, they may be rootbound and more
than ready to be transplanted.
Remember that these little plants were grown in a comfy greenhouse, so they
may need time to adjust to natural, outdoor conditions. This process is 
called hardening off. Help potted plants adjust to your weather conditions by 
gradually moving them to more extreme temperatures and sunlight. From the
porch to outside in partial sun and finally to full sun over a week’s time should
do the trick. If you don’t have a porch, put them outside for the day in a shady
spot protected from the wind and bring them back indoors for the night.
Gradually give them more and more sunshine over a week-long period during
their daytime outdoor periods. Do not leave them outside if freezing 
temperatures are forecast.
Miniatures can be planted at the same times as their larger cousins. 
212
Part IV: Growing Healthy Roses

Digging the hole
Digging a hole for a potted mini is somewhat easier than digging a hole for a
big rose. You can do it with a trowel, although removing a couple of spadefuls
of soil ensures that the roots have a generous area in which they can spread.
In any case, prepare the hole much as you would for a big rose. Because your
plant is smaller, the hole should be smaller — about 30 centimetres (1 foot)
wide and 30 centimetres (1 foot) deep. Add smaller amounts of the same soil
amendments you use for big roses.
Putting the plant in the ground
As with big bareroot roses, minis do a lot better when you cut half the length
off the canes. This may mean cutting off some flowers and buds, but bite the
bullet. Doing so pays off big-time later on.
Your mini rose should come out of its pot quite easily. Notice how all those
roots have grown round and round inside the pot? To encourage the roots to
spread out and grow into the new soil in your rose bed (or container), you
can do one of two gardening tricks. The first is to insert both your thumbs into
the bottom of the rootball and tear it apart for about two-thirds of its depth.
The second is for more timid gardeners and that is to gently tease the roots
away from the soil ball as you did with the larger pot-bound roses. Backfill and
water exactly as described for full-sized roses earlier in this chapter.
Remember that miniature roses always have shallower root systems than big
roses and need more frequent watering.

Watering and Mulching Roses
In This Chapter
 Watering rules — how often to water and how much water to apply
 Understanding sprinklers, drip irrigation, and other watering systems
 Mulching to keep the soil moist
H
ow often should you water your roses? How much water should you
apply? How should you apply the water? Should you use a hose? A
sprinkler? Or do you just let Mother Nature take care of it all with summer
rainfall?
Questions like these are often hard to answer even for the most experienced
rosarian. The reason is that, like any other plant, a rose’s water needs depend
on a number of factors, many of which are determined by conditions that
may be unique to your own garden. And what does that mean? It means that
the only person who really can know the answers to tough watering questions
is you.
Watering is really a matter of common sense and careful observation. You may
even find watering to be one of the more enjoyable gardening chores. This
chapter gives you tips that make setting up a watering schedule and applying
the right amount of water painless and easy.
The Basic Watering Rules
First, you need to accept the fact that your roses need water to be healthy
and bloom beautifully. Then tattoo these rules on your arm:
  Roses need more water more often in hot weather than in cool weather.
  Even if it rains often, that rain may not be enough water to keep your
roses healthy.

  Roses growing in sandy soil need more frequent watering than roses
growing in clay soils. (See Chapter 17 for more information about the
different types of soils.)
  When you water, water deeply so that you wet the entire root zone.
Don’t just sprinkle lightly! It does little good.
  If you really want to know whether your roses need water, get down and
dig in the dirt. It’s the only way to know for sure. If the top 5 centimetres
(2 inches) of soil is dry, you probably need to water.
  To reduce disease problems, water the soil, not the leaves. Roses can,
however, benefit from overhead watering once in a while. Just make sure
that you do so in the morning on sunny days so that the foliage can dry
before nightfall.
  Mulch! Mulch! Mulch! Doing so conserves water. See “The Wonderful
World of Mulches” later in this chapter.
Now we’re getting somewhere. In the following sections, we get down to the
nitty-gritty and answer the tough questions.
How often should I water?
Naturally, if you live where summers are dry (like the prairies most years)
you need to water more frequently than you do if you live in rainy Vancouver.
“Yeah, sure,” you say. “And if the soil is sandy, I have to water more frequently
than if the soil is mucky clay. My tattoo tells me that. But exactly how often
should I water?”
A good basic guideline is that a mature, full-sized rosebush needs about
3 centimetres (an inch or so) of water a week. Therefore, if you received at
least 3 centimetres (1 inch) of rain last week, no problem. If you didn’t, you
need to water. But watering is usually not that simple. Soil type and weather
are major influences.
Clay soil holds more water, so you need to add water less often. Sandy soil
holds little water, so you need to water more often. If the weather is blistering
hot and dry, common sense suggests more water is necessary. Likewise, if
weather has been cool, perhaps the roses can go well beyond a week
between drinks.
Keep in mind that, theoretically, you can’t overwater a rose. Of course, with
no sun and ten days of steady rain, your roses won’t be thrilled. But if drainage
is good, the extra water won’t hurt them, either.
216
Part IV: Growing Healthy Roses

Start with a watering schedule, watering once every five or six days, for exam-
ple. Watch the plant carefully, especially when you get to the fifth or sixth day.
If the new growth starts to look dull or wilts a bit, dig down near the base of
the plant and see whether the soil is moist. If it’s bone dry about 5 centimetres
(2 inches) from the surface, you’re ready to water. If it’s still moist, wait a
few days and check again.
Over time, you’ll get to know your soil and how quickly it dries out, whether
it’s warm or cool, rainy or dry.
How much water should I apply?
Water deeply so that the entire root zone is wet — for roses, that means to a
depth of at least 45 centimetres (18 inches). How far a given amount of water
can penetrate into the soil depends on the soil type. For example, if you
applied about 3 centimetres (1 inch) of water evenly over sandy soil, it would
go down about 30 centimetres (12 inches). In a clay soil, it would reach only
about 10 to 12 centimetres (4 to 5 inches). In a loam soil, 3 centimetres (1 inch)
of water would go down about 15 to 25 centimetres (6 to 10 inches).
Chapter 17 gives you some general guidelines on determining what type of
soil you have. But what you really want to know is how long you have to water
to wet your particular soil to the proper depth. To find that out, you need to
play in the mud a bit.
We consider different types of irrigation systems and how fast they apply water
later in this chapter. But for now, assume that your watering system, even if
it’s just a hose, is in place. Fill up your water basin — the 8- to 15-centimetre
(3- to 6-inch) high circle of soil you make around your rose when you plant it
— once. Let the water soak in and then probe the soil with a stiff rod or stick.
The rod or stick should move smoothly through wet soil, and then be hard to
push when it reaches dry soil. Digging with a spade, you can see exactly how
deep the water has gone. From there, calculating how long to water is easy.
For example, if the soil is wet to a depth of 15 centimetres (6 inches) after
10 minutes of watering, you need to water for a total of 30 minutes to get the
water down 45 centimetres (18 inches).
You may want to water a little longer than it takes to get the water down
45 centimetres (18 inches), just to make sure that you’re doing a good job
and watering your roses thoroughly.
217
Chapter 18: Watering and Mulching Roses

Tools of the Watering Trade
Two tools can help you fine-tune your watering schedule. The first is a soil
probe, a hollow metal tube that removes a small core of soil from the ground.
By examining the soil core, you can tell how deeply you’re watering or how
dry the soil is.
The second useful tool is a rain gauge. It can tell you exactly how much rain
has fallen, and you can adjust your watering schedule accordingly.
You can purchase soil probes and rain gauges through the irrigation supply
stores listed in the Yellow Pages, the Internet, or from your favourite garden
centre. Or, if you’re handy, you can make your own after seeing what they look
like in a catalogue. We use an old margarine tub as a rain gauge, which has
worked fine (with regular replacement) for twenty years or more.
Ways to Water
There are many ways to water roses. The key is to apply the water only over
the soil where the roots are — and not so fast that it runs down the gutter
toward the next town. Slower is better.
Building a basin
One simple way to water is to build an 8- to 15-centimetre (3- to 6-inch) high
basin of soil around the plant and fill it using a hand-held hose. Just make sure
that the basin is wide enough. It should be at least 45 centimetres (18 inches)
wide for new plants, and at least 90 centimetres (36 inches) wide for really
big roses. And don’t forget, you may have to fill the basin twice to get the
water deep enough.
Using sprinklers
There are many types of sprinklers — ones that attach to the end of a hose
(see Figure 18-1) and ones that are connected to underground pipes (see
Figure 18-2). You can hook both types to timers or controllers to prevent
overwatering. They can even water while you’re on vacation.

Set up a rain gauge and run the sprinklers to find out how long it takes to
apply about 3 centimetres (one inch) of water. This is the time you set the
sprinkler to run once per week on an automatic system, or you could set it to
run half of that time twice per week. Just don’t water any more than twice a
week or you’ll encourage shallow rooting. Shallow rooting makes a rose more
susceptible to winter damage as well as to dry soils if you ever forget to turn
on the sprinkler.
Sprinklers are very democratic waterers. They give equal amounts to all plants
and they don’t stop because it’s hot or the ball game has started. Consistent
watering is the key to good rose flower production, and sprinklers — even
the kind you turn on and off yourself — are better than hand watering.
Using drip irrigation
Drip irrigation (see Figure 18-3) is a particularly useful watering system for
areas that are dry in summer, in areas where water shortages are common, or
for busy gardeners who don’t have time to water as often as they’d like. Most
drip irrigation systems are built around 1- to 21⁄2-centimetre (3⁄8- to 1-inch) black
tubing and specifically designed emitters. The emitters drip or spray water
slowly, no faster than the soil can absorb it. And only the root area gets wet.

resource.

A good way to test out the timing for drip irrigation systems is to put an
emitter into a 20-litre (5-gallon) bucket of water and measure how long it takes
to fill the bucket halfway. This is the time the drip system should run every
week if you have average to good soil. After a watering, do a moisture test
by digging down 12 to18 inches with a spade or probe to see whether you
should lengthen the time (needs more water) or shorten the application time
to get the water to that depth.
Most garden centres carry a variety of sprinklers and watering devices. In
most cases, garden centre staff can help you with design and installation. See
Appendix B for other resources.
Black spot, and rust, and mites, oh my!
You have to think about one last thing before you decide how you’re going to
water. Many rose diseases, including black spot, rust, and downy mildew,
thrive on wet foliage. If you live in areas where such diseases are problems
(see Chapter 4 for more information about where these diseases are most
troublesome), you may want to water in a way that keeps the leaves dry. Drip
systems or bubbler-type sprinkler heads apply water at the base of the plant
and do a good job of keeping the leaves from getting wet.
To complicate matters, some diseases, such as powdery mildew, spread more
rapidly on dry foliage. And insect pests like mites thrive on dirty, dusty leaves.
In both cases, drenching the entire plant cleans the foliage of disease spores
and dust, reducing pest problems. But if you’re going to water with overhead
sprinklers, be sure to do it early in the morning on a sunny day so that the
leaves have a chance to dry before nightfall. And whether or not you water
overhead, keeping dead leaves and pruning debris out of the garden really
pays off.
The Wonderful World of Mulches
Mulch is any material, organic or not, that you place over the surface of the
soil. But mulches really are a waterer’s best friend. By reducing soil tempera-
tures and evaporation, and by smothering greedy weeds (the seeds won’t
germinate if they’re covered by several centimetres of mulch) that compete
with roses for moisture, mulches not only conserve water but also even out
rapid changes in soil moisture that can spell disaster in hot weather.
The best time to apply mulch is in early spring, about the same time you
remove winter protection (see Chapter 21 for more information).

Organic mulches
Organic mulches include grass clippings, compost, wood chips, leaf mould, pine
needles, shredded bark, straw, hay, grain and fruit by-products, composted
manure, mushroom compost, sawdust, and even newspapers. Some are
easier to find in specific parts of the country. We recommend organic mulches
for roses because, as the mulch breaks down, it adds organic matter to the
soil, improving soil texture and adding nutrients. Mulch also makes your
garden look better by giving the ground a cleaner, more orderly appearance.
Many organic mulches break down fairly rapidly, so they need to be replen-
ished regularly. Apply a good, thick layer in spring before the weeds start to
grow. Then check the plants in the fall to top it up if necessary. Figure 18-4
shows a properly mulched rosebush.
To be effective, a mulch should be at least 8 to 10 centimetres (3 to 4 inches)
thick. Spread it evenly under the roses, over an area that is slightly wider
than the diameter of the plant. Mulching is that easy!
Composted manures make particularly good mulches, looking neat while
adding nutrients to the soil as they break down. Just make sure that the
manure is fully composted and that you don’t add too much. Fresh manures
contain salts that will damage the plant and make its leaves look as if they’ve
been burned by a blowtorch. Basically, uncomposted manure is too much of
a good thing. (Too much of any fertilizer, manure included, supplies excess
nitrogen.) So compost fresh manure for at least six months before using it.
Think of having too much salt in your soup. A little is good . . . too much and
it’s inedible.

You can buy bags of composted manure in most nurseries and garden centres.
Some farmers will sell composted manure, and horse-riding stables can be a
good source of fresh manure for those in nearby areas, but remember to let
the fresh manure age six months before using it. 
Mulches are the topic of much advice and even myths in the gardening world.
Here are some of the most common stories you’ll encounter.
  Bark mulches, such as pine, are quite acidic. Luckily, they decompose
very slowly, so they will not influence the pH of the soil at all. Use these
large chunks freely, contrary to advice that says to avoid them. The same
goes for evergreen needles as mulch.
  Grass clippings make terrible mulches. Actually, fresh grass clippings
make a wonderful mulch if you don’t pile it higher than 3 inches. (Higher
than 3 inches and it might start to compost and heat up.) Grass clip-
pings are usually pretty abundant, although if the grass goes to seed
before you cut it, you could end up with grass growing in your rose
beds. Also, make sure that no herbicides (weed killers) have been used
on your lawn, the residue of which can damage or kill your roses.
  Some organic mulches — such as fresh sawdust — rob nitrogen from
your soil as they break down. As long as you don’t dig the mulch into
your soil, you won’t have a problem with nitrogen robbing. You may have
a problem with softwood sawdust as it contains oils that may reduce
growth rates on some plants. It’s usually best to avoid softwood sawdust.
If you do use sawdust, throw on an extra shovelful of compost to be on
the safe side. Sawdust from pressure-treated wood should not be added
to your garden.
  Peat moss makes a good mulch. Water will not penetrate dry peat moss,
so the water runs off instead of soaking through to the roots. Best to
avoid peat as a mulch.
  Tree leaves should never be used as mulch around roses. The best
thing to do with leaves is to compost them first to make a more dense
mulch material. Chopping them up with a lawnmower and then applying
them around your roses is a good idea. The only leaves we don’t apply
whole and unchopped around our roses are maple leaves because they
do mat down.
  Mushroom compost is a good mulch. The truth is that this compost is
largely devoid of nutrients and often has a very high salt residue. If you
use this as a mulch, do not expect it to feed your plants, and thoroughly
soak it to dissolve and wash away any excess salts. The easiest way to
do this is to spread it and then turn the sprinklers on for three to four
times longer than you normally would.
223
Chapter 18: Watering and Mulching Roses

You can purchase organic mulches like shredded bark, compost, and leaf
mould in bags, or sometimes in bulk, from nurseries and garden centres. Grass
clippings, compost, and wood chips come free from the garden. Municipalities
now regularly make compost available to residents.
Inorganic mulches
Inorganic mulches include plastic, gravel, stone, and sand. As we said, we
usually prefer organic mulches because they improve the soil and look better.
Some gardeners like the look of gravel under their roses. We find that garden
chores are more difficult with these mulches. Weed seeds germinate well in
them so you’ll constantly see small dandelions trying to establish themselves
in the gravel. Any digging is difficult with a rock mulch and cleaning it of plant
debris is harder than cleaning up an organic mulch. Once the gravel works its
way into the soil, you have a gravel rose soil — a delight we’re sure to avoid
in our gardens.

Fertilizing Roses
In This Chapter
 Applying the nutrients roses need most
 Testing your soil
 Knowing when and how often to fertilize roses
 Using specific fertilizer programs
M
ost roses need frequent applications of fertilizer to keep them growing
vigorously and blooming repeatedly. If that’s all you want to know about
the mind-boggling world of fertilizers, that’s fine. Go to your local nursery,
buy a bag or box of fertilizer labelled “Plant Food,” and follow the directions
on the package. You’ll get perfectly fine roses. If, however, you want to go for
perfectly spectacular roses, we can tell you about that, too. So in this chapter
we spell out the theory of fertilizing, and then we give you a few options.
The Whats, Whens, and
Whys of Fertilizing
For some people, plant nutrition is a complicated science that they spend
their whole lives studying. But it doesn’t have to be that complicated. We’re
just talking about how and what to give roses so that they grow their best.
The following sections give you the nitty-gritty of feeding roses.
But before we launch into all the whys and wherefores, keep in mind that no
fertilizer on earth will help your roses if the pH of your soil is too high or too
low. When the pH is off, important nutrients already in the soil are unavailable
to plants. As we explain in Chapter 17, roses prefer a slightly acidic soil with
a pH between 5.8 and 6.2. When the pH is right, your roses’ roots can interact
with the bacteria and enzymes in the soil and get full benefit of natural
nutrients and those you add.

Keep in mind, too, that fertilizers come in three basic forms:
  Granular: Designed to be scratched into the soil at the base of the plant
  Liquid: Either a liquid or powder designed to be dissolved in water for
liquid feeding to the soil or foliage
  Timed-release: To be mixed with the soil for constant release over a long
period of time
Note: Roses growing in containers need special care — see Chapter 7.
Nitrogen is the element needed most
Plants actually require 16 different elements for healthy growth, but most of
these elements are already in your soil (or in the air!) and don’t need to be
added regularly. Nitrogen, however, is what fuels the growth of a rosebush.
This chemical stimulates dark green, healthy foliage growth, and because a
plant’s energy to make flowers is manufactured in its leaves, healthy leaves
mean more flowers.
Nitrogen comes in several forms; some are fast acting, and others are slower.
But when you buy packaged fertilizer, the amount of nitrogen it contains (the
first number in the formula on the bag — see Figure 19-1) is what’s important.
Alkaline soils need iron
In areas where the soil is on the alkaline side, a rose plant may need applica-
tions of fertilizers containing iron. You know when your roses need iron
because their leaves are yellow with green veins.
226
Part IV: Growing Healthy Roses
Along with nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium
are called macronutrients because they are
needed in larger supplies than other nutrients.
However,somesoilscontainenoughphosphorus
and potassium for healthy rose growth; adding
more to them does little good. Besides, phos-
phorus doesn’t move easily through the soil like
nitrogen and potassium — it gets “tied up” and
hastostayput.Ifyoursoilisshortonphosphorus,
you should add it directly to the planting hole
when you put in your roses so that it gets where
it needs to go. That is why gardeners have been
adding bone meal (a good source of phosphorus)
to planting holes for centuries.
Only testing can tell whether your soil needs
either phosphorus or potassium.
Working your fingers to the bone meal

Iron is called a micronutrient, meaning that the plant needs it only in small
quantities. Zinc and manganese are other micronutrients that problem soils
may need. The fastest way to correct these deficiencies is to apply a liquid
fertilizer containing chelated micronutrients (forget about all the terminology
— it just means that they work better) to both the foliage and the soil. That’s
right, just spray the fertilizer over the whole plant. But look for cautions on
the fertilizer label. Most manufacturers recommend not spraying if the plants
need water or if temperatures are over 29° C (85° F).

Salty secrets for roses

If you have doubts, have the soil tested
Nutrient deficiencies aren’t always this cut and dried. If you’re having prob-
lems keeping your roses green and growing, have your soil tested or show a
sample of the foliage to a local nursery worker. If the nursery can’t help, the
employees should be able to recommend a private lab that can. A soil test
tells you exactly what’s wrong with your soil, and then your nursery can help
you correct the problem. Costs vary from area to area and depend on how
detailed the test is. Your provincial agricultural ministry and its Web site will
also have soil lab contact information. See Appendix B.
Feed often, but don’t overdo it
To keep roses blooming again and again, fertilize them about every six weeks,
although the type of fertilizer you use may alter this rule a bit. (Refer to the
basic fertilizer programs later in this chapter.) However, if you go overboard
and apply too much or too often, you can burn a plant — the edges or the
entire leaf turn brown and scorched looking. And if that doesn’t happen, the
overly lush growth is a favourite of many insect pests. Always follow label
instructions when determining how much fertilizer to use.
Roses that bloom only once in spring, like many of the old garden roses, don’t
need to be fertilized as often. Fertilizing once in early spring is enough.
If you do overfeed your plants and get fertilizer burn, simply turn the hose
onto the plant and overwater it drastically. This excess water dissolves the
fertilizer salts and washes them away from the root zone. It won’t help the
damaged leaves but it will stop the plant from absorbing any more.
Start in early spring, stop
in late summer or fall
Make your first application about four to six weeks before growth begins in
spring or when you take off your winter protection. Continue through summer
until about six weeks before the average date of your first frost. (Employees
at your nursery can tell you exactly when that date is.) Later fertilization may
encourage growth that will be damaged by frosts and can result in roses that
are not fully “cold resistant.” (For more information about rose hardiness,
see Chapter 4.) If in doubt, make your last feeding for the season during the
last week of July.
228
Part IV: Growing Healthy Roses

Water before and after fertilizing
A plant stressed from lack of water is more likely to be burned by nitrogen
fertilizers, so make sure that the soil is wet before fertilizing. Watering
afterwards helps to move nutrients into the root zone.
A Fertilizing Program Just for You
Fertilizing is kind of a personal thing. Of course you want to keep your plants
healthy, but how you do so really depends on the type of gardener you are.
So in this section we describe a few successful fertilizer programs we’ve seen.
Take your pick.
Lazy and cheap formula
Fertilizers that contain all three major nutrients — nitrogen, phosphorus,
and potassium — are called complete fertilizers. They are the types usually
packaged as “Rose Foods.” Although phosphorus and potassium are needed
for healthy growth, they are often already present in the soil in sufficient
amounts and don’t need to be replaced on a regular basis. Some fertilizers,
such as ammonium sulphate, contain only nitrogen. They are dramatically
cheaper than complete fertilizers and are often all that’s needed. However,
they are easier to make a mistake with and burn your rose. Don’t exceed the
label directions.
229
Chapter 19: Fertilizing Roses
Figure 19-2:
Spreading
fertilizer at
the base of
a rose plant.

Ammonium sulphate has the added advantage of being an acidifying fertilizer
(it gradually lowers soil pH), which is ideal for alkaline soils. One rose grower
we know saves money and time by running through the garden giving each
rose one handful of ammonium sulphate (he wears gloves) every six weeks.
He spreads the fertilizer evenly under each plant, shown being done with a
can in Figure 19-2, and then waters thoroughly to dissolve the granules and
wash the nutrients into the soil. Simple, cheap, and his roses look great.
Just plain lazy formula
You can apply several types of timed-release fertilizers once or twice a year,
and they provide enough nutrients for an entire season. Follow the label
instructions carefully and watch your roses closely. If they slow down and stop
blooming, the fertilizer may have run out early. Most rose growers who use
timed-released fertilizers supplement their use with one or two applications
of a regular fertilizer just to make sure that the plants have enough nitrogen.
Tree-hugger’s formula
Many gardeners prefer to use organic fertilizers — ones that occur
naturally — over chemical-based fertilizers. And their reasons are good
ones. Organic fertilizers, such as fish emulsion, composted manures (fresh
manures can burn plant foliage), and blood meal (dried animal blood, which
is high in nitrogen), contribute organic matter to the earth and are better for
all those weird micro-organisms that populate the soil and are responsible
for plant health.
One successful formula we’ve seen mixes even amounts of alfalfa meal and
cottonseed meal. Ten cups of the formula are spread at the base of each plant
every ten weeks and then covered with a thick mulch of compost. Try it; your
worms will love it.
You can grow superior roses (particularly container roses) if you feed them
weekly with a liquid fish emulsion mixed at recommended rates. Compost
tea — a shovel of compost in a 20-litre (5-gallon) pail of water — is also a
wonderful pick-me-up for summer rose feeding.
Water and spray, water and spray,
oh how I love to water and spray
You can’t argue with the fact that half the fun of gardening is actually spending
time in the garden. One friend of ours combines work with pleasure. She
applies liquid or water-soluble fertilizers through a hose-end sprayer, as shown
230
Part IV: Growing Healthy Roses

in Figure 19-3. She applies the fertilizer to the leaves and soil, so she gets the
immediate effects of foliar feeding and the long-term benefits of soil applica-
tion. (Believe us, applying fertilizers to the leaves works if the label says that
doing so is okay — try it! Roots are not the only part of the plant that can
absorb nutrients; leaves can do so, too.) She follows this routine at least every
two weeks, but sometimes she mixes the fertilizer at half strength and applies
it weekly.
If only we had the time. . . .
Gung-ho fertilizer for gung-ho rose growers
Rose society members, especially those who show their roses at local and
national rose shows, are pretty finicky about how they care for their plants.
But you can’t argue with their results, which are large, perfect flowers and
wonderful foliage. One trophy winner we know has a particularly high-powered
fertilizer program:
1. About a week after his plants leaf out in spring, he applies a water-soluble
20-20-20 fertilizer (refer to Figure 19-1 for more information about what
this means), diluting 2 tablespoons of fertilizer in 8 litres (2 gallons) of
water and giving each plant the whole 8 litres (2 gallons).
2. A week later, he puts a 1⁄2 cup of Epsom salts (magnesium sulphate)
around each bush.
3. The third week, he applies fish emulsion at the same rate as the 20-20-20
fertilizer applied two weeks earlier.
4. During week four, he applies a liquid fertilizer (16-4-2), which includes
chelated micronutrients, at 1 tablespoon per 4 litres (1 gallon), 8 litres
(2 gallons) per bush. In week five, he starts all over again.
Whew, a lot of work — but, he says, twice the bloom and bigger flowers.

 Cleaning up after pruning
I
f you think that pruning is a complicated thing, think again. Although
pruning trees and other types of plants may be met with lots of head
scratching, pruning roses is so simple and straightforward that you’re not
going to believe it. And you won’t believe the big-time results you’ll get from
performing a little lopping at the right time.
Feel better? Good. Because if you want to grow roses, you’re going to have to
prune them. Roses are tough plants, and even if you make every mistake in
the book, your roses will be better off than if you hadn’t pruned them at all.
When you prune, you cut the canes of a rosebush. You may cut them near the
top of the plant, you may cut them at the base of the plant, or you may cut
them somewhere in the middle. You cut ’em in all kinds of different places,
depending on the result you’re trying to achieve.
What pruning isn’t is something you do for the sake of doing it. Whenever you
take a pruner to a rose cane, ask yourself why.
Why You Need to Prune
What is pruning, anyway? Obviously, it means cutting something or other.
But what? When? And most of all, why? Roses need to be pruned for several
reasons. Most of them have to do with keeping the plant healthy, and a couple
of them have to do with keeping the plant pretty. And some of them have to
do with keeping the plant from getting out of bounds.

Here’s the skinny on why you really do want to prune your roses:
  To improve flowering: Proper pruning results in more and bigger blooms.
Especially with hybrid teas grown for cut flowers, good pruning practices
give you those huge flowers atop long, strong stems.
  To keep plants healthy: Pruning removes diseased or damaged parts of
the plant. It also keeps the plant more open in the centre, increasing air
circulation and reducing pest problems. (For more on controlling pests,
see Chapter 22.)
  To keep plants in bounds: Without pruning, many rose plants get huge.
Some of these monsters can take over an entire yard! Pruning keeps
them where they’re supposed to be. Pruning also keeps the flowers at
eye level, where you can enjoy them up close.
  To direct growth: More than just keeping them in bounds, pruning can
direct growth (and flowers) to a spot you pick. The best example is
pruning a climbing rose to grow on a trellis or an arbour.
Tools of the Pruning Trade
Before you can start pruning your roses, you need the proper equipment:
  Heavy gloves: We shouldn’t have to tell you this. You do know that
roses have thorns, right? Choose gloves that are flexible but not easily
punctured. Your nursery can recommend some types designed especially
for roses.
  Hand pruners: This tool does most of the work. We prefer bypass pruners
— the type with a curved blade and cutting arm, as shown in Figure 20-1.
This tool provides the cleanest cut and is less likely to crush the cane
below the cut, which often happens with anvil-type shears. Buy profes-
sional quality hand pruners rather than cheap ones — your hands will
thank you.
  Loppers: These are similar to hand pruners but have long handles to
give you better leverage when cutting thicker canes. (See Figure 20-2.)
  Pruning saw: This saw is necessary for cutting really old, woody canes
or dead wood. We like the folding type with a slightly curved blade, shown
in Figure 20-3. This type fits neatly, if slightly uncomfortably, in your
back pocket.
234
Part IV: Growing Healthy Roses

One thing you don’t need is any kind of pruning paint or black goop to seal
your pruning cuts. The rose does quite well on its own, healing itself. Using
goop of any kind seals in and protects problems rather than excluding them.

Deep cuts and the same old response
Even though each type of rose prefers to be pruned a little bit differently, we
like to simplify rose pruning into three types of pruning cuts. Each one gener-
ates a very predictable response from the plant. You’ll probably want to use a
combination of all three types of cuts:
  Thinning removes a branch at its origin — that is, it cuts a branch back
to another branch or to the base of the plant. Usually, thinning does not
result in vigorous growth below the cut. The result of thinning is that the
plant is more open and less densely branched.
  Cutting back to a dormant bud stimulates that bud to grow. If you’re prun-
ing during the dormant season — when the rose is resting and leafless in
winter — the bud won’t grow until spring, but this type of cut focuses
the plant’s energy into that one bud and maybe one or two buds below it.
Pruning back to a bud, at any time, is the best way to direct plant growth
and to channel energy into specific canes that you want to bloom.
Always prune to an outward facing bud.
  Shearing is a more aggressive type of pruning but is sometimes effective.
You simply use hedge clippers (see Figure 20-4) to whack off a portion of
the plant. The result of shearing is vigorous growth below the cuts and a
denser, fuller plant. This cut is particularly effective with landscape
roses, like shrubs and floribundas, especially if you plant them as hedges.
On a cool, crisp, early spring day . . .
Whenever we’re asked when people should prune their roses, we always
answer, “Whenever the weather’s right and you have the time.” And that’s the
truth. There’s no exact day, or even exact week, for pruning roses.
Just before growth begins in early spring — exact timing depends upon your
climate — is the best season for big pruning. And if you do a good job in the
spring, you shouldn’t have much to do throughout the rest of the season
beyond deadheading and cutting great roses.
236
Part IV: Growing Healthy Roses
Figure 20-4:
Hedge
clippers are

pruning.

You do want to wait until after the coldest weather has passed and any winter
damage to the plant has already occurred. That’s usually about six weeks
before the average date of the last spring frost. Your local nursery can give
you exact frost dates for your area.
Avoid pruning in early fall. Any pruning after the first frost but before really
cold weather usually signals the plant to grow. These new canes or shoots
are very tender and will be killed by cold weather. Late fall pruning of species
and hardy roses — after the leaves have fallen — is acceptable, but it is
preferable to wait and see what the winter brings (and damages) before doing
any major renovation pruning. Hybrid tea rose canes will be damaged by
winter cold so it is preferable to cut them back as per our instructions later
in this chapter.
For bigger flowers, get after those
hybrid teas and grandifloras
Because hybrid teas and grandiflora roses are usually grown for large, long-
stemmed flowers, you prune them more severely than other types of roses.
This harder pruning channels the plant’s energy into fewer canes, which
produce bigger and better flowers.
Here are the basic steps for pruning hybrid tea and grandiflora roses. Figure
20-5 shows the “before” picture.
1. In the early spring, remove dead or damaged canes.
When you remove the winter insulation, you’ll likely see winter damage
on the canes. This is dark brown, dead looking wood. Canes that are
alive have a green tinge. You can tell for sure whether a cane is alive by
cutting off a piece. A dead cane is brown inside; a healthy one is whitish.
Scratching the bark will also show you the cane’s status: a dead cane is
brown when the bark is removed; a living cane is green right below
the bark.
Anyway, remove the dead canes, cutting back at least far enough so that
the insides of the canes are white again. After a really cold winter, you
may have to prune all the way to the ground. If the plant looks dead, don’t
despair; wait a few weeks and it may still put out new shoots. If it doesn’t,
you may have to practise another type of pruning — shovel pruning —
to remove the dead rose plant and its roots.
Gardeners who plant their bud unions quite deep to aid in winter survival
may find that the rose canes die right to the ground every winter. The
below-ground canes will throw out new shoots approximately three weeks
after the more traditionally shallow-planted roses. Have patience.
237
Chapter 20: Pruning Roses

2. Remove suckers.
If you’re pruning budded plants, and you probably are, remove any
suckers — vigorous canes that arise from the rootstock below the bud
union. But be careful: Don’t mistake desirable new canes for suckers. If
you suspect that a new cane is a sucker, let it grow awhile. If its leaves are
distinctly different from other leaves on the plant, go ahead and cut it
away. (If you’re growing own-root roses, or roses that have not been
grafted but have their original roots, don’t worry about suckers.) For
more about rootstocks, bud unions, own-root roses, and the like, see
Chapter 16.
Suckers should be removed as close to the rootstock as possible. Some
gardeners use a claw hammer to pull them off the root, just like pulling a
nail out of a board. The lower down you prune them, the less likely they
are to regrow.
Suckers come all summer and they don’t bloom. So if you have a large,
vigorous cane without blooms, you likely have a sucker. Not only that,
but sometimes, in the spring, the desirable top of the rose dies and the
rootstock throws suckers to try to stay alive. These will grow like crazy,

producing huge long arching canes and you’ll think you’re growing a great
rose. Unfortunately, you’re growing a non-blooming rose that should be
compost. To positively identify a sucker, excavate around the base of the
rose to expose the bud union. If the cane comes from below the bud
union, it is a sucker.
3. After you have pruned out the damaged canes and removed the
suckers, select the flowering canes.
The healthiest canes are thicker and usually bright green; older canes are
brown or grey and sometimes shrivelled looking. Remove any spindly,
twiggy branches. You want the flowering canes to be as evenly spaced
around the plant as possible, and you should try to leave the centre of
the plant open, without any canes. After you finish, the plant should be
sort of cup-shaped with flowering canes around the outside.
The number of flowering canes you select depends on the vigour and
age of the plant. With recently planted roses, leave about three to five
flowering canes. Older plants can support more.
4. Cut back the flowering canes you select by a third to a half.
Cut back to an outward-facing bud, as shown in Figure 20-6. If you’ve left
30 to 45 centimetres (12 to 18 inches) of cane above ground for the winter,
plan on pruning these back to 15 to 25 centimetres (6 to 9 inches) in the
spring. In really tough winters, you may find yourself cutting further
back than that to find live wood. This is another reason to put that bud
union just a bit deeper if you’re in a colder climate.

facing bud.

5. After the blooming season, in the late fall, cut back the entire plant.
After a wonderful growing season and fall frosts knock the leaves from
the rose, it is time to start pruning for winter. With our tender roses, we
prune for several reasons. The first is to stop the winter wind from whip-
ping the canes around; this whipping can damage the bud union if the
base of the cane is close to this joint. The second is to eliminate excess
canes that might allow blackspot spores to overwinter. And the third is
that the canes are going to die anyway and will not be used in next
year’s growth so we might just as well cut them back in the fall as wait
for spring. We want to use fresh strong new canes next year to support
next year’s flowering so this year’s canes can be pruned in the fall.
Most rose growers cut the canes back to 45 to 60 centimetres (18 to
24 inches) in the fall and hill up to the top of the canes to protect the
rose. In the colder parts of the country, some growers prune the canes
down to 30 centimetres (12 inches) as the canes will be killed off that far
anyway. See Figure 20-7 for details.
And don’t forget to insulate for winter after the leaves have fallen. See
Chapter 21 for wintering tips. The following spring, return to step number
one (above) and start all over.
The shear pleasure of pruning
floribundas and polyanthas
In the spring after you’ve removed the winter’s protective cover, remove all
canes that were damaged by winter. Again, just like hybrid teas, cut about one-
third to one-half of the growth. Instead of picking three strong branches, shape
the plant into as nice a rounded dome as possible, as shown in Figure 20-8.
240
Part IV: Growing Healthy Roses
Figure 20-7:
Cut back
less if you
live where
winters are
mild (left)
and more if
you live
where
winters are
cold (right).

Then do a quick pass with a hand pruner, removing dead or very crowded
branches and opening the centre of the plant a bit. Again, take the stronger
and remove the weaker. The result will be a denser plant covered with blooms.
During the summer, you can prune floribunda and polyantha roses much like
hybrid tea roses, but because they have a more twiggy growth habit (more,
but smaller, stems and canes), you need to leave more flowering canes. How-
ever, because floribundas and polyanthas produce clusters of small flowers
instead of those long-stemmed single beauties of the hybrid teas, and because
they are more often used en masse as landscape plants, you can prune in a
much easier way — simply lop ’em back with hedge clippers.
Pruning a mixed bag of shrubs
Shrub roses represent a real mishmash of different kinds of plants, from
low-growing, spreading ground covers to neat, compact shrubs, to vigorous,
upright monsters. Consequently, there are no hard-and-fast rules about how
to prune them. Still, the basic techniques we’ve gone over in this chapter
work — remove dead and diseased branches, remove any rubbing or crossing
branches, try to open the centres a bit, and whack back whatever gets out
of bounds.

The problem with giving hard and fast directions is that winter ruins these
rules. What and how much you’ll prune back varies from year to year. A tough,
long winter with lots of Arctic highs (with their corresponding low tempera-
tures) can sometimes burn even the toughest of species roses to the ground.
At the risk of repeating ourselves, remove the dead, diseased, and rubbing
branches and both you and the rose will be better for the exercise.
Tiny pruners for tiny plants?
You can shear miniature roses like floribundas and polyanthas, which is
especially timesaving if you have several plants on landscape duty.
Because miniatures are so diminutive and often admired up close, many
gardeners prefer to handle them more gently. If you are one of those gardeners,
treat minis like hybrid teas, opening the centre, removing dead or twiggy
branches, and selecting healthy flowering canes. To keep the plants compact,
shorten the flowering canes a little more — by as much as three-quarters of
their original height.
Pruning antiquity
Old garden roses, like shrubs, are a greatly varied group of plants. We believe
in a less-is-more approach to pruning. Take out the damaged and dead
branches, shear back a bit — but not by over a third, or you may reduce bloom
— and remove anything that’s out of bounds.
Old roses that bloom only once in spring should be pruned after flowering.
Otherwise, pruning during the dormant season reduces the bloom. But the
rules still apply — go lightly.
Taking pruning to new heights
Pruning climbing roses is a bit different from pruning other roses.
The first thing you need to know is that climbing roses don’t climb like true
vines. They don’t twist around or attach to whatever they come in contact
with like ivy or grapes. Instead, they put out long, longer, and longer yet,
vigorous, arching canes. If you just leave them alone, they form a huge, sprawl-
ing shrub. Consequently, to get them to climb, you have to tie them (we like
to use the green plastic tape sold in any nursery) to some kind of a support,
such as a fence, arbour, or trellis. Different types of supports for climbing
roses are discussed in Chapter 5, “Landscaping with Roses.”
242
Part IV: Growing Healthy Roses

The most common types of climbers are the climbing sports of hybrid teas
and large-flowered climbers, which bloom repeatedly throughout the growing
season. Hardy Explorer roses that can be used as climbers are described in
Chapter 15. (Climbing roses are further described in Chapter 12.) After plant-
ing, you should pretty much leave these climbers alone for two years so that
they can develop long, sturdy canes. Just keep them within bounds and
remove any dead or damaged growth. Tie them to the support if you need to
keep them out of the way.
The fun begins after the second or third year of waiting. Think of your climb-
ing rose as having two parts: the flowering shoots and the main structural
canes on which they grow. Your goal in pruning is to select the sturdiest canes
and tie them to the support in some evenly spaced manner, ideally in an
angled or nearly horizontal fashion. The pattern doesn’t have to be fancy. The
number of canes you choose depends on the size of your support and the age
of the plant — three to five is common. As the rose gets older, you can select
more canes to fill up, say, a large fence. These main canes form the basic
structure of the plant. Other canes should be removed.
After you bend these structural canes and tie them to the support, new growth
sprouts along their length. These are the flowering shoots that — surprise! —
flower. During dormancy, you should cut back these shoots to about two to
three buds above the structural canes. After pruning, your climbing rose
should look something like Figure 20-9.

Occasionally, one of your structural canes may become too old and woody and
not bloom as well as it used to. So get rid of it. New canes that you can train
as replacements arise every year from the base of the plant.
The rules change a bit with climbing roses that bloom only once in spring.
Wait until after they bloom to prune; then remove more of the older structural
canes and replace them with new ones. The new canes produce most of the
next season’s bloom.
Deadheading: No Free Rides
on This Rose
You do most of the pruning described up to this point during the dormant
season, when plants are leafless. But you also need to prune a bit during the
growing season. Most important, you have to deadhead. Deadheading is
removing spent flowers — those that have withered and died — so that the
plant can channel its energy into producing more flowers instead of seeds.
As with other types of pruning, you can deadhead the hard way or the
easy way:
  You should prune most hybrid teas the hard way — cutting back each
spent flower shoot down to at least the first leaf with five leaflets, as
shown in Figure 20-10. Done this way, the plants maintain a neater
appearance, rebloom sooner, and produce sturdier stems that are less
likely to result in droopy flowers. Remember, buds arising from thicker
parts of a cane grow into sturdier canes themselves. Therefore, in order
to get the largest possible new cane to grow from a bud eye, you have to
cut down to where the main cane is fairly substantial. However, never
remove more than a third of the plant at one time during the growing
season. Doing so may weaken the plant unnecessarily.
244
Part IV: Growing Healthy Roses
After pruning, cleaning up and discarding or
destroying the plant debris is important. Many
insects and diseases live on dormant leaves and
branches. And even though you remove dormant
leaves and branches from the plant, pests can
find their way back to the bush if you leave the
prunings hanging around.
Start by removing any leaves left on the rose
plant during dormancy. Then rake everything up
and either discard or burn it. You can run the stuff
through a shredder and add the debris to a com-
post pile, but you still risk harbouring some pest
organisms. To avoid future problems, keep the
compost pile far away from your roses.
Post-pruning cleanup

  With more floriferous landscape roses like floribundas, shrubs, and
miniatures, deadheading in the preceding manner can take forever. So if
you don’t have time, get out your trusty old hedge clippers and whack
off the faded flower clusters. The disadvantage of the whack method is
that the plants take a little longer to rebloom. But the plants are much
better off than if you hadn’t whacked at all.
Other than deadheading, prune during the summer as you see fit. If a branch
gets in the way or is out of bounds, give it the axe.
Right after spring pruning is the ideal time to apply a dormant spray to your
plants, as long as the plants are still dormant and leafless and have not started
to grow. See Chapter 22 for instructions.

Protecting Roses Where
Winters Are Cold
In This Chapter
 Determining rose hardiness
 Preparing roses for cold winters
 Protecting roses from cold weather
L
ove those hybrid teas but fear our Canadian winters will be too much for
them? No worries. With a little extra effort (which is entirely worth it),
you can keep those babies alive no matter how wild the winter gets. That’s
what this chapter is about: protecting roses — any kind of roses — where
winters are cold. Mounding soil over the base of your plants is one secret, but
you can make your mounding more effective in some easy and inexpensive
ways. Planting the bud unions deeper is another secret, but hey, we’re going
to describe all our best secrets in this chapter.
How Hardy Are They?
Most plants are judged by the minimum low temperatures they can withstand
in winter without being killed or damaged. This is called the plant’s hardiness.
Unfortunately, rose hardiness is not a cut-and-dried matter because conditions
other than cold temperatures can devastate a rose plant. And these conditions
vary from winter to winter.
Even within rose classifications, different varieties can be hardier than others.
For example, the new, fragile-looking, striped floribunda called ‘Scentimental’
is surprisingly so hardy that if you live in zone 6 or warmer, it doesn’t need
much winter protection. But the lovely white floribunda ‘French Lace’ is so
tender that it often has to be replanted every year no matter where you plant
it. Unfortunately, there’s no sure-fire way to tell which varieties will be hardy
in your yard, other than having experience in your yard.

But generally, if you live anywhere in Canada where winter temperatures
predictably reach –12° C (10° F), and most of us do, many of the most popular
roses — such as hybrid teas, floribundas, grandifloras, miniatures, and climbers
— need some kind of protection to survive the winter. You can find more
information about rose hardiness, as well as a list of the hardiest varieties, in
the descriptive chapters on rose types. Also see Chapter 15 on hardy
Explorer and Parkland roses.
Without protection in areas where winters get colder than a variety’s hardiness
can tolerate, parts or all of the top of the plant will be killed or damaged. If a
tender variety is budded onto a hardy rootstock, the rootstock may survive,
but the flowering top of the plant can be killed or damaged. Who knows what
will grow from the rootstock next spring? What we know is that it won’t
flower much, if at all. That’s the main advantage of own-root roses — they
sprout true from the base. (For more information about roses and rootstocks,
see Chapter 16.)
Luckily, protecting roses is not a difficult task.
Preparing for a Cold Winter
Even though different types of roses are given general hardiness ratings, how
you care for specific plants prior to the onset of cold weather can affect their
hardiness. A good analogy is the difference between a car with a radiator full
of fresh antifreeze and one that has only water.
A rose that is properly prepared for cold weather is said to be hardened off.
Most roses harden off by themselves during the gradual onset of fall and
winter. During this time, the plant’s cell walls thicken as they prepare for
dormancy. In many rose varieties, this process manifests itself by the canes
taking on a purplish cast. Unfortunately, purple canes indicate the onset of
dormancy only and don’t give much of an indication as to whether the variety
is hardier than varieties that harden off without turning purple.
The better care your roses receive throughout the growing season, the better
chance they stand to get through the winter unscathed, or at least without
too much damage. If the plant suffers from lack of water or nutrients or was
devastated by disease during the summer and fall, it will be in a weakened
state when winter arrives.
The key to hardening off a rose is to make sure that the plant stops growing
and becomes fully dormant before the onset of the coldest weather. You can
encourage full dormancy in two ways:
248
Part IV: Growing Healthy Roses

  Stop fertilizing six to eight weeks before the first frost. Late applications
of nitrogen fertilizers can keep a rose growing longer into fall or winter
than is safe. If you don’t know the average date of your first frost, ask an
employee at your local nursery.
  Let hips develop. Instead of cutting off (deadheading) the spent flowers
from the last fall blooms, let the spent flowers go to seed. That is, let the
hips — or the seedpods — develop fully. Doing so slows growth and
encourages dormancy.
Keeping Roses Cold
Why would you want to keep your roses cold? You’re supposed to be trying
to protect them from cold, not keeping them cold, aren’t you?
Well, the two are kind of the same thing. You see, whether or not a rose plant
is damaged by cold is not purely a matter of how low the temperatures get.
Strong winter winds can burn or dry out the canes. And fluctuating tempera-
tures, which can cause plants to freeze and thaw, refreeze and thaw again (that
hurts just to think about it!), can kill a cane in a snap.
So what you really want to do when you winter-protect a rose is to insulate
the plant not only from the coldest temperatures but also from unusually warm
weather that may cause the plant to thaw prematurely. And you also want to
protect the rose from drying winds.
Here’s the easiest way to winter-protect roses:
1. Make sure that your plants are well watered.
Fall rains usually do the job, but if the weather has been dry, water deeply
after the first frost but before the ground freezes.
2. In mid to late fall, after most of the leaves have fallen from the rose
and when the nights are getting regularly frosty, mound spadefuls
of soil over the base of the plant, extending the soil up at least 30 to
45 centimetres (1 to 11⁄2 feet) above the soil line.
Take this soil from another part of the garden, not from around the roots.
You don’t want to dig around the roots and you don’t want to expose
them to more freezing than they need.
3. When the ground is thoroughly frozen, cover the soil mound with
a thick layer — at least 30 centimetres (1 foot) — of mulch, such as
straw, leaves, or compost.
Doing so ensures that the ground stays frozen. If any leaves are left on
the plant, pull them off. Besides harbouring disease, leaves can increase
drying. Cut off the canes above the soil line.
249
Chapter 21: Protecting Roses Where Winters Are Cold

4. Start pulling back the mulch as soon as it thaws in the spring and put
it aside to be reapplied as a summer mulch once the soil mound is
removed.
When the ground begins to thaw, slowly remove the pyramid of soil from
around the rose canes and spread it in another section of the garden. But
don’t get started too early; a sudden cold snap can be brutal. Watch for
the yellow blooms of the forsythia or buds swelling on trees. Once these
are in bloom or swelling, it’s okay to remove the mound of soil. Remove
the soil carefully, because you may find that growth is beginning — you
can tell if buds are swollen and are beginning to stretch. Those new buds
are very easy to break off, which is why working carefully around the
plant is important. Applying a gentle stream of water is often better than
using your hands.
Late frosts hurt only the buds that have opened up and are tender (having
been protected by the mulch and mounded soil). So, if you have new, tender
shoots and a forecasted frost is on its way — protect those shoots by carefully
covering the plant with mulch or damp cloth coverings (see Figure 21-1) and
watering heavily (hopefully before the temperature drops). Some rose grow-
ers from southerly climates suggest that a good snow cover takes the place
of soil mounding and mulch insulation. Snow is a good insulator on top of
mounded soil and 30 centimetres (1 foot) of mulch, but it doesn’t help much
by itself when it comes to protecting tender roses in Canadian winters.
250
Part IV: Growing Healthy Roses
Figure 21-1:
A mulched
and wrapped
rose ready
for winter.

Rose growers are an ingenious lot when it comes to protecting their roses.
Some gardeners wrap the mounded soil with wire fencing and then fill the
fencing with insulating material, as shown in Figure 21-1. Some cover their
roses with polyfoam pyramids. Others, led by the Royal Botanical Gardens in
Hamilton, Ontario, use a nursery overwintering foam cloth to cover their
rose beds. We would prefer to move our roses (with the gardener) to a more
southerly clime for the winter. Instead, we deep plant.
Planting Deep
As we’ve mentioned before, deep planting is another Canadian trick to protect
tender roses from the predations of Old Man Winter. When you plant, put
that bud union between 10 to 15 centimetres (4 to 6 inches) deep. It is like
having a permanent insulating mound installed on the rose. The key to success
with deep planting is adequate summer feeding to get the food down to the
deeper-than-normal root system.
If you’re having trouble overwintering your tender roses, you can also dig and
replant the rose when it is dormant. Simply dig up the rose, trying to keep as
many of the roots intact as possible, and excavate a deep enough hole to
install it at the lower depth. See Chapter 17 for planting instructions.
If you’re not having trouble overwintering your tender roses, don’t bother
experimenting with deep planting. On the other hand, it really doesn’t matter
where in Canada you live — if you’re killing your tender roses, try deep
planting to see how it works for you.
Protecting Climbers and Tree Roses
Because climbing roses and tree roses are more upright and more exposed to
cold and wind, they need special protection. If you live in zone 5 and colder,
take tender climbers off their supports. Tie the canes together and wrap them
with burlap or insulating material. Dig a trench 30 to 45 centimetres (12 to
18 inches) deep and bury the rose in the trench. It helps to do this as late in
the fall as possible and include some mouse bait along with the rose. Put the
bait in an old boot right next to the rose so it stays dry and available all
winter long. Tree roses can be stored the same way. Alternately, dig up tree
roses and store them for winter in a cool garage or basement where they can
be kept moist but not frozen solid.
251
Chapter 21: Protecting Roses Where Winters Are Cold

Some gardeners use what is called a tip-over method of overwintering roses,
as shown in Figure 21-2. To do this, dig up half the roots and lean the rose
over on its side. Use stakes to hold the rose down and in place. Then cover
the rose with soil and 30 centimetres (1 foot) of mulch to protect it for the
winter. It’s sort of like having an aboveground trench. This works well in
areas where the roses being grown are almost but not quite hardy enough to
grow on their own.

C
ertain insects and plant diseases probably like your roses as much as
you do — but not more so than they like many other kinds of plants.
Yeah, right. Then how come every time you walk into a nursery, garden
centre, or even a grocery store, all you see are rose care products — sprays,
dusts, combination fungicides and insecticides, and preventative three-way
cure-alls piled up to the roof?
Big surprise. Roses are, after all, among the most popular garden plants, and
gardening is big business. Millions of dollars are made each year from products
that catch the eye of rose growers, whether growers actually need those
products or not.
The truth is that more than one approach to controlling rose pests exists.
Some gardeners are determined to have their plants produce perfect flowers;
these growers are looking for the perfect flower to display at a rose show and
spray their plants every seven to ten days to prevent every insect and disease
from touching their roses. On the other hand, many gardeners never spray
with strong chemicals and still have beautiful rose gardens.

We recommend a flexible, common-sense approach to controlling rose pests.
Take a little and give a little. We can live with a few bugs — they make for a
more diverse garden. But if they try to wipe out our plants, we do something
to stop them. But even then, we use only products that have the least impact
on the environment. This common-sense approach to pest control is what
this chapter is all about.
Preventing Problems
You can do several things to prevent insects and diseases from becoming
problems on your roses:
  Grow healthy plants. A good, strong rose plant is less likely to be
seriously bothered by pests or diseases than one that is weakened by
under- or overwatering or that is planted where it doesn’t get enough
sunlight. Proper pruning to keep the plant open and free to good air
circulation helps prevent disease. Even too much of a normally good thing
— like nitrogen fertilizer — can result in excessive, lush growth that
attracts insects like aphids. The tender leaves are just too luscious to
pass up. So read Chapters 17 through 20 on caring for roses; they’re the
first step in preventing insects and disease.
  Use compost as a primary food source. Compost promotes the growth
of beneficial soil organisms that eat fungus spores and other bad guys.
As a midsummer food source, use a compost tea, fish emulsion drench,
or foliar spray. (See Chapter 19 for details.) Fish emulsion has tons of
minor nutrients that your rose will thrive on. A strong-growing rose is a
healthy rose.
  Plant problem-free varieties. Many rose varieties, especially the newer
ones, have natural resistance bred into them. On the other hand, some
of the loveliest roses are also the most disease prone. It’s like anything
else — for the best you have to pay a price, in this case more pests. Roses
of all types vary in their susceptibility to pests, and where you live plays
a part, too; some problems that are common in one region are rare in
others. Regional disease problems are discussed in Chapter 4.
If a rose has good pest resistance, we say so in the variety descriptions
beginning with Chapter 8. Rose mail-order catalogues (see Appendix B)
are also a good source of information about pest and disease resistance.
  Encourage and use beneficial insects. Beneficial insects are the good bugs
in a garden — the insects that feed on the bugs that bother your roses.
You probably have a bunch of different kinds in your garden already, but
you can also purchase them and release them into your garden. The more
beneficials, the fewer the pests. File that in your memory for now; we
give you specifics later in this chapter.
254
Part IV: Growing Healthy Roses

  Keep your garden clean. Many insects and diseases spend the winter
or go through various stages of their life cycle in garden debris, like
fallen leaves or prunings left on the ground. If you remove these hiding
places, you also likely reduce the number of future pests. So occasionally
rake around the base of your plants to clean up fallen leaves, and always
discard or burn your prunings. And apply a mulch to prevent water from
splashing disease spores onto the foliage.
  Know the enemy. The more you know about specific pests and diseases
common to your area — when they occur and how they spread — the
more easily you can avoid them. For example, the fungal disease black
spot runs rampant on wet foliage. By simply adjusting your watering so
that you don’t wet the leaves of your plants, or by watering early in
the day so that plants dry out quickly, you can reduce black spot’s
occurrence.
  Apply a dormant spray. This application is the most important preven-
tative spray you can make, and the only one we recommend that you
apply every single year. Usually a combination of fairly benign horticul-
tural oil and a fungicide like lime sulphur or fixed copper, a dormant
spray smothers insect eggs and kills disease organisms before they
become a problem. Apply the spray right before you put the rose to bed
and again in the spring after you uncover. The following summer your
roses will be much more disease free.
Identifying Rose Pests
Before you wrestle with any insect or disease problem, make sure that you
properly identify the problem. For a start, consult our list of common insects
and diseases that follows, and also take a look at the information we give about
the best products and materials to use. If you need further help, contact a
local nursery that has a variety of reference books to consult and is familiar
with local problems.
If you like to look things up for yourself, ask at your local nursery or library
for the Ortho Problem Solver. It’s a 1,000-page encyclopedia of garden pest
problems, each one with a colour picture.
Insects that prey on roses
Here are the most common insect pests that you are likely to find infesting
your roses and the best ways to control them. Later in this chapter we go into
full details on the insecticides, pesticides and other treatments recommended
in the following list.

  Aphids are tiny, pear-shaped pests that come in many colours, including
black, green, and red. (See Figure 22-1.) They congregate on new growth
and flower buds, sucking plant sap with their needlelike noses. They leave
behind a sticky sap that may turn black if infected with sooty mould.
Aphids are easy to control. You can knock them off a plant with a strong
jet of water from a hose or use insecticidal soap. The soap helps to wash
off the sooty mould, too. Sometimes, if you just wait a week or two, the
aphid population boom is followed by a build-up in beneficial insects,
especially lady beetles (commonly known as ladybugs), and they take
matters into their own hands before serious damage occurs. We knock
the first flush off our roses with a water spray and then depend on the
developing beneficials to provide protection for the rest of the summer.
  Cucumber beetles are easy to recognize — they’re about 1⁄2 centimetre
(1⁄4 inch) long and yellowish green, with black stripes or dots on their
backs. Two different types exist. They feed mostly on cucumbers and
vegetable plants, but they also love rose blossoms and take big bites out
of them just as they open.
To control these pests, spray with pyrethrin (a botanical insecticide) or
insecticidal soap. Parasitic nematodes (yes, worms) prey on the soil-
borne larvae. Rotenone dust is another excellent insecticide for beetle
problems. (See our description a little later in this chapter.)
  Japanese beetles are becoming more of a problem for Canadian garden-
ers. The 1-centimetre (1⁄2-inch) long beetles have coppery bodies and
metallic green heads. (See Figure 22-2.) They feed on both flowers and
foliage, often skeletonizing the leaves.
256
Part IV: Growing Healthy Roses
Figure 22-1:
Aphids.

Control can be tough. Treating your lawn and garden soil with parasitic
nematodes or milky spore may reduce the white, C-shaped larvae, but
more adults will probably fly in from your neighbours’ yards. Turning
the soil to expose the grubs to birds may also help. Floral-scented traps
that attract adult beetles are available, but the traps may bring in more
beetles than you had before. If you try traps, keep them at least 30 metres
(100 feet) away from your roses.
Insecticidal soap and pyrethrins are effective alternative sprays for con-
trolling adult beetles. An excellent control is to enlist the help of predator
nematodes, to attack and eat lawn grubs. (These nematodes also eat
over 200 other pests; see the full details later in this chapter.) Your local
garden centre or specialty nursery is the source for these tiny critters.
  June beetles are about 2.5 centimetres (1 inch) long and reddish brown
to black. They usually feed at night and prefer the foliage of various trees,
but they also feed on roses. Control is the same as for Japanese beetles,
but milky spore is not effective against June beetle grubs.
  Caterpillars are the larvae of moths or butterflies. They occasionally
feed on the foliage or flowers of roses. You can control them by releasing
trichogramma wasps. Rotenone and diatomaceous earth work their magic
on caterpillars.
  Rose midges are small, almost invisible pests that rasp new growth,
especially flower buds, causing it to shrivel and turn black. If your rose
plant looks healthy but you get shrivelled flowers, suspect rose midge.
Insecticidal soaps sometimes work, as does rotenone, but the best
environmental control is predator nematodes attacking the soil-borne
larvae. Diazanon applied as a soil drench also works for this pest.
257
Chapter 22: Outsmarting Rose Pests and Diseases
Figure 22-2:
A Japanese
beetle.

  Rose chafers are tan-coloured beetles with long legs, as shown in Figure
22-3. Again, control is the same as for Japanese beetles and June beetles,
but milky spore is not effective against the grubs, which is why the
predator nematodes are so useful.
  Stem borers (shown in Figure 22-4) are tiny, wormlike larvae that bore
into canes and feed inside, causing the cane to wilt and, eventually, die.
Borers are not hard to control. First, cut off the wilted stem well back
into healthy tissue. You may be able to see a small hole where the borer
entered the stem or two raised circular markings around the cane. Cut
back below that and look to see whether tissue inside the cane is dam-
aged. If so, cut lower still until the inside of the cane is healthy. Few sprays
of any kind are effective, although you may get some of the larvae by
using parasitic nematodes near the base of the plant. After feeding, the
larvae drop to the ground to mature. Discard or burn the cuttings, do
not leave them to compost. Some gardeners swear that putting a bit of
white glue on the cut end helps stop subsequent borer problems.
258
Part IV: Growing Healthy Roses
Figure 22-3:

  Spider mites are tiny, spiderlike arachnids that you can barely see with-
out a magnifying glass. If the population gets big enough, you can see
their fine webbing beneath the leaves. And as they suck plant juices, the
leaves become yellowish with a silvery stippling or sheen. If things really
get bad, the plant may start dropping leaves. Mites are most common in
hot, dry summer climates and on dusty plants.
A daily bath with a strong spray from a hose should keep infestations
down. You can control spider mites with insecticidal soaps, which also
help to clean off a plant’s leaves. Summer oil is also effective, as is releasing
predatory mites. The key to controlling spider mites is consistent and
regular action. You will not kill them all with one or even two sprays.
  Thrips are another almost-invisible troublemaker. They feed on flower
petals, causing them to be discoloured and the buds to be deformed as
they open. Often the first sign you see is an unopened bud that is bent
over at a sharp angle. Thrips like all roses but are particularly fond of
light-coloured varieties.
Many beneficial insects feed on thrips, especially lacewings. Insecticidal
soaps are also effective, as are several stronger botanical insecticides,
including rotenone.

Troublesome rose diseases
The following sections talk about five of the most common rose diseases and
suggest some techniques for controlling them.
Black spot
Like its name says, this fungus causes small black spots on rose leaves and
stems, as shown in Figure 22-5. The edges of the spots are fringed, and the
tissue around the spots often turns yellow. In bad infections, the plant may
drop all its leaves. This disease is most common during a warm, humid
summer with frequent rain.
The best advice to prevent black spot (besides planting disease-resistant
varieties) is to clean up your winter prunings — the most common source of
reinfection — and use a dormant spray that includes lime sulphur. Also, avoid
overhead watering or water early in the morning so that the leaves can dry
out quickly. Mixing baking soda and summer oil spray, as mentioned later in
this chapter, provides some control, as does liquid sulphur.
Downy mildew
Often confused with powdery mildew and black spot, but much more serious,
downy mildew has the capability to defoliate a plant in 24 hours. Greyish
white fuzz forms on the bottoms of the leaves. Round, purple blotches with
yellow edges form on the tops. Leaves often turn brittle and drop. Fortunately,
downy mildew is less common than other rose diseases. It usually shows up
after long periods of cool, wet weather and then clears itself up when the
weather warms.
260
Part IV: Growing Healthy Roses
Figure 22-5:
Black spot.

The disease needs moist conditions to spread, so avoid overhead watering
and water early in the morning — that way, everything has time to dry out.
Good cultural methods are the best control — prune to increase air circulation
and clean up plant debris. In late fall or winter, use a dormant spray. An early
spring spray with a copper-based fungicide is also effective if downy mildew
has been a problem in your garden.
Powdery mildew
Greyish white, powdery fungus infects new leaves and flower buds, causing
them to become distorted and crinkled-looking. (See Figure 22-6.) Unlike most
other fungal diseases, powdery mildew spreads on dry foliage as well as wet.
Many rose growers prevent its spread by overhead watering or a sprinkling
down each morning, thus washing the spores off the leaves before they can
establish themselves. Other preventative measures include planting resistant
varieties, planting in full sun, and pruning to encourage air circulation.
Effective preventative sprays include antitranspirants and the baking soda
and summer oil mixture, both mentioned later in this chapter.
Rust
On a plant that has rust, small, orange pustules form on the undersides of
the leaves. Yellow spots appear on top. (See Figure 22-7.) If the rust is severe
enough, the plant can lose all its leaves. This disease is most troublesome
when days are warm but nights are cool; prolonged hot, dry weather usually
stops its development.
Prevention is similar to black spot — winter cleanup and dormant spray. Make
sure that you also strip off infected leaves. Spraying a lime-sulphur (or sulphur
by itself) mix will provide some control, but there is not much that can kill rust.

Rose mosaic viruses
Rose mosaic viruses cause yellow mottling on the leaves and deformed new
growth. There’s not much you can do about it. Most of the time, it shows up on
a few leaves and doesn’t do much harm to anything. It can’t spread from plant
to plant, but you should definitely avoid taking cuttings from or hybridizing
with infected plants. The virus is passed on to offspring.
All reputable rose nurseries will replace a plant with a virus. Large commercial
nurseries that grow roses now supply plants that are 95 percent virus free,
but some older plants may be infected. Severely infected garden plants should
be destroyed.
Encouraging Garden Good Guys
Okay, open your mental file on beneficial insects — the garden good guys —
and fill it with some specifics. Following are some things you can do to
encourage beneficial insects to populate your garden and reduce the number
of rose pests:
  Avoid indiscriminate use of broad-spectrum pesticides, which kill
everything, the good guys and the bad. If you do spray, use a spray that
specifically targets the pest you want to eliminate.
  Have a diverse garden with many different kinds and sizes of plants. Doing
so gives the beneficials places to hide and reproduce. Variety can also
provide an alternative food source, because many beneficials like to eat
pollen or flower nectar, too. Some plants that attract beneficials include
Queen Anne’s lace, parsley (especially if you let the flowers develop),
dill, clover, fennel, goldenrod, milkweed, and yarrow. You’ll find many of
these plants described in Gardening For Canadians For Dummies.
262
Part IV: Growing Healthy Roses
Figure 22-7:
Rust.

If beneficial insects are not as numerous in your garden as you would like,
you can buy them from garden suppliers (we list several in Appendix B). If you
know that a particularly difficult pest is likely to appear, order in advance.
That way, you can release the beneficials in time to prevent problems.
Following are some of the good insects that you can buy to help control
rose pests:
  Lady beetles: These are your basic ladybugs, with black-spotted reddish
shells. Both the adult and particularly the lizard-like larvae are especially
good at feeding on small insects like aphids and thrips. Releasing adults
is sometimes not very effective because Mother Nature has programmed
them to migrate on down the road, so they leave your garden quickly.
Try preconditioned lady beetles, which have been deprogrammed (you
don’t want to know how); they are more likely to stick around. And release
them just before sundown. That way, they’ll at least spend the night.
Release a few thousand of them in your garden in spring as soon as you
notice aphids.
  Green lacewings: Their voracious larvae feed on aphids, thrips, mites,
and various insect eggs. These insects are one of the most effective
beneficials for garden use. Release them in your garden in late spring
after danger of frost has passed.
  Parasitic nematodes: These microscopic worms parasitize many types
of soil-dwelling and burrowing insects, including the grubs of Japanese
beetles, June beetles, and rose chafers. Because grubs usually inhabit
lawns, you have to apply these worms there, too, as well as around the
base of your rose plants. Apply parasitic nematodes to the soil around
the base of your plants once a year in the spring.
  Predatory mites: This type of mite feeds on spider mites and thrips.
Add them to your garden in spring as soon as frost danger has passed.
  Trichogramma wasps: Tiny wasps (harmless to people) that attack moth
eggs and butterfly larvae (that is, caterpillars). Release these garden
good guys when temperatures are above 22° C (72° F).
You’ll find that by avoiding the use of sprays other than forceful water jets
and by using your hands to control many pests, natural predators will make
their appearance. If you use compost to control soil-borne problems and
establish a natural order in the garden, your problems will usually be more
easily controlled.
Aphid Hors d’Oeuvre
Good bugs are no dummies; they hang out in gardens that offer the most
diverse and reliable menu. That’s why eliminating every last insect pest from
your garden makes no sense.

As we said earlier, our approach to pest control is to have maximum diversity
in the garden. That’s why having some “bad” bugs around all the time is
important. Aphids are like hors d’oeuvre for so many helpful insects (not to
mention hummingbirds), so you always hope to have a few in your garden.
Otherwise, what will the good bugs eat? But accepting the bugs also means
that you have to accept a little pest damage once in a while. So you’re really
just trying to manage the pests, not nuke them off the face of the earth. You
want to keep them at acceptable levels, without letting them get out of control.
Spend time in your garden. Poke around, turn leaves upside down. Investigate.
Knowing what’s out there is important.
Controlling Pests and Disease
To manage insects and diseases successfully, you have to be a good observer,
checking your roses frequently, if not daily, for developing problems. If an
insect or disease does get out of hand, you want to treat it effectively without
disrupting all the life in the garden. To do that, we start with what we consider
our first line of defence against pest outbreaks: pesticides that can be very
effective against a certain pest, are pretty safe to use, and have a mild impact
on the rest of the garden’s life forms.
In general, these products are short-lived after you use them in the garden —
that’s what makes them so good. However, in order to get effective control,
you often have to use them more frequently than stronger chemicals.
Here are our favourites:
  Biological controls: This method involves pitting one living thing against
another. Releasing beneficial insects is one example of biological control.
Applying predator nematodes to control grubs is another.
  Botanical insecticides: These insecticides are derived from plants. The
following two are especially useful against rose pests.
• Pyrethrins are derived from the painted daisy, Chrysanthemum
cinerariifolium. It is a broad-spectrum insecticide, which means that
it kills a wide range of insects, both good (spray late in the evening
to avoid killing bees) and bad. That’s the downside. The upside is
that this insecticide kills pests like thrips and beetles quickly, breaks
down rapidly in sunlight, and has low toxicity to mammals, which
means that it’s essentially harmless to people, pets, and the
environment.
264
Part IV: Growing Healthy Roses

The terminology can be confusing, however. Pyrethrum is the ground-
up flower of the daisy. Pyrethrins are the insecticide components of
the flower. Pyrethroids, such as permethrin and resmethrin, are
synthetic compounds that resemble pyrethrins but are more toxic
and persistent. Consequently, we prefer to avoid pyrethroids for
home garden use.
• Rotenone is derived from roots of some tropical trees. It is an
extremely potent dust for killing a wide range of pests. Its advantage
is that it breaks down very quickly in sunlight — disappearing
within a day or two. Do not confuse short-lived with ineffective.
Also, do not treat it lightly just because it is a botanically derived
insecticide. Always wear a mask and long sleeves when using it.
Pregnant women should not apply this product.
  Horticultural oils: When sprayed on a plant, these highly refined oils
smother pest insects and their eggs. The words highly refined mean that
sulphur and other components of the oil that damage plants are removed.
They are relatively non-toxic and short-lived. Two types exist:
• Dormant oils are sprayed on roses when they are leafless in winter.
They are often combined with a fungicide like lime sulphur or fixed
copper to help kill overwintering disease spores.
• Summer oils usually are more highly refined (or further diluted)
than dormant oils — they’re thinner. They can be used on roses
during the growing season, as long as the plants have been well
watered and temperatures are not above 29° C (85° F).
Avoid using oil sprays when temperatures are likely to reach above 29° C
(85° F). When it’s that hot, the oil can damage plant leaves.
  Insecticidal soaps: Derived from the salts of fatty acids, insecticidal soaps
kill mostly soft-bodied pests like aphids, spider mites, and whiteflies.
They can also be effective against Japanese beetles. They work fast, break
down quickly, and are non-toxic to humans. Insecticidal soaps are most
effective when mixed with soft water. Soaps sometimes burn tender foliage.
  Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate): Regular old Arm & Hammer has been
a popular powdery mildew remedy (partially effective against black spot)
in the rose underground for the past few years. If you want to try it, do it
like this: Mix 1 rounded tablespoon of baking soda with 1 tablespoon of
summer oil in a gallon of water. Apply weekly to well-watered plants, and
don’t spray if temperatures are above 29° C (85° F). The combination of the
spray with the heat damages leaves. Ongoing research has revealed that
potassium bicarbonate might work a little better and be less prone to
damage leaves. We expect to see products containing potassium bicarbon-
ate and summer oil soon. An alternative recipe is to use 2 tablespoons of
baking soda with a gallon of water and a squirt of household detergent
or soap to help with the mixing. Whichever recipe you experiment with,
be sure to keep the solution well mixed even while spraying.
265
Chapter 22: Outsmarting Rose Pests and Diseases

Baking soda can burn leaves. Apply it in the early morning and not at all during
very hot weather.
  Sulphur is a good fungicide and can be used as preventative for black
spot or a slow-down agent to reduce the spread of rusts. Obtain it at your
garden centre and follow the directions for mixing. It stains concrete or
wood yellow, so be careful mixing it. If you experiment with powdered
sulphur as a dust for pest control, remember to wear goggles. When
sulphur combines with water (as it will if you get a bit of the dust in your
eyes) it forms sulphuric acid. Your eyes will sting and itch for some time.
  Antitranspirants: When sprayed on plant foliage, these form a thin, waxy
layer that can prevent fungal disease like powdery mildew from invading
the leaves. Antitranspirants don’t kill disease, but they may prevent a
disease from getting worse.
Pesticide Double-Speak
People call pesticides such as carbaryl, diazinon, and malathion the “traditional”
pesticides. Such a label would make George Orwell proud. These pesticides
are not traditional at all, unless you figure that only what happened after
World War II is “traditional.” Most of the petroleum-derived pesticides that
line the shelves in garden centres weren’t available to home gardeners until
the 1950s.
Many chemical pesticides are labelled for controlling rose pests. They are
generally effective but usually kill beneficial insects as well as pests. And in
some cases, pests have developed resistance to a particular spray, so the
spray no longer provides adequate control.
A Rosarian’s Approach to Pest
Prevention
One of the things we do in our gardens, even with environmentally sound
methods such as rotenone or sulphur, is to use at least two products in rota-
tion. For example, in a season when black spot is a problem, we’ll spray with
a baking soda mix in week one, and we’ll switch to liquid sulphur in week two.
In week three we go back to baking soda, and we continue using the products
in alternate weeks for the whole spray season. This reduces the ability of
the problem to acclimatize itself and develop immunity to the control agent.
We alternate sprays for insect pests as well as sprays for diseases.
266
Part IV: Growing Healthy Roses

We do not believe in using combination products (fertilizer, insecticide, and
fungicide). They are a shotgun approach to pest control that often results in
excess use of unneeded chemicals, which can harm the environment.
267
Chapter 22: Outsmarting Rose Pests and Diseases
No matter which pesticides you decide to use,
you must use them safely. Even pesticides that
have a relatively low impact on your garden
environment can be dangerous to use and toxic
to humans. This is true of several commonly used
botanical insecticides.
Always follow instructions on the product label
exactly. Doing otherwise is against the law. Both
the pest you’re trying to control and the plant
you’re spraying (sometimes plants are listed as
groups, such as landscape shrubs or flowering
vines) must be listed on the label.
Wear gloves when mixing and applying pesti-
cides and fungicides. Dust masks are wonderful
inventions. Long sleeves to protect your arms are
good, as are rubber boots with pant legs tucked
inside for cleaning with a water hose before you
truck off into the house for a well-deserved cool
drink. In other words, don’t carry the spray
residues with you on your clothing or shoes.
Spray when winds are calm. Store chemicals in
properly labelled containers well out of the reach
of children (a locked cabinet is best). Dispose
of empty pesticide containers as described on
the label, or contact your local waste disposal
company for appropriate disposal sites.

 Hybridizing new varieties
S
o you bought a couple of rosebushes, and now they’re growing great.
You love the flowers; you love the fragrance. You’re hooked. It’s time for
more roses!
What’s the best way to increase your collection? The easiest and most obvious
is to go to a garden centre and buy more plants. Or if you spent hours poring
over the newest rose catalogues, why not order from them? Make no mistake:
Buying new, healthy, vigorous, young rose plants is the very best way to
increase your collection.
But noooo. You have to be the ultimate rosarian and make your own plants.
Okay, we can help. But know right now that there’s nothing simple about it, no
matter which method you use. The concept is simple enough, but a rose isn’t
a geranium or an impatiens. Roses are as easy to grow as other flowers, but
they’re not as easy to propagate. Roses certainly are fun to propagate (a heavy
term for increasing their numbers), though, if you really enjoy the hobby.
You can propagate a rose plant in two ways:
  Asexual propagation: Like cloning, asexual propagation creates new
plants that are identical to the original plant. You can use several methods
to create new plants of the same variety: transplanting new shoots from
own-root plants, rooting cuttings from the original plant, and budding
the original variety onto rootstock. Also, if you have an expensive tissue
culture lab, you can clone a new plant from just a single cell. But, as you
can imagine, cloning a plant is complicated, so we won’t get into it here.

One warning, however. As we mention in Chapter 1, new roses are
patented (you see that weird little symbol on the rose label); therefore,
asexually propagating patented roses is illegal. Although we doubt that
the rose police will come to your yard to check for illegal propagation,
out of respect for hybridizers who work so hard to bring new roses into
the world, most rosarians gladly comply with the law. Don’t worry;
plenty of great rose varieties are off-patent and are prime candidates for
propagating.
  Sexual propagation (also known as hybridizing): Pollen is taken from
one rose to fertilize the eggs of another rose. Roses self-pollinate because
they have both male and female parts. But the result is rarely as good as
the original plant. So hybridizers take pollen from one plant, called the
pollen parent, or dad, and brush it onto the female parts of another rose,
called the seed parent, or mom. After seeds develop, they are planted to
grow new varieties of roses. Sexually propagating patented roses, even
the very newest varieties, is not illegal.
Raiding a Rose Garden
Own-root roses, usually of the old garden type and some modern shrubs, are
not budded onto a rootstock (see Chapter 16 for more information about this
rootstock business). Therefore, new canes grow from the crown (the base of
the plant, right at ground level) of the plant. Often, the plant throws up a new
shoot close to the main plant. You can dig up this cane, plant it elsewhere,
and leave it to grow into a whole new plant.
Friends who grow roses, particularly the old garden roses that are more
inclined to produce this type of growth, are often willing to share their bounty
and give you new shoots to plant in your own garden. New shoots from
own-root plants are always identical to the original plant.
To plant a new shoot, do the following:
1. In early spring, dig up the new shoot with a spade, taking along a big
clump of the soil in order to keep the roots relatively undamaged.
2. Plant the whole thing in a beautifully prepared hole, just like one you’d
prepare for any other rosebush (see Chapter 17 for pointers).
3. Water thoroughly and mound the plant with soil, leaving the soil in
place until new growth begins to appear, which indicates that the roots
are working on their own to nourish the plant.
In a month or two, you should have a healthy new rose plant.
270
Part IV: Growing Healthy Roses

Growing New Plants from Cuttings
Growing roses on their own roots has some advantages, such as increased
winter hardiness. Although many rosarians and commercial growers believe
that a plant must be budded to reach its full potential, that’s not true for all
varieties. Why not try rooting a few cuttings (pieces of rose stem) and compare
for yourself?
Rooting new plants from softwood cuttings sounds easy, but unless you know
what a cutting needs and faithfully provide those things, you will not have a
successful experience. Here’s how to do the job right:
1. Take a cutting from a fairly young cane coming from a bud eye along
a main cane.
Just after a new cane flowers is a good time to take your cutting. The
diameter of the cane should be about the diameter of a drinking straw.
You will have more success with cuttings taken from the tender growing
ends of canes than with those taken further down the cane.
An easy way to tell if the cutting is ripe to be taken is to press sideways
on a thorn on the section of cutting you want to take. If the thorn bends
over and does not snap off, it is too young to make good roots. If it fights
back and punctures your thumb, it is too old to take a cutting. If, on the
other hand, it snaps off with a small pop, it is exactly right to be taken
and rooted.
2. After you remove the small cane from the plant, cut off the bottom at
a very sharp angle so that the cut is as close as possible to a bud eye.
Make this angled cut with a very sharp pruner.
3. With a razor blade or X-acto knife, lightly score the bark vertically
from the bottom, and up about 2 to 3 centimetres (1 inch), on the side
of the stick opposite a bud eye.
Doing so encourages roots to form along the score.
4. From the bottom of the cutting, measure up about 15 centimetres
(6 inches), leaving two to three sets of five-leaf leaflets. Cut the top off
the stick, about 1⁄2 a centimetre (1⁄4 inch) above a bud eye.
5. Dip the bottom, angled end of the cutting into a liquid rooting hormone
(such as Dip n’ Grow), mixed according to package directions.
Dip the cutting to a depth of about 2 to 3 centimetres (1 inch) so that the
score you made on the cane is immersed. If you use dry powder hormone
instead of liquid, knock off all excess dust so only a sheen of dust is
showing.
271
Chapter 23: Making More Roses

6. Insert the coated cutting into a small peat pot filled with wet sterile
potting soil.
With your fingers, squeeze down the soil so that the cutting stands up
and is fairly stable in the pot.
7. Place your cutting into a misting tent.
Making an effective misting tent is easy. Simply mist the cutting with water,
place a clear or white plastic bag over the container, and secure the bag
around the top of the pot with a piece of string, as shown in Figure 23-1.
The tent keeps the cutting moist and prevents it from drying up and dying.
8. Place the misting-tent-enclosed cutting outdoors in a spot that gets
indirect morning and afternoon sun but is in shade at midday, such as
the north side of the house.
Avoid placing the misting tent in direct sun at all costs, or you will
bake the contents of the bag rather than help root your cutting. You
must mist the leaves several times each day, more often if it’s sunny.
Misting keeps moisture in the cutting, which it needs because it has no
roots to get its own moisture. Don’t forget to mist, or your cutting will
die. If the leaves turn yellow and fall off before the first week ends, you
may as well give up and start again.
272
Part IV: Growing Healthy Roses
Figure 23-1:
A rooted
rose cutting

tent.

If the leaves fall off after three weeks, it’s not a great sign, but you still
have hope. Mix 1 tablespoon of a high-nitrogen liquid fertilizer in 4 litres
(1 gallon) of water and lightly mist your plant with the solution. Doing so
may stimulate new leaf growth from the bud eye.
If all goes well, your cutting should root in less than a month. Strong white
roots grow from the bottom of the cutting and fill the small pot. Now’s
the time to transplant into a larger pot.
If you are not able to mist regularly during the day, spray the cuttings (top
and bottom of each leaf) with an antidesiccant. This is a waxy liquid that
dries on the leaf and prevents it from losing water. We use it on all tricky
cuttings to almost guarantee success.
9. Plant the cutting, peat pot and all, into a 15-centimetre (6-inch) pot
filled with regular potting mix, harden it off, and start dreaming while
you grow it for a month or two in the sun.
To harden off a plant, move it from a shady, wind-protected spot out into
full sun gradually, keeping it outdoors in the sun a little longer each day
for a ten-day to two-week period. Never let the soil dry out.
10. When the plant starts putting out strong, healthy growth, transplant it
into the garden and treat it as you would any rose plant.
See Chapter 17 for planting instructions.
Sexual Propagation
You’ve heard about this kind of thing before, haven’t you? Well, the process is
pretty much the same for roses as it is for people, give or take a few steps.
Here’s how to go about it the rose way.
If you want to try your hand at creating a new variety of rose without a lot of
effort, try growing the seeds in the hips that you find on your plants in the
fall. They’re already pollinated — by bees or by themselves. So the sex part is
already over.
Follow these steps:
1. After the hips (seed pods) change colour from green to orange or red,
pick them off the plant.
2. Carefully cut open the hip with a knife, trying not to injure the seeds
that are waiting inside. Gently remove the seeds.
3. Wrap the seeds in a damp paper towel and place them in a plastic bag.
4. Keep the bag in the crisper section of your refrigerator for 90 days.
273
Chapter 23: Making More Roses

5. Remove the seeds from their cool packaging and plant them 1⁄2 to
1 centimetre (1⁄4 inch) deep in a shallow container or flat filled with
sterile potting soil.
6. Place the container under lights or on a really sunny windowsill and
wait for the seeds to sprout.
Not all the seeds will sprout, but that’s normal.
7. Leave the seedlings to grow in the container, keeping them moist but
not soggy at all times.
They should bloom in about six weeks. The plant and the bloom will be
small, and although you won’t get a very accurate idea of what the flower
will look like on a mature plant, you can tell whether it has potential.
8. Destroy plants with really ugly flowers or those that become diseased
when the others in the flat do not.
9. After the first flower blooms, carefully transplant the seedling into a
larger pot.
To keep from damaging the fragile roots, take plenty of the surrounding
soil along with the roots when you transplant.
10. After the plant throws several new canes, harden it off (see Step 9 in
“Growing New Plants from Cuttings” earlier in this chapter) and then
plant it in the garden to mature.
Roses are heavy feeders, so give your new seedling plenty of nutrients to
enable it to achieve maximum growth in its first season. (Chapter 19
explains fertilizing roses.) With proper care, many seedlings can reach a
large size in the first season.
Hybridizing Roses
Hybridizing is best done in a greenhouse, rather than outdoors where bees
can interfere with crossbreeding and your plants are subject to the whims of
the weather. Of course, you can hybridize outside. Here goes:
1. Choose two varieties of roses that you think have good characteristics
that you would like to see passed on to a new variety.
2. Watch the plant that you have decided should be the seed, or female,
parent. When you see a flower on which the first couple of rows of
petals have opened but the centre is still tightly furled, gently remove
all the petals from the flower.
Doing so leaves the yellow stamens exposed. (See our rose anatomy
explanation in Chapter 2.) The anthers, or male parts that produce the
pollen, are at the top of the stamens. The anthers must be removed to
ensure that the rose does not self-pollinate, ruining your cross.
274
Part IV: Growing Healthy Roses

3. Gently bending the rose stem, cut off or remove the anthers from the
stamens with a pair of tweezers or manicure scissors.
Never allow the anthers to fall into the centre of the flower.
Once you remove the anthers, your rose seed parent is emasculated.
4. Cover the parent with a bag so that no new pollen drifts in.
Leave it alone for 24 hours so that the female parts can ready themselves
to accept pollen.
5. In the meantime, collect some pollen from the pollen parent, or male.
Pollen requires a couple of days to ripen after being harvested, so collect
the anthers (removing them just like you did when you emasculated the
seed parent) well in advance from a mature flower of the variety you
choose as the pollen parent. Let the tiny anthers sit in an uncovered
shallow container in a warm place until you can easily shake off the
yellow pollen.
6. When both the pollen and the seed parent hip are ready, use a small
paintbrush to dab pollen onto the centre of the emasculated seed parent.
If you want to simplify this step, just cut the pollen source from the
rosebush and dab the pollen on the seed parent when its centre looks
slightly sticky. (See Figure 23-2.) The results are less reliable, but this
method is much easier. Whichever method you use, place a bag back over
the seed parent for a week.
275
Chapter 23: Making More Roses
Figure 23-2:
Dabbing
pollen onto
the seed
parent.

If the cross-pollination is successful, the hip begins to swell, as shown in
Figure 23-3. The hip is ripe and the seeds are harvestable after six to
eight weeks, when the hip turns red or orange. Like the self-pollinated
seeds we discussed earlier in this chapter, the seeds must be chilled for
90 days before planting.
7. Plant the seeds about 1⁄2 to 1 centimetre ( 1⁄4 to 1⁄2 inch) deep in a pot or
tray filled with sterile potting soil.
Put them in a warm, brightly lit area indoors (a heated greenhouse is
ideal) and keep the soil moist. They should germinate in about six to
eight weeks.
8. When the seedlings have two true leaves, transplant them individually
into small pots.
Keep them in a bright windowsill until the weather is nice enough to plant
outdoors. But make sure to harden off the seedlings first, conditioning
them to outdoor sun and temperatures gradually.
Keeping track of the cross you made is always a good idea. You can do so by
attaching a label to the stem of the hip as you leave it to ripen. Write the seed
parent’s name first, then an x, meaning “crossed with,” and then the pollen
parent’s name. For example:
‘Pristine’ x ‘Folklore’
Some rose varieties make better seed parents, and some make better pollen
parents. Hybridizers who have worked with roses for years have learned which
is which, and you can share their experience by reading any of the books
they’ve published or by subscribing to the Rose Hybridizers’ Association
Newsletter, published by the Rose Hybridizers’ Association.

If you want to get rich hybridizing roses, try to come up with a large, red,
fragrant hybrid tea with excellent form. It has to grow on long, sturdy stems
and produce flowers generously. It must be disease resistant and do well in a
greenhouse. If it does well outside, too, that’s a great bonus. The colour must
stay true for a long time, not bluing or blackening on the edges, and the flower
should have a long vase life. Good luck!

Beginners that outlines the basics of hybridizing.
One More Thing, Sport!
One other way to come up with a new variety of rose is to find a sport on an
existing plant. A sport is an anomaly in a plant’s cells that causes a cane and
flower that look entirely different to grow from the bud eye of the original
plant. Often these sports are really wonderful roses, sometimes even better
than the original plant. For example, ‘Chicago Peace’, a sport of ‘Peace’, was
discovered by a gardener in Chicago. And ‘Gourmet Popcorn’, a sport of the
white miniature ‘Popcorn’, was discovered by a rosarian in Los Angeles.
Many of the roses you can buy today are sports.
As with many types of plants, sporting is a fairly common occurrence, but
finding a sport is always fun — especially if it’s a good one.
If you observe a sport on one of your plants, make a cutting and grow the
new variety. The plant may be wonderful beyond your wildest dreams. If so,
invite one of the large commercial growers to take a look. If they like your rose,
test it, and introduce it to the public, you’re entitled to a royalty!

ver walk into one of those wonderful-smelling shops where they sell
cookbooks, kitchen utensils, things to hang on the wall, and maybe soaps
and towels — you know, just about anything frilly? They also sell perfect
bouquets of dried roses and intensely fragrant potpourris filled with dried rose
petals. Where does that stuff come from? A herd of hard-working grandmas
must be out there somewhere growing and drying a heck of a lot of roses.
Actually, if a herd of grandmas is out there, they may not be working as hard
as you think. Drying roses and making potpourri is not that difficult. In fact, it’s
pretty easy, as we show you in this chapter. And in the process, you not only
find out how to preserve and spread the beauty of roses around your house
12 months a year, but you also can make great gifts to share with friends.
Drying Roses in Silicon Valley North
Computer nerds use silica gel to dry roses, of course. What did you expect?
(Okay, so it’s not funny and doesn’t make sense. But every ...For Dummies
book has to have a reference to computer nerds, and that was ours.) Silica gel
is actually a sugar-like substance that sucks the moisture right out of a rose,
leaving a perfectly dried flower. You can get the stuff from a florist or at a
craft shop.

To get the best results when drying roses with silica gel, cut your roses in
the morning after the dew dries. Pick the best roses, open just the way you
want them and free of insects and disease. Leave very little, if any, stem on
the flower.
Spread about 2 to 3 centimetres (1 inch) of silica gel in the bottom of a flat,
wide container that has a snug-fitting top. A plastic microwave tray works
well. Set the roses upright in the gel, making sure that they don’t touch. Gently
add more gel until the flowers are completely covered and then seal the
container.
The roses take anywhere from a day or two to two weeks to dry, depending
on their size and how humid the air is where you live. The roses are dry when
they feel like crisp paper. Carefully remove the blossoms from the gel and blow
on them gently to remove the excess gel. If some gel sticks, use an artist’s
brush to remove it. Don’t leave the roses in the gel too long, or the colour will
fade quickly after you take them out.
You can also dry rose leaves for making more realistic dried bouquets, but you
should dry them in a separate container from the flowers. They become too
brittle if left on the stem, and they may take longer to dry than the flowers do.
Which roses dry best?
Because they dry so quickly, miniature roses are favourites for preserving in
silica gel. But with some practice, you can also dry larger roses successfully.
Which colours are best? Many of the deepest red roses dry black. However,
some bright orange roses dry bright red. Deep pink roses usually dry nicely.
White, light pink, and yellow roses tend to fade to dishwater white. Blended
roses dry beautifully, but again they tend to fade after a while.
We asked some members of the American Rose Society who have been
drying roses for years, which varieties they get the best results with. They
made the following suggestions (some of these might be difficult to find, so
consult the resources in Appendix B):
  Reds: Use hybrid teas ‘Old Smoothie’ and ‘Olympiad’, and miniatures
‘Acey Deucy’, ‘Debut’, ‘Old Glory’, and ‘Starina’.
  Pinks: Try ‘Century Two’, ‘Colour Magic’, ‘Dainty Bess’, ‘Electron’, ‘Miss
All-American Beauty’, ‘Perfume Delight’, ‘Pink Peace’, ‘Prima Donna’,
‘Sheer Elegance’, and ‘Touch of Class’ among the hybrid teas, and ‘High
Jinks’ and ‘Winsome’ (actually a mauve rose) from the miniatures.
280
Part IV: Growing Healthy Roses

  Oranges: Good choices (which, oddly, dry to red) include ‘Bing Crosby’,
‘Cary Grant’, ‘Command Performance’, ‘Dolly Parton’, ‘Fragrant Cloud’,
and ‘Tropicana’ of the hybrid teas, grandifloras ‘Olé’ and ‘Prominent’,
and floribundas ‘Impatient’ and ‘Marina’.
  Multis: Good choices include ‘Milestone’ and ‘Mon Cheri’ of the hybrid
teas, and ‘Child’s Play’, ‘Holy Toledo’, and ‘Kristin’ of the miniatures.
Preserving and arranging dry flowers
You can display dried roses in bowls or dishes with other dried flowers, or
you can use them to make arrangements. However, to make arrangements
like you do with fresh flowers, you need to attach the blooms to flower sticks,
floral wire, or something stiff to support the dry flower. A craft shop is the
best place to look for ideas and materials.
Making Potpourri
Who’d want to make “rotten pot”? Well, maybe the idea sounds better when
you translate “rotten pot” into French, making it potpourri. Potpourri is an
aromatic and colourful mixture of dried rose petals, herbs, spices, and
aromatic oils. (You can make moist potpourri, but this chapter describes the
dry kind, which is a lot easier to make, anyway.) The word potpourri is derived
from a French process of aging rose petals in some type of container — the
rotting pot.
Any rose, as long as it’s fragrant, makes a good potpourri. Collect the petals
in the morning after they have dried. Flowers that are about three-fourths to
fully open are best. Anything older loses its fragrance.
To dry the petals, spread them out on an elevated screen placed in a well-
ventilated, warm, dry area away from direct sun. The petals are dry enough
when they break when bent — the process takes anywhere from a day or two
to a week.
The basic procedure for mixing potpourri is as follows:
1. Mix the dry petals with your favourite aromatic herbs and spices —
cloves, allspice, mint, and cinnamon work well.
Use 30 millilitres (an ounce) of dry herbs for every litre (quart) of dried
petals. You can also throw in dried citrus peel and other dried flowers.
281
Chapter 24: Drying Roses and Making Potpourri

2. Add some aromatic oils, such as lavender, clove, or cinnamon, and a
preservative.
Powdered or chopped orris root (available at craft shops) is a favourite
preservative. You can either put a few drops of aromatic oil on the small
pieces of orris root or drop the oil over the whole mixture into which
you have added the powdered orris root.
3. Mix everything gently and place the potpourri in a sealed container.
Store the potpourri in a cool, dark place. Gently shake or toss the mixture
every so often. The mixture should be ready in a few weeks, although
the scent is pretty strong at first.
You can put your potpourri out in any attractive container, but a glass
bowl looks especially nice. To prolong the aroma, keep the potpourri
covered, and then open and gently stir it when you want to release the
essence (like when guests come over). You may want to add more dried
flowers occasionally to intensify the colour. When covered, a potpourri
can last for years.
You usually can find everything you need for making potpourri in craft
shops. Aromatic oils can also be found in drugstores and health food
stores.
Pressing Flowers
You can dry roses another way — by pressing them. The process is simple
but works best with single roses or flowers with fewer than 10 or 12 petals.
You can find flower presses in nurseries or craft stores, but you can just as
effectively press flowers between the pages of a heavy book. Here’s how:
1. Place two pieces of blotter paper (even paper towels work) between
the pages of a heavy book.
2. Pick some roses in the morning after they dry.
3. Place the roses between the pieces of blotter paper, arranging the
petals just the way you want the flower to dry.
4. Close the book carefully and pile some other heavy books on top.
5. Check the flowers every few days.
If the blotter paper looks wet, replace at least one piece of it, carefully
moving the flowers with tweezers, if necessary. The flowers dry in about
two weeks.
282
Part IV: Growing Healthy Roses

Store the flowers in an airtight container, between pieces of paper, or even in
the book itself. You can use pressed roses to make greeting cards, mount them
in picture frames, or use them to decorate festive tables.
Friends of ours who do this kind of thing (we’re too busy growing and smelling
roses to be crafty too) tell us that the clay pressing boards you use in the
microwave are wondrous technological advancements in flower drying. These
are available through specialty garden stores and come highly recommended
for those who want dried flowers in a hurry. As a bonus, our friends tell us the
original colours are preserved better with microwave drying than with any
other method they’ve used.

The Ten Most Frequently Asked
Questions about Roses
In This Chapter
  All the things you wanted to know about roses but were afraid to ask
From the Queen of Hearts
School of Pruning
Q. How soon can I prune?
A. Never prune for the sake of pruning. Cut off dead parts of the canes in
early spring after removing winter protection. Prune off dead or dying flowers
(which is called deadheading). Prune out spindly growth from the bottom of
the plant as soon as you see it. And cut as many flowers as make you happy.
Never cut rose canes in late summer before frost. (See Chapter 20 for more
information about pruning.)
From the Imelda Marcos
School of Shopping
Q. Where can I shop for roses?
A. Seen a rose you simply must have but can’t find it anywhere? Get on the
Internet. Go to a meta search engine like www.dogpile.com and enter the
name of the rose. If it exists, this will bring it up. Also check out Appendix B
for specialty catalogues.

From the Absolutely Clueless
School of Rose Culture
Q. What’s wrong with my roses?
A. If your plants don’t seem to have any of the pests or diseases that we
describe in Chapter 22, get a soil test. You can find out more about soil tests
in Chapter 17, or see Appendix B for soil-testing resources in your area.
From the Climbing the
Wall Syndrome
Q. Why won’t my climbing roses bloom?
A. Some older varieties of climbing roses bloom on old wood — that is, stems
that are two years old or older. If you chop those climbers to the ground every
spring, you’ll never see a flower. In Canada, your best bet is to protect your
climbers really well. See Chapter 21 for winter protection tips. If you haven’t
protected them, it is also possible that the tops are dead and the non-blooming
growth is coming from the rootstock below the bud union. If so, dig it up
and compost it.
From the Jaundiced Rose Garden
Q. Why do my rose leaves turn yellow and fall off?
A. First, check for spider mites by looking on the undersides of the leaves.
You may need a magnifying glass. If you see little red spiders, they’re sucking
the very life from your rose plant. Try blasting them off with daily hose spray-
ings — the more powerful the better. If this doesn’t work, try a spray with
summer oil, which smothers the little suckers. If you don’t see tiny spiders,
check Chapter 22 about rose pests and diseases and see whether your plant
has black spot or any other fungal disease. Our best guess is mites and/or
black spot.
288
Part V: The Part of Tens

From an Insecure Rose Gardener
Q. What are the easiest roses to grow?
A. It really depends on the kind of gardener you are. But if you have absolutely
no confidence in your ability to grow roses, give it a rest! You’re as good a
grower as anyone else. To start with, try roses in the Explorer series, such as
‘John Cabot’ or ‘Champlain’. See Chapter 15 for more information on these
hardy roses. If you can’t grow Explorers — think silk.
From the “No Question Is Stupid”
School of Higher Learning
Q. What’s the difference between bareroot and potted roses?
A. One has its roots growing in a pot of soil, and the other has all the soil
removed from the roots. We’ll let you figure out which is which. For more
information about how roses are sold, see Chapter 16.
From the “All That Glitters”
School of Disease Control
Q. Why are my rose leaves silvery and shrivelled?
A. Your roses have powdery mildew. Kill it quick before it spreads to other
plants in your garden. Try the summer oil and baking soda routine described
in Chapter 22.
From the Runny Nose Department
Q. Why aren’t my roses fragrant?
A. You may be growing varieties that have little or no fragrance. Or perhaps
you’re smelling them at the wrong time of day. Choose fragrant varieties if
fragrance is important to you. See the list of fragrant roses in Chapter 3.
289
Chapter 25: The Ten Most Frequently Asked Questions about Roses

From the Freezer Section
Q. When should I prepare my roses for winter?
A. Wait until you think that your plants are pretty dormant. Hint: When the
leaves start falling off in the fall, the plant is dormant. Some people wait until
the ground is frozen, but chances are you’ll have to do your winter preparing
in the snow if you wait that long. You want the roses to have experienced a
hard black frost or three to ensure they’re well dormant and will stay that way.
If you do get snow before you have a chance to protect your tender roses,
pile the mulch on anyway, the deeper the better. (You did think ahead and
leave the mulch where it was dry and not frozen, didn’t you?)

Ten Ways to Kill a Rose
In This Chapter
  How you can kill roses without getting the blame.
I
f you decide that roses aren’t for you and you want to kill them in your
garden, here’s how to go about getting rid of these pesky plants. Mind you,
some of these tips are simply common mistakes made by beginning gardeners.
Whether you’re trying to kill the rose or simply making a common mistake
is up to you.
Plant Them in the Shade
Roses need six hours of full sunshine each and every day. The more you reduce
this amount, the fewer blossoms you’ll get. Not only that, but the weaker your
plant will become and one winter . . . well, after the winter, you’ll have some
extra material for the compost pile. Even those roses that are labelled as
being shade tolerant will not tolerate much shade and still produce flowers.
It will likely take three to four years for a shaded plant to die.
Plant Them with Lots of Grass around
the Base to Compete for Nutrients
This is a favourite of some gardeners. They take a hybrid tea rose and plonk
it down in the middle of the lawn. Having read that a rose is a shrub, they
expect it to compete with grass for nutrients. Nothing competes with grass
for nutrients, and a rose is certainly not going to win that contest. Get rid of
the grass around your rose.

Plant Them Where They Get
a Dose of Lawn Spray
The average rose does not appreciate the chemicals used to kill lawn weeds.
Being woody plants with deeper roots, they are not immediately killed by
lawn chemicals. However, several doses over the summer will set them back
and they simply won’t grow well or flower heavily. Remember that many lawn
sprays are volatile. This means they form gases and float around on the breeze.
If they float over to your rose — you get the picture, I’m sure.
Never Water Them during a Dry Spell
This is one of the truly creative ways to kill a rose. Roses are seldom killed
outright by a lack of water unless it is a truly serious drought. Instead, they
struggle along with reduced growth and blooms and enter the winter in a
weakened condition. When they die over the winter, then winter damage
becomes the cause, not your lack of gardening efforts.
Never Treat for Black Spot
Black spot will take a few years to weaken a rose (even a good healthy one)
until it succumbs to winter death. This disease defoliates a plant over the
course of the summer. Without leaves, the plant can’t get enough energy to
renew itself. Just like the above non-watering point, the gardener can hardly
be blamed for winter losses.
Do Not Protect Tender Hybrid
Teas during the Winter
This is a wimpy way to kill your roses. If you want to be creative, see the
above two points. Everybody knows you have to protect tender roses — this
is Canada, after all. However, you can always say you thought they were extra
hardy Explorer roses. You still come out looking bad but at least you have
somebody else to blame — like the nursery that sold you the wrong roses.
292
Part V: The Part of Tens

Don’t Take Climbing Hybrid Teas
off the Trellis for the Winter
Hey, these climbers are supposed to climb, right? What’s with taking them off
the trellis and burying them for the winter? You can confuse the issue for an
extra season if the rootstock throws out suckers that will grow like crazy and
not bloom. If in doubt, blame the nursery where you got the rose: “They said
it would be easy to grow.”
Prune Heavily and Do Not Feed At All
If you cut your rose to the ground every year, or it is knocked down over the
winter, it takes a lot of food to grow strong canes and produce flowers. If you
never feed your rose, slowly but surely it will weaken. It will produce pitifully
thin canes and small flowers. If you combine this technique with growing in
the shade and never watering, you can shorten the lifespan of most roses
quite a bit.
Spray with Heavier Doses of Sprays
Than Recommended
This is a good one. Ignore the warnings on the label that caution you to only
use one tablespoon of something like baking soda. Heck, use four or five. If a
little bit is good then a whole lot is better, right? So what if the leaves all turn
brown and the flowers go purple after you spray. You’ve definitely knocked
back the fungus problems!
Ask Your Neighbours to Water
Your Plants for You
We don’t know why, but every time we ask the neighbours to water the garden
all heck breaks loose. You can substitute your mother-in-law, the minister, or
anybody else you want to blame, but understand that when you leave for a
holiday, the plants will resent it. They resent it so much they simply die for
your return. This works particularly well on roses you are growing in pots or
large containers.

Ten Tips for Cutting Roses
In This Chapter
 Getting the most from a cut rose
 Cutting real winners
A
nyone who grows roses and doesn’t cut some to bring their beauty and
fragrance indoors is missing the boat. No matter what your home looks
like, from campy to castle, bringing some roses inside can make it look regal.
And having roses around the house makes you feel great, too. Try it if you
don’t believe us.
Really, almost any rose makes a great cut flower. It’s true that some varieties
last longer than others, and we tell you about those varieties in this chapter.
But if you like a rose — any rose — then cut it, bring it inside, and put it in a
vase. Who cares whether it lasts two days or ten; this isn’t a contest! If the
thing wilts, you can always cut another one.
Anyway, that’s our approach to cutting roses. But we may be in the minority.
To many people, cutting roses is an art. And artists can be a little nutty. You
know the type:
“My cut roses last longer than anyone’s. The secret is to cut them while
standing on your head and singing John Denver songs. Then chew off all the
thorns while gargling with beer and put them in water measuring exactly 47
degrees Celsius.”
Yeah, right.
To be honest, cutting roses is a little bit craziness and a little bit science. And
that’s what this chapter is about. If you want your cut roses to last as long as
possible, follow as many of our ten suggestions as possible. If you don’t care
whether they last five days or six, do whatever you want.

Following a Flipped-Out Florist
Here are ten ways to get the longest-lasting cut roses:
  Cut flowers late in the afternoon, when stem and flower are loaded with
food reserves. The second best time is very, very early in the morning
before the rose starts growing for the day.
  Make sure that the plant you’re cutting from is not dry, especially in hot
weather. If it is, water it several hours prior to cutting flowers.
  Choose flowers at the right stage — roses that are one-third to one-half
open, or still closed in the bud but whose sepals are separated and
turned downward. The bud shouldn’t be rock hard. Instead, it should be
slightly soft when you squeeze it.
  Carry a bucket of water with you. Cut the stem at a 45-degree angle and
place it immediately in the water. You can cut as far down the stem as
you want, but try to leave at least two or three leaves on the stem below
the cut. Those leaves feed the remaining stem.
  When you get inside, cut the ends of the stems again, but this time cut
them under water. That’s right, under water. Doing so keeps the stem’s
vessels open so that it can take up water. Just use a pruner or a pair
of scissors that you don’t mind getting wet and cut the stems at an angle
right in your bucket. If you take only one suggestion — this is the one
to take!
  Let the flowers stand in a bucket of room-temperature water, in a cool,
dark place for at least a few hours before arranging them. This conditions
the roses so that they’ll have a longer vase life.
  Doctor the water in the vase. Roses last longer in clean water that is a
little on the acidic side. You can buy little packs of flower preservative
that add all the right stuff at florist shops, or you can make your own. The
florist’s one works the best but homegrown ones are better than noth-
ing. Our favourite mix adds one part lemon-based soda pop, like Sprite
or 7-Up, to three parts water. Or just add two good squeezes from a fresh
lemon, a tablespoon of sugar, and a few drops of household bleach to a
quart of water.
  Before putting the flowers in a vase, remove the lower leaves and thorns
(they snap right off when you push them sideways) that will be beneath
the water. If left on the stem, they’ll rot quickly and mess up the water.
Also, use a clean vase.
296
Part V: The Part of Tens

  Change the vase water often. The cleaner you keep the water, the longer
the flowers will last. This is the second most important suggestion we’ll
make. And, when you change the water, recut the stems (under water!)
half a centimetre (one-quarter inch) shorter to extend their blooming life
a bit more.
  Last but not least, say something nice to the roses. It can’t hurt. Besides,
if you do all the other stuff, you probably talk to your flowers already.
If, even after all this, your roses still wilt (or maybe the phone rang and you
forgot all about the flowers in the yard), recut the ends, submerge the entire
bunch in cold water, and let them sit for an hour. That may revive them.
The Best Roses for Cutting
In general, the more petals a rose has, the longer it lasts as a cut flower, simply
because it takes longer to open. So, fully double modern roses, especially
hybrid teas, are ideal as cut flowers because they usually have those great
long, sturdy stems. Old rose flowers tend to have a shorter life than modern
varieties, but the great character and fragrance of most old roses really make
them wonderful in bouquets.
How you handle the rose is more important than the variety you grow. Follow
as many of the above suggestions with any rose you like to grow in your
garden. If you like it in your garden, you’re going to love it in your kitchen.

Ten Roses and Rose Gardens
That Made History
In This Chapter
  Facts and fancy on roses throughout history
R
oses have a royal history that few other plants can match. You can trace
them back over 5,000 years, when they were grown by many an ancient
civilization, including the Egyptians, Chinese, Greeks, and Romans. Even
Confucius wrote about roses around 500 B.C. Since then, roses have been
cherished by kings and queens, described by poets and philosophers, and
just plain loved by us commoners.
Even if you’re not a history buff, you can’t ignore the historical significance of
roses and some rose gardens. This chapter talks about roses and gardens that
made history, giving you just enough to whet your appetite for what might
be the start of a new career: Rosarian Historian. Or is it Historian Rosarian?
The Rose the Romans Loved
Rosa damascena sempervirens, known as the autumn damask rose, caused
quite a stir in ancient Rome around 50 B.C. Until then, the Romans knew only
roses that bloomed once a year. When they saw this new rose from North
Africa that bloomed twice a year, they went bonkers. Imagine what would have
happened if someone had walked into Rome with the floribunda ‘Iceberg’,
which never stops blooming. A Caesar might still rule the world!

Cleopatra’s Secret Weapon
The cabbage rose, Rosa centifolia (at least we think the plant was a cabbage
rose — we weren’t actually there), was another rose that those decadent
Romans loved. They learned how to grow these roses in heated greenhouses
so that they flowered almost year-round. Picture this: Emperor Nero, sipping
wine while lounging on cushions filled with rose petals. Fountains flowing with
rose-scented water, with guests strolling through halls strewn with rose petals.
And — how come we didn’t see this in the movie? — Cleopatra supposedly had
rose petals piled knee-deep in the room where she first entertained Mark Antony.
Fighting over Roses in England . . .
Roses were even involved in the fight over who would be king of England. The
five-petalled White Rose of York, Rosa alba, is infamously linked to the House
of York, who used it as its emblem in the 15th-century Wars of the Roses.
Their enemies, the House of Lancaster, chose the red apothecary’s rose, Rosa
gallica officinalis, as its symbol. One fable says that the two parties stopped
fighting when they found a rosebush bearing both red and white individual
flowers, and flowers that were both red and white, in the English countryside.
The pink and white damask rose ‘York and Lancaster’ is often credited with
being that rose, but it actually wasn’t introduced to England until much later.
. . . and the Rose to Commemorate
the War’s End
The ‘Peace’ hybrid tea has long been one of the world’s favourite roses. In
1965, Antonia Ridge published the story of ‘Peace’ and the Meilland family
that bred her. If you’re interested, the book was called For Love of a Rose.
We’ve borrowed liberally from her story.
‘Peace’ can be traced back to Lyon, France, where, in 1935, the 23-year-old
hybridizer Francis Meilland made the cross that would first be known as
#3-35-40. The rose caught everyone’s eye. Meilland himself described it, saying
that it “produced flowers quite marvelous in shape and size with a greenish
tinge, warming to yellow, and progressively impregnated with carmine around
the edges of the petals.”
Buds from #3-35-40 were passed to several nurseries around the world. In
the confusion surrounding the start of World War II, the rose was given three
different names: ‘Gloria Dei’ by a German company, ‘Gioia’ by an Italian
nursery, and ‘Mme A. Meilland’ in memory of the hybridizer’s mother.
300
Part V: The Part of Tens

Even during the war, #3-35-40 gained notoriety. The Duke of Windsor himself
said, “I have never seen another rose like it. It is most certainly the most
beautiful rose in the world.”
Meanwhile, the Conard Pyle Company introduced #3-35-40 as ‘Peace’ to
commemorate the end of suffering of World War II. Under the auspices of the
American Rose Society, ‘Peace’ was formally introduced on April 29, 1945, a
date that also marked the fall of Berlin. Shortly after this event, at a meeting
of 49 delegations of the United Nations in San Francisco, the head of each
delegation received in his or her hotel room a small vase with a single ‘Peace’
rose accompanied by a card carrying the following message:
“This is the ‘Peace’ rose, which was christened by the Pacific Rose Society
exhibition in Pasadena on the day Berlin fell. We hope the ‘Peace’ rose will
influence men’s thoughts for everlasting world Peace.”
Besides being inseparably linked to world peace, the ‘Peace’ rose is also one
of the most widely used roses for creating new varieties. No fewer than 285
progeny of ‘Peace’ exist, including 236 hybrid teas, 32 floribundas, 11
grandifloras, and 6 shrubs.
What a rose!
The World’s Biggest Rose Plant
The ‘Tombstone’ rose, a single Lady Banks’ rose growing in Tombstone,
Arizona, was originally planted in 1885. It now covers over 720 square metres
(8,000 square feet) and has a trunk that is approximately 2.4 metres (95 inches)
in diameter. It is listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world’s
largest rose plant.
Build It and They Will Come
Empress Josephine, wife of France’s Napoleon I, put together probably the
world’s most famous, if not most important, rose garden at her imperial
chateau, Malmaison. In 1798, she started collecting every species and natural
hybrid of rose she could find. Plants came from all over the world until she
had a collection of about 250 rosebushes.
Visitors who saw the great garden were stunned. At once, the great diversity
in the rose family was plainly visible, and people saw the possibilities of new
varieties and types. Soon there were new hybrids galore, heralding the era of
modern roses to come.

The Hangover Rose?
Roses have a long history as medicinal and perfume plants. Rose oils were
used to treat everything from eye problems to wrinkled skin to hangovers. As
far back as the 13th century, the apothecary’s rose, Rosa gallica officinalis,
was widely used to make perfume and medicine in the French town, Provins.
Eventually, the apothecary’s rose became a symbol for modern pharmacology.

all-American tradition on New Year’s Day. It got its start in 1890 as a celebration
of California’s mild winter climate, where roses can still bloom in January.
The founders of the Tournament of Roses, as the day’s events are called,
created a floral festival patterned after the Battle of the Flowers held in Nice,
France. Initially, the Tournament was a modest procession of flower-covered
carriages. The afternoon “games” included foot races, tug-of-war contests,
and sack races.
Today, the Rose Parade features animated floral floats, high-stepping eques-
trian units, and precision marching bands and is viewed by an estimated
425 million people worldwide. In the afternoon, the championship collegiate
football teams of the Pac-10 and the Big Ten conferences meet for a gridiron
showdown in the Granddaddy of Them All (a trademarked name, no less), the
Rose Bowl.
‘Tournament of Roses’, the pink grandiflora rose, was named to celebrate the
100th anniversary of the Tournament of Roses.
The Canadian Heritage Rose Garden
Rideau Hall, the home of Canada’s Governor General, is the site of a unique
rose garden commemorating Canada’s heritage. Open to the public, this
garden has 260 specific rose species and varieties in 11 different garden areas.
These roses were chosen to represent all of Canada’s immigrant populations
as well as the aboriginal peoples. The granite columns flanking the garden are
inscribed with the histories of each of the native and immigrant communities
that built this country. Constructed with private funds, this heritage rose
garden is the only one of its kind in the world.

Part V: The Part of Tens

Provincial Roses
Only one province in Canada uses the rose as its provincial emblem. And the
winner is . . . Alberta.
You have to understand that we aren’t saying that Albertans are either “wild”
or “prickly” but that’s what their rose is.
The wild rose or prickly rose (Rosa acicularis) was adopted as the provincial
emblem in 1930. It is a hardy rose found throughout much of northern Canada
but particularly in Alberta. A spiny shrub rose with a delicate scent, it
presents a single flush of pink flowers (variable from light to dark pink) in
July. You can make a wonderful jam from the rose hips too.
Hmmm, nice fragrance, great sweet jam, but prickly and wild. Who does that
remind you of?

ecause you’re having so much fun growing roses,
you’re going to need more of them. So in this part,
we show you how to increase your supply without having
to visit a nursery — by buying roses through the mail or
even via the Internet! Now that’s fun. Of course, we also
supply you with a list of Canadian rose growers so that you
can visit their nurseries in person, if you’re happier seeing
roses up close and personal rather than on a catalogue
page. And you can ﬁnd contact information on provincial
agriculture ofﬁces, soil-testing facilities, and “bug stations”
to help you identify and conquer your rose gardening
challenges. Here’s also where you can discover how to
access online rose articles and newsgroup discussions,
and how to join rose societies across the country.

Appendix A
Rose Societies and Newsletters
W
ith such widespread love for the rose as a flower and a plant, it’s no
surprise that people get together to share their experiences. Joining a
rose society is a great way to meet people with similar interests and a fantastic
way to get information about growing roses, particularly on a local level.
Canadian Rose Society
If you are falling in love with this wonderful plant, there is no better way to
learn and meet fellow enthusiasts than to join the Canadian Rose Society.
This will open the door to meeting rose enthusiasts in your province as well.
The Canadian Rose Society produces several publications, including the
following:
  The Rose Annual contains full colour pictures of new and interesting
roses as well as informative articles on the techniques of growing and
showing roses in Canada.
  The Rosarian magazine is published three times a year, giving current
developments in the world of roses and practical tips on rose growing. It
also serves as a way for members to communicate with each other.
Benefits of membership include the opportunity to consult rose experts who
can answer your questions, and a book-lending library that operates by mail
to give you access to all the books on rose growing that you’ll ever want or
need to read. A large slide collection on roses is available to members for an
evening’s entertainment or to show during lectures or seminars. A special
added bonus of membership is getting access to other member’s gardens.
These private rose gardens (some quite spectacular) are only open to other
members and not the public.
To join the Canadian Rose Society write to them at 10 Fairfax Crescent,
Scarborough, Ontario M1L 1Z8 or call 416-757-8809 or fax 416-757-4796 or visit
their Web site at www.mirror.org/groups/crs/index.html (membership
is only $25.00 /year).

Local Rose Societies across Canada
For something a little closer to home, you should try contacting these local
rose societies, which are happy to receive new members:
Don’t Forget Our Friends in the U.S.A.
We would be remiss if we didn’t mention the American Rose Society (ARS).
Founded in 1899, the ARS is a huge resource that should not be ignored by
Canadian rose fanciers. They produce a yearly American Rose Annual as well
as a monthly magazine, The American Rose. Like the Canadian society, they
have many resources for members, including consulting rosarians to solve
problems, annual garden visits, get-togethers, and trial gardens. A Canadian
membership costs $42 (payable in U.S. funds only).
For information on the American Rose Society, write to them at Box 30,000,
Shreveport, LA, 71130-0030, or call them at 318-938-5402.
Take a look at their Web site at www.ars.org/ for more details.

Newsletters
Harry McGee writes a newsletter every second month about rose growing in
Canada. Called The Rosebank Letter, after his own garden’s name, this is an
excellent resource for Canadian gardeners.
The newsletter varies in size (he guarantees 10 pages but it’s usually larger
than that) and is Harry’s way of helping out the Canadian rose-growing
community rather than a money-making venture. For only $15 a year, you can
learn all about the newest roses, the oldest roses, and what roses are doing
well in various parts of the country. This is practical information written by a
practical gardener and other gardening authors.
You can subscribe by sending a cheque for $15 (payable to Rosecom). Mail it
along with your complete address to Rosecom, 41 Outer Drive, London, ON
N6P 1E1.
Visit Harry’s Web site at www.mirror.org/people/harry.mcgee/rosebank.

the newsletter. You can reach him by e-mail at rosecom@lonet.ca.

Where to Find Roses, Information,
and More in Canada
S
o many catalogues, so many roses — so little time. You can find more
plants represented in these Canadian mail-order and online catalogues
than any gardener needs to grow. Ah, but wants to grow — that’s another
matter.
You’ll be able to find most of the good beginner roses, such as the Dream and
Explorer series, at your local garden centre. But when you branch out and
start growing harder-to-find varieties, you’ll need some of these sources. A few
of the nurseries in this list do not provide retail services but will refer you to
other garden supply merchants where you can purchase their roses. If you
want to place a special order with your local garden centre, it helps to know
the source of the rose you want. We collect many of the catalogues in this list
just because they’re fun to browse through on a winter’s evening. They’re
cheap dreams.
