Sperm and Hormone Production

Spermatogenesis occurs in the testes. 
 
Spermatogonia (stem cells) can divide continuously throughout the life 
of the male.

Leydig Cells 
secrete testosterone 
secrete DHT (dihydrotestosterone, contain 5-a-
reductase) (for 2° male characteristics) 
 
Sertoli Cells 
make androgen binding protein 
convert testosterone to estrogen

FSH initiates sperm differentiation.  
 
Testosterone needed to mature the sperm. 
 
Number of sperm in semen (200-400 million/5ml) 
depends on proliferation rate and frequency of 
ejaculation.  
 
<20 million sperm/ml = infertile! 
 
Maturation = 90 days. 
 
Capacitation requires contact with female oviduct 
epithelium.  
Sperm Production 

Androgens 
Testosterone is responsible for gonadotropin (GnRH) feedback, 
spermatogenesis and embryonic differentiation.  
 
Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is most important for external 
virilization and secondary sexual characteristics.  
 
Steroids delivered by carrier in the blood. Act by changing gene 
expression (activate transcription). 
 
Anabolic actions (promoting increased muscle mass). 
 
Excess testosterone can decrease the size of the testes and 
decrease sperm count but will increase the size of the prostate.  

Androgen Dependent Tissues 
•
Seminal vesicles 
     - provide fructose rich liquid which is 60% of semen 
volume. 
 
•
Prostate 
 
- alkaline secretion provides 20% of semen volume 
      - enlarges under influence of DHT 
 
•
Secondary sex traits: inc. muscle mass, inc. facial 
hair, deep voice  

Estrogen & the Male Skeleton 
Bone expresses aromatase 
 
Estrogen and testosterone stimulate longitudinal growth of 
the skeleton. 
 
Estrogen induces epiphyseal growth plate closure at end of 
puberty.  
 
Males with estrogen receptor inactivation or aromatase 
inactivation have continual growth of skeleton.  
 

Key Concepts 
Local synthesis of testosterone is required for 
differentiation of sperm and embryonic sexual 
differentiation. DHT is most important for secondary 
sexual characteristics.  
 
At the end of puberty, estrogen acts at the epiphyseal 
plate to limit linear growth of the long bones.
