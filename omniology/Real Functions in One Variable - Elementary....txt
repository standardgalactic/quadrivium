Preface
Preface
In this volume I present some examples of Elementary Functions, cf. also Calculus 1a, Functions of
One Variable. Since my aim also has been to demonstrate some solution strategy I have as far as
possible structured the examples according to the following form
A Awareness, i.e. a short description of what is the problem.
D Decision, i.e. a reﬂection over what should be done with the problem.
I Implementation, i.e. where all the calculations are made.
C Control, i.e. a test of the result.
This is an ideal form of a general procedure of solution. It can be used in any situation and it is not
linked to Mathematics alone. I learned it many years ago in the Theory of Telecommunication in a
situation which did not contain Mathematics at all. The student is recommended to use it also in
other disciplines.
One is used to from high school immediately to proceed to I. Implementation. However, examples
and problems at university level are often so complicated that it in general will be a good investment
also to spend some time on the ﬁrst two points above in order to be absolutely certain of what to do
in a particular case. Note that the ﬁrst three points, ADI, can always be performed.
This is unfortunately not the case with C Control, because it from now on may be diﬃcult, if possible,
to check one’s solution. It is only an extra securing whenever it is possible, but we cannot include it
always in our solution form above.
I shall on purpose not use the logical signs. These should in general be avoided in Calculus as a
shorthand, because they are often (too often, I would say) misused. Instead of ∧I shall either write
“and”, or a comma, and instead of ∨I shall write “or”. The arrows ⇒and ⇔are in particular
misunderstood by the students, so they should be totally avoided. Instead, write in a plain language
what you mean or want to do.
It is my hope that these examples, of which many are treated in more ways to show that the solutions
procedures are not unique, may be of some inspiration for the students who have just started their
studies at the universities.
Finally, even if I have tried to write as careful as possible, I doubt that all errors have been removed.
I hope that the reader will forgive me the unavoidable errors.

Some Functions known from High School
Example 1.1 Diﬀerentiate each of the following functions:
1) y = ln(2x),
2) y = cos √x,
3) y = sin2 x,
4) y = sin

x2
,
5) y = x2 ex,
6) y = tan x
x
.
A. Simple diﬀerentiations.
D. Determine where the function is deﬁned and where it is diﬀerentiable. Then apply some well-
known rules of diﬀerentiation.
I. 1) The function y = ln(2x) is deﬁned and diﬀerentiable for x > 0. Since
ln(2x) = ln 2 + ln x,
we get
dy
dx = 1
x
for x > 0.

One should also check whether the function is diﬀerentiable from the right at x = 0, where
y = 1. The diﬀerence quotient is given by
ϕ(x) −ϕ(0)
x −0

x

2 + ε(x),
and we see that it converges towards −1

has a half tangent at x = 0+, ϕ′(0+) = −1

x
is deﬁned and diﬀerentiable at least when
x /∈{0} ∪
 π
2 + pπ
 p ∈Z

.
However, since both the numerator and the denominator are 0 for x = 0, we shall look closer
at this point.
a) When x ̸= 0 and x ̸= π
2 + pπ, p ∈Z, it follows from the rules of diﬀerentiation that
dy

1 + tan2 x

x2
= x + x tan2 x −tan x
x2
=
x cos2 x + x sin2 x −sin x cos x

b) When x = 0, we get by the continuity that
ϕ(0) = lim
x→0
tan x
x
= lim
x→0

cos x · sin x
x
= 1 · 1 = 1.
Then consider the diﬀerence quotient

x −0
=
tan x
x
−1
x −0
= tan x −x
x2
= x2ε(x)
x2
= ε(x),
which converges towards 0 for x →0. Here we have used that the numerator tan x −x is
an odd function, and that the Taylor expansion starts with 0 · x, so the ﬁrst true term is of
the form c · x3 = x2 ε(x). We therefore conclude that the function is continuously deﬁned
and also diﬀerentiable at x = 0 with the derivative ϕ′(0) = 0, which looks quite reasonable
when we consider the ﬁgure.

I. 1) Usually there are several possibilities of writing a programme in MAPLE. Personally I prefer
always to describe a function by using a parameter to describe the function. This may seem a
little complicated, but it is actually the best way of doing it. Here, I suggest in the ﬁrst case
that we use
plot([t,cos(2∗t),t=-4..4],x=-4..4,y=-1.2..1.2,
scaling=constrained,color=black);
2) The function is deﬁned for x < 0.
Here we also have several possibilities of the MAPLE
programme. My suggestion is
plot([t,ln(-t),t=-5..0],x=-5..1,y=-2..2,
scaling=constrained,color=black);
3) The function is deﬁned everywhere. By a reduction we get
y = ln (ex) = x,
so a simple MAPLE programme (which is not unique here either) is
plot([t,t,t=-1..1],scaling=constrained,color=black);

we can e.g. use the following MAPLE programme,

where we have cheated a little in order not to be troubled by the vertical line x = π

also be removed by the command discont=true). Notice that one can get more of the graph
by changing y=0..3 to e.g. y=0..4.

Example 1.3 Reduce the following expressions:
1) y = cos2 x + sin2 x,
2) y = cos2 x −sin2 x,
3) y = e−ln x,
4) y = ln (x ex) −ln x.
A. Reduction of simple mathematical expressions.
D. Determine the domain and then apply high school mathematics.
I. 1) It is obvious that the expression is deﬁned for every x ∈R and that
y = cos2 x + sin2 x = 1.
Remark. It is very important for an engineering student to know that (x, y) = (cos t, sin t),
t ∈R, is a parametric description of the unit circle, run through inﬁnitely often. The most
important movements are the straight movements and the circular movements. ♦
2) It should also be well-known that
y = cos2 x −sin2 x = cos 2x,
for every x ∈R.
3) The function y = e−ln x is deﬁned when ln x is deﬁned, i.e. for x > 0. In this case we get
y = e−ln x = 1
x,
for x > 0.
Remark. The trap is of course that one should believe that the function is deﬁned if only
x ̸= 0. This is not true because we have not deﬁned the logarithm of a negative number. ♦
4) The function y = ln(ex) −ln x is deﬁned for x > 0. In that case we have
y = ln (x ex) −ln x = ln x + ln (ex) −ln x = x,
for x > 0.

y = tan x.

Example 1.5 For the two angles u and v we introduce the vectors
e = (cos u, sin u)
and
f = (cos v, sin v).
We can express the scalar product of e and f in two ways: Either by means of coordinates, or by taking
the length of e multiplied by the length (positive or negative) of the projection of f onto the direction
deﬁned by e. Apply this to prove an addition formula for trigonometric functions.

I. In rectangular coordinates the scalar product of the two vectors is given by
e · f
=
(cos u, sin u) · (cos v, sin v)
=
cos u · cos v + sin u · sin v.
The angle between the vectors e and f calculated from e towards v is given by v −u, hence the
projection of the unit vector f onto the direction given by e is cos(v −u).
By an identiﬁcation we therefore get
cos(v −u) = cos u · cos v + sin u · sin v.

If we in this formula replace u by −u, we get
cos(v + u) = cos u · cos v −sin u · sin v.
Example 1.6 For two angles u and v we introduce the vectors
e = (cos u, sin u)
and
f = (cos v, sin v).
Prove an addition formula for trigonometric functions by ﬁrst calculating the scalar product ˆe · f in
two ways: Either by means of rectangular coordinates, or by taking the product of the length of one of
the vectors and the signed length of the projection of the second vector onto the direction of the ﬁrst
one.

I. When e = (cos u, sin u), we get
ˆe = (−sin u, cos u),
(interchange the coordinates and then change the sign on the ﬁrst coordinate). Then the inner
product becomes
ˆe · f = (−sin u, cos u) · (cos v, sin v) = cos u · sin v −sin u · cos v.
On the other hand, the signed angle between ˆe and f is given by v −u −π

When these two expressions are identiﬁed we get
sin(v −u) = sin v · cos u −cos v · sin u.
Finally, when u is replaced by −u we get
sin(u + v) = sin u · cos v + cos u · sin v,

A. Three nonlinear equations in three unknowns.
D. Apply the logarithm on all three equations and solve the new equations.
I. Since 128 = 27 and 8 = 23 and 1024 = 210, we get by taking the logarithm of the three given
equations that
⎧
⎨
⎩
(r + s) ln a
=
7 ln 2,
(r −s) ln a
=
3 ln 2,
rs ln a
=
10 ln 2.
It follows from the ﬁrst two equations by an addition and a subtraction, etc. that

r ln a = 5 ln 2,
s ln a = 2 ln 2.
When these expressions are inserted into the last equation we get
10 ln 2 = rs ln a = s(r ln a) = s · 5 ln 2,
i.e. s = 2;
10 ln 2 = rs ln a = r(s ln a) = r · 2 ln 2.
i.e. r = 5.
Finally, it follows e.g. from r ln a = 5 ln 2 and r = 5 that ln a = ln 2, thus a = 2. Hence we have
found that
a = 2,
r = 5,
s = 2.
C. Check. When a = 2 and r = 5 and s = 2, we get by insertion into the original equations that
ar+s
=
25+2
=

=
128,
ar−s
=
25−2
=
23
=
8,
ars
=

=

=

We see that all three equations are fulﬁlled.

When we divide the latter equation into the former equation, we get

Since r > 0 according to the assumptions, we get

hence

As a conclusion the solution is

1) By applying rule III twice and at the last equality using rule I we get
ln

ar+s
=
(r + s) ln a = r ln a + s ln a
=
ln (ar) + ln (as) = ln (ar · as) .
Since ln is one-to-one, we get by the exponential that
ar+s = ar · as.
2) Analogously we get by applying the rules III, I, III, I that
ln ((ab) r)
=
r · ln(ab) = r{ln a + ln b} = r ln a + r ln b
=
ln (ar) + ln (br) = ln (ar · br) .
Since ln is one-to-one we get by the exponential that
(ab)r = arbr.
3) Finally we get by using rule III at every equality sign that
ln ((ar)s) = s ln (ar) = rs ln a = ln (ars) .
Since ln is one-to-one we get by the exponential that
(ar)s = ars.
Example 1.13 Given a positive number a and a natural number n. Then an can be deﬁned in two
ways: Either as the product of a with itself n times, or by an = en ln a. Explain why the two deﬁnitions
give the same result.
A. Two apparently diﬀerent deﬁnitions should give the same.
D. Use the rules of the logarithm.
I. Since
ln(ab) = ln a + ln b
for a, b > 0,
we get for b = a,
ln

a2
= ln(a · a) = 2 ln a,
hence the claim is true for n = 1 and for n = 2, where a > 0 is any number. This indicates that
we should try
Induction. Assume that
ln (an) = n ln a
for some n ∈N.
This assumption has been proved to be true for n = 1 and for n = 2.

Then we get for the successor,
ln

an+1
= ln (an · a) = ln (an) + ln a = n ln a + ln a = (n + 1) ln a,
and we conclude that the formula follows by induction.
We have now proved that
ln (an) = n ln a = ln

en ln a
.
Since ln : R+ →R is bijective, we have
an = a · · · a = en ln a,
and it follows that the two deﬁnitions agree for every n ∈N.
Example 1.14 Investigate in each of the following cases if the claim is correct or wrong:
1) (xy)z = xyz,
2) xy = ey ln x,
3) ln(a −b) = ln a
ln b ,
4) xy+z = xy + xz,
5) sin(x + y) = sin x + sin y,

A. The formulation of this example is on purpose very sloppy, because this is more or less how the
students’ exercises are formulated without any “proof”. We shall ﬁnd out if some given “formulæ’
are correct or not. The solutions will not be too meticulous, because that would demand a lot
more.
D. If one of the formulæ is correct, it should of course be proved, and its domain should be speciﬁed.
If some formula is wrong, one should give a counterexample. This part is a little tricky because the
formula may be right for carefully chosen x, y and z. In particular, one cannot give some general
guidelines for how to do it.

I. 1) The claim is in general wrong. If we e.g. choose x = y = z = 2, we get
(xy)z = (2 · 2)2 = 16,
xyz = 2 · 22 = 8 ̸= 16 = (xy)z.
Notice however that the formula is correct if z = 1, or if x = 1 (or x = 0).
2) The claim is true for x > 0.
3) The claim is wrong. First notice that its potential domain is given by 0 < b < a. If we here
e.g. choose b = a −1 for any a > 1, we get
ln(a −b) = ln 1 = 0
and
ln a
ln b ̸= 0, when b ̸= 1.
4) The claim is wrong. Choosing e.g. x = y = z = 1, we get
xy+z = 11+1 = 1
and
xy + xz = 11 + 11 = 2 ̸= 1 = xy+z.
It follows by continuity that the formula is not correct in some open domain containing (1, 1, 1).
5) The claim is wrong. If we choose x = y = π
2 we get
sin(x + y) = sin π = 0
and
sin x + sin y = 1 + 1 = 2 ̸= 0 = sin(x + y).

6) The claim is wrong when both a ̸= 0 and b ̸= 0. In fact,
(a + b)2 = a2 + b2 + 2ab,
and we see that the additional term 2ab ̸= 0, when a ̸= 0 and b ̸= 0.
Remark. A very frequent error made by the students is to put (a+b)2 equal to a2 +b2, which
is not correct. ♦
7) The claim is wrong. The left hand side sin v is an odd function ̸= 0, and the right hand side is
an even function ̸= 0. The only function, which is both odd and even is 0.
8) This claim is correct for α ̸= −1. In fact,

1) When y = x, we get by the rules of calculations that
cos 2x
=
cos(x + x) = cos x · cos x −sin x · sin x
=
cos2 −sin2
=
cos2 x −(1 −cos2 x) = 2 cos2 x −1

2) Analogously,
sin 2x = sin(x + x) = sin x · cos x + cos x · sin x = 2 sin x · cos x.
Example 1.16 Let x0(t) be the solution of the diﬀerential equation
dx
dt + 2x = a,
for which
x(0) = 5
and
x(t) →100
for t →∞.
Find x0(t).
Does there exist a solution x(t), for which
x(t) →∞
for t →∞?
A. A linear, inhomogeneous diﬀerential equation of ﬁrst order.
D. Start by ﬁnding the complete solution.
Even though it is possible here to apply the solution
formula, we shall choose the variant, in which one multiplies by the integrating factor e2t and
reduces.
I. When the equation is multiplied by e2t, we get
a e2t = e2t dx
dt + 2e2t · x = d
dy

e2t x

,
hence by an integration,
e2tx = a
2 e2t + c,
dvs.
x = a
2 + c · e−2t.
When the conditions are inserted into the complete solution we get
x(0) = 5 = a
2 + c
and
x(t) →a
2 = 100
for t →∞,
hence a = 200 and c = −95. The searched solution is then
x0(t) = a
2 + c · e−2t = 100 −95 · e−2t.
Finally, since
x(t) = a
2 + c · e−2t →a
2
t →∞,
there does not exist any solution for which x(t) →∞for t →∞.

The latter formula is preferred in high school and it is also mostly found in tables. However, the
former formula is in practice often more convenient to use. It is derived by considering the quotient
f(x)
g(x) = f(x) ·
1
g(x)
as a product, where
d
dx

1
g(x)

= −g′(x)
g(x)2 .
This product is again obtained by composing h(y) = 1
y and g(x) to H(x) = h(g(x)), then apply
the rule of diﬀerentiation of a composite function, and that h′(y) = −1
y2 .
Remark 1. The reason why
(1)
d
dx
f(x)
g(x)

= f ′(x)
g(x) −f(x) · g′(x)
g(x)2
often is more convenient to use is that the ﬁrst term f ′(x)
g(x) is simpler than the corresponding term
f ′(x)g(x)
g(x)2
in the formula known from high school. The preference in most places of this high school
formula is due to the fact that it is more “symmetric” than (1), thus easier to remember. ♦
1) A diﬀerentiation of y = x · ln x −x gives by the rule above that
dy
dx = 1 · ln x + x · 1
x −1 = ln x.
Remark 2. From this we also derive the important result,

ln x dx = x · ln x −x.
♦
2) A diﬀerentiation of y = 2 sin x · cos x = sin 2x gives by the rule of calculation above that
dy
dx = 2 · cos2 x −2 · sin2 x = 2 cos 2x,
which can also be found directly by a rewriting.
3) Putting f(x) = 1 and g(x) = x we get
dy
dx = −1
x2 .
Remark 3. This is actually a circular argument. We have above assumed this rule when we
derived this result! In the correct proof one has to go back to the diﬀerence quotient (where
we assume that x ̸= 0 and x + Δx ̸= 0),

Example 2.4 Check in each of the following cases whether the formula is correct or wrong. If it is
wrong, then correct the right hand side, such that the formula becomes correct.
1) cosh 2x = 2 cosh2 x + 1, x ∈R.
2) (cosh x + sinh x)n = cosh nx + sinh nx, x ∈R, n ∈N.
3) sinh 2x = cosh2 x + sinh2 x, x ∈R.

A. Check some formulæ. Look in particular for obvious errors. We shall always assume that the left
hand side is given.
D. Apply if possible the deﬁnitions.
I. 1) The ﬁrst claim is clearly wrong. In fact, choose x = 0. Then cosh 2x = 1 and 2 cosh2 x + 1 =
3 ̸= 1.
In order to get the correct expression we apply the deﬁnition of cosh on the left hand side.

3) This claim is wrong. The left hand side is an odd function, and the right hand side is even.
The only function which is both odd and even is zero, so the two expressions do not agree.
Apply the deﬁnition of sinh on the left hand side in order to get the correct formula,

A. Find the inverse function of a given function in some interval.
D. For given y, solve the equation with respect to x. Do not forget to indicate the corresponding
y-interval (the domain of the inverse function).
I. From
y = x2 + 4x −8 = x2 + 4x + 4 −12 = (x + 2)2 −12,
follows that
(x + 2)2 = y + 12 ≥0,
from which we get the condition y ≥−12.

A. Inverse functions.
D. Find the domain and the range and then the inverse function.
I. 1) Let y = xα, x > 0, y > 0 and α ∈R.
a) If α = 0, then we only get y = x0 = 1, which is not strictly monotonous and the inverse
function does not exist.
b) If α ̸= 0, then y = xα is strictly monotonous (increasing for α > 0 and decreasing for
α < 0), so the inverse function exists. We ﬁnd this inverse function by raising the equation

b) If instead a ∈R+ \ {1}, we get by taking the logarithm,

x ∈R,
y > 0,
a ∈R+ \ {1}.

This shows that ψ(x) is strictly increasing for every x ∈R, hence the inverse function x = ϕ(y)
exists.
We see by inspection that if x = 1, then y = ψ(1) = 4, and since the function ψ : R →R maps R
bijectively onto itself, we conclude that y = 4 also corresponds uniquely to x = 1. Since
y = ψ(x) = ψ(ϕ(y)),
we get by a diﬀerentiation with respect to y of the composite function that
1 = ψ′(x) · ϕ′(y),

1) Write the formula for the derivative of the function y = F(x) = f(g(x)).
2) Write the formula for the derivative of the function x = f −1(y).
3) Write the formula for the inverse function x = F −1(y) of the function in (1).
4) Write the formula for the derivative of the function x = F −1(y).
A. Formulæ for derivatives of inverse functions.
D. Apply the rule of diﬀerentiation of a composite function.
I. 1) This formula is well-known,

2) If x = f

to the end points of the interval. The correspondence is given by x = f(y) = cos y, where
f ′(y) = −sin y = −

Example 4.2 1) For which x ∈R is it true that

2) For which x ∈R is it true that
cos(Arccos x) = x?
A. Find the domains of two formulæ.
D. Check the deﬁnition, the domain and the range for the given functions.
I. We know that Arccos is deﬁned by
y = cos x
⇔
x = Arccos y,
when x ∈[0, π] and y ∈[−1, 1].
1) Let x ∈[0, π], and put y = cos x ∈[−1, 1]. Then
x = Arccos y = Arccos(cos x),
x ∈[0, π].
Since Arccos(cos x) ∈[0, π], we conclude that the formula is never right, when x /∈[0, π]. Hence,
the formula is correct, if and only if x ∈[0, π].
2) The left hand side is only deﬁned when x ∈[−1, 1]. In this case we put y = Arccos x ∈[0, π].
When x and y are exchanged in the correspondence above, we get
x = cos y = cos(Arccos x),
for x ∈[−1, 1].

On the other hand, the claim is correct, when y ∈

Example 4.4 Prove that
Arcsin(cos x) = π
2 −x,
x ∈[0, π].
What is the corresponding formula for x ∈[−π, 0]?
A. Prove one given formula, and derive another one.
D. Since the functions are deﬁned and continuously diﬀerentiable for x ∈]0, π[, it is suﬃcient to show
that they have the same derivative everywhere, and that they agree in just one point.
Perform a similar analysis for x ∈[−π, 0].
Here we can produce an alternative solution.
I. 1) Both Arcsin(cos x) and π
2 −x are continuous for x ∈[0, π], and sin x ≥0 in this interval. For
x = π
2 we get
Arcsin

cos π

hence the functions agree at the point x = π

Both functions are of class C∞, when x ∈]0, π[. and we see that

.
By an integration we see that the two functions only diﬀer from each other by a constant, and
since we have shown above that the constant is 0, the formula follows by continuity at the end
points.

By an integration we therefore get

Example 4.7 Guess two solutions of the diﬀerential equation
d2x
dt2 + a2x = 0.
Then guess two solutions of the diﬀerential equation
d2x
dt2 = a2x.
A. Solve linear and homogeneous diﬀerential equations of second order by qualiﬁed guessing.
D. Which functions are carried over into themselves, apart form a constant, when we diﬀerentiate
twice?
I. It is well-known that
d2
dt2 cos at = −a2 cos at,
d2
dt2 sin at = −a2 sin at,
and that
d2
dt2 cosh at = a2 cosh at,
d2
dt2 sinh at = a2 sinh at.
This implies that x = cos at and x = sin at both satisfy the linear and homogeneous diﬀerential
equation
d2x
dt2 + a2x = 0.
Since cos at and sin at are linearly independent, and the structure of the solution contains precisely
two arbitrary constants, we conclude that the complete solution is given by
x = c1 cos at + c2 sin at,
t ∈R,
c1, c2 ∈R arbitrary constants.
Similarly we see that x = cosh at and x = sinh at are both linearly independent solutions of the
diﬀerential equation
d2x
dt2 = a2x,
hence this equation has the complete solution
x = c1 cosh at + c2 sinh at,
t ∈R,
c1, c2 ∈R arbitrary constanter.
Remark 1. We have implicitly above assumed that a > 0 (or just a ̸= 0). For completeness we
mention that if a = 0, then the complete solution is
x = c1 + c2t,
which follows from two to successive integrations of
d2x
dt2 = 0.

Example 4.8 First prove that if y = Arctan x, then
1 −cos2 y
cos2 y
= x2.
Then ﬁnd an algebraic expression for cos(Arctan x), x ∈R. (An algebraic expressions contains only
power functions, root functions and the four basic operations of calculus.)
A. We shall reduce a formula to an algebraic expression. To that end there is given a hint.
D. The hint is proved by some simple geometry. Then apply this formula in order to ﬁnd an algebraic
expression for cos(Arctan x).
I. Let y = Arctan x ∈

−π
2 , π

for x ∈R. Then cos y > 0, and
1 −cos2 y
cos2 y
= sin2 y
cos2 y = tan2 y = tan2(Arctan x) = x2,
and we have proved the formula.
It follows from this formula that
1 + x2 =
1
cos2 y =
1
cos2(Arctan x).
Since cos y > 0, we get
cos(Arctan x) = +

1 + x2 ,
x ∈R.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Figure 26: The graph of f(x) = Arccos(cos(x)).
I. 1) The function Arccos y is deﬁned for y ∈[−1, 1]. Since y = cos x ∈[−1, 1] for every x ∈R, the
domain of f is the whole of R.
The range of Arccos y is [0, π]. Since
cos(−x) = cos x
and
cos(2pπ + x) = cos x,
p ∈Z,
we get f(x) = |x| for x ∈[−π, π], continued periodically with the period 2π.
2) The maximal domain of g(x) is [−1, 1], and in this interval we have
cos(Arccos x) = x,

Since f(0) = 0, we get
0 < f(x) = x −Arctan x
for x > 0,
(and 0 > f(x) = x−Arctan x for x < 0), hence by a rearrangement,
Arctan x < x
for x > 0.
3) It follows from (2) that
0 > x −Arctan x
for x < 0,
i.e.
Arctan x > x
for x < 0.
4) Let y ∈

A. Derivation of some formulæ.
D. 1) Show that the derivative is x ̸= 0.
2) Check the domain once more.
3) Find a simple expression for a similar function.
I. 1) Obviously, f(x) is deﬁned and diﬀerentiable for x ̸= 0. When we diﬀerentiate for x ̸= 0 we get

2) The domain R−∪R+ is not an interval. For x = 1 we get

4 = 0.
For x = −1 we get
f(−1) = Arctan(−1) −Arccot(−1) = −π

4 = −π.
Thus we conclude that
f(x) = Arctan 1
x −Arccot x =

0,
for x > 0,
−π,
for x < 0.
This is not a contradiction, because the union R−∪R+ is not an interval.

Example 4.17 Hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, is an unstable chemical connection, which decomposes ac-
cording to the reaction equation
(3) 2 H2O2 −→O2 + 2 H2O.
1. The equation (3) implies that the concentration x of H2O2 in a given solution satisﬁes the diﬀer-
ential equation
dx
dt = −k x2,
x > 0,
t ≥0.
Find the concentration x in a solution where x(0) = c0 and c0 > 0.
We then add a constant stream of a sulﬁte solution to the original solution, where the sulﬁte and the
hydrogen peroxide immediately react according to the equation
(4) SO2−
3
+ H2O2 −→SO2−
4
+ H2O.
If we add V mol SO2−
3
per second, then x(t) satisﬁes the diﬀerential equation
dx
dt = −V −k x2,
x ≥0,
t ≥0.
2. Find x(t), when x(0) = c0, where c0 > 0.
3. Find the time T (expressed by V , k and c0), when all H2O2 in the solution has been spent, and
show that T →+∞for V →+∞for V →0+, where k and c0 are ﬁxed constants.
A. Mathematical models.
The real task is to solve two diﬀerential equations.
In both cases the
variables can be separated.
D. 1) Solve the equation by the method of separation.
2) Discuss the reasonableness of the equation, and then solve it.
3) Find T from the solution of (2), where x(T) = 0. Show that
lim
v→0+ T = +∞.
I. 1) When we divide the equation by −x2 ̸= 0 we get
−1
x2
dx
dt = d
dt
 1
x

= k,
hence by an integration,
1
x = kt + c.
If t = 0, then x = c0, so c = 1
c0
, and the solution is given by
x(t) =
1
kt + 1
c0
=
c0
c0kt + 1,
x > 0,
t ≥0.

2) When we add V > 0 mol SO2−
3
per second, we also remove V mol H2O2 per second, so dx
dt is
furthermore diminished by V . This argument gives us the equation

A. Here we shall see that the solution method is far from unique. I shall give a lot of variants.
The task is to prove a formula for an inverse function.
D. Analysis. The left hand side is not deﬁned for x = 0. The standard method is now to show that
the two expressions for x ̸= 0 have the same derivative, thus they agree apart from a constant.
Then by checking the values in some point x < 0 and another one x > 0 we show that the constant
is 0 in both cases.
Alternatively one may start by analyzing the function ψ(x) = 1

cosh t dt = 2 ln cosh t = ln cosh2 t,
it follows that cosh2 t is a solution of the corresponding homogeneous equation. Then a partic-

{1 + cosh t} dt = (t + sinh t) · cosh2 t.
The complete solution is

When we add y2 + 1 we get after a small rearrangement,
(ex)2 −2y ex + y2 = (ex −y)2 = y2 + 1.
Thus by taking the square root,
ex =


y2 + 1
 .
Since y <

y2 + 1 for every y we must have
ex = y +

y2 + 1 > 0,

Example 5.2 Calculate the integral
 √
1 + x2 dx.
A. An integral.
D. The trick is to ﬁnd some monotonous function f(x), such that it becomes easy to calculate the
square root of 1 + f(x)2. Here we have at least two candidates,
(1) x = sinh t,
(2) x = tan t.
We shall treat both possibilities and learn that the calculations in the ﬁrst variant are much easier
to perform than the calculations in the second one.
I. First variant. Since 1 + sinh2 t = cosh2 t and x = sinh t is strictly increasing, we can choose this
as a monotonous substitution. The “unpleasant thing” is that the inverse function
t = Arsinh x = ln

x +

looks complicated. On the other hand,



1 + sinh2 t = cosh t
and
dx = cosh t dt,
are quite simple, and since
cosh 2t = cosh2 t + sinh2 t = 2 cosh2 t −1,
i.e.
cosh2 t = 1
2 (1 + cosh 2t),
we get the following calculation

Second variant. Alternatively (and it will soon be seen that this is somewhat more cumber-
some) we know that
1 + tan2 t =
1
cos2 t,
t ∈

−π
2 , π

,
which is of the desired structure. (The variant under consideration has been inspired by the
fact that most students at this stage the trigonometric functions will be more familiar with
them than with the hyperbolic functions, and it is well-known that one will always prefer to
choose the known cases ﬁrst.) Another possible monotonous substitution is therefore
x = tan t,
with the inverse function t = Arctan x,
where

1 + x2 =

1 + tan2 t = +

Example 5.3 1) Find directly the inverse function x = ϕ(y) of
y = tanh x,
x ∈R.
2) Find ϕ′(y), either by directly to diﬀerentiate ϕ(y), or by applying the theorem of diﬀerentiation of
an inverse function.
A. Find the inverse ϕ(y) of y = tanh x, and the derivative of ϕ(y).
D. 1) Apply the deﬁnition of tanh x and then solve with respect to x. Do not forget to specify the
range of y.
2) Calculate ϕ′(y) in the two indicated ways.

1 + e−x = tanh x = 1 −
1
e2x + 1 < 1,
where we can get as close to the two limits as we want, we conclude that y ∈] −1, 1[. In this
case we get

i.e.
e2x(1 −y) = y + 1,

Let f(x) = tanh x. Then we get alternatively that f ′(x) = 1 −tanh2 x > 0, and therefore

Example 5.4 A paratrooper of mass m jumps from the height h. We call the air resistance R, and
we denote the gravitation by g. The paratrooper’s vertical velocity is denoted by v(t).
According to Newton’s Second Law the equation for the paratrooper’s vertical velocity is
(5) m dv
dt = mg −R(v),
where R(v) is a function of v.
We assume that m = 90 kg. It is empirically known that the paratrooper’s velocity at the surface
of the Earth (no matter the initial height) is approximately 7 m/s. We shall here interpret this as
limt→+∞v(t) = 7.
We shall consider two diﬀerent models:
1) Assume that R is proportional to the velocity, i.e. R = C · v. Find the particular solution of (5),
for which v(0) = 0, sketch the graph of v(t) and ﬁnd the constant C.
2) Assume that R is proportional to the square of the velocity, i.e. R = c1v2.
a) First show that if k > 0 and g −kv2 > 0, then


.
b) Then ﬁnd in the present case the particular solution of (5), for which v(0) = 0. Sketch the
graph of v(t) and ﬁnd the constant c1.
A. We are given in advance a mathematical model (a diﬀerential equation of ﬁrst order where the
variables can be separated). We shall use this model in two special cases. There are given some
guidelines in both cases.
D. Follow the guidelines. Remember the two additional conditions v(0) = 0 and limt→+∞v(t) = 7.
I. 1) When R = C · v, we write (5) in the form
m dv
dt = mg −C · v,
where dv
dt > 0, i.e. mg −C · v > 0. Then 0 ≤v < mg
C .
By separation of the variables we get
