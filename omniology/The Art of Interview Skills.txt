About the author
Interview skills Client Testimonials:
Both of these clients had been unsuccessful in four medical Consultant interviews prior to my coaching:
“With Fiona’s help I was transformed from a sweaty, pale rabbit in the headlights interviewee to someone who 
could actually give a good answer to the questions and look comfortable and confident in the process. She 
allows you to practice answering questions so that you can safely remove the cloaks of British embarrassment, 
and finally learn to sing your own praises.
“Every session with Fiona helped me enormously, and I would thoroughly recommend her to anyone with 
an important interview coming up.” Peter
“The interview coaching was structured, made me focussed. The coaching was tailored to my needs and 
helped to correct my weaknesses. I had a hard time selling myself. You made me focus on selling my skills 
and abilities effectively.
I was feeling very confident which showed through the whole interview and helped me to secure the job. 
I would recommend everyone to have interview coaching with you before his or her dream job!” Frances

Introduction
1	 Introduction
“Find a job you like and you add five days to every week”
H. Jackson Brown Jnr.
We spend a large part of our lives working, so the more enjoyable your work is, the more you will enjoy 
life! The purpose of this book is to help you prepare for that all important interview that will get you 
the job that you want. Whether you are a new graduate entering the workplace for the first time, an 
experienced worker facing redundancy as part of an organisational restructure or thinking of applying 
for a promotion in your current job; this book will inform and inspire you to your future success.
Having had a successful first career in Nursing, I learned a very important lesson; 
“Life is an enquiry and then we die “or perhaps you are more familiar with the more common version 
“Life’s a bitch and then you die”. I came face to face with this when nursing young adults with life 
limiting illnesses. Not once did I ever meet someone as they faced the end of their life that said “I wish 
I had stayed in that job that I didn’t enjoy a bit longer…” in her book “The top five regrets of the dying” 
Bronnie Ware captures the reflections of people at the end of their lives. Their number one regret was:
“I wish I’d had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me”. 
Realising this helped me to change my career, despite the concerns of friends, colleagues and family, I 
knew that I wanted to transfer my gifts and talents into Learning and Development. 
Working in Staff development: designing training, coaching, mentoring opportunities for people, helping 
people to enjoy their work enables me to make a contribution in a different way from when I was a 
nurse. During my working life, I have been interviewed many times for a variety of jobs, I have also sat 
on Interview panels, run training courses on Interview skills for staff involved with Interviewing and 
currently one of the most rewarding aspects of my work is inspiring people with confidence, so that they 
shine at interviews and are successful getting the jobs that they really want!

Introduction
There are several exercises that you can complete to explore the issues that are involved in creating your 
own future success. The exercises are a great opportunity for you to draw on your previous experiences 
and integrate any learning that you bring from reflecting on these.
During the book you will be exploring:
•	 What is your current experience of interviews? Feedback that you have received about your 
performance at interviews and your own personal reflections.
•	 Reflecting on these experiences: what contributed to this experience? How did you prepare, 
were you last minute.com? How confident were you? Did you research the company 
sufficiently? The job specification – did you match the criteria?
•	 Evaluating the experience: Deepening your awareness and reflections on your previous 
experiences. Bringing in additional information such as personal style, any information that 
can help you make sense of the situation.
•	 Plan for next time: from focusing on your previous experience and what you have learned 
from working through this learning cycle, you will have started to formulate an action plan 
of how to approach your next interview.

Introduction
Paper and coloured pens are useful as life is rarely black and white; you may enjoy highlighting and 
illuminating your experiences.
One of my favourite films is “Dead Poets Society”, in which Robin Williams portrays a teacher who 
challenges conventional teaching methods. During one scene he asks his students to stand on their desks 
rather than sitting at them, to view the classroom from a different perspective.
Whilst I am not going to ask you to stand on any furniture I would like to invite you to think about how 
you can approach interviews differently.
1.4	
 You get what you focus on.
In life we get what we focus on. So if I ask you to not think of a blue elephant…whatever you do, do 
not think of a blue elephant…what happens?
I guarantee you will be thinking of a blue elephant, because the way our brains are wired, we have to 
think about or picture something before we can choose not to think of it…
How is that relevant to you and your interview?

Introduction
In my experience, most people focus on everything else but their own success; for example that the other 
candidates will have more knowledge, that they will not be able to answer the questions in enough depth 
and the most common worry “I won’t be able to sell myself”.
Preparation is the main ingredient in interview skills and by working through this book you will 
be creating a new focus for yourself that will enable you to present yourself with confidence at your 
next interview!
1.5	
Where to start?
So in the words of Julie Andrews’s character in The Sound of Music:
“Let’s start at the very beginning – it’s a really good place to start!”
Starting Point Exercise
This is a useful exercise to help focus you on what you would like.
1.	 Take a piece of A4 paper and number it down the left hand side. Number 0–100, in tens; 
imagine that this is decades of your life.
2.	 Mark where your current age is and tear off this section up to your age as this is the time 
that has already passed in your life.
3.	 Mark off the age when you think you would like to retire.
4.	 What have you got left?
Look at the remaining paper that you have…
1.	 What would you like to do with rest of your working life?
2.	 Why are you not doing it?
3.	 Where does the job that you are applying for fit into this? Important isn’t it, Ok let’s 
get cracking!!

Keys to Success
2	 Keys to Success 
“Before everything else, getting ready is the secret of success”
Henry Ford
2.1	
Confidence the essential ingredient.
Self confidence is an essential ingredient in the successful recipe for your interview success! What is 
self confidence? The origin of the word confidence is the Latin word confidere, which means to trust or 
have faith in. So to have self confidence means to approach what you are doing with faith in yourself 
and your abilities.
One of the most important contributions to your self confidence is the knowledge that you are sufficiently 
prepared. In his recently published book David Beckham describes how he prepared for a very important 
free kick in the 92nd minute of a 2001 match against Greece.
“Confidence is a funny thing; people often say that you need luck to win. But for me, confidence comes 
down to preparation. I took two deep breaths, eyed the corner of the net and emptied my mind of everything 
else except one thought “I am going to score”. There was one focus; there was no doubt in my mind, no 
negativity, just a sense of complete reassurance”. 
	
(David Beckham – The Illustrated Book, 2013)
2.2	
Prepare, Prepare, Prepare!
So the preparation was in three key parts:
1.	 The psychological preparation and choosing the right language “I emptied my mind of 
everything else except one thought I am going to score, no doubt in my mind”
2.	 The physical preparation of having practiced hundreds of free kicks during his career, taking 
two deep breaths, eying the corner of the net
3.	 The one focus “no doubt in my mind, no negativity, just one thought I am going to score”
This is an effective way of creating the right state and as football history unfolded David Beckham scored 
that goal in the 92nd minute taking England into the 2001 World Cup.

Keys to Success
2.3	
Creating the right state.
So translating this for your interview:
1.	 Choosing the right language: that you create a positive mantra about being well prepared, 
are answering the questions with ease and have practiced out loud so you have heard 
yourself answering questions.
2.	 Your physical preparation: what you are wearing, that you are well hydrated & energised, 
that your body language is open and you are relaxed, confident and smiling at the 
interviewing panel.
3.	 That you have the right focus: thorough preparation into the company that you are 
applying to work with, knowledge of the job from the job description and job specification, 
applying your experience and skills to match what they are looking for.
Creating the right state and achieving interview success
In this triangular model, having each side of the triangle working together will ensure that you have a 
really clear strategy on creating your future success.
 
Physiology
Open body language; smiling at the panel.
Wear what look, feels comfortable and you 
will feel confident wearing.
Being relaxed.
Being energised.
Language
Positive self talk, having practicing answers. 
Adapt what you are saying to their language and 
their job specification.
Focus
Knowledge of the role, organisation, your skills & experience.
Positive mental rehearsal – seeing yourself succeeding and answering the questions well.

Keys to Success
I am not suggesting that you go into your interview roaring like a lion! However how you see yourself at 
your interview has a big impact on your preparation. Positive mental rehearsal involves seeing yourself at 
the interview looking and sounding confident, seeing yourself answering the questions well and smiling.
In order to be able to achieve your goal of the successful interview; you need to be working on all three 
key areas as your preparation. 
It may help to label the 3 parts of the blank triangle below to help you focus on this.

“Pearls do not lie on the sea shore. If you desire one, you must dive for it”
(Oriental proverb)
3.1	
How to get an interview with a winning CV
The preparation can begin even before the job is advertised, having an up to date CV is a great starting 
point for any job application as it focuses you on your experiences. 
Tips on creating an effective CV:
•	 Choose a clear font such as Arial or Times New Roman, size 10 or 12. Bold your headings.
•	 Ensure your name, address, telephone number and email contact details are at the top of 
your first page. Think carefully about how your email address, telephone answering message 
come across as these are a potential employers first impression of you; they should be 
business like.
•	 Remember that your potential employer may have received 40–200 applications for one 
vacancy, so the Interview panel will skim read and match the CV experience with the job 
specification, so tailoring your CV to the job is essential to ensure you get an interview.
•	 Two pages as a basic CV with any extra adaptations if required. For example if you have alot 
of customer care experience that you would like to say more about have an extra page titled 
Profile of customer care experience. 
•	 Have a positive personal profile and key skills that represent you and your experience.
•	 Career summary: begin with your most recent work experience first.
•	 Avoid abbreviations and words that you wouldn’t normally use.
•	 Bullet points are an effective way of highlighting your achievements in work, university or 
voluntary work.
•	 Shine a light on your positive qualities, positive people are much more attractive to employers.

Preparing the key ingredients that  
contribute towards  your Interview success
•	 Make sure you have ensured your dates flow, if you changed jobs and had an extended holiday, 
make sure to write this down and what you gained from the experience, avoid gaps in dates.
•	 Write references available on request rather than waste valuable space with names, addresses.
•	 Beware your spell check as you may end up with the American spelling of words. 
•	 Get a friend, colleague to read through your completed CV.
•	 Be proud of your CV as it represents all of your personal and professional accomplishments; 
be prepared to talk about yourself through your CV.
Once you have created your CV, keep it up to date and you can add information that is relevant to a 
particular role. Make sure you are familiar with everything you have written about and that is a true 
representation of who you are. At a recent successful interview I was asked to talk through my CV and 
why I had made the career changes I had. An example of that CV is on the following page.

4	 Make it easy and get organised!
4.1	
Project – Your interview
When the job is advertised, or you locate a role in the local newspaper or on a website. There are a number 
of things that you can do to ensure you are as prepared as you can be.Occasionally an interview coaching 
client attends one of my workshops or coaching sessions with a jumbled pile of information, in which 
somewhere is their CV, application form, job description, company information, an old presentation…
The first thing I suggest to them is that they start treating their job searching as a project and get organised!
Printing out important information in paper format and filing it in a file that is organised so you can 
access it with ease. If you enjoy stationary, invest in an A4 file that you will feel inspired to focus on, 
perhaps in your favourite colour and also some extra wide dividers so you can be organised with the 
information. For one job application you may have the following headings:
•	 Copy of Advert, with key words highlighted
•	 Job description & job specification 
•	 CV adapted for role
•	 Information about the company 
•	 Copy of application form, covering letter
•	 A record of any conversations that you may have had with the company or recruitment 
agency so you are clear about who said what, dates etc.
When you are this organised, if you are unsuccessful at your interview you have all the information to 
hand when you next need it, which will save you time.
4.2	
 Further research to assist your interview preparation
Other factors to take into consideration whilst getting yourself organised during your preparation:
•	 You are likely to be using several different methods of career hunting such as online 
advertisements, company websites, newspaper adverts and recruitment agency. It is vitally 
important to keep a record of who you have said what to, applied with.
•	 When you receive the information, if it is a paper copy, photocopy the application form and 
put in your project file, so that when you complete it, it is clean. Always photocopy a copy 
before you send it, so you have an accurate record of what you said.
•	 Check the details of the time frame of the application and interview process; an online 
application will require you to plan your time completing your form online, some 
companies give you up to 90 minutes to complete an online application form before having 
to access their portal again. 
•	 Find out as much as you can about the organisation, their website, arrange an informal visit 
if it is possible so you can see for yourself what the environment is like.

Make it easy and get organised!
I was once applying for a job as a Nurse Facilitator within an emerging Health Care Company, what I 
hadn’t realised was that my new working environment would be within a Call Centre. The person who I 
spoke to on the phone about the job assured me that it would not be possible to have an informal visit, so 
I asked them to describe the working environment and when they described the environment; I was able 
to make my mind up about applying for the job and save myself a lengthy application process. Sometimes 
the process of applying for another job can make you appreciate where you are currently working.
4.3	
The Informal Visit 
If you are applying for a role where this is available, I suggest that you make the effort to attend if possible 
as this is demonstrating that you are interested in the role. Remember that you are presenting yourself 
at any informal contact that you make with your potential employer, so be professional. 
Tips for an Informal visit:
•	 If information is available on their company website make sure that you have read about 
the company first, their general information and if they have a careers section, so that when 
someone is talking about it, you look and sound interested.
•	 Dress smartly and professionally.
•	 Your interview process has started as you walk through the office doors as the person 
showing you around will have an opinion on the candidates.
•	 Make sure all electronic items are switched off.
•	 Smile and listen to what the person talking to you is saying, keep eye contact.
•	 Accept any information pack / leaflet they have to offer you, even if you have alot of 
online information. The member of staff will probably have put alot of time and effort into 
preparing their role facilitating this informal visit.
•	 Have a positive statement about yourself ready for when asked what you are doing now and 
why you are seeking this change of job.
•	 Sit down directly after the informal visit and write down your immediate thoughts, 
reflections and any concerns that you have from the experience. This will be very useful 
information when you come to preparing your interview questions.
If an informal visit is not possible, is there anything else you could do? 
For example if I was applying for Seasonal work at Marks and Spencer or Tesco I would go to one of the 
stores and walk around as a potential employee and ask myself “What is unique about this Company 
and what can I bring that will contribute to that?”.
Some large companies have very informative websites with virtual tours and case scenarios of each 
departments work, extensive career sections.
Check out all aspects and write notes as part of your preparation.

Make it easy and get organised!
Take care with your Social Media
Just like you may check out a potential employers website, Facebook or Twitter to see what image and 
information the company is giving out…look at your own Facebook, Twitter account and other social 
media that you are using to portray yourself. Employers can also check out social media to see another 
perspective on their interview candidates.
Whilst speaking at a recent Graduate career fair, I heard some examples of people who had been using 
their social media to tell their world how much alcohol they enjoyed, that they were having “another sickie 
thanks to their raging hangover” with choice language and that the offer of that job they had worked so 
hard for had been rescinded. The job offer “pending references” may also include the informal reference 
of what you choose to say about yourself in social media.
Think before you write: once you write this about yourself any potential employer can read it and it may 
cloud their opinion on whether you match their job specification.

Preparing for your Interview
5	 Preparing for your Interview
Having submitted your application form and covering letter / email, you must have presented yourself 
well as you now have an interview!
If you have organised it as we discussed in Chapter three, you will have everything at hand…so get ready 
to prepare for your interview!
5.1	
The competency based interview
Whether an interview is face to face or telephone, most interviews are competency based.
A competency is a behaviour that you must have or be able to acquire to be effective in the role. The 
majority of companies will break down each vacancy into a number of core competencies and the 
interview panel will ask questions that require the candidates to show evidence of demonstrating them.
Some of the most popular competencies are:
•	 People management
•	 Communication skills
•	 Team working skills
•	 Leadership skills
•	 Customer care skills
•	 Problem solving
5.2	
The job specification
The job specification provides essential information. The interview panel will want to hear specific 
examples of how you can demonstrate the skills and abilities that they consider essential for the post.
So if you prepare by starting with the key competencies / skills that are required for the job, which you 
will find on the Job specification.

Why this approach works
When you prepare in this way, with the detail of specific examples that evidence / illuminate your 
knowledge and experience, you will have prepared for the key questions that they will be asking you.
Such as:
Q: Tell us what are the key skills that you think are important for this role?
A: Highlight the competencies / skills that they have asked for with your specific examples 
that demonstrate this.
Q: Give an example of a time when you have assisted a team member.
A: This is asking you about team working & people management skills; however you can also 
weave in effective communication skills and problem solving skills.
Q: Can you tell us how you demonstrate good customer care skills?
A: This is asking about your skills with customers, also about how you would represent the 
organisation, department. You can answer this generally and also use an example of good 
customer care that you will have prepared. Some positive feedback you have received from 
a customer also underlines your customer care skills well.

Preparing for your Interview
Q: We are looking for someone who works well under pressure; can you tell us how you would 
demonstrate this?
A: This is looking for your organisational skills, time management and some positive examples 
of how you work under pressure – have some examples prepared. Also an opportunity to 
talk about the day to day things that you do to relax: reading, sport, time with family.
Q: Tell us about your strengths.
A: Talk about the things that you really enjoy and know that you are good at remembering to 
include at least two of the skills that they are looking for from the job specification. If you 
have an example that illuminates these skills such as 
“One of my skills is that I enjoy providing positive leadership to people, for example when we 
were planning a team building event I enjoyed making sure that everybody had a chance to 
contribute. I also make sure that I give challenging aswell as positive feedback to my team”.
Q: Can you tell us about your weaknesses.
A: The key to this type of question is to talk about something that you have improved on, 
an area of weakness that you are/ or have transformed / are working on such as “One of 
my weaknesses is that I have very high and exacting standards and I can get disappointed 
when other people do not contribute as fully as I do; I have realised that not everyone is as 
enthusiastic as me and that I need to be aware of my colleagues other areas of expertise.” 
Or “I am aware that in the past I have overcommitted myself and have had feedback that 
my time management could be improved; I have worked hard on being more assertive and 
prioritising my workload and am pleased that this area is much more focused now”.
Don’t be too hard on yourself in this question and don’t go for the worst feedback that you 
have ever received; choose something that you can feel positive about and that is the way 
you will come across to the panel.

Allowing yourself to shine!
6	 Allowing yourself to shine!
6.1	
A common mistake that leads to an unsuccessful interview
One of the most common elements of feedback given to unsuccessful candidates is that they “didn’t sell 
themselves as well as the successful candidate”. 
I worked with a Medical client who felt very uncomfortable with the concept of “selling himself”; he felt 
he sounded arrogant and boastful about himself, which in turn made him very negative about how he 
answered the interview questions.Thinking back to the triangle of Creating the Right State, he did not 
have the right focus by this negativity; so when we reframed his language to a different metaphor, this 
meant something to him and his work and refocused him. 
6.1	
Changing the focus to feel more comfortable
So instead of thinking about “selling himself” he said he felt more comfortable with “allowing himself to 
shine” and that he was just imparting information to the interview panel about what he did every day 
for his patients. By doing this his focus shifted to a more positive outcome and he was delighted when 
he was successful at his next interview.
6.2	
The internal candidate – make no assumptions
This is especially important if you are an internal candidate for a job within the organisation you already 
work in. Make no assumptions that the panel will know how you work, prepare as you would for an 
interview in a company you don’t know.
Q: Tell us about your career history and why you are applying for this role.
A: “Well as you know from my CV and work here, I have all the skills that you are looking for”. 
Sitting on the interview panel I would be thinking: Which part of your CV or role…. I can’t remember 
those details; you are the fourth person I have interviewed today. That answer does not allow me to tick 
any competencies on my interview panel answer sheet, so reluctantly (as I know you and what you are 
capable of) you have left me no choice but to tick has not met the required standard. A more suitable 
answer to the same question would be:
A: “Having left University with a degree in Communication Skills, I have enjoyed working within the 
Customer Services department here for the past two year. I think that I have gained knowledge and experience 
with handling problems within the Customer Service department and also working as a shift supervisor 
for the past six months, I have gained some insight into the problems that staff and customers face. I enjoy 
working for this company and would welcome the opportunity this new position would offer me”. 
This answer gives me the information about your professional background, that you enjoy working for 
this company, have some people management experience and are enthusiastic about your work.

“I want to put a ding in the Universe” 
Steve Jobs.
7.1	
Putting a ding in the Universe
There is such a difference in writing things down and saying them out loud. Getting focused on answering 
questions out loud will really help you in how you come across at your interview.
Try saying out loud this inspiring quote from the co-founder of Apple Steve Jobs. I find it almost 
impossible not to smile when I am saying these words. This is how you need to be when presenting 
yourself at your interview, answering questions with enthusiasm. You getting this job can contribute to 
that ding in the universe!

A presentation at an interview is a great opportunity and your first question
If you are asked to prepare a presentation as part of your interview, this is a great opportunity as it is in 
effect your first question! Make sure that you practice delivering your presentation out loud and that it 
is within the time that they have asked you; so if it is a ten minute presentation, deliver a nine minute, 
thirty seconds presentation.
Whilst delivering your presentation at the interview, the panel is also looking at:
•	 How you cope under pressure
•	 Your organisational skills and time management: for example if you say that you are a 
concise communicator with good time management and your presentation overruns by ten 
minutes, this does not indicate that you are effective with time management.
•	 Your leadership skills: are you enthusiastic about your topic or have you sent them to sleep 
by death by power point?
•	 Good communication skills: your audiovisual aids: handout
•	 Getting your message across
7.2	
Interview Stress – can you avoid it?
No you can’t, interview stress is a necessary part of the interview preparation process. What is important 
is to use the energy that comes out of a stressful situation to your advantage. When working with my 
interview skills clients I encourage them to transform their interview nerves into creative apprehension.
7.3 	
False Evidence Appearing Real
One of the things that happens to us is we get fearful and start worrying about what may happen at the 
interview. I would like to suggest that if you break the word fear down into the acronym this can serve 
as an interruption to your negative pattern.
F alse
E vidence 
A ppearing
R eal 
Where is the evidence that you won’t perform at the interview? Our brain searches for evidence that we 
won’t do well. 95% of the things we worry about never happen, however it appears real, when it is false. 
So if this happens at your next interview, think to yourself; “It’s just false evidence appearing real, I am 
prepared, organised and I have practiced my answers out loud – my Interview Bring it on”!

Creating your own future history: Positive mental rehearsal
When Mohamed Ali prepared for his fights, he used his own unique form of mental preparation that he 
called creating your own, future history. By visualising his success with such detail, clarity and focus, he 
could predict accurately when his opponent was “going down” after his knockout punch. It was a very 
successful strategy and it worked for him fourteen out of his seventeen title fights. When asked about 
the three that he lost he said 
“I guess on those occasions, my opponent had created a better future history than me”.
This type of preparation is called positive mental rehearsal, where you visualise yourself in the interview 
answering the questions well, your presentation was very well received, your answers are flowing.

Beware of Imposter Syndrome
Imposter Syndrome is a term described by Clinical Psychologists Pauline Clance and Suzanne Imes 
in 1978. Sometimes called Imposter Phenomenon in which people are unable to internalise their 
accomplishments. People with Imposter Syndrome remain convinced that they are frauds and do not 
deserve the success they have achieved. Any proof of success is dismissed as luck, or timing “I was just in 
the right place at the right time” or as a result of deceiving others into thinking they are more intelligent 
and competent than they believe themselves to be despite external evidence. 
Originally thought to be particularly common among women who are successful in their careers, it has 
since been shown to be equally common in men. 
Quotes from people to illustrate Imposter Syndrome include:
“I have offended God and mankind because my work didn’t reach the quality it should have”  
Leonardo da Vinci.
“At anytime, I still expect that the no-talent police will come and arrest me” 
Mike Myers
“I have written 11 books, but each time I think…uh oh they are going to find me out now” 
 Maya Angelou
“I would wake up in the morning before going to a shoot, and think, I can’t do this, I’m a fraud”  
Kate Winslet
So having prepared so thoroughly for this interview, you are going to have a two sided conversation, 
answer some questions that you have thought about and are able to share with the panel your experience, 
knowledge and skills and how you will be able to contribute to their team, project, organisation. 
You are in the right place at the right time and ready for your interview!

8.1	
Enjoy your interview
The first 90 seconds of the interview are crucial, so practice introducing yourself positively, using open 
body language, smiling and giving the whole panel eye contact.
If you have a presentation deliver it well, with enthusiasm and enjoy your first question of the interview.
Enjoy your interview and have a positive closing statement.
8.2	
 Any questions?
Here are some examples of questions that you can ask an interview panel.
•	 Can you tell me about the potential career progression within this position?
•	 How do you see this role developing over the next 6 months?
•	 What type of induction will I receive?
•	 What is the timescale for appointments to this role?
Thank the panel at the end of the interview and smile saying that you welcome the opportunity to 
contribute your skills and experience to this team. A positive ending to the interview demonstrates that 
you would be a valued member of their staff.
8.3	
Reflect on your interview 
After the interview reflect on your experience, perhaps using the Reflective learning cycle from 
chapter one.
If you are successful, enjoy celebrating your new job! 
If you are not successful on this occasion, make sure that you get feedback on your interview and build 
from that feedback into your personal reflection on this interview, most importantly, how can you transfer 
this learning back into your next experience.
You may like to engage a coach to help you with your interview technique, I happen to know a good 
one who will help you with the art of interview skills to create your own future success!
