About the Authors
Carolyn Dean, MD, ND, is known as “The Doctor of the Future,” but it began 
in her teens when she read all the health literature she could get her hands 
on. When no one wanted to take her advice about nutrition and exercise, she 
decided to become a doctor — then they’d have to listen! She graduated with 
her MD in 1978 from Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, did her 
internship at Mount Sinai in Toronto, and graduated from the Ontario College 
of Naturopathic Medicine (now the Canadian College of Naturopathic 
Medicine). She has been dedicated to the practice of natural medicine and 
helping patients and clients take charge of their health ever since.
Carolyn is the author and coauthor of 18 books, including IBS For Dummies 
(Wiley), The Magnesium Miracle (Ballantine Books), and The Yeast Connection 
and Women’s Health (Square One Publishers). Carolyn offers an online news-
letter and a 48-week Internet health program called Future Health Now! Her 
goal isn’t about telling people to take handfuls of supplements; it’s about diet, 
lifestyle, and cultivating a great attitude!
As the Medical Director of the Nutritional Magnesium Association (www.
nutritionalmagnesium.org), Carolyn helps educate the public about the 
benefits of magnesium. She also offers a wellness telephone consultation ser-
vice. With her dual degrees in medicine and naturopathic medicine, she’s 
able to choose the best from both worlds for clients from around the world. 
You can join Carolyn’s newsletter and health program and find out more 
about her myriad projects at www.drcarolyndean.com.
Christine Wheeler, MA, divides her professional life between writing and edi-
ting books on health and natural wellness and being a Certified Emotional 
Freedom Techniques (EFT) Practitioner. She’s ghostwritten four titles she 
can’t tell you about, but her work with her sister Carolyn is out in the open. 
They coauthored IBS For Dummies (Wiley) and the book you are holding in 
your hands.
Christine is also an expert in helping people who fear public speaking and 
experience performance anxiety and has cocreated the successful audio pro-
gram Eliminating Your Fear of Public Speaking: Finding Your Voice with EFT, 
which you can find at www.tappingvancouver.com.
As an EFT Practitioner, Christine has helped countless people resolve the 
emotional and physical pain and symptoms associated with having IBS and 
other illnesses and conditions. She works with clients in person in her pri-
vate practice in Vancouver, Canada, and in phone consultations with people 
from all over the world. You can find her at www.christinewheeler.com.


Dedication
Carolyn places dedications on the heads of Bob and all her new friends on 
Maui who have made writing a book in paradise quite blissful.
Christine dedicates this book, and any words she writes, to Ken.
Authors’ Acknowledgments
Huge thanks go to the team of experts at Wiley starting with Stacy Kennedy, 
our Acquisitions Editor, who knew it was time for our first book to have an 
offspring. To Alissa Schwipps, Senior Project Editor, thank you for your 
patience, guidance, and great ideas as we navigated through writing our first 
cookbook. Thanks also to Copy Editor Megan Knoll who made great sugges-
tions, and our recipe editors Emily Nolan and Connie Sarros who provided 
very colorful feedback.
Thank you to our agent, Jack Sach of BookEnds, who knew we had a cook-
book in us and encouraged us to let it out.
We have such appreciation for our chefs who have contributed their beauti-
ful recipes in the hopes of helping people who are dealing with intestinal dis-
orders. Their passion for their work fueled our passion for this book. An 
extra special thanks goes to our healing chef, Colleen Robinson, who tire-
lessly helped us to adapt recipes to make them friendlier and friendlier for 
people with IBS. Chefs Shannon Leone and Angela Elliott get a standing ova-
tion for turning over their kitchens and cookbooks to us; your contributions 
are invaluable.
Thank you to our past readers, clients, and patients who have shared with us 
how reading and using IBS For Dummies helped them with their condition. 
We were happy to have the opportunity to write another book for all of you.
Carolyn: A special thanks to Wiley for the six months of nonstop fun with my 
sister Chris. And to my dear friends Barbara Ann and J.W. who showered me 
with perspective. My husband of 40 years still asks me “Carolyn, do we eat 
asparagus?”, so we just fasted our way through this cookbook!
Christine: I’d like to thank my sister Carolyn for making me love books as a 
kid and for making me love writing books now. To my great friend Rob Egger, 
thanks for knowing exactly when to phone, text, email, or make me go to a 
movie. In so many ways, I’m grateful for my partner Ken for the love, encour-
agement, and laughter and for cooking meals while I was writing a cookbook.

Introduction
I
f you picked up this book, that means you are ready for a change. How 
many times have you said to yourself, I really want to find out what foods 
my body loves; I really need to clean up my diet; I really don’t need to eat all 
this junk food; I know what makes me feel worse and I keep on doing it? We 
feel your pain; you are not alone. But you’ll find this book to be an easy and 
even fun way to explore a new way of eating for your IBS.
A lot of people struggle with IBS at some point or the other in their lifetimes, 
so you’re not alone in your quest for IBS solutions. Both of us have had 
many bouts of IBS over the last 20 years, but we’re both able to control our 
symptoms by avoiding wheat, limiting dairy and sugar, and doing Emotional 
Freedom Techniques (EFT) for the stress and emotional factors that can con-
tribute to IBS. With our training (Christine’s in EFT and Carolyn’s in medicine 
and nutrition), and the fact that we both fancy ourselves as comedians, we 
hope to give you a memorable resource with creative ideas for what to eat 
and how to cook it in order to keep IBS at bay. For example, we advise eating 
organic foods if at all possible. Genetically modified grains, corn, and soy 
seem to be the wave of the future, but these genetic experiments are associ-
ated with gut disturbance in animals. The only way to avoid them is to buy 
organic. As you find out about IBS-friendly food, we assure you that you’ll be 
able to befriend food again.
About This Book
We’ve written IBS Cookbook For Dummies as a companion to IBS For Dummies 
(Wiley). But here we take a closer look at the role food and food preparation 
can play in both triggering and managing your IBS. Our goal is to show you 
that not all foods, or even all foods you may expect, are off limits — you just 
have to know your individual body to recognize what it can and can’t handle.
You don’t have to read this book from start to finish — unless you want to, of 
course. (When we read a For Dummies book, we go straight to the cartoons 
at the beginning of each part. Then when we’re laughing we know we’re in 
the best frame of mind for learning!) Jumping around in a For Dummies book 
is great exercise, so we’ve set it up so that you can start reading this book 
anywhere you want. Simply look over the index or table of contents and then 
proceed to the chapter that tells you exactly what you need to know.
By the way, we take full responsibility for all jokes, puns, silly alliteration, and 
bathroom humor. It’s the part of the job we love most.

Conventions Used in This Book
The following conventions are used throughout the text to make things con-
sistent and easy to understand:
 
✓ All Web addresses appear in monofont. 
 
✓ New terms appear in italics and are closely followed by an easy-to-
understand definition.
 
✓ Bold highlights the action parts of numbered steps as well as keywords 
in some bulleted lists.
 
✓ IBS-D stands for IBS-diarrhea, and IBS-C stands for IBS-constipation.
 
✓ When you see the acronym SCD, it stands for the Specific Carbohydrate 
Diet™, which is specifically formulated for intestinal conditions. You 
can read more about it in Chapter 3. 
Here are a few more conventions that apply to the recipes:
 
✓ Eggs are large.
 
✓ Pepper is freshly ground black pepper unless otherwise specified.
 
✓ Butter is unsalted.
 
✓ Sugar is granulated unless otherwise noted.
 
✓ Stevia is a natural noncaloric sweetener.
 
✓ All herbs are fresh unless dried herbs are specified.
 
✓ All temperatures are Fahrenheit. (Check out Appendix A for information 
about converting temperatures to Celsius.)
 
T If vegetarian recipes are your thing, look for recipes preceded by this 
tomato icon, which signals that a dish contains no meat.
Many cookbooks pride themselves on including esoteric ingredients they 
gather from all parts of the globe. Not us; you can find all our ingredients in 
your local grocery store, health food store, or online. We pride ourselves 
on having contributing chefs, cooks and food lovers who have provided us 
with IBS-friendly recipes that will appeal to your taste buds no matter what 
your stage and degree of IBS. Some recipes will provide more guidance than 
others but we think each one will be easy to follow whether you are a cook-
ing maven or newbie.
 
We’ve tried our best to make these recipes as consistent with each other as 
possible, but they do come from several different sources, so they may not all 
have the same level of detail or guidance.

 Introduction
What You’re Not to Read
We’d love you to read every word of our book, but if you just want to get in 
and out with the info you need, we flag some interesting but nonessential 
information that you can skip if you’re in a hurry. You can come back to it 
later on as you become addicted to our lovely book.
 
✓ Text in sidebars: Sidebars are shaded boxes that usually give detailed 
examples or stories about our IBS clients with all the personal data 
removed so they won’t be embarrassed and we won’t be sued.
 
✓ Anything with a Technical Stuff icon: This icon indicates information 
that the scientist in you would love but that isn’t necessary on the first 
reading.
 
✓ The stuff on the copyright page: No kidding. You’ll find nothing of inter-
est here unless you’re inexplicably enamored by legal language and 
Library of Congress numbers.
Foolish Assumptions
We can actually be quite accurate with our assumptions about who is read-
ing this book because we’ve both suffered the symptoms of IBS. You may not 
identify with every one of the following descriptions, but if even one of them 
makes sense to you, this book is for you:
 
✓ You’ve seen umpteen doctors and given them your money, time, and 
parts of your dignity, but none of them have given you relief. 
 
✓ You’re looking for support and reinforcement because those around you 
think your problem is in your head, not your bowels.
 
✓ You have to wake up at least one hour earlier than you want to in the 
morning to make sure your gut isn’t going to play any tricks on you on 
your drive to work.
 
✓ You’re tired of missing every important family gathering, or spending 
them in the bathroom.
 
✓ You’ve become a genius at covering up abdominal pain that would take 
down a Marine.
 
✓ You find yourself gazing longingly at the incontinence products in the 
drugstore.
 
✓ You know someone with IBS and want to be able to provide support 
(and possibly snacks).

IBS Cookbook For Dummies 
How This Book Is Organized
Earlier in this introduction, we mention our love for the cartoons that begin 
each part in a For Dummies book. Of course, the cartoons are just the tip of 
the iceberg. Each part is chock full of valuable information, so here we give 
you an overview of what information you can find in this book and where.
Part I: You Are What You Eat: 
Food and IBS
What goes in must come out, but when you have IBS you can’t help but 
wonder what the foods you eat are doing along the way. This part helps you 
identify your symptoms and some simple ways you can treat them with natu-
ral medicines and foods.
You find out about foods that are thought to trigger IBS and how to deter-
mine what foods trigger you.
Finally, we show you how to transition to an IBS-friendly diet, clear your 
kitchen of unfriendly foods, and stock up on better options.
Part II: Eating For Your Intestinal Health
We’re excited to share more than 100 recipes for every meal of the day as 
well as snacks, soups, salads, drinks, and desserts, including options that 
mimic some old comfort-food favorites so you can enjoy them again safely. 
We provide these recipes with IBS-friendliness in mind, but you can expect 
many of them to become favorites of the whole family.
Part III: Simple Solutions 
for Specific Situations
Some IBS circumstances require special considerations. For example, even 
just leaving the house can be a challenge if you have IBS, so here you get 
some great tips for eating safely when you can’t be in your own kitchen, 
whether you’re out with friends or headed to an event. Parents of IBS kids 

5
 Introduction
can find a whole chapter of recipes and tips to help them help children make 
the transition to a more IBS-friendly diet. 
Part IV: The Part of Tens
Some of the most important points in the book are condensed into these 
four chapters. They remind you to avoid certain foods and common eating 
traps, show you how to make the foods you do eat a little more digestible, 
and tip you off to the underdiscussed (at least in our opinion) problem of 
yeast overgrowth.
Part V: Appendixes
These four appendixes give conversion info for those of the metric persua-
sion, show you how to substitute more friendly alternatives to certain trig-
gers, identify the fiber contents of many common foods, and help you find 
triggers where they may be hiding in foods and ingredient lists.
Icons Used in This Book
To make this book easier to read and simpler to use, we include some icons 
that can help you find and fathom key ideas and information.
 
This icon appears whenever an idea or item can save you time, money, or 
stress when taking care of your IBS.
 
Any time you see this icon, you know the information that follows is so impor-
tant it’s worth reading more than once.
 
This icon flags information that highlights dangers to your health or 
well-being.
 
This icon appears next to information that’s interesting but not essential. 
Don’t be afraid to skip these paragraphs.

IBS Cookbook For Dummies 
Where to Go from Here
This book is organized so that you can start wherever you want and find 
cross references to other chapters for the complete story. If you’re still 
feeling lost, we have a few suggestions about where to begin. If you want a 
primer on food and IBS or want to let your spouse or partner in on what’s 
brewing in your gut, read Chapter 1. If you’re ready for the recipes, dive into 
Part II to find out what’s cooking. If you have a child with IBS, Chapter 15 is a 
good starting point.
Of course, you can always go straight through from start to finish. But be 
forewarned: When you see how much fun we had, you may find yourself read-
ing the book from cover to cover, laughing uproariously at all our jokes.

Eat: Food and IBS

econciling your body’s need for food and your IBS’s 
intolerance of many foods can be difficult, so in this 
part we help you break down your new eating plan. 
Chapter 1 gives you an overview of food’s relationship 
with IBS. All IBS sufferers are different, so Chapter 2 helps 
you determine your own personal triggers, which can be 
the opposite of your best friend’s. In Chapter 3, we help 
you transition toward an IBS-friendlier diet that’s based 
on your needs; Chapter 4 shows you how to support that 
diet with a properly stocked kitchen. Finally, Chapter 5 
gives you tips on calming your stomach when you have a 
flare-up despite your best attempts.

In This Chapter
▶ Understanding the cause, effects, and triggers of IBS
▶ Watching out for similar conditions
▶ Exploring nutritional and medical treatments for IBS

emember the day you found out that you may have IBS? Maybe your 
doctor offered you the diagnosis along with a prescription for the 
appropriate intestinal accelerant or depressant. Or maybe you surfed the 
Internet from your perch on the toilet, entered your list of symptoms into 
the search engine, and came up with IBS. Either way, finding that diagnosis 
likely brought some relief because you finally knew that you weren’t alone 
(or crazy) — IBS is real!
Lots of people with IBS try to tough it out on their own without seeking medi-
cal treatment (according to some, about 70 percent). We’ve seen the lists of 
books our clients have read, the Web sites they’ve surfed, and the support 
groups they’ve attended. We hear your cries of frustration as you sit in front 
of 17 Web pages that all offer conflicting information about what to do, feel, 
eat, wear, think, take, and expect for IBS.
Feeling powerless? Well, one major way to take control of your IBS symptoms 
and your general health is to pay attention to the food you eat, and this chap-
ter shows you just how to do that by providing you with an overview of IBS 
and how what you eat can affect it.
Following the Food Trail: How Food Is 
Supposed to Travel through Your System
Irritable bowel syndrome isn’t all in your head, but it can make you feel crazy 
and out of control when it strikes. Most medical professionals agree that IBS 
doesn’t cause any structural changes in the gut, which is why it’s still called a 

10
Part I: You Are What You Eat: Food and IBS 
syndrome and not a disease. What IBS does specifically (besides making your 
life miserable) is change the form and frequency of your bowel movements. 
No matter the name, know that you can regain control of your body and 
soothe your IBS symptoms simply by changing what and how you eat. But to 
do that, you first need to understand how the human body breaks down food 
so that you can recognize what your body isn’t doing that’s causing you so 
much discomfort. For even more details on the biology of IBS, check out our 
IBS For Dummies (Wiley).
When you chew food, saliva coats the particles with enzymes that begin the 
digestive process. Sounds disgusting, but it’s very effective because carbs do 
start breaking down in your mouth. Chewing activates the stomach acid that 
gets to work on each bite you swallow, focusing on the protein. When your 
stomach acid sufficiently breaks down a meal, your body sends the mass 
of pulp out the other end of the stomach into the small intestine. Lipase fat 
enzymes from the pancreas and bile from the liver attack fats while amylase 
(an enzyme from the pancreas) continues the digestion of carbs.
The proper muscular movement of gastrointestinal tract (GIT) muscles pro-
pels everything through the various stages of digestion and absorption in 
the small intestine. By the time food reaches the large intestine, it should 
no longer be food but rather fibers and debris from microorganisms that 
now have to be excreted. The trip through the large intestine is designed to 
absorb any extra fluids, but if food particles remain because your small intes-
tine hasn’t properly digested them, microorganisms have a feast and can 
cause the symptoms of gas, bloating, and constipation or diarrhea associated 
with IBS.
Recognizing IBS’ Common 
Cause and Triggers
The main issues with the GIT aren’t unique to IBS. Anyone can suffer gut 
symptoms but in IBS, the symptoms never seem to stop. The following sec-
tions give you clues about what likely causes IBS and the triggers you can 
avoid to lessen the likelihood of an IBS attack.
Causing IBS
The only medically accepted cause of IBS is a history of having a previous gut 
infection. In surveys of people with IBS, the only common association that 

11
 Chapter 1: IBS, Food, and You
stands out is an intestinal infection, whether that’s stomach flu, food poison-
ing, traveler’s diarrhea, or something else. Whether the infectious organisms 
or the antibiotics used to treat the infection are the underlying cause is still 
unclear. The solution, which we talk about in Chapter 5, is to be sure and 
take probiotics whenever you have a gut infection or take an antibiotic.
Certain people may just be susceptible to IBS, so they may go on to develop 
chronic symptoms after an acute infection. But medical research isn’t com-
plete enough to confirm that theory because we don’t know the criteria for 
being susceptible to IBS.
Triggering an attack
By definition, a trigger is something that initiates a process or a reaction. 
Certain factors may trigger symptoms of IBS in some people. If that sounds 
vague, that’s because it is — each person is unique, and though you and your 
neighbor may have similar IBS symptoms, your triggers probably aren’t the 
same. 
 
✓ The food you eat: Yes, sad to say, food is a trigger for IBS. But what type 
of food triggers you and what type of reaction it triggers is very individ-
ual, so Chapter 2 helps you sort out your own personal triggers so that 
you can use Chapter 3 to put together a friendlier diet.
 
✓ How you eat: If you don’t chew your food properly, or if you drink too 
much liquid with your meals, your food remains partially undigested 
and is fodder for intestinal microorganisms. Not enough hydrochloric 
acid in your stomach and/or not enough pancreatic enzymes can create 
similar circumstances. Also, eating large meals might cause the intesti-
nal sphincters between your small and large intestine to open too soon 
and rush your undigested food through and cause diarrhea.
 
✓ Previous negative reactions to foods: If you’ve had a negative reaction 
to a food in the past, your brain may decide that that particular food 
is never going to be good for you and set off alarm bells the next time 
you’re even in its presence. The food doesn’t even have to pass your lips 
before your stomach starts to tighten up as if it’s going to war. And the 
really nasty part of this whole story is that the food in question may not 
have even caused your symptoms in the first place.
 
✓ Emotions: Foods and emotions, especially stress, can trigger the release 
of serotonin in the gut, leading to some of your symptoms. This connec-
tion occurs because an amazingly high 90 percent of the serotonin feel-
good hormone in the body arises from the gut.

12
Part I: You Are What You Eat: Food and IBS 
 
 Stress comes in many forms. In fact, one aspect of IBS can be an uncon-
trollable urge to control. That may sound like an oxymoron, but it may 
explain why a loss of control in the intestines is often paralleled by a 
loss of control in life. Diarrhea is a complete loss of intestinal control, 
and constipation is a clamping down to try to maintain control, resulting 
in cramps, pain, and distention. Chapter 5 outlines more details about 
stress’s effects on the gut.
 
✓ Yeast: Alone or in combination, the overuse of antibiotics, a high-sugar 
diet, stress, cortisone, hormones, and other factors can all lead to an 
overgrowth of yeast in your gut, which can cause some nasty effects. For 
more info on yeast overgrowth, flip to Chapter 18.
 
✓ Antibiotics: Although sometimes they’re necessary to kill dangerous 
bad bacteria and can be life saving, they can also take out the good 
bacteria in your system. Actually, these drugs aren’t too smart; they 
are supposed to kill off bad bacteria that are causing your symptoms, 
but instead they mow down every bacteria in their path, throwing the 
healthy gut flora completely out of balance and opening the door for 
yeast to migrate from the large intestine to the small intestine, causing 
symptoms of gas, bloating, and stool changes. Chapter 18 gives you the 
skinny on the potential problems with antibiotics and yeast.
 
 Take antibiotics when you need them and you can replace the good bac-
teria with probiotics as we discussed in Chapter 5.
How What You Eat Affects Your IBS
The GIT is always at work moving food through your body while distinguish-
ing between safe and unsafe foods. If you’ve ever had food poisoning or too 
much to drink, you know what happens when your GIT rejects the toxic food 
or drink from your body — usually either vomiting or diarrhea.
Most sources agree that certain foods and even the mere act of eating can trig-
ger symptoms of IBS, but nobody really says why or how that happens. Here’s 
Carolyn’s theory after spending 30 years working with patients who have IBS:
Your hard working GIT has evolved through the ages and seen many, many 
foods, both natural and artificial. If you think back just two or three genera-
tions in your own family, you likely have a very different diet than your great-
grandparents did. In fact, grandma’s comfort food probably had very simple 
ingredients, and what she mixed together in her homemade chocolate cake 
recipe is very different than the ingredients on the box of chocolate cake mix 
sitting in your cupboard.

13
 Chapter 1: IBS, Food, and You
Food has evolved from these simpler times into tastier, sweeter, richer, 
easier to prepare, more convenient versions with longer shelf lives. As a 
result, more foods are prepackaged with lots of added sugar, food additives, 
fats, and preservatives. Cooks and entrepreneurs have created restaurants 
that get inexpensive, filling, and tasty food into your system within moments 
of ordering it, even if that food’s nutritional value may be questionable. Your 
GIT can become so overwhelmed by the variety of sugars, fats, grains, dairy, 
and food additives you’re pumping into it that your system may either latch 
on to a food as toxic and use diarrhea to dump it or get confused and startled 
into constipation.
Differentiating from Inflammatory 
Bowel Disease (IBD)
IBD stands for Inflammatory Bowel Disease, which encompasses Crohn’s 
disease and ulcerative colitis. IBD is a defined disease with definite signs and 
symptoms. To diagnose IBD, scopes look for signs of tissue inflammation and 
ulceration. X-rays taken after you take barium can help define areas of nar-
rowing and ulceration. Bleeding and excessive mucus in the stools are the 
defining symptoms that differentiate IBD from IBS.
Some suggest that IBS may continue worsening and turn into IBD if you don’t 
treat it properly with diet and probiotics. We don’t say this to scare you but 
rather to encourage you to take charge of your condition now instead of put-
ting it off or ignoring it altogether.
Considering Other Ailments 
Masquerading as IBS
The main four conditions that mimic IBS and can also be triggers for IBS if 
not treated are celiac disease, yeast overgrowth, lactose intolerance, and 
food sensitivities and allergies. They all have so many symptoms in common 
with IBS that you have to understand their subtleties and do some food 
avoidance and challenging testing (described in Chapter 2) to determine 
whether your IBS is really one of these ailments. This process of food elimi-
nation lets you find out whether your IBS symptoms are really from gluten, 
yeast overgrowth, lactose intolerance, and food sensitivities or allergies. 

14
Part I: You Are What You Eat: Food and IBS 
Celiac disease
Celiac disease is a genetic condition caused by an immune response to gluten, 
a protein found mainly in three grains (wheat, rye, and barley) and contami-
nating another grain (oats).
 
Oats don’t actually contain gluten, but they’re invariably farmed, stored, and/
or milled in facilities that also handle wheat, rye, and barley, so they can be 
contaminated with tiny trace amounts of gluten — still enough to trigger some 
people with celiac disease. Some oats are grown, stored, and milled in isola-
tion and bear the gluten-free symbol.
The immune system attacks the gluten, damaging the intestines and impair-
ing their absorption of food. The main symptoms of celiac disease include 
(but aren’t limited to) the following:
 
✓ GI symptoms
 
✓ Headaches
 
✓ Poor concentration
 
✓ Infertility
 
✓ Weight loss or gain
 
✓ Depression
 
✓ Muscle, joint, or bone pain
 
✓ Anemia
 
✓ Fatigue
The treatment for celiac disease is simple: Avoid gluten grains and products 
that use these grains.
Yeast overgrowth
Yeast is a type of fungus, a cousin to mold and mildew in the form of tiny 
round buds that grow naturally on your skin and in your intestines. Yeast 
buds don’t have mouths or stomachs — they grow into their food, absorbing 
sugars in the form of table sugar, milk sugar, fruit sugar, and glucose mol-
ecules from simple carbohydrates like bread. When a round yeast bud grows 
to a critical size, it can no longer absorb enough food through its surface 
to reach the center, so it breaks off into smaller buds that form their own 
colonies.

15
 Chapter 1: IBS, Food, and You
 
Antibiotics can contribute to yeast overgrowth because they kill all gut bacte-
ria, including the good stuff, leaving room for yeast to take over.
Symptoms of yeast overgrowth include
 
✓ Chronic fatigue
 
✓ Allergies, sinusitis, and asthma
 
✓ Vaginitis or prostatitis
You can starve out yeast by avoiding sugar, wheat, and dairy; see Chapter 18 
for more on controlling yeast overgrowth.
Lactose intolerance
Lactose (milk sugar) is what makes milk taste a bit sweet. Up to 75 percent 
of adults worldwide have diminished capacity to digest dairy products, so 
lactose intolerance isn’t a rare condition. Experts estimate that about 50 mil-
lion Americans feel the effects of lactose intolerance, and that figure doesn’t 
count the millions who suffer occasionally when they load up on lactose. 
The reactions occur because undigested dairy becomes fodder for intestinal 
organisms that feed and breed off your waste. It can also attract water, which 
makes your stools very runny. The symptoms of lactose intolerance are very 
much like the symptoms for IBS:
 
✓ Abdominal pain and bloating
 
✓ Constipation
 
✓ Diarrhea (usually very runny)
 
✓ Alternating constipation and diarrhea
 
✓ Cramps
 
✓ Gas
 
✓ Nausea and vomiting
To determine whether your condition is lactose intolerance or dairy-triggered 
IBS, you can take a lactose tolerance blood test or a hydrogen breath test 
(lactose intolerance creates an excess of hydrogen in the breath). Your doctor 
first takes a preliminary reading of either your blood glucose or the amount 
of hydrogen in your breath, depending on which test you’re taking. After you 
drink a liquid containing lactose, you repeat the test and compare the results. 
If your blood glucose has suddenly become elevated or your hydrogen breath 
reading has spiked, you are diagnosed with lactose intolerance, not IBS. 

16
Part I: You Are What You Eat: Food and IBS 
The best way to treat lactose intolerance? Avoiding lactose. In Appendix D, 
we list many foods that may contain lactose so you can make more informed 
food choices.
Food allergies and food sensitivities
Food allergies and sensitivities are two separate animals that can both cause 
IBS-like symptoms. The medical definition of a food allergy is a reaction to 
food causing an immediate reaction with swelling of mucus membranes and 
a positive IgE blood test showing elevated antibody levels. Strawberries, 
shellfish, and nuts are some of the big food allergy culprits; if you have an 
allergy and eat an offending food, your body releases histamines and other 
chemicals, causing hives, itching, and swelling that can occasionally be life-
threatening. Only 1 percent of adults and 3 percent of children suffer IgE food 
allergies; naturally, if you have a food allergy, you want to identify and avoid 
that food.
Chronic food allergies can take up to 48 hours to appear, so associating them 
with food intake can be difficult unless you do the avoidance and challenge 
testing we talk about in Chapter 2. Dairy, wheat, soy, and corn are common 
IgG food allergies, and a positive test shows a higher level of IgG antibodies. 
Unfortunately, most doctors only recognize IgE food allergies and not the IgG 
kind, so you often have to do the dietary testing yourself to make your own 
diagnosis. Many nutritionally oriented doctors perform the IgG allergy tests 
to determine food allergies, but Carolyn finds that the food avoidance and 
challenge testing works just as well or even better.
 
You can take IgG food allergy blood tests, but if you have a leaky gut (which 
we discuss in Chapter 18), molecules of undigested food can be absorbed 
from the gut into the bloodstream. Your immune system attacks those mol-
ecules with IgG antibodies and can give you a false positive IgG test result for 
just about every food you’re eating.
Food sensitivities are foods that you may have identified as unique triggers 
for your symptoms without any clear medical reason. The designation food 
sensitivity is more in the realm of inability to digest a particular food, with 
symptoms of mucus, nausea, or upset stomach after eating. You may burp 
after a pizza due to inability to digest green peppers, or dairy products may 
give you mucus and you find yourself clearing your throat after drinking a 
milkshake. Many foods that cause symptoms in people with IBS are labeled 
food sensitivities. That’s where a food diary and avoiding and challenging 
foods become very important tools. (Head to Chapter 2 for guidance on cre-
ating a food diary.)

 Chapter 1: IBS, Food, and You
Treating Your Symptoms With Nutrition: 
What an IBS-Friendly Diet Looks Like
The definition of medicine as Carolyn learned it in medical school is the diag-
nosis of disease and the treatment of disease symptoms with drugs. We’d 
rather show you ways of treating IBS to relieve the condition, but there may 
be times when you need symptomatic treatment. The following sections 
give you tips on controlling your symptoms with diet, natural remedies, and 
medicine.
To get a good visual of an IBS-friendly diet, take a look at the color section 
near the middle of this book. A diet that provides you and your sensitive 
stomach with delicious, safe foods doesn’t have a lot of garbage associated 
with it. We’re talking about the ingredients and the packaging here — if 
you’re eating fat-laden cuisine out of a bag, wrapper, or cardboard container 
that’s going to end up in your trash can, it’s very likely not IBS-friendly. If 
you’ve prepared the meal yourself from fresh ingredients, your gut is far 
more likely to thank you later. After you identify your personal triggers (see 
Chapter 2), Chapter 3 shows you how to transition away from triggers and 
trash and into a healthy-yet-tasty alternative.
 
To get you started on this friendly path, check out the recipes in Part II — 120 
delightful dishes for your mouth and your stomach.
Supplementing a Healthy Diet
Whether or not you have IBS, supplements are important to create and main-
tain a healthy body. Many doctors argue that you can get all your vitamins 
and minerals from a healthy, balanced diet, but that’s becoming harder and 
harder as heavy industrialized farming strips minerals from the soil without 
properly replacing them.
 
Don’t assume that enriched foods — bread products with B vitamins, sugared 
yogurt with probiotics, milk with extra calcium — are totally healthy. The 
synthetic supplements manufacturers add don’t completely make up for the 
actual nutrition that’s been refined, processed, and bleached away.
If you have IBS-C, your colon is holding a lot of waste hostage in your body. 
You need a good antioxidant supplement to counteract the toxicity and a 
probiotic to fight off the fiendish bacteria roaming your body. IBS-D sufferers 

18
Part I: You Are What You Eat: Food and IBS 
may often have the sense that they’re losing their lunches before they’ve 
had time to absorb it. As a result, their bodies may be depleted of necessary 
nutrients, and a good-quality multivitamin is essential.
 
Studies that say vitamins are dangerous or ineffective are usually testing syn-
thetic supplements and not the food-based nutrients that come from nature. 
And no supplement is an acceptable replacement for improving your diet and 
lifestyle.
Making magnesium your new best friend
Magnesium tops our list as the number one supplement for anyone because 
it’s crucial for your health, it’s simple to take, it’s inexpensive, and it’s effec-
tive in the proper forms whether you have IBS-C or IBS-D. Magnesium is 
necessary for the proper function of more than 325 different enzymes in the 
body, and maintaining adequate magnesium levels can ease the pain and 
spasms of IBS symptoms and make having such an illness a little less uncom-
fortable. The symptoms of magnesium deficiency include muscle spasms, 
palpitations, hypertension, insomnia, migraines, PMS, depression, and anxi-
ety and panic attacks. Another major symptom is moderate fatigue — not just 
general tiredness but rather a distinct lack of energy that, when coupled with 
IBS, compromises your body’s healing resources.
 
Most people don’t think of having a magnesium deficiency because the symp-
toms are associated with so many other conditions. But being deficient in 
magnesium can affect your overall health because you’re operating your body 
without all its vital components. And most doctors don’t recognize a magne-
sium deficiency because no test in standard lab work accurately identifies it.
Magnesium is a great natural laxative, so it’s very helpful if you have IBS-C 
to take a magnesium citrate powder in water or a magnesium dimalate 
tablet if you would rather swallow a pill. Recent research has also turned 
up two forms of magnesium that work for IBS-D: magnesium oil and angstrom-
sized magnesium. The following list covers these and other helpful forms of 
magnesium.
 
✓ Magnesium oil: Although it’s not technically an oil, magnesium chloride 
highly concentrated in distilled water has a slightly oily consistency. 
You spray or rub the oil on your skin, so it doesn’t reach your intes-
tines and cause a laxative effect (unless you bathe in a few gallons of it). 
Research shows that applying a solution of magnesium oil to your skin 
restores levels within your tissues in four to six weeks. The minimum 
daily dose is 400 milligrams or about 20 sprays if you’re using a spray 

19
 Chapter 1: IBS, Food, and You
bottle. You can dilute the oil with distilled water if it burns or tingles 
slightly; leave the oil on all day, or wash it off after at least 30 minutes if 
you prefer.
 
✓ Angstrom minerals: Good things come in small packages, and the 
smaller the magnesium particle, the more likely it’s able to pass through 
the miniscule openings in the cell walls. Fortunately, magnesium and 
other minerals come in atom-sized packages called angstrom. The 
dosage for angstrom minerals is between five and ten times less than 
the common brands on the shelf. It comes in liquid form, and a dose is 
about 40 milligrams (2 tablespoons) twice a day taken with or without 
food in a small glass of water.
 
 On her blog, Carolyn has gotten numerous testimonials from people 
who have switched to angstrom minerals (especially magnesium) and 
found enormous benefits. One woman wrote, “The (angstrom) magne-
sium works much faster that the taurate capsules. Sleeping even better, 
relaxed muscles, just calmer. I will continue taking this form of magne-
sium from now on.” If you’re looking for angstrom, the source we trust is 
www.completeh2ominerals.com.
 
✓ Magnesium from food: Seaweed and chocolate both have very high 
amounts of magnesium. We know how exciting the chocolate part 
sounds, but remember that we’re talking about the 100-percent raw, 
bitter chocolate called cacao. Even so, Carolyn’s Chocolate Banana 
Cream Pudding (see the recipe in Chapter 13) is a delicious magnesium 
supplement containing banana (33 milligrams for 4 ounces), coconut 
milk (100 milligrams per cup) and raw chocolate (100 milligrams for 
2 tablespoons).
 
 Other foods rich in magnesium are nuts, seeds, deep green leafy veg-
etables, and whole grains. You may think that these foods are off limits, 
but that’s not the case. Our Basic Seed or Nut Pâté (see the recipe in 
Chapter 7) is a blend of nuts or seeds, lemon juice, sea salt, and garlic 
and is extremely high in magnesium. Deep green leafy vegetables may be 
a stretch for you but consider juicing greens or even blending your salad 
to a consistency that your tummy can tolerate.
Making room for other important 
vitamins and minerals
We don’t deal too deeply with supplements in this book because our focus is 
on treating your IBS with food, but we want to make you aware of the most 
beneficial nutrients for your gut. The most important nutrients after magne-
sium are vitamin D, zinc, calcium, and vitamin A. Of course, you could make a 

20
Part I: You Are What You Eat: Food and IBS 
case for any of the other 44 vitamins and minerals, but the following list just 
aims to get you started on the basics.
 
✓ Vitamin D: Vitamin D research is in its infancy, but so far it has shown 
that vitamin D affects most of the body’s tissues. Current research links 
vitamin D deficiency with 17 different types of cancer (including breast 
cancer) and many other illnesses like osteoporosis, heart disease and 
juvenile diabetes. According to Dr. Soram Khalsa, author of The Vitamin 
D Revolution (HayHouse) having adequate vitamin D intake (2,000 IU 
a day year round) provides you with overall health benefits that may 
translate into the lessening of your IBS symptoms. Vitamin D is very dif-
ficult to get in your diet; in order to get 2,000 IU a day, you would have 
to drink 20 glasses of milk or eat 10 cans of tuna, but as vitamin D3, it’s 
an easy-to-take supplement that may speed up the healing of damaged 
tissues and cells. Sun exposure does give you lots of vitamin D, but only 
at certain times of the day and certain times of the year.
 
✓ Zinc: Researchers say that fast-healing humans have high levels of zinc 
in their tissues. Almost 100 body enzymes depend on zinc to make them 
work properly; that’s less than the 325 powered by magnesium (see 
the preceding section), but it’s still pretty impressive. Many of these 
enzymes deal with tissue growth and repair and may just help those 
with leaky gut (which we discuss in Chapter 18). Sunflower seeds, pump-
kin seeds, and oysters are good sources of zinc; our Basic Seed or Nut 
Pâté in Chapter 7 helps you easily obtain your daily dose of zinc (which 
in tablet form is 10 to 15 milligrams and in liquid angstrom form is 20 
milligrams per day).
 
✓ Calcium: Calcium is the most abundant mineral in the body, helping to 
create your bones and teeth. It’s also the most commonly used mineral 
supplement. Calcium is crucial for heart health because it makes mus-
cles, including the heart muscle, contract. It neutralizes acidity in the 
body, activates enzymes, promotes cell division, and allows the trans-
port of nutrients through cell membranes. 
 
 Although it’s famously associated with dairy products, better sources 
for those with dairy triggers are whole grains, nuts, and seeds. Despite 
dairy concerns, yogurt is a good source of calcium and its beneficial pro-
biotics may also slow down diarrhea. You can find dairy and non-dairy 
yogurt recipes in Chapter 6. 
 
 You may see calcium recommended as a treatment for IBS because of 
its tendency to cause constipation, but we must warn you of the dan-
gers of taking too much calcium. Carolyn receives reports from doctors 
and clients who tell her they are developing complications (including 
gall stones, kidney stones, and magnesium deficiency) possibly caused 
by overuse and overprescription of over-the-counter calcium tablets. 

21
 Chapter 1: IBS, Food, and You
Excess calcium sticks around in the body, building up in tissues and 
throwing your magnesium levels out of balance. Carolyn now only rec-
ommends 20 milligrams of calcium liquid angstrom supplement twice 
a day.
 
✓ Vitamin A: Vitamin A is important for healthy skin — both your outside 
skin and the inside skin of your lungs and gut. If you have vitamin A defi-
ciency, symptoms of IBS-D can worsen because the mucus membranes 
of the gut are not as strong and healthy. At the same time, diarrhea can 
cause loss of vitamin A. Supplemental vitamin A usually comes from cod 
liver oil, but some food sources include colorful (dark green, yellow, 
orange, and red) vegetables and fruits, including spinach, pumpkins, 
peppers, squash, carrots, yellow peaches, apricots, papayas, and man-
goes. It’s also found in high amounts in egg yolks, although some folks 
with IBS may be avoiding those (see Chapter 6). The recommended daily 
intake for vitamin A is 3,000 IU, but we suggest at least 5,000 IU per day, 
which you can usually get in 1 teaspoon of cod liver oil.
Using digestive supplements 
to help digest your food
When we give people the choice to chew each bite of food 40 times or take 
a digestive supplement, they usually go for the supplement, but we wish 
people would choose chewing (or at least chewing and a supplement). 
Chewing well lets you do one-third of your digesting in your mouth with sali-
vary enzymes. Plus, it also alerts the rest of the GIT to get ready for dinner. 
If your food isn’t well-chewed and fully digested as it makes its way through 
the digestive tract, some of it reaches the intestines in particle sizes that are 
difficult to absorb, leaving fodder for microorganisms to power up on so they 
can set off your symptoms later.
 
✓ Digestive enzymes: Most digestive enzymes contain amylase, betaine 
hydrochloride, lipase, and peptidase, and the vegetarian formulas con-
tain bromelain and papain from pineapple and papaya. Take one or two 
in the middle or at the end of your meal to help relieve symptoms of 
gas, bloating, and belching. Another remedy that is effective and less 
expensive is to take 1 to 3 teaspoons of organic apple cider vinegar in 4 
ounces of water before and/or during a meal.
 
✓ Probiotics: Countless recent studies have shown the importance of pro-
biotics (good bacteria) for the GIT in promoting fermentation to assist 
digestion and maintaining an appropriate pH in the large intestine to 
deter invading bacteria. Probiotics are the answer to the good bacteria 

22
Part I: You Are What You Eat: Food and IBS 
vacuum created by antibiotics; bifidus and lactobacillus acidophilus 
are examples of helpful probiotics you can take. The optimum dosage 
range for probiotics is from 2 to 10 billion active cells daily. Make sure 
the label on your product guarantees this number through the expira-
tion date.
 
✓ Herbs: Many herbs have been used for centuries to treat gut symptoms 
and assist digestion. The best herbs for the gut are demulcents, or sub-
stances that have the ability to form a soothing film over a mucus mem-
brane to protect enzyme function and areas that absorb nutrients. You 
get the very gooey picture of that process when you think of slippery 
elm bark, aloe vera, Irish moss, and the newest protein powder on the 
block, chia seeds. Jelly-like and cooling, they’re anti-inflammatory and 
soothing.
 
 Be sure to use aloe vera and not the laxative aloe latex products. The 
safest aloe vera we know is George’s Aloe.
 
 Here are some suitable herbs that can help take the spasm and bloat-
ing out of the gut, making digesting food and absorbing nutrients much 
easier. Check out IBS For Dummies (Wiley) for more information:
 
• Peppermint oil: Relaxes the intestines and relieves bloating 
 
• Fennel: Antispasmodic that eliminates gas and bloating
 
• Ginger: Antispasmodic that relieves nausea and indigestion
 
• Chamomile: Antispasmodic and anti-inflammatory that relieves 
anxiety
 
• Caraway: Antispasmodic that relieves gas and aids digestion
 
• Anise: Relieves gas and bloating, settles the bowel, and has anti-
fungal properties
 
• Oregano: Relieves nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and muscle spasms 
and has antifungal and antibacterial properties
 
• Angelica root (dong quai): Relieves intestinal cramps, gas, and 
bloating
 
• Bitter herbs such as bitter orange peel, gentian root, artichoke 
leaf, areca seed, and dandelion root: Stimulate gastric juices and 
increase bile production
 
• Areca seed: Relieves abdominal distention and constipation and 
has antiparasitic properties

 Chapter 1: IBS, Food, and You
Beginning the Healing Process
Adopting an IBS friendly diet begins at home — right in your own kitchen. 
Although thinking about everything you have to do may feel overwhelming 
right now, remember to be patient with yourself and know that you’re at 
the beginning of your healing process and in charge of how fast or slow you 
move through this transition. 
Everything seems a bit easier when you break it down into steps, so one of 
the first things to do is get the offending foods out of your kitchen (or at least 
your line of vision). Chapter 4 shows you how to chuck the junk and stock 
up on IBS-friendly foods, whether you live alone or with others who don’t 
have IBS.
The shopping tips in Chapter 4 are especially helpful as you load up on the 
ingredients for the recipes in Part II. Whether you are new to the kitchen or 
a seasoned cook, the recipes are easy to follow and feature easy-to-find, IBS-
friendly ingredients. The recipes may even show you some new ways to cook 
and prepare food.
But there’s also life outside your kitchen, and we’ve got lots of tips for eating 
away from home in Chapter 14. Whether it’s lunch at the office, dinner at a 
restaurant, or a family gathering, our tips help you prepare for safe and fun 
meals. You are on the path to a healthier way to eat.

Chapter 2
Finding Your Intestinal Triggers
In This Chapter
▶ Figuring out what makes a trigger food
▶ Examining dairy and gluten as major causes of IBS symptoms
▶ Spotlighting the effects of sugar, fructose, and insoluble fiber
T
here’s no template for the care and feeding of IBS, which is why it’s 
important for you to find out what’s eating you as you embark on this IBS 
adventure. In this chapter, we explain the sensitivities that people can have 
to dairy, gluten, sugar, fructose, and insoluble fiber; we then show you how 
to safely experiment with your diet so you can determine whether these IBS 
triggers are aiming for your intestines.
In this chapter, we provide very specific guidelines on challenging three of 
the traditional four food groups in order to help you identify your triggers. 
In case you’ve forgotten, the four are meat, dairy, grains, and fruits and veg-
gies; meat is off the hook in this chapter. Armed with this knowledge, you can 
start exploring the many food substitutions and recipes that we outline for 
you. (Check out Appendix B for a quick reference list of trigger food substitu-
tions.) If you’ve been living with IBS for many years, we assure you that there 
are many more options and substitutions than existed even ten years ago.
 
We want to be clear right from the beginning that we know we’re jumping into 
very dangerous territory by telling you to avoid certain foods. These may be 
the foods you crave, eat every day, and can’t wait to enjoy after a long day at 
work. It’s hard to believe that your favorite comfort food may be causing you 
such intestinal discomfort, but the relief you’ll feel by cutting it out of your diet 
and exploring new recipes that don’t trigger IBS will be well worth the effort.
Identifying Trigger Foods
No doubt you know of some foods that clearly aren’t your friends and are 
fairly easy to avoid, but there are likely to be some IBS culprits lurking in 

26
Part I: You Are What You Eat: Food and IBS 
your current diet. You know the ones we’re talking about — remember that 
painful reminder when you ate the spicy sausage and drank beer at your 
weekend picnic?
An IBS trigger may also be described as food sensitivity. (Some people talk 
about food intolerance, but since lactose intolerance and fructose intoler-
ance (malabsorption) are genuine diseases, we use the word sensitivity 
instead for clarity.) There are many different symptoms of food sensitivity, 
including headaches and achy joints that don’t even seem to affect the gas-
trointestinal (GI) tract. You may be treating such symptoms with prescription 
medications when simple food avoidance can bring you permanent relief. 
We provide a list of symptoms of food sensitivity in the section “Listening to 
your body” later in this chapter.
 
An intolerance is an inability of the natural digestive processes to break down 
a food substance, leading to symptoms. Lactose intolerance and fructose intol-
erance are two examples. An allergy, on the other hand, is a condition wherein 
an immune system response causes antibodies to be released in response to a 
particular food. A food sensitivity is another designation of your body rejecting 
a food. It doesn’t necessarily show up on allergy tests, and the most common 
way to diagnose it is to do food avoidance and challenging, which we cover in 
the individual trigger foods sections later in this chapter. Celiac disease, on 
the other hand, is an auto-immune reaction to gluten and not an intolerance, 
allergy, or sensitivity, although you can have gluten intolerance, gluten allergy, 
or gluten sensitivity.
Knowing the top five trigger foods
Knowledge is power. We’ve spoken to many IBS sufferers who would prefer 
to remain in denial than admit that their favorite treat was causing some of 
their IBS symptoms. But knowing the top trigger foods gives you power over 
your diet and food intake, and some simple substitutions can be a treat for 
your taste buds while calming your colon. We hope the recipes in this book 
will help alleviate the anxiety that may be churning as you consider eliminat-
ing anything from your diet.
 
The top five foods that trigger IBS are
 
✓ Dairy
 
✓ Wheat
 
✓ Sugar
 
✓ Fructose
 
✓ Insoluble fiber

27
 Chapter 2: Finding Your Intestinal Triggers
The most common reaction that IBS sufferers have when we tell them to 
avoid dairy or wheat or fruit (a source of fructose) is disbelief. How can 
the staff of life (wheat) or the milk you were raised on be bad for you? And 
apart from the forbidden apple, fruit is usually considered a healthy snack. 
However, in the context of IBS you may not be able to digest these foods to a 
degree where your body is comfortable with them, meaning they gang up on 
your intestines and cause problems that you may not even recognize.
We feel your pain. At one time or another, we’ve sadly turned our backs on 
all these foods and food groups and lived to write about it. And you will, too. 
Well, maybe not write about it, but you can tell your grandchildren that you 
survived.
Listening to your body
Remember that weekend treat mentioned earlier, when the spicy sausage and 
beer intermingled to become a fermenting cauldron in your gut? That was 
your body saying no!
People become so accustomed to having burpy, gassy, churning reactions to 
everyday foods that they don’t even consider that these foods may be con-
tributing to IBS. So you don’t listen to the sounds your gut is making because 
you really don’t want to admit that you’re having a reaction. We want you to 
become accustomed to hearing and feeling the signs and signals that your 
body is giving you and to become more aware of the impact of food on your 
system.
Here’s a comprehensive list of food sensitivity symptoms, courtesy of 
www.foodintol.com.
 
✓ Respiratory symptoms: Coughing, sneezing, wheezing, asthma, ear infec-
tions, snoring, sleep apnea, pneumonia, bronchitis
 
✓ Immune system symptoms: Catching colds and infections easily, mouth 
ulcers, yeast fungal infections
 
✓ Neural (nervous system) symptoms: Poor coordination, clumsiness, 
headaches, migraines, depression, memory problems, intellectual diffi-
culties, dementia
 
✓ Skin, hair and nails: Eczema, psoriasis, dermatitis, hives, rosacea, 
rashes, hair loss, split and cracked nails, poor complexion, dandruff
 
✓ Metabolism problems: Moodiness, weight gain, weight loss, chills, thy-
roid disease, cravings, addictions
 
✓ Musculoskeletal symptoms: Stiff muscles or joints, tendonitis, arthritis, 
bone thinning, bone fractures, osteoporosis

28
Part I: You Are What You Eat: Food and IBS 
 
✓ Malabsorption: Extreme tiredness and lack of energy, difficulty concen-
trating, vitamin deficiencies, iron deficiency, anemia, calcium deficiency
 
✓ Gastro symptoms: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), diarrhea, constipa-
tion, indigestion, esophageal reflux, stomach ulcers, bowel cancer
 
✓ Genital and reproductive symptoms: Vaginitis, urinary tract infections, 
infertility, difficulty conceiving, miscarriage
You’re looking for signs like these not because you’re a glutton for punish-
ment but so you can avoid the particular food combinations that resulted in 
such symptoms the next time.
Making a food diary
If your memory seems to get conveniently wiped out after every IBS food 
attack, we suggest you record the events surrounding your meal in a food 
diary. Write down your observations as close to the event as possible so 
that they’re fresh in your mind. Describe the symptoms and discomfort in 
detail so that you’re also aware of other triggers like stress, exhaustion, and 
tension. Otherwise, you may just blame the food and end up limiting your 
diet unnecessarily.
 
If you eat out a lot, use a small notebook that you can carry around in your 
pocket or purse. If it’s not handy, you won’t use it. If people ask you what 
you’re doing you can tell them you’re writing the Great American Novel, chan-
neling a winning lottery number, or calculating the square root of pi. They’ll 
never bother you again.
On one side of the page, list everything you eat and the time you eat it. On 
the other side, record whatever symptoms arise during the day along with 
the time.
When reviewing your food diary, you’re looking for patterns; you may be 
surprised to find a correlation between what you eat and how you feel. Your 
spicy sausage and beer is only one of many revealing moments. Another may 
be that bagel with lox and cream cheese that you have once a week when 
you have a meeting in a particular neighborhood; luckily there’s a restroom 
handy to deal with the cramping and diarrhea that seems to hit you out of 
the blue. Another connection may be the fried chicken that your mother 
makes for Sunday dinners; no cramping, just many trips to the restroom. 
Or you may find that your aunt’s lasagna with three layers of three different 
cheeses stoppers you up for a week. In the case of lactose intolerance, your 
symptoms may come after two hours or even as soon as 30 minutes after 
eating. If constipation is your symptom for lactose intolerance, you may not 

29
 Chapter 2: Finding Your Intestinal Triggers
notice it until you get up in the morning and your usual arising BM never 
arrives.
Suddenly you’re amazed that your intolerance for certain foods has gone 
unnoticed for decades. While you’re working on your food diary, you may 
hear an item on TV, read an article in a magazine, go online, or read this 
book, and it’s like a giant light bulb goes off. You know beyond a shadow of 
a doubt that wheat and dairy are no longer your friends. You finally come to 
grips with the realization that eating bread and bagels and pizza and toasted 
cheese sandwiches are what’s doing you in.
Identifying a food allergy, sensitivity, or food intolerance can be exciting, 
because there’s an implied promise that if you stop eating certain foods 
that could be bothering you, you have a good chance of dumping your IBS 
symptoms.
Asking your ancestors
You don’t just inherit genes from your ancestors; you inherit their food 
choices, eating habits, and recipes as well. In addition to inheriting your 
mother’s eyes, you may also have inherited her intolerance for certain kinds 
of foods. Take a few moments to think about what food-related issues have 
been handed down through the generations in your family.
Interviewing your folks about food may be an interesting topic for your next 
family gathering. For example, you may have grown up with limited access 
to milk, cheese, and ice cream if dairy wasn’t a favored food group in your 
house. But when you get out on your own and decide that you love drinking 
milkshakes and eating cheese pizza regularly, you may discover that you can’t 
digest dairy products properly. Gas, bloating, diarrhea and/or constipation 
can be your reward for not following family tradition. On the other hand, if you 
grew up eating toast and cereal for breakfast, sandwiches for lunch, and rolls 
at dinner, you never got away from bread. The abdominal cramps that were 
only soothed by your mother’s hand on your tummy could have been from all 
that wheat bread. And it wasn’t until you decided to go on a diet in your 20s 
and take bread out of your menu that your stomach didn’t rumble anymore.
The most common inherited reaction to food is celiac disease, which is an 
immune system response triggered by the consumption of gluten protein 
found in wheat, rye, barley, and often contaminating oats. Even though many 
members of one family suffer gastrointestinal symptoms, they may not even 
know they have celiac disease. Sometimes it takes a very inquisitive person 
determined to get to the bottom of his symptoms to solve the puzzle for the 
whole family.

Dairy as a Trigger Food
Humans are the only mammals to continue drinking milk after weaning, but 
as they wean off milk, most people experience a decrease in the amount of 
lactase enzyme necessary to digest dairy. Lactose, the sugar in milk, requires 
enzymes to break it down during digestion. Small amounts may cause no 
problems, but it’s the larger load that the body can’t handle.
Whether they do it consciously or unconsciously, many people recognize 
that dairy doesn’t agree with them early on in life, so they avoid dairy prod-
ucts. Perhaps the avoidance is instinctive given that ancestry seems to influ-
ence a person’s ability to digest dairy. But for those who crave creamy treats 
like ice cream and cheesecake, dairy-related IBS symptoms are one inheri-
tance they’d rather give back.
Dairy and IBS
The connection between dairy and IBS can take the form of lactose intoler-
ance and the insufficiency of lactase enzymes leading to the incomplete 
digestion of dairy leading to GI symptoms. Another connection and cause of 
symptoms may be an allergy or intolerance to the casein protein in dairy. 
This section delves into these possible sources of symptoms.
Lactose intolerance
Lactose intolerance symptoms primarily impact the GI tract. Lactase enzyme 
is designed to decode the lactose molecule into its two designer molecules: 
glucose and galactose. If that magic interaction doesn’t occur — that is, if you’re 
one of millions of people who don’t produce lactase enzymes — lactose con-
tinues merrily along the superhighway of your gut wreaking havoc in its path. 
The chaos is due to bacteria and yeast in your large intestine feasting on 
undigested milk sugar, resulting in many IBS-like symptoms.
Symptoms of lactose intolerance include abdominal bloating, distention, pain 
and cramping, audible bowel noises, diarrhea, flatulence (passing gas), and 
sometimes nausea. As we outline in Chapter 1, these symptoms can be con-
fused with an intestinal infection or celiac disease or be labeled IBS or IBD 
(inflammatory bowel disease).
Symptoms differ at different ages. Children with lactose intolerance may also 
have failure to thrive because one of their main sources of nutrients isn’t 
being absorbed and they’re losing nutrients due to diarrhea. Remember the 
childhood birthday parties where cake and ice cream (or ice cream cake) 

31
 Chapter 2: Finding Your Intestinal Triggers
were the main attraction? Imagine how scary and embarrassing those are for 
a child who’s blindsided by a need to rush to the bathroom while the other 
kids are pinning the tail on the donkey.
Adults may have the symptoms we list along with an urgency to evacuate the 
bowels. As we note earlier in the chapter, the timing can be from 30 minutes 
to two hours after a meal containing lactose.
 
According to the National Digestive Diseases Information Clearinghouse 
(NDDIC), 30 to 50 million Americans are lactose intolerant. But different cul-
tures experience different levels of intolerance. 90 to 100 percent of Asian 
Americans, 80 percent of African Americans, and 15 percent of Caucasians 
suffer from the condition. Folks of northern European descent have even 
lower rates of lactose intolerance.
 
The symptoms associated with lactose intolerance are often related to the 
amount of dairy consumed and vary from one individual to another. If you eat 
dairy as the bulk of your meal or snack instead of it being a small portion of 
your meal, you may have a more difficult time digesting it. However, having 
milk or cheese as part of a full meal, which allows for a longer digestion time, 
give your limited lactase enzymes more time to do their work. Some dairy 
products also contain less lactose and are often easier to tolerate. Chapter 17 
shows you more ways to make dairy easier to digest.
Casein allergy or intolerance
Casein is a milk protein, whereas lactose is a milk sugar. The symptoms of 
a casein allergy or intolerance are more difficult to identify as coming from 
dairy. Symptoms can include GI symptoms (vomiting, heartburn, abdominal 
pain, diarrhea, gas, and bloating) and also eczema, hives, asthma, and short-
ness of breath.
If you’ve taken the dairy challenge (see “Taking the dairy challenge” later 
in this chapter) and have finally narrowed down your IBS symptoms to 
dairy after avoiding it for two weeks, you may think that drinking and eating 
lactose-free products or taking lactase enzyme pills will solve your IBS prob-
lems. However, if your symptoms return in spite of lactose-eliminating pre-
cautions, casein may be the culprit.
 
Many foods that are advertised as “nondairy” or “dairy-free” still contain 
casein, and it may be found in high-protein or protein-enriched products. But 
casein can be hard to recognize on an ingredient list because it goes by sev-
eral different names. Look for casein (obviously) but also sodium caseinate, 
galactose, sodium lactylate, lactose, lactalbumin, and other names that begin 
with or feature lact–.

32
Part I: You Are What You Eat: Food and IBS 
Eating dairy-free
Dairy products are used in many processed and packaged foods, such as 
cereals, muffin and pancake mixes, stuffing, and meat extenders. Make read-
ing labels your new hobby, and pay extra attention to understanding and 
spotting the many hidden names of dairy. The dairy vocabulary includes 
whey, whey powder, clarified butter, ghee, artificial butter flavor, curds, lactose, 
hydrolysates, lactalbumin, lactoglobulin, and lactulose.
We understand that you may shy away from the idea of giving up dairy prod-
ucts. Not only is dairy a staple in many households, with milk topping most 
grocery shopping lists, but dairy is also a comfort food and a treat. Many 
people grew up enjoying milk and cookies after school and a glass of milk 
before bedtime. But we assure you that this book provides alternatives to 
dairy that will become even better comfort foods because they won’t disrupt 
your digestion.
For example, our favorite dairy substitute is nut pâté. Different nuts and seeds 
offer different flavors, and using more salt mimics the sharpness of aged 
cheese. Incorporating lemon, lime, pineapple, or coconut in the pâté recipe 
provides tartness or a sweet taste. Turn to Chapter 7 for our pâté recipes.
Nut milks are also high on the list of substitutions, and they come in so many 
different flavors: almond, cashew, macadamia, hazelnut, pecan, Brazil nut, 
and walnut. Almond milk can be low in calories and provide a subtle, creamy 
flavor in cereals, smoothies, and even your coffee.
Soy products are another viable alternative to dairy. Soy is processed and 
packaged into an unimaginable assortment of products, including cheese, 
yogurt, and milk. We strongly recommend that you use organic soy products 
because they haven’t been genetically modified.
Rice products such as rice milk and processed rice cheese can fill your dairy 
gap. Rice cheese comes in many varieties complete with the ability to melt 
just the way cheese should.
 
Variety is the spice of life, so rotating several dairy substitutes may be just 
what you need. Try nut products one day, soy the second, and rice the third 
for a three-day rotation; most nutritionists recommend this strategy because 
most foods are out of your digestive tract after three days and won’t build up 
a sensitivity.
Concern about calcium
A common question that people have when they imagine a life without dairy is, 
“How will I get enough calcium?” No doubt you grew up hearing that dairy is high 
in calcium, and it is. However, the high temperature of dairy pasteurization 

33
 Chapter 2: Finding Your Intestinal Triggers
binds calcium to milk protein, making the calcium difficult to absorb. Several 
servings of dairy a day are necessary to obtain enough calcium, but people 
with lactose or casein intolerance just aren’t able to get their calcium in this 
way. What’s left out of the calcium story is magnesium. Dairy is low in mag-
nesium, so if dairy is your main source of calcium, you’re creating a relative 
deficiency in magnesium.
 
Calcium and magnesium levels are both high in green leafy vegetables, nuts 
and seeds, seaweed, beans, and fish with edible bones (salmon and sardines), 
so you can turn to these foods instead of dairy for your daily dose of calcium 
as well as magnesium.
Taking the dairy challenge
If you haven’t already done so, get yourself a nice notebook to use as a food 
diary. We recommend that you keep track of your typical food and beverage 
intake (and your physical and emotional symptoms) diligently for at least a 
week before taking the dairy challenge. This preparation gives you a great 
benchmark because you track the effect your current, typical diet has on 
your IBS symptoms.
 
If you find yourself resisting the dairy challenge, or if you think that dairy 
couldn’t possibly be the culprit in your IBS, please reconsider and make the 
commitment to yourself to do this challenge. Given the statistics, there’s a 
possibility that dairy is involved in your IBS symptoms.
The dairy challenge involves avoiding dairy — and only dairy — for two 
weeks in order to determine whether these foods are causing your IBS symp-
toms. If you avoid all possible trigger foods at once, not only are you severely 
limiting your food choices, but you may become hungry and discouraged and 
drop the whole experiment.
 
Why two weeks, you ask? You typically need three to four days to clear a 
substance from your system and then another few days for your body to start 
repairing any damage the offending food may have caused.
Start by stocking your kitchen with dairy substitutes and giving your dairy 
products and foods containing dairy (read those labels and refer to the ear-
lier section “Eating dairy-free”) to your best friend (who hopefully doesn’t 
have IBS). We suggest that you start on a weekend, and for two weeks, use 
your food diary to track your diet details and the physical and emotional 
symptoms that you notice after eating. After about a week, you may already 
notice the relief of a dairy-free diet. If not, don’t worry; avoiding dairy is only 
part of the exercise.
The challenge part of the experiment comes at the end of two weeks. Make 
it a Saturday so you have Sunday to recover, if necessary, and stay close to 

34
Part I: You Are What You Eat: Food and IBS 
home, especially if diarrhea is your body’s chosen reaction to trigger foods. 
Then simply indulge in all the dairy foods we made you stop eating for two 
weeks, and record the results. Have a large glass of milk for breakfast. After 
a few hours, eat several pieces of cheese. Have some ice cream after dinner. 
During the two-week challenge, your body got used to being without dairy. 
Now that there’s the equivalent of a three-car pileup of milk, cheese, and ice 
cream careening down the superhighway of your intestines, you’ll be the first 
to know if dairy is doing you in.
If you discover that your symptoms never really left and are exactly the same 
as they were before you eliminated dairy from your diet, dairy probably isn’t 
contributing to your IBS symptoms, and the search continues.
However, you may discover that eating dairy again after two weeks off makes 
you feel worse, so you can decide to moderate your dairy intake. Rotate 
dairy choices, and use the substitutes that you’re now familiar with, having 
enjoyed them during the challenge.
The next food you should avoid and challenge is gluten (see the following 
section). Depending on your reaction to the dairy challenge, you can con-
tinue eating dairy or rotate it while eliminating gluten.
Gluten in Grains as a Trigger Food
Gluten is a combination of two proteins, gliadin and glutenin, that occur in 
grains such as wheat, rye, barley, and, to a lesser extent, oats. Its elastic and 
stretchy nature helps make bread dough rise, but gluten also gives rise to 
many IBS symptoms in people who have an autoimmune reaction to this pro-
tein, which turns to poison in their systems.
Linking autism and food intolerance
In a vulnerable segment of the population 
(perhaps as much as 10 percent), a particu-
lar gene sequence can be damaged by heavy 
metals, antibiotics, alcohol, and acetamino-
phen. This vulnerable gene sequence is found 
in people with autism and Alzheimer’s, and it’s 
the template for creating the kinase enzyme 
PI3, which the body requires to help digest and 
absorb gluten and casein. When not completely 
digested, casein and gluten produce brain-
disrupting hallucinogens or brain depressants. 
Not surprisingly, there’s a high incidence of IBS 
and bowel disorders in the autistic population. 
A therapeutic diet for autism eliminates foods 
that are poisoning sufferers. Until researchers 
can figure out how to effectively splice genes, 
diet is the most effective treatment. Medical 
experience with gluten and casein intolerance 
in autism has lead to more research and has 
helped doctors understand the ramifications of 
genetic conditions like celiac disease.

35
 Chapter 2: Finding Your Intestinal Triggers
In Carolyn’s medical practice, she’s seen a spectrum of gluten intolerance 
from mild and moderate symptoms to fully developed celiac disease. (Celiac 
disease, also called gluten enteropathy, is an inherited condition that occurs 
in about 1 percent of the population.) Some people don’t even know they 
have celiac disease and put up with mild to moderate symptoms, going from 
doctor to doctor trying to find the cause. 
Gluten and IBS
Celiac disease is a genetic condition that causes the immune system to attack 
gluten in the diet. However, you can have gluten intolerance or a gluten 
allergy and not suffer from celiac disease. Unfortunately, celiac disease is 
often called gluten intolerance, which leads to some confusion; having the 
abnormal genetic component is the key to celiac disease. Fortunately, the 
symptoms of gluten intolerance and allergy usually aren’t as severe as those 
of celiac disease and are usually confined to the gastrointestinal tract. In 
Chapter 1, we outline how to sort out the symptoms of IBS, celiac disease, 
gluten intolerance, and gluten allergy.
 
According to the NDDIC, celiac disease affects people in all parts of the world. 
It was originally thought to be a rare childhood condition but is now identified 
as a genetic disorder. More than 2 million people (1 in 133 people) in the United 
States have the disease. The incidence increases to 1 in 22 people for those 
who have a first-degree relative — a parent, sibling, or child — diagnosed with 
celiac disease.
As we point out in Chapter 1, gluten triggers an immune response that flat-
tens out the absorptive fingers, called villi, in the small intestine in people 
who suffer from celiac disease. Flattened villi can’t reach out and grab 
nutrients from your food. With hampered absorption, you can develop mal-
nutrition and vitamin deficiencies. Following is a list of some other serious 
implications of celiac disease:
 
✓ Weight loss and muscle wasting, which can occur from poor absorption 
of protein, fats, and even carbohydrates
 
✓ Anemia and fatigue resulting from improper absorption of iron and vita-
min B12
 
✓ Edema (fluid retention) of the lower legs caused by protein deficiency
 
✓ Nerve symptoms of tingling and numbness resulting from B1 and B12 
deficiencies
 
✓ Muscle cramping due to magnesium deficiency
 
✓ An itchy rash due to B vitamin deficiency
 
✓ Arthritis and osteoporosis resulting from magnesium and calcium 
deficiencies

36
Part I: You Are What You Eat: Food and IBS 
Symptoms of celiac disease, gluten intolerance, and gluten allergy are very 
close to those of IBS. Abdominal pain and bloating, diarrhea, and constipa-
tion are mutually shared symptoms, but gas and stool that clears the house 
with its odor and oily, mucus-filled, floating stools (with high fat content) are 
unique to celiac disease. Some people can develop even more widespread 
symptoms, such as tooth discoloration, joint pain, mouth ulceration, hypo-
glycemia, nosebleed, short stature, amenorrhea (skipped menstrual period), 
infertility, miscarriage, and seizures.
In celiac disease, the most difficult symptoms to reconcile are the behavioral 
changes. In children the range of emotions can be from complete withdrawal 
to violent outbursts. Adults can experience depression. In Carolyn’s medical 
practice, she’s witnessed the transformation of many people whose depres-
sion, melancholy, and exhaustion lifted after avoiding wheat for just one week.
 
Even a decade ago, the incidence of celiac disease was thought to be 1 in 5,000 
people; now it’s increased to 1 in 100. How can this happen if celiac disease 
is a genetic condition? The celiac gene comes from one or both parents. If 
you have two defective genes, one from each of your parents, you’re sure 
to develop celiac disease. Some researchers speculate that the increased 
consumption of wheat gluten products may be causing celiac disease to 
express itself in people who have only one defective gene, thus explaining the 
increased incidence of this condition.
Eating gluten-free
In addition to wheat bran and germ, semolina flour, and couscous, among 
others, you may be surprised to find out that food products such as binders 
and fillers commonly found in processed meat; soy sauce; malt found in beer, 
coffee, and cocoa mix; soft cheese; licorice; and cough drops contain gluten. 
It may not be too hard to cut out some or all of the items, but what grains can 
you eat on a gluten-free diet? The many tasty alternatives include quinoa, corn, 
millet, rice, buckwheat, sorghum, amaranth, teff, wild rice, and Indian rice 
grass. We include lots of recipes using some of these substitutes in Chapter 12.
 
If you’ve done some research and suspect that you have celiac disease, you 
should not begin a gluten-free diet before you’re diagnosed by a doctor. As 
soon as you avoid gluten, your intestines begin to heal, and the gliadin and 
glutenin antibodies disappear. When you go for diagnosis testing, the results 
won’t be accurate. Instead, avoid the biggest gluten offender, wheat, for one 
week, keep up your food diary, and check to see if your symptoms are altered. 
If they are, you can keep eating gluten grains until you have your blood test or 
small intestine biopsy.
If you’re diagnosed with celiac disease, the prescribed treatment is avoidance 
of wheat, rye, barley, and oats for the rest of your life. Removing the damaging 
gluten from scraping and irritating your intestines allows the intestinal villi to 
heal and stay vital and healthy for the proper absorption of nutrients.

37
 Chapter 2: Finding Your Intestinal Triggers
Taking the gluten challenge
If you think you may still have difficulty with gluten but don’t suspect that 
you have celiac disease and aren’t diagnosed with that condition, you may 
have a gluten allergy and can undertake a gluten challenge much like the 
dairy challenge explained in the earlier section “Taking the dairy challenge” 
to determine whether gluten triggers your IBS symptoms.
Spend at least one week documenting your normal diet in your food diary, and 
then eliminate wheat from your diet completely for two weeks. (We start with 
wheat because it’s the most common of the gluten foods and the one that we’ve 
found people to be most intolerant of.) Continue to chronicle your food intake 
and your physical and emotional symptoms to reflect the change in your diet.
After two weeks, you may introduce wheat back into your diet, ideally in a 
simple form — perhaps biscuits or pasta rather than yeast bread. Again, we 
suggest that you conduct this wheat challenge on a weekend in case you 
have an IBS reaction.
In Chapter 3, we talk about rotating your diet so you don’t eat the same foods 
every day, and this story helps show you why. One of Carolyn’s patients 
avoided wheat for two weeks and then challenged by eating some simple pan-
cakes made with whole-wheat flour. She noted that her symptoms included 
indigestion and heartburn, but she felt that was tolerable discomfort and not 
IBS-related, so she continued to eat wheat. On the third day of reintroducing 
wheat into her diet, she had a return of her IBS symptoms. When she only 
eats wheat once or twice a week she has no symptoms of IBS.
Karen gives up wheat
Karen suspected that wheat was a trigger for 
her IBS symptoms, which included bloating, so 
she decided to try the challenge by avoiding 
wheat and then reintroducing it into her diet.
Within a week of eliminating wheat from her diet, 
Karen noticed a change in the way her intes-
tines felt — the bloating seemed to be subsiding. 
Heartened by this, she eliminated other gluten 
foods and felt a further shift in her symptoms 
accompanied by what seemed like her first 
normal bowel movements in recent memory. For 
two weeks, Karen was diligent in avoiding 
gluten products, and then she was ready to 
challenge the wheat. Unfortunately she did so at 
a dinner party, deciding to snack on the crackers 
offered as an appetizer. It wasn’t long before she 
felt the gas collect in her intestines, and she found 
that she was holding back uncomfortable flatu-
lence. Karen had to excuse herself several times 
to release the gas privately, and she eventually 
cut her evening short. The next morning she 
welcomed several gassy, mucosy bowel move-
ments, confirming her intolerance to wheat. 
Karen’s experience is very common, including 
the way she began by eliminating wheat and 
then removing all gluten foods. She found that 
she could tolerate oats, barley, and rye with no 
symptoms but continued her ban on wheat.

Part I: You Are What You Eat: Food and IBS 
Sugar as a Trigger Food
Sugar isn’t a food group, but you’d hardly know that given that the average 
per-person consumption of sugar in America is about 140 pounds annually. 
We’re talking about the refined sugar that has found its way into thousands 
of food products to both sweeten and bulk up the product. Refined sugar is 
linked inextricably with special occasions, parties, and just treating your-
self to a sweet. Giving up sugar can seem tremendously difficult to anyone, 
including people with IBS, but we encourage you to consider the effect that 
sugar may be having on your GI system.
Refined sugar and IBS
SIBO (small intestine bacteria overgrowth) may be a newly found cause of IBS. 
SIBO’s role in IBS is still being researched. In the medical worlds, the current 
thinking is that the SIBO may be the culprit for a portion of IBS patients. For 
those who have SIBO, the bacteria in the small intestine set upon carbohy-
drates, resulting in symptoms of gas, bloating, and diarrhea.
However, according to the clinical research of Dr. Heiko Santelmann, refined 
sugar can also stimulate the growth of yeast in the intestines, which leads to 
symptoms of IBS. Candida is a yeast that is naturally present in the human 
body. Excessive sugar in your diet (among other causes) can cause the yeast 
to multiply, leading to a number of health problems, from vaginal yeast infec-
tions to severe fatigue. And these yeast, when present in abnormally high 
numbers, can cause strong cravings for sweet, starchy foods, thus perpetuat-
ing the problem. Chapter 18 gives you more information about yeast and how 
to treat it.
Why eat sugar-free?
Sugar is a simple carbohydrate found naturally in many foods, including 
fruits and grains. If the only sugar you consumed were in natural, whole 
foods, your intestines would be able to cope. But the average American 
diet is full of refined, nutrient-depleted foods and contains an average of 20 
teaspoons of added, refined sugar every day. That’s twice the amount rec-
ommended by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), which 
specifies 10 teaspoons, and four times the maximum Carolyn personally rec-
ommends to her patients.

39
 Chapter 2: Finding Your Intestinal Triggers
So what’s wrong with refined sugar? Many things.
 
✓ Refined sugar compromises immune function. Two cans of soda, which 
contain 24 teaspoons of sugar total, reduce the efficiency of white blood 
cells by 92 percent — an effect that lasts up to five hours, according to 
Kenneth Bock, M.D., an expert in nutritional and environmental health. 
Because white blood cells are an integral part of your immune system, if 
you happen to meet a nasty virus or bacteria within five hours of drinking 
a few sodas, your immune system may be unable to fight off the invader.
 
✓ Refined sugar overworks the pancreas and adrenal glands as they 
struggle to keep the blood sugar levels in balance. When you eat sugar, 
it’s quickly absorbed into your bloodstream in the form of glucose. This 
speedy absorption puts your pancreas into overdrive making insulin 
(which carries glucose to your cells to be used for energy) to normalize 
blood sugar levels. But the rapid release of insulin causes a sudden drop 
in blood sugar. In reaction to the falling blood sugar, excess adrenal 
cortisone is stimulated to raise blood sugar back to normal. A constantly 
high intake of simple dietary sugar keeps this roller coaster going and 
eventually overworks or “burns out” normal pancreas and adrenal func-
tion, leading to abnormal serotonin levels in the intestines, early meno-
pause, adult-onset diabetes, hypoglycemia, and chronic fatigue.
 
✓ Processing sugarcane, or any whole food, strips it of most if not all of its 
nutritional value; the refining process of sugar removes between 83 and 
98 percent of its chromium, manganese, cobalt, copper, zinc, and mag-
nesium. Ironically, the end product, refined sugar, is what you consume, 
and the nutritious residues are discarded and generally fed to cattle.
 
✓ Because refined sugar is devoid of nutrients, the body must actually 
draw from its nutrient reserves to metabolize it. When these store-
houses are depleted, the body becomes unable to properly metabolize 
fatty acids and cholesterol, leading to higher cholesterol and triglyc-
eride levels. Drawing on the body’s nutrient reserves can also lead to 
chronic mineral deficits, especially in magnesium (a mineral required 
for more than 300 different enzyme activities) and chromium (a trace 
element that regulates hormones such as insulin); magnesium and chro-
mium deficiencies put you at risk for dozens of diseases, including con-
stipation, depression, attention deficit disorder, and asthma.
We want you to read labels to understand the hidden foods in your diet, but 
when it comes to sugar, you have to apply for a detective license to find the 
hidden sugars in foods. You probably know the “-ose’s” (maltose, sucrose, 
glucose, and fructose), but there are dozens more names for sugar that you’d 
never suspect; check out Appendix D for a list of these aliases.

40
Part I: You Are What You Eat: Food and IBS 
Taking the sugar challenge
Eliminating refined sugar for two weeks further hones your skills at reading 
food labels and hopefully introduces you to your kitchen to prepare food 
from scratch (because refined sugar is everywhere in prefab food)! For exam-
ple, ketchup contains more sugar than it does tomatoes.
Actually, this is the avoidance and challenge adventure that kids love most. 
To help determine whether there is a dietary cause of hyperactivity, Carolyn 
often tells parents to have their kids do an experiment to avoid sugar for one 
week, then on Saturday, load up on candies and sugar treats to their hearts’ 
content. The kids love the idea of gorging on candy, but then on Sunday they 
look and feel like they’re totally hungover. The kids get the message, and we 
hope you will too. Do the experiment of avoiding sugar yourself for one or 
two weeks, and then eat candy all day and see how you react. You can learn 
a lot about your body this way. Remember that you should honestly record 
your symptoms in your food diary — even if you don’t want to admit to them.
 
Of course, if you’re diabetic, we don’t recommend you undertake this 
experiment.
Sugar substitutes and IBS
Sorbitol is a sugar alcohol that’s neither digested nor absorbed by the human 
gut. Intact, it reaches the large intestine, where it is acted upon by gut bac-
teria and yeast, encouraging them to overgrow. Gas, bloating, intestinal 
cramps, and diarrhea are the natural consequence.
Sorbitol is used as a sugar substitute in many confections — even those in 
the health food section. However, sorbitol causes bloating, flatulence and 
diarrhea — even at only 2 teaspoons consumed a day. If you have a magnify-
ing glass when you read labels, you can sometimes spot the warning “Excess 
consumption can have a laxative effect.” In fact, when we searched “sorbitol” 
online, the third result that popped up was “How Sorbitol Causes Irritable 
Bowel Syndrome.”
Sorbitol is found naturally in prunes and pears, explaining why these fruits 
have a laxative effect. It’s even the principle ingredient of an OTC laxative 
called Sorbilax. Chronic chewing of sorbitol-laced gum can cause chronic 
diarrhea. Similar diarrhea label warnings should be on products containing 
mannitol, maltitol, and xylitol.
 
If you decide to avoid sugar in all its forms, be aware that you’re changing how 
you feed your intestinal yeast. Without sugar, yeast can die off in large num-
bers, and you may experience some symptoms as a result. Yeast can produce 

41
 Chapter 2: Finding Your Intestinal Triggers
up to 178 different toxins that are normally released as they die. These toxins 
may cross the intestinal wall into the bloodstream and cause reactions that 
can feel like allergic reactions. When greater numbers of yeast die off, you may 
feel a little more tired, have a coated tongue, or even develop a skin rash.
Fructose as a Trigger Food
Fructose is a simple single sugar in the carbohydrate family. It’s found in 
fruits; root vegetables, such as beets, sweet potatoes, parsnips, and onions; 
honey; cane sugar; and high fructose corn syrup. Fructose actually requires 
less digestion than white sugar (sucrose), which is a double sugar with equal 
parts of glucose and fructose.
 
Is fructose healthier than sugar? Many people mistakenly believe that fructose 
is a healthier sugar because one of its sources is fruit. The fact that it’s used in 
many so-called “natural” foods also makes it seem benign. Although fructose 
is naturally present in fruit, the fructose that’s added to many commercially 
prepared foods is even more refined than plain white sugar.
Hereditary fructose intolerance is a genetic disease caused by lack of a particu-
lar enzyme that breaks down fructose. It’s a rare condition that only occurs 
in about 1 in 10,000 people. What we’re talking about in terms of fructose as 
an IBS trigger is fructose malabsorption, commonly referred to as fructose 
intolerance, which occurs when absorptive cells in the intestinal lining don’t 
accept and transport fructose into the bloodstream. The intestinal contents 
become supersaturated with fructose, causing gas and bloating and provid-
ing food for intestinal bacteria and yeast. Fructose malabsorption is quite 
common; according to www.foodintol.com, about 30 percent of the popu-
lation has some level of sugar sensitivity, mostly to fructose.
Fructose and IBS
Fructose, just like its cousin, sucrose (table sugar), feeds intestinal bacteria 
and yeast and can cause an imbalance in the number of organisms in the 
intestines. Refer to the earlier section “Sugar as a Trigger Food” for an expla-
nation of the biological problem of sugar in the gut.
Fructose from fresh fruit (sometimes referred to as fruit sugar) has the same 
effect as fructose sweeteners, but fruit can have the added effect of irritation 
due to the insoluble fiber in the skin of the fruit. But remember, fruit isn’t just 
empty sugar — it also has the added benefit of vitamins, minerals, and fiber. 
The goal here isn’t to get you to eliminate all fruit; we want you to be able to 
identify whatever culprit is triggering your IBS.

Prunes are well known and applauded for their laxative effect. In the last 
generation, prunes were a staple in many households (including ours), and 
we fondly remember our mother popping a prune or two to prevent constipa-
tion. Because of their laxative capabilities, prunes have suffered from a lot of 
negative publicity; now, they’re often referred to as dried plums as a way to 
wipe the slate clean of the negative connotations of the word prune.
In addition to prunes/plums, when eaten in considerable quantities, peaches, 
figs, kiwi, pineapple, mango, and papaya have a laxative effect in most people. 
However, for someone with gut sensitivity, it may not take much to cause irri-
tation and increased bowel movements.
Eating fructose-free
Products containing added fructose number in the thousands but can be 
identified by closely reading labels. Most of the fructose you encounter in 
foods is in the form of high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) or crystalline fructose, 
which have nearly eclipsed sugar as the most consumed sweeteners in the 
U.S. HFCS contains 55 percent fructose and 45 percent glucose. Crystalline 
fructose is created by enriching corn syrup with fructose, making it 98 per-
cent fructose.
In the past decade, researchers woke up to the fact that HFCS causes an 
elevation in blood lipids and should be avoided. The American Diabetic 
Association (ADA) used to include food products containing fructose in its 
recommendations because fructose is absorbed more slowly into the blood-
stream than table sugar. Now, however, the ADA warns diabetics to avoid 
HFCS because of lipid elevation.
Eating or drinking 20 to 40 teaspoons of HFCS a day can overwhelm the 
body’s ability to digest it so that it stays in the blood and elevates the blood 
sugar. That sounds like a lot of sugar, but when you realize that one can of 
soda contains about 10 teaspoons of sugar and that many people drink soda 
more than water, it’s not hard to down the equivalent of a cup of sugar (48 
teaspoons) a day.
Taking the fructose challenge
For a two-week period, avoid all fruit and fructose-containing products. If 
you’ve determined that dairy and/or gluten are not an IBS challenge for you 
(see the sections on each earlier in this chapter), you may choose to con-
tinue to eat them during your fructose challenge. Of course, if you reacted 

43
 Chapter 2: Finding Your Intestinal Triggers
to foods from those avoidance experiments, keep them out of your diet, too. 
There’s no substitute for a piece of fruit, but you can use stevia, Just Like 
Sugar, and maybe some honey, maple syrup, or a dash of xylitol instead of 
fructose as a sweetener.
 
Keep a diary of your symptoms before and during the challenge, and see if 
they improve during the two weeks you’re fructose-free. When the two weeks 
is up and you challenge fruit, choose one that you would normally eat — don’t 
pick a new exotic fruit you’ve never tried before. You want to measure your 
reaction to your typical foods, so this isn’t the time to try out new things. Eat 
several pieces of fruit and see how your body reacts. If that goes well and 
you don’t have symptoms, try a bottle of fruit juice sweetened with HFCS and 
assess your reaction.
 
Make sure that you write down all the symptoms that you notice — even if 
they aren’t IBS-related. For example, Christine remembers avoiding fruits for 
two weeks and then challenging by eating strawberries, which had just come 
into season. Her reaction was itchy hives, which indicated an actual allergy 
and not a digestive intolerance.
Fiber as a Trigger Food
Dietary fiber includes those parts of edible plants that your body can’t digest 
or absorb. You need to digest protein, fats, and carbohydrates to build and 
run your body, but you also need fiber that remains undigested in order to 
act like a broom sweeping through the colon. Fiber helps keep you regular. It 
also keeps colonic bacteria and yeast under control, lowers cholesterol and 
blood sugar, and decreases the risk of hemorrhoids and diverticulitis. Soluble 
fiber can actually decrease the risk and symptoms of IBS, which is why this 
section focuses primarily on its less-friendly sibling, insoluble fiber.
There are two types of fiber:
 
✓ Soluble fiber dissolves in water. It forms a gel-like substance that is best 
exemplified by psyllium powder in its pure form. You can take psyllium 
powder for either IBS-D or IBS-C. Better-tasting soluble fiber foods are 
peas, carrots, beans, apples, pears, citrus fruits, and barley.
 
✓ Insoluble fiber doesn’t dissolve in water. It creates bulk that helps pro-
mote the movement of matter through your GI tract. The main insoluble 
fibers are whole-wheat flour, wheat bran, nuts, a variety of vegetables, 
and the skins of some fruits.
The amount of each type of fiber varies in different plant foods.

44
Part I: You Are What You Eat: Food and IBS 
Insoluble fiber and IBS
Insoluble fiber can be an irritant for people with IBS because the rough edges 
of the fibers don’t soften up in water and may irritate sensitive intestines. To 
help soothe fiber-triggered IBS symptoms, you may eat some form of soluble 
fiber with every meal to help soften the intestinal contents, or you may avoid 
consuming insoluble fiber altogether by peeling tomatoes and apples before 
eating them, for example.
In terms of insoluble fiber as a trigger of IBS symptoms, beans may cause you 
a cacophony of gas if you have trouble digesting them. Soaking the beans 
well before cooking removes the indigestible complex sugar flatus factors, 
cleans the beans off well, and rehydrates them to allow them to cook faster.
Nuts and seeds contain insoluble fiber that may cause some intestinal scrap-
ing and digestion issues. You can overcome this problem by grinding and 
blending these foods into butters and pâtés that are more soothing to the 
intestines. We incorporate principles for combating the IBS-triggering capa-
bilities of fiber in the recipes in Part II, and Appendix C shows you the fiber 
contents (soluble and insoluble) of lots of common foods.
Journaling fiber foods
It’s impossible to eliminate all fiber foods in order to perform a fiber chal-
lenge to identify whether fiber is a trigger for your IBS, so we don’t ask you 
to do it. Instead, you should pay close attention to your food diary to help 
determine which of the fiber foods listed in Appendix C may be causing some 
intestinal upset.
 
The connection between fiber foods and IBS symptoms is very individual and 
personal. You may find that certain soluble fiber foods aren’t your friends and 
certain insoluble fiber foods are. And a person with IBS-diarrhea may deter-
mine that his symptoms are triggered by the same type of food that causes 
constipation in his friend who has IBS-constipation.

F
eeling like you have to change your diet beyond recognition can be 
daunting, especially when so many of your favorite foods are now off 
limits. Although you may have to make some food compromises, don’t feel 
like you have nothing left to eat. This chapter makes easing into a good diet 
effortless. It does come with some restrictions, such as avoiding food addi-
tives, synthetic sweeteners, MSG, caffeine, and alcohol, but we also suggest 
plenty of friendly replacements for you to try. Appendix B offers additional 
sensible trigger food substitutes. Just like dating, you may have to try out a 
few before finding the perfect mate.
 
Changing your diet is a long-term plan and not an overnight quick fix. Go easy 
on yourself as you experiment with new ways of cooking and eating. Ease into 
the adjustments and remember that big changes like these take time, commit-
ment, planning, and patience. You won’t wake up in the morning after reading 
this book and have everything in place. But you will wake up with a new sense 
that you have more control over your IBS than you thought. If your commit-
ment falls by the wayside for a bit, that’s okay — just hop back on the wagon 
and continue your journey towards a healthier diet.

Tracking Your Transition 
with a Food Diary
Eating has evolved into a task most people do while focusing on something 
else — chowing down on a TV dinner while engrossed in the tube, or draining 
a latte during a skim of the morning paper. But what if you bring the attention 
back to what you’re eating and how it affects your body? If you suffer from 
frequent burping, heartburn, fatigue, headaches, or if your stools are loose 
or hard, grab your food diary and do some detective work to see which foods 
may be causing those reactions.
Chapter 2 gives you more detailed instructions for creating a food diary, 
which is basically any sort of note-taking system you use to record every-
thing you eat, when you eat it, and what if any symptoms and/or emotions 
you notice in conjunction with that eating. A food diary is an important part 
of the diet transition process for a few reasons:
 
✓ It helps you keep track of what you eat. You may be surprised by the 
number of snacks or sips that you indulge in throughout the day that 
may not quite adhere to your transition plan. If it goes in your mouth, 
it goes in your food diary, including grabbing a few French fries from the 
bottom of the bag or finishing off the milkshake your daughter left behind.
Eating for your type: The blood type diet
In the 1970’s, Naturopath Peter D’Adamo, ND, 
came up with the theory that a person’s blood 
type influenced what kind of diet she should 
eat. Here are some of this diet’s highlights; 
check out Chapter 5 for more information:
 ✓ O blood types need high amounts of animal 
protein and fish in their diets. They have 
problems digesting dairy and wheat and 
may struggle with grains in general. They 
can eat meat, fish, and olive oil freely and 
eggs, nuts, seeds, certain vegetables (such 
as spinach, sweet potatoes, and turnips) 
and fruits in moderation.
 ✓ People with an A blood type can thrive 
on a plant-based vegetarian diet but have 
difficulty digesting red meat and dairy. 
Their recommended foods are nuts, seeds, 
beans, cereals, pasta, rice, fruits, and 
vegetables.
 ✓ Those who have B blood types can eat a 
varied diet, including grains, dairy, animal 
protein, vegetables, and fruits. They don’t 
usually digest nuts and seeds well and 
should limit their carbs.
 ✓ AB blood types can eat a combination of 
the foods recommended for blood groups 
A and B. Their best bet is a primarily veg-
etarian diet with occasional meat, fish, and 
dairy products.

47
 Chapter 3: Transitioning to an IBS-Friendly Diet
 
✓ It helps you keep track of how you feel both physically and emotion-
ally after you eat certain foods. When a pizza is staring at you from your 
kitchen counter, you can easily forget the fact that the pizza you had four 
weeks ago sent you straight to the bathroom or messed with your streak 
of successive bowel movements, making you feel embarrassed and guilty. 
When you write what you’ve eaten and how you felt physically and emo-
tionally, you have it there in your own writing and can reinforce why you 
want to transition away from those foods. Of course, you have to actually 
refer to your food diary and heed your own warnings!
 
✓ It helps you monitor your results over time. You may notice that wheat 
made you feel bloated and gassy when you first introduced it back into 
your diet four months ago. When you try another introduction, you may 
notice that you feel gassy but not bloated. It’s a great way to see that 
you’re making progress through this process.
 
If you feel like you don’t have time to sit down and write in a food diary, use 
the memo function of your cellphone. Depending on your phone, you may 
be able to download the information into your computer and even blog it if 
you want!
Some of our IBS clients have a degree of sensitivity to all five trigger foods 
covered Chapter 2, and as a result, they’ve chosen to avoid them all for a 
period of one to three months. Using food substitution lists like the one in 
Appendix B, these clients have been able to enjoy a varied and healthy diet 
while healing their intestines.
Eating for your constitution: The Ayurvedic doshas
In Ayurvedic Medicine, the three doshas or con-
stitutions (Vata, Pitta, and Kapha) are identified 
according to details about body type. According 
to this ancient medical tradition, eating foods 
that correspond to your dosha balances your 
body and improves your health. The following 
list gives you the highlights of each constitu-
tion’s recommended diet; flip to Chapter 5 for 
more details about doshas.
 ✓ Vata: Vatas should avoid sugar, alcohol, 
and drugs, as well as and cold, raw, bitter, 
pungent, or astringent food and drinks, as 
well as raw foods. Recommended foods are 
those in the sweet (but not sugary), salty, 
and sour categories, along with warming 
spices and cooked foods.
 ✓ Pitta: Pittas respond best to regular meals 
of cooling foods like oatmeal, basmati rice, 
sweet fruits, cottage cheese, and mint tea. 
They should avoid spicy, sour, salty, and 
pungent foods and focus on sweet, bitter 
and astringent foods. Raw is better than 
cooked, with a minimal amount of oil.
 ✓ Kapha: The best foods for Kaphas are 
astringent, bitter, and pungent; less desir-
able options include sweet, sour, and salty 
foods. Food should be cooked with a small 
amount of oil.

48
Part I: You Are What You Eat: Food and IBS 
Rotating Your Way to Health
We mention in Chapter 2 that most nutritionists recommend a three-day rota-
tion for people with food allergies or sensitivities. Some food groups create 
more sensitivity as they build up in your system, so you should only eat them 
every few days; within 72 hours, most foods have cleared the digestive tract, 
and if you don’t eat the same food within that time you most likely won’t 
accumulate an allergy load.
Dairy and wheat are two examples of foods likely to cause such sensitivity. 
You may be able to eat yogurt once a week, but make sure it’s plain, organic, 
and low-fat (if you have problems digesting fat). Rotate wheat into your diet 
once or twice a week so you don’t build up a reaction to it or feed yeast and 
bacteria in your gut. On the off days, try another grains like quinoa, rice, or 
any of the other grain products in Chapter 12 that break down into glucose at 
a slower rate than wheat and therefore don’t feed yeast as readily.
Here’s an example of a three-day rotation using different grains and dairy 
substitutes each day; these combinations are random, so you can mix and 
match the components however you want:
 
✓ Day 1: Grain: Rice cereal for breakfast and rice pasta in a main meal. 
Dairy substitute: Rice milk
 
✓ Day 2: Grain: Millet puffed cereal for breakfast and cooked millet as part 
of a main meal. Dairy substitute: Almond milk
 
✓ Day 3: Grain: Oatmeal cereal for breakfast and quinoa as part of a main 
meal. Dairy substitute: Soy milk or hemp milk
 
When you eat a rotation-only food, write the date on the food box or in your 
food diary so you don’t forget and eat it again too soon.
 
Use the rotation rationale for your whole diet and try not to eat the same 
thing every day or even two days in a row. That way, you have much less 
chance of building up a sensitivity to it even if it’s not especially prone to 
causing problems.
Substituting Trigger Foods
The concept of food substitution is actually the basis of a good IBS diet. This 
book assumes that certain foods in your current diet have something to do 
with your IBS symptoms and that you therefore need to get them out of your 
kitchen and replace them with foods that are IBS-friendly. (We’re not talking 
about substituting plain potato chips for your sour cream potato chips but 
rather substituting something like baked rice crackers for potato chips.)

49
 Chapter 3: Transitioning to an IBS-Friendly Diet
Go through your food diary and notice what foods have left you feeling full 
of IBS. No matter what you’ve been eating that’s been aggravating your IBS, 
you can find healthier options; we list many in Appendix B. Granted, the IBS-
friendly substitutions may not be as creamy, crunchy, rich, or sugary as your 
current faves, but they can help fend off feelings of deprivation as you make 
this diet transition. The more friendly foods you substitute into your diet, the 
more likely you’ll feel relief from some of your symptoms.
Table 3-1 uses a food chart to show you how you can transition your diet. 
We’re making a lot of assumptions in this section about your diet, so just look 
upon this table as a vast generalization about the diets that most Americans 
are eating. The substitution lists in Appendix B are more extensive, but here 
we want to give you a broad overview of your diet at a glance.

Part I: You Are What You Eat: Food and IBS 
Here’s the lowdown on why we recommend these swaps:
 
✓ Processed cold cuts and hot dogs are full of fat and additives. Replacing 
them with antibiotic-free meat (ideally grass-fed beef and lamb and 
free-range chicken) helps prevent yeast overgrowth and antibiotic resis-
tance (see Chapter 18). (We shy away from pork because it may contain 
parasites if not cooked properly.) On the fish front, farm-raised fish 
absorb the antibiotics, colorings, and chemicals used in their hatcher-
ies. Wild salmon doesn’t have this problem, and it has less mercury than 
other fish.
 
✓ Commercial canned beans are often sweetened and have many addi-
tives. Indulge in organic kidney, pinto, black, garbanzo, and adzuki 
beans when the only other ingredients are water and maybe some 
seaweed. Tofu is a non-fermented soy product that is hard to digest, so 
replace it with fermented soybean tempeh.
 
✓ Stevia, xylitol, and Just Like Sugar are allowed in the IBS diet; if you’re 
avoiding alcohol sugars like xylitol, you can stick with stevia and Just 
Like Sugar.
 
✓ The lactose sugar in dairy feeds bacteria and yeast in the intestines. You 
can substitute with nut milk and rice and soy cheese and still use plain, 
organic yogurt. Remember: A good yogurt contains little to no lactose 
because its bacteria have eaten it all. Butter has much less lactose than 
the dairy it came from but you can make it even IBS-friendlier by creat-
ing ghee (butter without the milk protein casein). You can find a recipe 
for ghee in Chapter 6.
 
✓ Fruit and especially fruit juices have loads of fruit sugar that yeast and 
bacteria love. If you have a yeast overgrowth (see Chapter 18), excessive 
fruit may cause a problem; limit yourself to two pieces of fruit a day and 
avoid fruit juice. Vegetable juices are your transition substitution.
 
✓ Coffee, black tea, and soda raise your blood sugar and overly stimulate 
the adrenal glands, which can activate your intestines. Diet drinks and 
alcohol are out of the running as well. “Diet” is more of a marketing 
slogan than it is an actual health benefit. Diet drinks have no calories, 
but they often contain artificial sweeteners; the most common one is 
aspartame, a chemical made up of methanol (wood alcohol) and two 
neurostimulatory amino acids. European studies show that aspartame 
can cause widespread side effects, including obesity and bowel prob-
lems. Alcohol contributes to yeast overgrowth and is damaging to the 
liver. The substitutions are herb teas and water flavored with essential 
fruit and herb oils like citrus, raspberry, and especially peppermint, 
which are soothing for the intestines.
 
 Stevia comes in various flavors to naturally sweeten and flavor water at 
the same time.

51
 Chapter 3: Transitioning to an IBS-Friendly Diet
 
✓ Hydrogenated oils can be irritating to the intestines and also your heart, 
but butter, ghee, and coconut oil are better alternatives. Light olive 
oil and lard aren’t as healthy as extra-virgin olive oil and coconut oil. 
Genetically modified products consistently show digestive problems in 
test animals, so sub genetically modified corn and canola oil, as well as 
vegetable oil, with sesame oil and extra-virgin olive oil.
 
✓ Refined white flour products (such as bread, crackers, bagels, torti-
llas, pizza, cookies, cakes, muffins, pasta, pretzels, and Danish) usually 
contain yeast-growing sugar and bowel-irritating hydrogenated oil. 
100-percent sprouted-grain breads (breads made from grains that have 
germinated) are better for IBS because the grains are not processed into 
flour, which breaks down quickly into glucose, and the sprouting makes 
them more easily digstible.
 
 Miracle noodles may be a miracle substitution for people with IBS, espe-
cially IBS-C. The noodles are made from glucomannan, a water-soluble 
plant fiber. Medical studies confirm that their high soluble-fiber content 
creates bulky stool to relieve constipation; they should also be a relief to 
IBS-D sufferers because their fiber soothes the gut. Manufacturers claim 
that miracle noodles have zero carbs and calories and are gluten- and 
wheat-free. They’re rather tasteless on their own, but they can take on 
the flavors of any sauce or soup.
Finding possible cheese solutions
The Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD) allows non-lactose dairy that you may 
be able to tolerate, but only you can know that for sure. The following list 
shows you the cheeses the SCD has deemed legal for free and occasional use, 
as well as those marked as always illegal. If you’ve avoided diary for 2 weeks, 
you may want to try one of the legal cheeses.
 
✓ Cheeses approved for free SCD use: Brick cheese, cheddar, Colby, dry-
curd cottage cheese, Gruyère, havarti, Manchego, Provolone, and Swiss
 
✓ Cheeses approved for occasional SCD use: Asiago, blue, brie, 
Camembert, Edam, feta (after six months of symptom improvement), 
Gorgonzola, Gouda, Limburger, Monterey Jack, Muenster, Parmesan, 
Port du Salut, Romano, Roquefort, and Stilton
 
✓ Cheeses identified as illegal for the SCD: Chevre, cottage cheese, cream 
cheese, gjetost, mozzarella, Neufchâtel, primost, processed cheeses, 
ricotta, and Tofutti
You can read more about the SCD and its potential IBS advantages in the 
“Benefiting from the Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD)” section later in this 
chapter.

Being savvy about synthetics
Food additives come in many forms and have many useful jobs, but they’re 
derived from chemicals that your body simply isn’t meant to digest easily. 
Many people find this fact surprising, assuming that the government wouldn’t 
allow manufacturers to use an additive if it were unsafe or even bad for them. 
But just because an additive is approved for human consumption by govern-
ment agencies doesn’t mean it’s been approved by your unique digestive 
system — you may simply be someone who can’t digest certain additives. 
We suggest watching out for and even avoiding the following kinds of food 
additives to reduce the impact to your gastrointestinal tract (GIT):
 
✓ Anti-caking agents
 
✓ Antioxidant preservatives
 
✓ Artificial sweeteners
 
✓ Colors
 
✓ Emulsifiers
 
✓ Food acids
All a matter of tastes
Some diet theories (such as Ayurvedic and 
Chinese medicines — see the sidebars in this 
chapter) rely on certain tastes of foods to better 
balance a person’s system. Here are some 
examples of each taste category so that you 
know what you’re looking for when someone 
tells you you’d benefit from pungent food:
 ✓ Astringent: Pomegranate, beans, lentils, 
cherry, foods rich in tannins (bitter plant 
substances that can shrink proteins), tur-
meric, cruciferous vegetables such as 
cauliflower and cabbage, and cilantro
 ✓ Bitter: Coffee, aloe, salad greens (such as 
arugula and dandelion leaf), hops, lettuce, 
radish leaf, vinegar, many dark leafy greens, 
turmeric, fenugreek, and bitter gourd
 ✓ Sour: Lemon, lime, grapefruit, pear, plum, 
mango, many unripe fruits, yogurt, vinegar, 
cheese, all foods produced by fermentation, 
pomegranate seeds, and tamarind
 ✓ Salty: Sea salt, rock salt, kelp, salty pret-
zels, and pickles
 ✓ Sweet: Bread, rice, milk, butter, ghee, 
sweet cream, honey, raw sugar, ripe fruits, 
and chestnut
 ✓ Pungent: Green onion, chive, clove, parsley, 
coriander, peppers, onion, radish, garlic, 
ginger, black pepper, mustard, radish, and 
white daikon.

✓ Flavors
 
✓ Flavor enhancers
 
✓ Glazing agents
 
✓ Humectants
 
✓ Preservatives
 
✓ Stabilizers
 
✓ Thickeners
Most people eat food additives every day and don’t even blink an eyelash. 
They aren’t foods, they aren’t the body’s normal building blocks, and they 
don’t help metabolism. In the name of protecting freshness, additives can 
extend the shelf life of foods for years — you may have heard of the experi-
ments that observe sealed jars of various foods for months or years — but 
you have to wonder what those foods and chemicals are really doing inside 
your body.
Mapping Your Weekly Meal Plan
Earlier in this chapter, we discuss rotating foods and substituting safe foods 
for your triggers. If you have your safe list of foods, you can start to map your 
weekly meal plan. (For help compiling a safe food list, head to Chapter 2.) 
For the first five days, build your daily menus around five of your safe pro-
teins (one per day). See “Planning a menu first” later in this chapter for more 
advice on menu-building.
On the sixth day, test something that you normally don’t eat and then on the 
seventh day try a modified fast — a detox day — that helps your body rest 
and even clears out any reactions from your day-six test. To make about six 
quarts of the detox drink, combine the following ingredients:
 
✓ 6 quarts of water
 
✓ Juice of four lemons
 
✓ 1⁄8 teaspoon of cayenne
 
✓ The contents of six 500 milligram ginger capsules, or 1 level teaspoon 
of ginger powder, or 3 inches of raw ginger run through a garlic press 
or juicer
 
✓ 2 tablespoons maple syrup, agave, or blackstrap molasses

54
Part I: You Are What You Eat: Food and IBS 
If you’re on medications and have other conditions besides IBS, if you’re run 
down, have weight loss, or other medical symptoms, check with your doctor 
before doing a detox day. After you’re clear to undertake this adventure, 
drink five to six quarts of the detox mixture copiously throughout the day. 
You may be surprised that you have fewer symptoms of IBS as you proceed 
through the day. We suggest that your detox day fall on a weekend in case 
you experience any side effects (such as headache, stomach rumbling, or 
feeling generally icky and like you need to stay close to the bathroom). These 
side effects are generally greater for longer, five-to-seven-day detox cleanses, 
but you may experience some effects on a one-day detox.
 
You can also use the drink as a morning elixir (although not five to six quarts 
of it) to transition into your new IBS diet — in fact, we called the drink the 
Morning Elixir in IBS For Dummies (Wiley).
Building your basic recipe list
Part II provides recipes for you to sort and sample using your safe food list as 
a guide, and you may have other resources as well. As you experiment with 
recipes, think about how you can mix and match them to create meals.
 
Go ahead and mark off recipes you know you absolutely can’t have, but think 
about revisiting them in a month or two as your symptoms improve.
Planning a menu first
To get the most out of your meal planning and shopping, grab your recipe 
list (see the preceding section) and figure out what you can and want to eat 
for the next few days. Say you can eat chicken, beef, tuna, eggs, and almonds 
with no problems. These five protein foods will form the structural base 
of your diet. If you’re a vegetarian, your choices are more limited, but they 
may include beans and grains, nuts and seeds, eggs (unless you’re vegan, of 
course), and fermented soy. With five protein foods, you have a protein base 
for each of the next five days and can choose appropriate recipes from your 
arsenal (and add their ingredients to your shopping list if necessary).
If you know what you’re planning later in the week, and have the ingredients 
on hand then you may be able to do some extra cooking on a day you’re feel-
ing good.
 
Some days and even weeks, planning a day ahead makes no sense because 
your symptoms are fluctuating so much. The best plan to have is to have the 
ingredients and foods already in your house so when you feel like you can eat, 
you’re prepared.

55
 Chapter 3: Transitioning to an IBS-Friendly Diet
Shopping for success
Whether you shop online or in co-ops, markets, supermarkets, or buying 
clubs, always take your trusty shopping list and your safe food list (and 
stick to them). You’re likely getting more groceries than before you had IBS 
(because you’re cooking more), and you may be buying for a whole IBS-free 
family, so the trip can get pretty harried pretty fast if you’re not prepared.
 
If certain family members don’t have a lot of patience in grocery stores or mar-
kets, drag them along on your shopping adventures. If you normally shop for 
people in your family who don’t have IBS, ask them to shop for their own food 
as often as possible. That takes some of the pressure off you and it may give 
them the freedom to grab some snacks that you wouldn’t think to buy. Just make 
them promise to store those foods out of your reach so they don’t tempt you.
Reading food labels
Bring out the magnifying glass. Reading the labels on the food already in your 
house isn’t enough — you can’t support your IBS unless you read the labels 
of every food you buy to make sure you know what you’re eating. Appendix 
D gives you a hand with this task by showing you some foods and ingredients 
that may be hiding triggers.
 
If a product that you buy regularly suddenly has a change in its packaging, check 
the ingredient list to see whether it’s undergone an ingredient change as well.
If you have a child who has IBS, have her learn to read labels so she can be 
on the lookout for her own safe foods. Of course, bringing kids to the store 
and helping them learn about product ingredients adds some time to your 
shopping trip, but after a couple of these outings, the little shoppers become 
more invested in their own diets.
Being Patient with Results: 
Charting Your Numbers
Carolyn often tells her clients that a healing program barely registers in your 
consciousness when you only feel 49 percent better, but when you’re 51 
percent better, a light bulb suddenly goes on. You’re finally over the great 
divide and are on your way to health. Keeping a food diary helps you see the 
progress you’re making, and Figure 3-1 gives you a survey to help track the 
improvement in your symptoms.

56
Part I: You Are What You Eat: Food and IBS 
Use this survey to register your symptoms on a scale of zero to ten, with zero 
meaning no symptoms and ten meaning they’re so bad you’re writing from 
your hospital bed. The key helps you to determine if your symptoms are 
viral, bacteria, fungal, or parasitic. Print 12 of these pages and use one per 
month. Don’t peek at last month’s when you complete each new form — we 
guarantee you’ll be amazed that some of your symptoms are lessening and 
you didn’t even notice. Doing this simple exercise helps validate what you’re 
doing and also helps keep you on the highway to health.

Considering Common Diet Solutions
The diets we surveyed to develop recipes for IBS run the gamut of meat and 
potatoes to Raw. We have no prejudices, and we don’t make our diet advice 
into a religion. We simply want to give you information about the diets you 
may be less familiar with and our reasons for featuring them in this book.
 
One size shoe doesn’t fit everyone, so why should one diet? Individualize your 
own diet by keeping a food diary and mixing and matching what works for you.
Benefiting from the Specific 
Carbohydrate Diet (SCD)
Carolyn had the great fortune of knowing Elaine Gottschall, SCD ground-
breaker, before the latter passed away in 2005. Elaine became a hero to 
many people suffering bowel disorders when she discovered the nutritional 
research of Dr. Sidney Haas and implemented his diet to heal her young 
daughter of ulcerative colitis. Elaine’s Breaking The Vicious Cycle: Intestinal 
Health Through Diet (Kirkton Press) is the definitive book on the SCD.
The SCD is a diet for Crohn’s disease, colitis, IBS, and other intestinal condi-
tions. The premise underlying the SCD is that certain bacteria (the ones that 
produce disease) and yeast overgrow to such an extent that they spread 
their byproducts, which become toxins in the intestines that cause irrita-
tion and are absorbed in the blood stream, disrupting the immune system. 
Eating for your constitution: The Chinese elements
Chinese medicine bases diet on the five ele-
ment theory of body type, with a specific food 
taste assigned to each. The Chinese are quick 
to acknowledge that you need to eat a bal-
ance of all the tastes, but if you’re a particular 
elemental type you can emphasize one taste 
to benefit the body. You can read more about 
the five elements in Chapter 5; for more on the 
tastes, check out the “All a matter of tastes” 
sidebar in this chapter.
 ✓ Wood: Sour is the predominant taste that 
can help balance the liver and gallbladder 
symptoms that Wood types may be prone to.
 ✓ Fire: Bitter helps stimulate beneficial juices 
in the small intestine, the most important 
organ for Fire types.
 ✓ Earth: Sweet is the taste that soothes the 
stomach, the main organ that needs to be 
balanced in Earth types.
 ✓ Metal: Pungent foods aid balance in a 
Metal’s large intestine, and they have a lot 
of antifungal properties.
 ✓ Water: Salty foods aid the balance of water 
in the body for the Water type.

59
 Chapter 3: Transitioning to an IBS-Friendly Diet
The overgrowth also interferes with the natural balance of good bacteria in 
the intestines, and masses of yeast and bacteria cause abnormal food fer-
mentation. The foods these bad guys most often go after are double sugars 
(fructose, sucrose, and lactose) as well as carbohydrates in grains and some 
starchy vegetables.
 
SCD belief maintains that yeast alone or bacteria alone don’t cause bowel 
symptoms. Rather, bacteria and yeast are partners in crime, living together in 
groups and helping each other survive. In fact, research shows that a bacterial 
toxin called LPS transforms yeast into a harmful pathogen.
The SCD does not completely omit any one food group and consists of most 
vegetables, nuts, some fruit, lactose-free dairy, meat, fish, poultry, and eggs. 
The diet relies on nut meal rather than flour to make bread and cookies. 
Though the SCD may appear to be restrictive, you may be amazed at how 
healthy and tasty the SCD-friendly recipes in Part II are.
In the vast clinical experience of Dr. Ronald Hoffman (a colleague of 
Carolyn’s), he has found that “patients with IBD often note significant 
improvement in their symptoms within three weeks of starting the Gottschall 
diet. By twelve weeks, the majority are recovering definitively.”
An SCD success story
Here’s an email to Carolyn from Cathy, a 39-year-
old U.K. mother of three children under six, who 
has been on the SCD for 23 days for her ulcer-
ative colitis. Though ulcerative colitis and IBS 
are different conditions, Cathy’s triumph shows 
how the SCD can improve not only digestive 
symptoms but also the psychological strain that 
can come with bowel conditions:
 
 I just wanted to update you on my situation 
as I don’t want to just be in touch when the 
news is bad! After a grueling beginning 
week to the SCD diet (I got much worse and 
was a bit worried but stuck it out), gradually 
the blood stopped in week two and next the 
watery (10 times a day) stool stopped by the 
end of the week. I am now eating a good 
many foods on the allowed list and feeling 
very well. I made sure not to try anything 
else at the same time so I would be sure 
what was having an effect. I have checked 
that all my supplements are SCD safe, so 
have stayed on these. I feel really well and 
so happy to be eating. I just wanted to let 
you know how shockingly quickly things 
began to improve for me on the SCD. I 
have never had such quick results without 
special meds or herbal treatments — just 
FOOD this time! I love the foods and have 
made many delicious things. I know the diet 
states it is often a long road with bumps in 
the first two years but I am feeling very pos-
itive about this being the right thing for me. 
Thank you for all your help and advice — I 
will keep updating you so I can be a part of 
your data collecting! All the best, Cathy

Part I: You Are What You Eat: Food and IBS 
Although the SCD tends to focus more on helping folks with IBD (inflammatory 
bowel disease) than it does those with IBS, we still want to do our small part to 
introduce the IBS community to the potential benefits of an SCD program.
 
The creators of the Web site www.pecanbread.com/ibs have designed it 
specifically to help readers of IBS Cookbook For Dummies (Wiley) find more 
information about the diet and its supporting research.
Eating Raw for IBS
The Raw food movement is the new vegetarianism with a big enzyme kick. 
Every food has its own digestive enzymes that help it decompose. When you 
eat food that still contains living enzymes, you use fewer of our own diges-
tive enzymes to break down food into digestible bits. This shift means fewer 
digestive upsets, better absorption of food, and fewer undigested food bits 
leftover to feed yeast and bacteria.
 
If you take antacids, don’t eat enough protein, and drink a lot of fluids with 
your meal, you suppress your own ability to digest foods, and no amount of 
Raw eating is going to make up for that. Antacids neutralize stomach acid, lack 
of protein makes that acid difficult to produce, and fluids dilute the acid.
Heat destroys the food’s enzymes, so you kill them when you cook food 
above the magic temperature of 120 degrees Fahrenheit. Raw foodists also 
contend that applying high-temperature heat to food damages vitamins and 
changes protein and fats into forms that are more difficult to digest.
 
We’re talking specifically about the Raw food movement here. You can find 
many forms of raw cuisine, including eating raw meat and of course sushi. We 
don’t advocate that IBS sufferers eat raw fish because sushi presents its own 
digestive and parasitic challenges.
Raw is an important culinary style to explore because it relies on unpro-
cessed food straight from the farm. Most Raw food chefs recommend organic 
ingredients, which we encourage you to use whenever you can. Raw food 
retains the rich and exotic tastes that your body craves and doesn’t require 
heavy spices and sweeteners that can upset the digestive system or irritate 
the intestines. Eating Raw also allows you to focus on foods high in magne-
sium, such as nuts, seeds, and deep leafy green vegetables; we discuss the 
benefits of magnesium in Chapter 1. Plus, you may be surprised how quickly 
you can prepare a raw meal and how little cleanup it requires.
 
Some people think they can’t eat Raw because raw foods trigger IBS. Nothing 
could be further from the truth. Raw gets a bad rap because folks with sensitive 

61
 Chapter 3: Transitioning to an IBS-Friendly Diet
guts can also have issues with their digestive enzymes, with not chewing food 
properly, and with drinking too much liquid with meals. The Raw recipes in 
Part II use preparation techniques that emphasize soluble fiber and minimize 
insoluble fiber minimized. We also flag some of the salads as being for folks 
who know they can handle veggies well.
Nuts and seeds also have something of a bad reputation in the IBS literature 
because their tiny shards can irritate the gut if you don’t chew them com-
pletely. Underchewing nuts and seeds causes them to miss an essential stage 
of digestion, which is why you may see those shards in the toilet when you 
have a bowel movement.
 
Soaking nuts and seeds (as well as lentils and legumes) helps improve your 
ability to absorb their minerals. Check out the Soaking Nuts and Seeds recipe 
in Chapter 8 for instructions on soaking nuts and seeds.
 
Don’t let the nuts and seeds stop you from trying our Raw recipes in Part II — 
we blend the offending ingredients to a creamy consistency that is as soothing 
as it is delicious and healthy.
Getting the most out of vegetarianism
Vegetarian staples like vegetables and grains get little respect in the IBS diet 
world because they have all that roughage (insoluble fiber). Even the word 
roughage is like scratching your fingernails on a chalkboard to someone with 
a sensitive gut. Unfortunately, committed vegetarians with IBS tend to live in 
a world of wheat pasta and white rice, only dabbling in vegetables that are 
overcooked and unappetizing. Such a bland diet may keep your IBS under 
some control, but it’s hardly healthy in the long run.
Juicing is one IBS-friendly way to enjoy a vegetarian diet. Throwing away the 
fiber of fruits and vegetables and drinking all the nutrient-filled juice is very 
healthy for the intestines and lessens the chances of irritation. Chapter 8 is 
all about IBS drinks and juices.
Another safe way to get your vegetables is to make a salad and then blend it 
into a green pudding. We can hear the blechs from here, but give it a try — 
you may fall in love with blended salads. If that’s not going to work, you can 
find lots of organic green powders on the market that you shake or blend into 
a green smoothie.
 
Vegetarians can benefit from the reasoning and recipes in the Raw diet (see 
the preceding section) because they incorporate blended nuts and seeds (so 
the fiber is broken down). Nuts and seeds provide an exceptional source of 

62
Part I: You Are What You Eat: Food and IBS 
protein. For example, 1 cup of almonds has the same amount of protein as 4 
ounces of meat.
Looking at organic eating
Eating organic (choosing foods grown without chemical pesticides, insecti-
cides, and herbicides) is becoming more popular and affordable. An organic 
diet assures that your intestines aren’t receiving or having to digest any 
of those unwanted chemicals that may trigger your symptoms. U.S First 
Lady Michelle Obama sparked great interest when she planted an organic 
garden on the White House lawn in March of 2009. Not to be outdone, the 
next month the U.S. Department of Agriculture released plans for an organic 
People’s Garden on the Washington Mall.
According to the Environmental Working Group (www.ewg.org), some fruits 
and vegetables soak up more pesticides than others:
 
✓ Pesticide-heavy: Only buy these fruits and veggies organic if possible: 
Apples, bell peppers, carrots, celery, cherries, grapes, kale, lettuce, nec-
tarines, peaches, pears, and strawberries.
 
✓ Lower-pesticide: These options have fewer pesticides and toxins, but 
you should still try to get organic versions when you can: Asparagus, 
avocados, broccoli, cabbages, sweet corn, eggplants, kiwis, mangoes, 
onions, sweet peas, papayas, pineapples, sweet potatoes, tomatoes, and 
watermelons.

Chapter 4
Stocking Your Kitchen 
to Support Your Diet
In This Chapter
▶ Kicking your unsafe food to the curb
▶ Filling your kitchen with IBS-friendly substitutes
▶ Making your kitchen work for you
You’re sitting at home when your stomach growls to tell you that you 
need a meal or snack. What are the first things that come to mind?
 
✓ I wonder what to eat from the assortment of tasty, healthy treats in my 
kitchen.
 
✓ I wonder whether I have any applesauce left.
 
✓ When is the last time I went grocery shopping?
 
✓ I hate that I don’t have choices.
 
✓ Did I see something move in the fridge?
 
✓ I’m so hungry I don’t care what I grab.
Read the first bullet again and notice your thoughts. You may be mumbling 
“Yeah, right — who has the time?” But most people discover that the mere 
thought of a well-stocked kitchen is a relief. The well-planned kitchen is a 
good friend of a healthy colon.
Now read the final bullet again. How often do you just grab food to fill space 
in your stomach? How does your body feel when you’re so hungry that you 
don’t care what you eat? Feeling like you have no food choices makes the 
stress of IBS even worse, especially when you feel like you have no safe food 
in the house. And choices are important when you’re dealing with IBS. When 
you have been relieved of the choice of when you relieve yourself, you want 
to increase the control and choice you have in other areas of your life.

64
Part I: You Are What You Eat: Food and IBS 
In this chapter, we help you get your kitchen, shopping, and cooking habits in 
shape to support your IBS challenges. Lots of our clients report feeling fewer 
symptoms and IBS attacks when they take charge of their kitchens.
Getting Rid of the Junk in 
Your Pantry and Freezer
Before you can stock your kitchen, you have to unstock it to get rid of the 
things that are unhealthy for you. When you’re hungry, you may be tempted 
to eat whatever is in front of you even if you know you’ll pay tomorrow, so 
the solution is simply not to have bad foods in front of you (or next to you, or 
stashed behind the toaster).
In Chapter 1, we discuss your gastrointestinal tract’s (GIT) role as the gate-
keeper of every bite you eat or drink. Its defense system is all set up to do the 
job of keeping nasty bugs and chemicals out of your blood stream and tissues, 
but it can only handle so much. If you throw caution to the wind and eat foods 
that have 50 different ingredients, most of them fresh from a chemistry lab, 
what’s a poor GIT to do but dump them out in a hurry or hold onto them like a 
failing lab experiment trying to neutralize each chemical? That’s why recognizing 
the type of food you eat and making your kitchen a safe zone are so important.
Take a look at the food you have in your home. Some of it likely is prefabri-
cated, preserved, frozen, heat-and-eat stuff that you may not really know the 
contents of. Survey your freezer and cupboards for prepackaged meals and 
check the ingredient list against your safe food list. You particularly want to 
keep an eye out for these kinds of foods; this list isn’t a complete rundown of 
potential IBS landmines, but it will get you thinking along the right lines:
 
✓ Foods with ingredients you can’t pronounce: If your brain can’t digest 
the word enough to even pronounce it, your colon likely can’t process it 
either, and you should get it out of the house.
 
✓ Foods full of cream and/or sugar: Ice cream (even the homemade stuff) 
and other frozen sweet desserts can be an insult to a sensitive colon. 
Even if you aren’t lactose intolerant, the cream and sugar can loosen 
things up for someone with IBS-D.
 
✓ Foods full of trans fats: Tubs of frozen dessert topping, and the cakes 
you put it on, are full of trans fats, which can act as a laxative in IBS-D 
and disrupt cell membranes potentially causing leaky gut (which we 
discuss in Chapter 18). In fact, most frozen dessert toppings are just fla-
vored whipped oils.
 
Worried about wasting food? Take a few boxes of the nonperishable stuff to 
your local homeless shelter or food bank.

 Chapter 4: Stocking Your Kitchen to Support Your Diet
Stocking IBS-Safe Essentials
An IBS diagnosis (or even a suspicion that you have IBS) is a wake-up call 
to take more control over what you put in your mouth. If you’ve decided to 
purge your kitchen of all the foods your IBS can’t tolerate (see the preceding 
section), you may feel like you don’t have any food left. We don’t want you 
to be feeling deprived, but as you adjust to a new way of eating, you need to 
have healthy choices around you. For everything that you take out of your 
cupboard, fridge, or freezer, we want you to have an IBS-friendly choice to 
replace it with, so the following sections guide you to safer alternatives to 
some of the foods you may have had to toss.
Putting together a list of foods your intestines can handle is the first step toward 
restocking your IBS-friendly kitchen. (If you haven’t compiled your safe food list 
yet, head to Chapter 2 for guidance on setting one up.) Your next task is to make 
sure you have items from that list close at hand. Having safer food choices at the 
ready doesn’t have to be a chore if you know what to look for, and the following 
sections give you some suggestions to start off your shopping list.
Starting with snacks
Many snack crackers, cookies, and chips contain lots of wheat and fat, which 
are two major IBS triggers. However, friendlier options may be easier to find 
than you think. Although white flour has low nutritional value, it is high in 
fiber and an okay replacement in snacks when your choices are limited and 
you’re having symptoms. Try plain white flour saltine crackers to replace 
your whole wheat-based ones (which have the extra insoluble fiber). Coconut 
cookies can have a welcome binding effect in IBS-D and are a better choice 
than most other cookies. Check out our recipe for Coconut Currant Cookies 
in Chapter 13.
Fast food fasting
We believe the fact that this fast food gen-
eration has a 20-percent chance of having 
IBS is no coincidence. A 2004 study looked at 
the daily diets of more than 6,000 children 
nationwide and found that on a typical day 
more than 30 percent of the children ate some 
kind of fast food. This diet means they ate more 
fat, sugar, and carbs, all of which can be IBS 
trigger foods.
Check your food diary to see how many times 
in the past two weeks you’ve gotten fast food. 
Whether you sit down or go through drive-
through, it’s still fast food! If you have IBS-D, 
fast food might also mean that you (well, your 
bowels) move faster after you eat it.. For the 
next two weeks, stay away from eating on the 
run. Just slowing down at dinner time may be a 
relief for your colon.

66
Part I: You Are What You Eat: Food and IBS 
Chips basically come in four varieties: potato, corn, rice, and wheat. Avoid 
the wheat stuff and look for options such as the following in your grocery or 
health food store.
 
You don’t necessarily have to replace your chips with more chips. Try sub-
bing fruits and veggies from your safe list instead.
 
✓ Rice cakes: Many people think eating rice cakes is worse than 
eating packing foam, but you can dress these cakes up with almond 
butter or organic peanut butter. (And anyway, those people exaggerate.) 
We recommend choosing a simple rice cake with two ingredients 
(rice and salt), which you can get from any health food stores. Watch 
out for the flavored rice cakes at the supermarket. Just because they’re 
rice cakes doesn’t mean they’re healthy for you — depending on 
the flavor, they may contain sugar, yeast, milk, buttermilk, cheese, 
food coloring, fructose (fruit sugar), and/or maltodextrin (a food 
additive).
 
✓ Rice chips: Rice chips are made with rice flour, corn flour, and contain 
sesame seeds. Check out all the Lundberg brand rice chips; our favorites 
are the gluten-free Fiesta Lime (which contain a small amount of butter-
milk) and the gluten- and dairy-free Honey Dijon flavors.
 
✓ Baked organic corn chips: Guiltless Gourmet makes a line of baked corn 
tortilla chips. The yellow and blue corn options have simple ingredients 
of corn, salt, oil, and a bit of lime. The flavored options may contain cane 
sugar (which is unrefined, but still sugar) and autolyzed yeast, if you are 
avoiding yeast. We recommend choosing organic corn products to avoid 
any genetic modifications to the ingredients and their potential harm to 
the gut.
 
✓ Baked potato chips: Baked potato chips have less fat than regular 
potato chips. Kettle Brand lightly salted baked potato chips have 3 
grams of fat per serving and the regular version has 9 grams of fat. If you 
stick to the lightly salted option, the ingredients are simply potatoes, 
sunflower oil, and salt. As with any food, added flavors mean added and 
potentially triggering ingredients, so choose carefully.
 
✓ Oat cakes: If oats are on your list of safe foods, oat cakes are a great 
cracker substitute. Nairn’s makes a product with simple ingredients: 
oats, oil, salt, and baking soda.
 
✓ Mochi: Mochi is pounded rice that’s cut up and toasted. It’s crunchy on 
the outside and chewy on the inside, so it can satisfy whatever texture 
you crave.
 
To make these chip replacements even tastier, try them with the dips in 
Chapter 7.

 Chapter 4: Stocking Your Kitchen to Support Your Diet
Sifting through breakfast cereals
Sugary cereals and granola are usually full of a variety of grains, sugars, and 
even yeast. Here are some healthier alternatives:
 
✓ Oats and oatmeal
 
✓ Rice puffs
 
✓ Millet puffs
 
✓ Kamut puffs
Looking at lunch
Frozen prefab pizzas, pastas, and other entrees are quick, easy, and even 
tasty, but the ingredients in most of the major brands are geared to flavor 
more than nutrition. The best alternative is to make your own meals, but if 
you just can’t swing that, Organic Bistro (www.theorganicbistro.com/
organic_bistro_meals.html) and Amy’s Kitchen (www.amys.com) offer 
gluten- and dairy-free frozen meals. You may also be able to find them in your 
grocery store.
If canned spaghetti, ravioli, chili, and cream soups have always been more 
your style, try subbing them with one of the following; just remember that 
anything in a can or box, even if it’s natural and organic, can come with a 
long list of added ingredients that your gut may not like, so check your labels.
 
✓ Amy’s Kitchen (www.amys.com) has a wide variety of canned soups and 
mild chilis. Check their ingredient lists against your safe food list for 
some that fit for you.
 
✓ Eden Organic (www.edenfoods.com) has canned chili and rice-and-
beans options whose ingredients are likely okay for your system.
 
✓ Canned wild salmon
 
✓ Low-mercury canned tuna (in water) or low-mercury tuna in pouches 
(without added oil)
Be sure to also check out the IBS-friendly soup recipes in Chapter 9; prep 
them ahead, and they can be just as convenient as the canned stuff. Salads 
can cause problems for some folks with IBS, but Chapter 10 offers several 
salad recipes that may work for you if that’s your lunch of choice. For those 
who tend to lunch on leftover dinner, be sure to check out the following sec-
tion for more replacement options.

68
Part I: You Are What You Eat: Food and IBS 
Digging for dinner
Whether you’re talking about bags of frozen fish sticks or boxes of just-add-
meat meal mixes, most quick-fix dinner options just aren’t IBS-friendly and 
have no direct, safer replacements. Having IBS tends to require you to cook 
more meals yourself (often especially at dinner), so we want to offer some 
basic guidance on putting together safe, healthy meals; head to Chapter 3 
for more advice on menu planning. Your component choices for main meals 
follow two basic food categories:
 
✓ Protein: Includes lean beef, lean chicken, lean turkey, fish, nuts, seeds, 
and bean/grain combinations
 
✓ Carbohydrate: Includes vegetables, fruits, grains, and beans
Note: Grains and beans appear in both bullets because they contain both 
protein and carbs.
The recipes in Part II offer many choices of healthy entrees — choose the 
ones that are right for your safe food list.
 
How often have you whipped up a box of macaroni and cheese only to devour 
the whole thing yourself while it’s still in the pot? Even the healthier versions 
are full of fat and calories, requiring the addition of potential triggers like milk 
and butter. To get your pasta fix, consider rice, kamut, and quinoa pastas.
Beefing up your baking goods
You likely do at least a little bit of actual cooking (and with IBS, you’ll likely 
have to do a lot more), so chances are that you have some common ingredi-
ents that need replacing with safer alternatives. Baking in particular can be 
quite a landmine for IBS, what with all the flour, eggs, dairy, and sugar. We 
offer safe recipes for all sorts of baked goods in Part II; check those recipes 
for specific ingredient lists, but in the meantime the following list can give 
you a starting point for all your baking shopping.
 
✓ Assorted flours: Use whatever flour your recipe calls for, but coconut 
flour, almond flour, and rice flour are all good places to start. You may 
be able to buy a few cups of flour at a time out of the bulk bin at the gro-
cery store until you determine what works for you.
 
✓ Aluminum-free baking soda and baking powder
 
✓ Butter or ghee (casein-free butter; see the recipe in Chapter 6)
 
✓ Sugar substitutes (see Appendix B)
 
✓ Egg substitutes (see Appendix B)
 
✓ Milk substitutes (see Appendix B)

69
 Chapter 4: Stocking Your Kitchen to Support Your Diet
 
✓ Organic vanilla extract
 
✓ Sea salt
 
✓ Raw nuts
 
✓ Shredded coconut
 
✓ Coconut milk
 
✓ Raw cacao (chocolate)
Setting Yourself Up for 
Success in the Kitchen
All the IBS-safe food in the world doesn’t matter if you can’t find it, store it, or 
prepare it because your kitchen isn’t properly equipped. Relax — we’re not 
talking about a bunch of fancy-schmancy equipment here, just some simple 
organizational and storage strategies (and, okay, a few cool gadgets) to help 
you get the most benefit out of your IBS-friendly food stash.
Keeping tabs on your safe foods
One challenge many IBS sufferers face when organizing their kitchens is that 
they share that space with other people. Ideally, you can designate special 
shelves in the cupboard, fridge, and freezer for your IBS foods out of the 
reach of little hands (or big hands, for that matter).
 
Give your kitchen-sharers some advance warning if you’re going to rearrange 
the cupboards; otherwise, you may spend weeks answering, “Hey, where’d 
you put that again?”
If you can’t get your own shelf, write your name on the packages with a per-
manent waterproof pen or a piece of masking tape. Safe food doesn’t do you 
any good if it’s gone when you get to it. You can also write “Don’t eat the last 
one!” on a package you don’t mind sharing from but want to keep tabs on.
 
If your safe cereal is also a family favorite, buy more than one box at a time, put 
your name on one of them, and insist that everyone else leave your box alone.
Storing food conveniently
If you buy food in bulk or in larger quantities so that you always have plenty of 
safe foods on hand, you need a place to put it to keep it fresh. We recommend 

70
Part I: You Are What You Eat: Food and IBS 
putting storage containers on your shopping list when you first start your IBS 
diet so that you can take advantage of any sales on your safe foods.
The more storage capacity you have, the better, so mason jars, plastic 
freezer bags, and covered glass dishes are musts in your kitchen. Cooking a 
few meals all at once and freezing them is a way to minimize the stress asso-
ciated with trying to figure out what to eat on a given day. (Flip to Chapter 14 
for more on cooking and storing meals in advance.) You can even label meals 
for good days and bad days to leave the guess work out if you’re feeling ill 
and have to eat. We also recommend putting the expiration day and/or the 
packaged date on any containers of food that you set aside.
Having handy tools at the ready
A fun part of organizing your kitchen to be IBS-friendly is that you may get to 
shop for new kitchen appliances (at least the small ones — you probably won’t 
need a new fridge). Certain appliances save you time chopping and preparing 
food and allow you to prepare foods that you may not have tried before.
 
✓ High-speed blender: A high-speed blender (such as those made by 
Blendtec) let you grind nuts and make nut pâté, whizz up frozen des-
serts, and make great garlicky salad dressings in seconds without having 
to use a garlic press. It can take the place of multiple other appliances 
you may have needed to do the same job — a coffee grinder to grind 
nuts, a blender to mix things up, and a food processor to chop.
 
✓ Juicer: Fresh juices are very healing; they give you fruit’s nutrients with-
out the fiber. You can find some very good and inexpensive juicers on 
the market — Jack LaLanne has one for around $100.
 
✓ Spiral slicer: This garnishing machine turns vegetables into a pasta 
replacement with a few twists of the wrist, helping you easily fill your 
pasta craving without triggering your IBS with the real thing. Carolyn 
purchased hers online for about $25.
 
✓ Chef’s knife: Vegetables are an important part of many folks’ IBS diets, 
but chopping them can be a chore. With the right knife, however, chop-
ping vegetables is a breeze. Shop in person for a knife that fits your 
hand and is easy to wield. Carolyn uses a Nakiri bocho knife, which is a 
Japanese-style vegetable knife with a wide, thin, straight blade. Knives 
with thicker blades are used to cut through bones of fish and meat.
 
✓ Wooden cutting board: At one point, health professionals believed that 
plastic cutting boards were safer than wooden ones in terms of cleanliness. 
However, research has shown that wooden boards are easier to clean and 
don’t harbor bacteria the same way plastic ones do. Cutting into plastic 
over and over can also cause tiny bits of plastic to show up in your food.

Your Gut on Difficult Days

W
hen you think of an IBS attack, you probably imagine rushing to the 
bathroom with urgency and frequency with IBS-D. However, IBS isn’t 
all about diarrhea; you can also have an attack of cramping pain with both 
IBS-D and IBS-C. Either attack can be enough to keep you indoors for days.
Whatever causes an attack, avoiding or eating certain foods can help soothe 
your symptoms. In this chapter, we provide some solutions for soothing 
yourself with foods and other remedies.
 
We want to be clear here: We’re not saying that if you eat some blueberries 
your attack is suddenly going to be cured. We simply want you to have all the 
tools possible to help calm your stomach, and those tools can include certain 
foods.
Avoiding Certain Foods During an Attack
When you have an IBS flare-up, you may be tempted to just quit eating 
entirely, but that’s not a healthy solution. A better bet is to understand why 
some foods may make your attack worse, so here we guide you to some of 
those potential bad guys.

72
Part I: You Are What You Eat: Food and IBS 
For example, when you have a sudden attack of diarrhea due to an infection, 
eating dairy or fruit can prolong the attack. Note: This diarrhea attack is dif-
ferent from chronic diarrhea, where ripe bananas and applesauce my help. 
The microorganisms running rampant in your intestines during an infection 
can wipe out the enzymes that digest sugars and instead use those sugars to 
make the perfect meal. This strategy of avoiding dairy and fruit can also be 
helpful for a non-infection attack of IBS. 
Even if wheat isn’t a trigger for you, you may want to avoid it during an attack 
because its gluten can be difficult to digest when your intestines are already 
irritated. And wheat breaks down into sugar so rapidly that it can quickly 
feed any microorganisms residing in your gut. 
 
For an attack of either type of IBS, avoid alcohol, coffee, and soda; they can 
make your symptoms worse because they’re all chemically irritating and 
(assuming you sweeten your coffee) can feed microorganisms with sugar.
So what can and should you eat? The following section details some soothing 
foods and drinks to keep on hand.
Focusing on Therapeutic Foods
The last thing you may feel like doing during an IBS attack is eating, but some 
foods can actually be helpful for your tummy during an attack. Easy soluble-
fiber foods like oatmeal, rice, and bread provide safe bulk for your bowels, 
which means you can eat them as a therapeutic food when you need to. What 
this section focuses on are food remedies for both IBS-D and -C.
Here are several options to experiment with to find your soothing solution. 
You may be surprised by the variety of choices you have, but we want to give 
you as many possible comforting solutions as we can. Remember, particular 
food remedies may or may not work for you at any given time or place or for 
any and all circumstances. It’s a matter of trial and error to see what suits 
your particular condition.
 
But first, a few tips:
 
✓ Pay attention to the foods in both the diarrhea and constipation sec-
tions. For example, if you have constipation but enjoy drinking pome-
granate juice, a look at the diarrhea remedies reveals your pomegranate 
habit may aggravate your constipation.
 
✓ Keep some of the foods for your condition on hand. Just having them 
on standby makes you feel like you’re prepared, and you know how 

73
 Chapter 5: When Symptoms Strike: Soothing Your Gut on Difficult Days
important that feeling is when you’re dealing with something as unpre-
dictable as IBS.
 
✓ Eat small frequent meals so that you don’t stretch your stomach and 
trigger the gut reflexes to dump.
 
✓ When you eat, chew your food well and in a slow and relaxed way. 
Chewing 30 to 40 times per bite can improve your digestion, making you 
feel full more quickly so you’re satisfied by eating less and don’t overeat. 
A sensitive bowel tolerates smaller meals better, less-rapid movement of 
the intestinal contents.
 
✓ In a pinch, just remember the acronym BRATTY. It stands for bananas, 
rice, apples, toast, tea, and yogurt, all foods currently recommended 
by doctors for soothing the symptoms of an IBS attack. Just be sure to 
use white bread, because it makes toast that’s high in soluble fiber and 
can help absorb intestinal fluids, and plain, sugar-free organic yogurt, 
because it has beneficial bacteria for the gut that is very important in 
getting the intestinal flora back in balance. The BRATTY diet is palatable 
for both IBS-D and IBS-C because of the high content of soluble fiber.
 
✓ If you can, try to go for a little walk, even if it’s just around the house or 
your office, after every meal. This habit is especially helpful for IBS-C 
because it can help keep things moving. It doesn’t have to be a long 
trek; just 10 to 15 minutes is enough to get your juices flowing and your 
bowels moving. Make it a regular habit, and all parts of your body will 
benefit.
Dealing with IBS-D
Use your intuition and what you know about your personal condition to 
decide which of thee remedies make the most sense to try. You may find that 
you’ve already naturally gravitated to one remedy or another when faced 
with an IBS-D attack. You can also use the following foods to ward off attacks.
 
✓ Grate an apple and let it brown for two hours to allow it to begin break-
ing down and fermenting; this process makes the apple more digestible 
and puts no strain on an IBS-D gut. The pectin in apples is an excel-
lent soluble fiber that helps absorb the excess fluid in the intestines to 
relieve diarrhea. (Pectin can also help treat IBS-C; check out the follow-
ing section to make sure you’re best utilizing pectin for your symptoms.) 
 
✓ Apple cider vinegar is a long-standing digestive remedy with miraculous 
properties (and it’s our personal favorite). Studies show that vinegar 
slows down the emptying of the stomach; this delay can be very benefi-
cial for IBS because the stomach is less inclined to dump a whole meal 

74
Part I: You Are What You Eat: Food and IBS 
into the small intestines, which can cause symptoms. Take between 1 
teaspoon and 1 tablespoon in water before meals three times a day. Ease 
into this treatment by starting with the lower dose.
 
✓ Ripe bananas have the maximum amount of soluble fiber to help soak up 
liquid in the bowels and treat diarrhea.
 
✓ Blackberry and raspberry leaves are high in tannins (which have astrin-
gent properties that tighten tissues, making them secrete less fluid and 
lessen inflammation) and can serve as an aid for diarrhea. Steep 1 tea-
spoon of either leaf in 1 cup of boiling water for 15 minutes, strain, and 
drink either plain or with stevia as a sweetener.
 
✓ Blueberries are high in soluble fiber and contain tannins that become 
more concentrated when dried. You can eat the dried fruit or make a tea 
by steeping the berries in boiling water for 10 minutes. Blueberries also 
contain substances that have antibacterial properties, which is benefi-
cial if your IBS is yeast- or bacteria-related.
 
✓ Carrots help ease diarrhea because of their high soluble-fiber content. 
They also contain significant amounts of vitamin A, an important nutri-
ent for the health of the intestinal lining. Cook your carrots with ginger 
for the added benefit of settling nausea and digestive upset.
 
✓ Cinnamon in large doses can actually cause diarrhea, but in small 
amounts this powerful spice can actually help relieve it. Use 1⁄4 to 1⁄2 tea-
spoon to add to the soluble fiber effects of cooked oatmeal or baked 
apples, or brew it as cinnamon tea.
 
✓ Ginger tea is an excellent remedy for nausea, diarrhea, and intestinal 
upset. You can sweeten with stevia, honey, or coconut milk.
 
✓ Whole lemon contains pectin, which is high in soluble fiber. Liquefy a (thor-
oughly washed) whole organic lemon (seeds, rind, and juice included) in a 
high-speed blender with 1⁄2 teaspoon salt and then take 1 teaspoon of this 
mixture three times a day. Lemon seeds have an anti-microbial effect that’s 
especially helpful if your IBS is related to yeast or bacterial overgrowth.
 
✓ Mint tea and mint essential oils act as muscle relaxants to intestinal 
muscles to help with diarrhea and relieve gas.
 
✓ Papaya contains soluble fiber and enzymes that help ease diarrhea. 
Grate a raw green papaya and boil it in 3 cups of water for 8 to 10 min-
utes. Strain out the papaya pieces and drink the liquid throughout the 
day. Although papaya can help treat constipation as well, in this form it 
has a drying effect on acute diarrhea.
 
✓ Although raw persimmon treats constipation, cooked persimmon 
relieves the symptoms of diarrhea because cooking releases its tannins, 
which act to dry up diarrhea.
 
✓ Pomegranate juice acts as a powerful astringent that has a drying effect 
on the stool. It’s available in most health food stores; mix one part juice 
with one part water and sip throughout the day.

 Chapter 5: When Symptoms Strike: Soothing Your Gut on Difficult Days
Controlling IBS-C
Make sure you thoroughly wash the following fruits and vegetables before 
consuming. You can also use ten drops of grapefruit seed extract in a sink of 
clean water to eliminate bugs and parasites: Soak for ten minutes, drain, and 
use. They don’t require rinsing after soaking.
 
✓ In addition to keeping the doctor away, an apple a day can help moistur-
ize the stool. Apples are also very high in the soluble fiber called pectin, 
which is an excellent gentle laxative. They can absorb enough liquid 
from your diet to create a soft bulking fiber that helps relieve constipa-
tion. So drink a glass of water with your apple snack. 
 
 Be aware that larger amounts (such as two apples a day) can create too 
much moisture and intestinal gas and bloating, especially in those who 
have trouble digesting raw apples.
 
✓ Unripe bananas can help lubricate the intestines to relieve constipation.
 
✓ Figs contain digestive enzymes, soluble fiber, and fruit sugar, all neces-
sary components of a gentle laxative. Figs also treat bloating and flatu-
lence. You can soak and stew figs (as well as prunes or dates) in licorice 
tea to create a laxative drink.
 
✓ Gooseberries have a laxative effect. Soak 4 ounces of dried gooseberries 
in water overnight; remove the soaking water and add 1 quart of water. 
Bring to a boil, let stand for 30 minutes, strain off the fruit, and drink the 
water throughout the day.
 
✓ Bitter foods with high mineral content stimulate peristalsis, which basi-
cally means certain greens can help you go. Salad greens like arugula, 
lettuce (romaine in particular), and escarole are especially helpful.
 
 If raw salads irritate your stomach, you can cook escarole and drink the 
liquid for its bitter properties.
 
✓ Kiwi, pineapple, mango, and papaya have a reputation for helping relieve 
indigestion and promote digestion. They’re high in soluble fiber and 
their high fruit sugar content draws fluid into the stool to relieve con-
stipation. Papaya also is rich in a constipation-relieving enzyme called 
papain that helps break down protein.
 
✓ Peaches may act as a gentle laxative. You can eat several with or with-
out the skin, depending on your sensitivity. The fruit sugar is thought to 
pull water into the stool to relieve constipation.
 
✓ Raw persimmon can relieve constipation because their raw fruit sugar 
pulls water into the stool. Too much raw persimmon can eventually 
cause diarrhea.
 
✓ Snapper is a fish that Chinese medicine uses to increase the amount 
of moisture in the intestines and promote movement in the intestines, 

76
Part I: You Are What You Eat: Food and IBS 
making it useful for constipation. Swordfish is another fish thought to 
lubricate the stool and treat constipation.
 
✓ Turnip helps relieve constipation because of its high soluble fiber con-
tent, which allows it to absorb water and create bulk to help bowel 
movements.
Keeping Soothing Recipes Close By
When you’re feeling overwhelmed by your symptoms, simply eating can be 
an effort, much less taking a lot of time to seek out and prepare safe food. 
Part II of this book is chock-full of IBS-friendly recipes, but when your symp-
toms are acting up, you may not want to take the time to rifle through and 
pick out one that sounds good. The following list gives you a head start by 
describing some of this book’s most soothing recipes. They won’t work for 
everybody all the time, but they’re a place to start.
 
Soothing teas are always a good bet whether you have IBS-C or -D. If you don’t 
have time to brew tea, put one drop of peppermint essential oil in 32 ounces of 
water and sip throughout the day.
 
✓ Strawberries and Cream Oatmeal (Chapter 6): Oatmeal is high in solu-
ble fiber; make it a little runnier to go easier on your sensitive system.
 
✓ Any of the smoothies (Chapter 8): Smoothies are a must when you’re 
in the midst of a flare-up because they’re an easy, comforting way to get 
the nutrients you need in a small liquid package. 
 
✓ Savoring Sourdough Bread (Chapter 12): As we recommend through-
out the book, sourdough bread is a great soluble side to have on hand. 
When you’re feeling up to baking, make an extra loaf and store it sliced 
in a zipper bag in the freezer for days when you’re feeling off your game.
 
✓ Fast, Colorful Papaya Pudding (Chapter 13): Papaya, a well-known 
digestive aid, can help digest foods that may be causing some irrita-
tion in your gut. Adding psyllium powder to this recipe makes it a great 
source of soluble fiber to soothe unsettled intestines.
 
✓ Goji Berry Tapioca (Chapter 13): If you have IBS-D, the chia seeds in 
this quick recipe bulk up in your intestines with safe soluble fiber. (See 
Chapter 13 for more on chia seeds.)
 
✓ Vegan Khir Pudding (Chapter 13): This recipe contains the healing herb 
cardamom, and using no-carb miracle noodles gives it an extra burst of 
soluble fiber.

 Chapter 5: When Symptoms Strike: Soothing Your Gut on Difficult Days
Exploring Other Helpful Options
Eating or avoiding certain foods (see the sections earlier in this chapter) isn’t 
the only way to take charge of an IBS attack. The following sections show you 
other methods of relieving your symptoms and maybe even preventing future 
flare-ups.
Snoozing away your symptoms
Sleep is a very important factor in healing IBS symptoms. If you have IBS-D, 
the depletion of nutrients and stress on your adrenal glands from loss of 
magnesium can tire you out. Those with IBS-C are often prone to irritable 
tiredness because of the toxins they may be reabsorbing from their large 
intestine; when toxins overload the liver, anger rises to the surface. You may 
notice that your intestines give you the most trouble when you’re especially 
tired or run down; fatigue can make you even more sensitive to foods you 
think you can digest. If you’re forced to pull an all-nighter, be especially care-
ful about what you eat during the wee hours — coffee and takeout may just 
compound the problem. If tiredness is causing your attack, slow down and 
rest as much as you can.
Dealing with stress
Stress can make any disease worse, and IBS is no exception. And good stress 
can affect your intestines just as much as bad stress — your gut doesn’t 
know the difference between taking an exam and standing as an attendant at 
your best friend’s wedding.
When you feel the rumbling in your gut or the cramping in your abdomen, 
stop and take a deep breath. Notice what is going on in that moment. Are 
you rushing to get everyone and yourself ready for school and work? Are you 
sitting at your desk trying to finish a project? Did the mailman bring you yet 
another bill to pay? If you realize that stress is likely causing your attack, look 
for positive ways to release that stress, such as yoga, meditation, or a simple 
walk around the block. Deep breathing can also be incredibly relaxing, and 
you can do it from your chair.
 
Create a part of your food diary to write down your stressors so you can iden-
tify trends in what situations and activities stress you out. Then you can decide 
whether you want to continue them and/or how you can better deal with them.

78
Part I: You Are What You Eat: Food and IBS 
 
Stressful situations aren’t the time to expand your diet beyond what’s on your 
safe food list; if stress triggers your IBS, the last thing you want to do is throw 
another potential trigger on top of that. Resist the urge to just grab whatever’s 
handy or tempting. Flip to Chapter 20 for more guidance on avoiding this emo-
tional eating.
 
In IBS For Dummies (Wiley), we introduce you to Emotional Freedom Techniques 
(EFT), a do-it-yourself stress relief technique that anybody can use. EFT is espe-
cially useful in the midst of an attack because it can have direct effects on your 
current symptoms. You can find out more about EFT and how to use it to relieve 
your symptoms on Christine’s Web site (www.christinewheeler.com).
Treating with medicine
Depending on what symptoms you have, you may be prescribed any variety 
of medications, such as antispasmodic drugs; antidiarrheal drugs such as 
Lomotil or Imodium; drugs that have narcotics like codeine; laxatives; bulk-
ing agents; anti-flatulents; and antidepressants. Sometimes you get the same 
drug for your IBS-C that your friend is taking for IBS-D. So when you’re under 
attack from your IBS symptoms, you may get short-term relief by taking 
Lomotil, Imodium, or bulking agents, but follow the guidelines, which usually 
tell you that they are for short-term use only.
The key word here is short term. In the long term, you have to address your 
diet and lifestyle to find what is making your symptoms worse and to make 
helpful changes. There’s no definitive cure for IBS, but we’ve heard from 
many, many readers of IBS For Dummies (Wiley) who resolved their symp-
toms and resumed normal relationships with their bathrooms. One of our 
chefs told us that a client of hers claimed her IBS was cured when she read 
IBS For Dummies and took charge of her diet. Our chef said that we attained 
the status of rock stars in her client’s eyes! We’ll take a pass on the rock star 
status but are thrilled when our work helps and heals people.
Zelnorm: A cautionary tale about side effects
A possible result of taking any kind of medi-
cation that it can cause side effects. You may 
remember Zelnorm, a drug marketed for a few 
years as treatment for IBS-C because it manip-
ulated the serotonin in the gut. At one point, the 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration demanded 
Zelnorm’s packaging include a warning about 
the potential occurrence of ischemic colitis 
(bowel inflammation or injury caused by lack of 
blood supply to the colon), but in 2005, new label 
warnings only mentioned severe diarrhea and 
fainting. In 2007, Zelnorm was pulled from the 
market after several people who were taking 
the drug died of stroke or heart attack.

 Chapter 5: When Symptoms Strike: Soothing Your Gut on Difficult Days
Medicating acute attacks with 
homeopathy and magnesium
In the previous section, we go over the failure of conventional medicine to 
find something to cure or even treat IBS, but that doesn’t mean we’re going to 
leave those of you suffering from acute attacks empty-handed. This section 
gives you several remedies that can offer at least some relief during an acute 
attack. (Of course, we don’t expect those acute attacks to keep happening 
after you develop your own IBS diet — see Chapter 3 — and implement some 
of the advice in this book.)
Helping symptoms with homeopathic remedies
 
Use a qualified homeopath if you choose to explore homeopathy as a treat-
ment for your chronic IBS symptoms.
You may not know much about homeopathy (treating conditions with small 
amounts of drugs that would produce the conditions’ symptoms in a healthy 
person) except the use of arnica for pain and shock, but it’s the best first 
aid for an acute IBS attack. Each remedy in Table 5-1 treats a certain set of 
symptoms best. Match your symptoms with a remedy or two, and then buy 
those remedies and keep them on hand. Because stress can contribute to IBS 
attacks (see “Dealing with stress” earlier in this chapter), knowing you have 
treatments ready to go may lessen the chances of an attack.
The dosage for acute symptoms is one dose every half hour. In the health store, 
you can find different potencies of each remedy. Choose a 6, 12, or 30 potency. If 
a homeopathic remedy is going to work, it should do so within four to five doses. 
If one remedy isn’t working after five doses, try another remedy. But if you try 
two or three different remedies and nothing is helping — move on to other ways 
of helping your IBS. Note: The pellet forms of these remedies contain lactose, 
and the liquid versions have some alcohol as a preservative. Most people do just 
fine with either, but if you have severe lactose intolerance, use the liquid.
 
Anyone, infant to elderly, can take homeopathic treatments safely, and there are 
no interactions with any other medications or any other diseases. Still, it’s smart 
to consult with your doctor before you begin taking any of these medications.

Making magnesium work for you
One of the really bad parts about having an IBS-C attack is the cramping pain 
that can cut like a knife.
Researchers are still trying to figure out what exactly causes intestinal 
spasms in IBS; some theories suggest that the intestines may already be in 
spasm from generalized tension or from lack of magnesium. In either situa-
tion, taking magnesium is going to help. We cover magnesium and its laxative 
properties in Chapter 1; if you have IBS-C, take two to three 200-milligram 
doses of magnesium citrate/magnesium chloride power or capsules through-
out the day and one glass of water with each dose.
The first doses should help calm you down and begin to relax your intestines. 
If that amount doesn’t result in more relief of your constipation, you can take 
more magnesium up 600 to 800 milligrams of magnesium citrate per day.
If you have IBS-D, you can easily get around the dilemma of magnesium being 
a laxative: Use magnesium salts in a bath or a foot bath, or spray magnesium 
oil on your skin, especially your abdomen. Epsom salts are magnesium sul-
fate and available in any drugstore in the country. Put 2 to 4 cups of Epsom 
salts in a moderately hot bath and relax while the magnesium penetrates 

82
Part I: You Are What You Eat: Food and IBS 
your skin and relaxes your intestinal spasms. Magnesium oil is magnesium 
chloride highly concentrated in distilled water; put 2 ounces in a bath or 1 
teaspoon directly on your skin. It’s available from various online sources 
(such as www.globallight.net).
Defending against infections
Even if you have IBS, you can still suffer a gut infection on top of everything 
else, so you want to know how to recognize the difference and be able to 
treat an infection if you have one.
If other people around you are coming down with a stomach flu, that’s a clue 
that your extra symptoms indicate is a newly arrived gut infection. The initial 
symptoms of a gut infection begin with abdominal cramping and diarrhea. 
These symptoms are so common in IBS that you have to judge the intensity 
and frequency of symptoms to know the difference. You can also have one 
or more of the following symptoms, which definitely indicate that something 
more is going on than just a bad IBS attack:
 
✓ Fever
 
✓ Nausea
 
✓ Loss of appetite
 
✓ Vomiting
 
✓ Weight loss
 
✓ Mucus or blood in the stool
 
✓ Dehydration
The following from Carolyn’s e-book Future Health Now! Encyclopedia gives 
you some tips on treating a gut infection or acute attack:
 
✓ Use dietary treatment first. Antibiotic or antidiarrheal pills can be dan-
gerous and actually prolong the illness.
 
✓ Triple your dose of probiotics (beneficial bacteria).
 
✓ Observe the following diet:
 
• On the first day of your symptoms, drink only clear fluids such as 
soups, juices, and teas.
 
• On day two, eat only rice, applesauce, and bananas. Three times 
that day, take 1 teaspoon of carob powder in some applesauce.

• For day three, you can add dry, bland foods, but nothing greasy, 
fried, or spicy.
 
• By day four, you should be able to move up to a normal diet, but 
do so slowly.
 
• Avoid dairy and citrus for at least a week.
 
• If your bowels loosen at any time, move back to clear fluids.
 
If any of the following happens, go to the nearest doctor or hospital:
 
✓ Any symptom of gut infection hangs on for more than five to six days.
 
✓ Fever and bloody diarrhea or vomiting and diarrhea occur together. 
Dehydration occurs when vomiting and diarrhea are present. Make sure 
you are drinking lots of fluids to make up for all the fluid loss associated 
with with vomiting and diarrhea.
Antidiarrheal pills should be used only to control diarrhea for short periods 
of time when absolutely necessary, such as long road trips. Antibiotics can 
be dangerous when used for diarrhea and should only be prescribed by a 
doctor. They can lead to overgrowth of bacteria and/or yeast in the intes-
tines so be sure to take probiotics as we mention in Chapter 1 if you take an 
antibiotic.
Watch young children with diarrhea; they dehydrate faster. They can go with-
out food for short periods of time but don’t let them go without fluids. Warm 
baths can help to rehydrate.
Preventing infectious diarrhea
The nearby “Defending against infections” sec-
tion presents infection as a probable cause of 
some cases of IBS, so we want to make sure 
you have some useful preventive tips and tools 
to help you avoid this particular kind of diarrhea 
attack:
 ✓ Don’t drink the water, including in ice, fruit 
drinks, and milkshakes. Drink only boiled 
water, commercially bottled water, or 
mineral water (with unbroken seals). Also 
consider other ways you may ingest water, 
such as while brushing your teeth.
 ✓ Don’t eat salads or cut fruits, except fruits 
you peel yourself. Eat only dry foods (which 
are usually safe) and freshly cooked food.
 ✓ Wash your hands often, using hot water 
and soap.
 ✓ Take probiotics every day to keep the good 
bacteria at a high level and grapefruit seed 
extract capsules and/or digestive hydro-
chloric acid tablets with every meal.

Borrowing benefits from other theories
You’re an individual with your own unique symptoms and triggers, so when 
your symptoms strike, you may need a treatment farther off the beaten path. 
To help you celebrate your uniqueness, and so you won’t think you have to 
avoid every food and trigger just because it affected someone else with IBS, 
we want to give you some different perspectives on healing. We give you an 
overview of them in Chapter 3, but this section explores how these theories 
can guide you to foods that may help soothe your symptoms.
 
Read about these theories with an open mind. Don’t be alarmed if you read 
that a certain constitution can eat spicy food or drink coffee because it 
doesn’t fit into the IBS picture. One man’s IBS pleasure food is another man’s 
IBS poison.
(Blood) typing your way to health
No, we aren’t suggesting that you hit the keyboard of your computer to find 
the answers — we know that you’ve already drained the Internet of informa-
tion about IBS. This section looks at the blood type diet and how you can use 
it when your intestines are under attack.
In his book Eat Right 4 Your Type: The Individualized Diet Solution to Staying 
Healthy, Living Longer & Achieving Your Ideal Weight (Putnam Adult), Dr. 
Peter D’Adamo describes the four blood types and the four different blood 
type diets. The following list gives you the highlights of each diet; if you’re 
having trouble calming an IBS attack, find your blood type and see whether 
these suggestions help put your system back in harmony.
 
✓ Blood type O: People who are O blood types need high amounts of 
animal protein and fish; they can’t digest dairy or wheat properly and 
may have problems with grains and beans in general. They can eat meat, 
fish, and olive oil freely and enjoy eggs, nuts, seeds, certain vegetables, 
and fruits in moderation.
 
✓ Blood type A: People with an A blood type can live a good life on a 
plant-based vegetarian diet that includes nuts, seeds, beans, cereals, 
pasta, rice, fruit, and vegetables. However, they have difficulty digesting 
red meat and dairy.
 
✓ Blood type B: B blood types can eat the most varied diet: grains, dairy, 
animal protein, vegetables, and fruits. They have trouble digesting nuts 
and seeds and they do much better only eating small amounts of carbs.
 
✓ Blood type AB: ABs can eat a combination of the foods recommended 
for blood groups A and B.

 Chapter 5: When Symptoms Strike: Soothing Your Gut on Difficult Days
Many years ago, Carolyn did a survey at her local health club to see whether 
healthy, athletic people naturally followed their blood type diet. They didn’t. 
Then she surveyed her patient population and discovered that when people 
were sick and symptomatic and not following a diet appropriate for their 
blood type, they always benefited by making some changes.
For example, when Theresa and Pam, patients from the A and AB blood 
groups, came to see Carolyn with IBS symptoms, they had a lot of red meat, 
wheat, and dairy in their diets. Their symptoms of fatigue, headaches, and 
alternating constipation and diarrhea made them both feel miserable. She 
explained that the foods they were eating weren’t being digested properly 
and were creating bowel toxicity (and feeding intestinal organisms that made 
even more toxicity). She encouraged both women to try a plant-based veg-
etarian diet that matched their blood type-approved food list for 3 weeks; the 
diet’s high fiber content and their inherent ability to better digest this diet 
helped turn their symptoms around.
Applying Ayurvedic medicine
Ayurvedic medicine is a 5,000-year-old medical tradition of the Vedic culture 
in India. It centers on the three doshas (the energies that govern the body 
Physician, heal thyself: Carolyn’s type diet story
When Carolyn first learned about the blood type 
diet, she was in her first year of medical prac-
tice and experimenting with a macrobiotic diet 
comprised of soy products, beans, grains, and 
vegetables. After a few weeks, she developed 
fluid in her lungs; even though she wasn’t sick 
and didn’t have a fever, she could feel the rasp-
ing in her chest and hear water moving around 
the air sacs when she listened to her breathing 
with a stethoscope.
Her macrobiotic doctor friend told her it was 
just a “healing reaction,” but her husband 
and nurse were pretty worried about her 
symptoms — they thought she had pneumonia. 
But she thought the problem was her diet’s pro-
tein deficiency. She’s an O blood type, so she 
figured she didn’t have enough protein to keep 
her fluids in the right places in her body! Plus, 
she was eating lots of soy that upset her intes-
tines because she couldn’t digest it.
She knew she couldn’t get enough protein from 
the macrobiotic diet when she eliminated soy, 
so she decided it was time to eat some meat. 
Within 36 hours of eating organic chicken, her 
lungs cleared, proving her need for protein and 
inability to digest soy — two ideas suggested 
by the O blood type diet. (Check out the nearby 
section “(Blood) typing your way to health” for 
info on appropriate foods for each blood type). 
The information from the O type diet also helped 
reinforce her decision to reduce wheat and 
dairy, which are difficult for Os to digest. When 
she did that, her intestines were the happiest 
they had ever been.

based on a person’s body frame) or constitutions: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. A 
person derives health and well-being from having balanced doshas.
 
We’re giving you some very basic, general information about the three consti-
tutions as examples of alternative ways to approach your IBS condition. In no 
way are we suggesting that you suddenly and drastically change your diet. If 
any of this information feels right to you, please do much more research and/
or see an Ayurvedic doctor.
The following list gives you a quick rundown of each constitution as well as 
some foods you should and shouldn’t eat to keep your system in balance:
 
✓ Vata: A person with a Vata constitution is thin and cool (as in body 
temperature, not like the Fonz) and has dry skin. When the Vata person 
is out of balance, he’s likely to be gassy, flatulent, constipated, and anx-
ious. If this sounds like you, look to salt, oil, and hot and spicy foods to 
warm up your system and lubricate your intestines. Sour foods are also 
a good choice. Vatas have a cool metabolism, so cold foods put them 
even further out of balance, so try staying away from cold foods like 
beer, ice cream, and cold salads.
 
✓ Pitta: A person with the Pitta constitution is likely to be medium build 
with a well-proportioned body. The element that runs the Pitta person is 
fire, so Pittas often have a warm body temperature and a fiery tempera-
ment. If you have a Pitta constitution, sweet, bitter, and astringent foods 
are your best bets for intestinal peace; you can get into trouble and out 
of balance when you stoke up the fire that is already burning in your 
belly, especially the small intestine.
 
✓ Kapha: Kaphas don’t have digestive issues, except a sluggish metabo-
lism that can lead to constipation. Kaphas flourish on astringent, bitter, 
and pungent foods and flounder when they eat sweet, sour, and salty 
foods.
Finding the five elements of Chinese medicine
Chinese medicine discusses constitutions in terms of elements; the five ele-
ments of Chinese medicine are Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water. In this 
section, we give you a quick rundown of the elements and the foods each 
type can use to soothe an intestinal attack.
 
We know that Chinese medicine’s five-element diet theory isn’t an easy sub-
ject. If it seems to strike a chord with you, however, and you want to read 
more, we recommend Harriet Beinfield and Efrem Korngold’s Between Heaven 
and Earth: A Guide to Chinese Medicine (Ballantine Books).

87
 Chapter 5: When Symptoms Strike: Soothing Your Gut on Difficult Days
 
✓ Wood: A Wood type has a tendency to ward liver and gall bladder prob-
lems, possibly leading to constipation. Foods that help relieve liver and 
gall bladder symptoms are in the sour taste category: citrus fruit, pear, 
plum, mango, many unripe fruits, yogurt, vinegar, cheese, yogurt, all 
foods produced by fermentation, pomegranate seeds, and tamarind.
 
✓ Fire: Like a Pitta constitution in Ayurvedic medicine (see the preceding 
section), a Fire type can have problems with digestion and food absorp-
tion when the small intestine is out of balance. The foods that help 
stimulate beneficial gastric and intestinal juices are in the bitter taste 
category: coffee, aloe, salads, hops, lettuce, radish leaf, vinegar, many 
greens, turmeric, fenugreek, and bitter gourd.
 
✓ Earth: An Earth type is a worrier with a slow metabolism and relies on 
sweet foods to soothe the stomach. But too much sweet food coupled 
with the worry can make an Earth feel heavy and bloated and lead to 
IBS-D. To pacify your gut, look to bread, rice, milk, butter, ghee (butter 
without the protein casein; see the recipe in Chapter 6), sweet cream, 
honey, raw sugar, ripe fruits, and chestnuts.
 
✓ Metal: Metal types express their digestive symptoms in the large intes-
tine, which can lead to dryness in the large intestine and constipation. 
Pungent foods help move stuff through the intestines — try green onion, 
chive, clove, parsley, coriander, peppers, onion, radishes, garlic, ginger, 
chili peppers, black pepper, mustard, radish, and white daikon.
 
✓ Water: Water types don’t typically deal with digestive issues because 
their problem area is the kidney. They rely on salty foods to balance 
the fluids in their body, including sea salt, rock salt, kelp, salty pretzels, 
and pickles.
If your symptoms seem to sound like any of these elements, do some more 
research or consult with a doctor of traditional Chinese medicine.

reakfast, more than any other meal, can 
be a touchy subject for someone with IBS. 
You can do the math on how many hours it’s 
been since you last ate when you roll, lurch, or 
leap out of bed in the morning. If you suffer from 
IBS-D, lurching out of bed is designed to propel 
you in the direction of the bathroom as your body 
responds to the adrenaline surge from low blood 
sugar. Morning is when your blood sugar is at 
its lowest, which is why breakfast should be the 
heartiest meal of the day.
You may not want to tempt your sphincters with 
anything bulky, but you still need to eat some-
thing so you don’t become hypoglycemic as you 
start your day. You can’t push your adrenaline all morning to keep your 
blood sugar up. In fact, that action can actually overly stimulate your intes-
tines and cause more activity than you want.
Balancing your blood sugar by eating breakfast serves many purposes. It 
offsets the production of adrenaline and the stimulation of your intestines. It

prevents low blood sugar headaches and irritability — things we’re sure you 
want to avoid. Breakfast done right can nourish your body without you suf-
fering any side effects.
Especially if you have IBS-D, you can begin your day with a calming tummy 
tea and then a safe and soothing smoothie. Because you can enjoy our teas, 
smoothies, and other delicious drinks throughout the day, we feature them in 
Chapter 8. This chapter focuses on breakfast foods.
 
You don’t have to limit yourself to smoothies if you have IBS-D. The following 
breakfast favorites served up with IBS-friendly ingredients should be safe for 
everyone. Just take it slow and easy, use small portions, and remember to list 
your food reactions as you develop your safe food list.
Factoring In Soluble Foods
You can balance any breakfast meal by eating a portion of soluble fiber food. 
Your best high soluble-fiber fruits are apples, bananas, mangoes, and papayas. 
Ideal breakfast grains include brown rice cereal, oatmeal, cornmeal or polenta, 
barley, quinoa, and sourdough white bread.
We aren’t big on white bread, and we don’t mean for you to eat the white 
flour and water paste that passes for bread in the grocery store. Try to find 
fresh, homemade sourdough white bread, or better yet, make your own! 
(See the recipe in Chapter 12.) The reason we favor white bread at all is 
because of its soluble fiber. Wheat bread and whole-wheat bread still contain 
the wheat bran, which is insoluble and capable of irritating your intestines. 
Although you also lose the vitamins and minerals from the bran by eating 
white bread, sometimes it’s a fair trade-off to keep you from having a 
tummy attack.
Shoot for breakfast recipes where at least half the ingredients (or safe sub-
stitutions) are sources of soluble fiber. The soluble/insoluble fiber chart in 
Appendix C shows you the fiber content of many common foods — choose 
the ones that have at least the same amount of soluble as insoluble fiber.
Being Grateful for Grains and Cereals
If you simply want a quick breakfast out of a box or bag, you can try millet, 
rice, or, if you aren’t too gluten-sensitive, kamut puffed cereal. They don’t 
have much nutrition, but they have bulk, and you can dress up your dish 

93
 Chapter 6: Beginning Your Day with Breakfast (Without the Consequences)
with some fruit (like papaya, mango, or strawberries), douse it with coconut 
milk, and be good to go. Check out Chapter 12 for more on grains.
Then there’s the old standby: What would breakfast be without good, old-
fashioned oatmeal? Our grandfather told us stories of his mother making 
huge vats of oatmeal, pouring it into the drawers of a dresser to harden, and 
then cutting it out in bricks as needed!
Oatmeal is high in soluble fiber and can therefore be called an IBS health food. 
You can make oatmeal thick or thin; thinner is better for a sensitive stomach.
You can find different varieties of oatmeal based on their cooking times:
 
✓ Old-fashioned: Oat groats are called old-fashioned oats. They take longer 
to cook (around 45 minutes), are chewier, and may not be as soothing to 
the gut as rolled oats. 
 
✓ Steel-cut: Steel-cut oats are oat groats cut into pieces but not flattened 
leaving them coarse and somewhat chewier than rolled oats when 
cooked. The coarseness may cause some intestinal irritation. Their 
cooking time is about 20 minutes.
 
✓ Rolled: Rolled oats are oat groats steam-heated and flattened into round, 
flat oats. They cook more quickly than old-fashioned oats (in about 15 
minutes). In terms of stomach compatibility, they’re not as coarse as 
groats and steel-cut oats and may be easier to digest.
 
✓ Quick-cooking: Quick-cooking oats are even flatter than rolled oats. The 
manufacturers probably use a laundry press on them (just kidding). 
Because they’re flatter and more processed, you can cook them up even 
more rapidly than rolled oats — in about 5 minutes. They may be easier 
to digest because they are more processed, but they aren’t as tasty as 
rolled oats or groats.
 
✓ Instant: Instant oats are the fastest cookers of all. They cook up in hot 
water in one to two minutes. They may be the easiest on the gut, but 
they have the least flavor. 
 
Instant oatmeal in little packets is a great option when you travel. Use the 
coffee maker in your hotel room to heat water, pour it over your oats in a 
coffee cup, and stir and let sit for a few minutes for lovely oatmeal.
You may have heard that oatmeal has gluten, which can be hard on an IBS 
stomach. According to gluten researchers, most oatmeal contains some 
gluten only in the sense that it’s been cross-contaminated by wheat or rye in 
the field, granary, or manufacturing plant. If you have celiac disease, look for 
gluten-free oatmeal, which guarantees noncontamination.

T Quick Brown Rice Protein 
 
Power Breakfast “Cereal”
Julie Beyer contributed this recipe that’s quick to prepare and easy to digest, tastes 
great, and can hold you over for three to four hours. Julie created recipes like this one 
to harness the healing potential and power of organic whole foods. If you’re going to 
warm fruit for this recipe, try using a steamer. A good tip is to keep berries in your 
freezer — you can quickly steam them when you’re in a hurry.
Preparation time: 5 to 10 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: 1 serving
3 tablespoons brown rice protein powder
2 tablespoons ground flaxseed
1⁄2 teaspoon cinnamon
Pinch of sea salt
1⁄2 teaspoon stevia
1 tablespoon flaxseed oil
1 to 2 tablespoons water
1 cup fresh or warmed peaches
1⁄4 to 1⁄2 cup coconut milk
1 teaspoon shredded coconut
Sprinkle of nut of your choice (optional)
1⁄8 teaspoon each cloves, nutmeg, and 
cinnamon, or to taste
1 to 2 teaspoons of maple or agave syrup 
(optional)
 1 In a bowl, mix the brown rice protein powder, ground flaxseed, cinnamon, and salt.
 2 Add the flaxseed oil and water to obtain a dough-like consistency. If you’re steaming the 
peaches, you can use some of the warm water from the steamer.
 3 Add the peaches, coconut milk, shredded coconut, nuts (if desired), and spices.
 4 Drizzle with a small amount of maple or agave syrup if desired.
Tip: Freshly ground flaxseed is best. Use a coffee grinder to make this healthy addition to 
breakfast.
Tip: Flaxseed oil tends to go rancid quickly. Therefore, it’s best to buy only the smallest bot-
tles and use within 3 weeks. You can buy several and preserve the extras in the freezer for 
up to one year.

1 tablespoon walnuts
1 tablespoon shredded coconut
1 cup coconut juice or water to mix 
ingredients
4 ounces of coconut milk
Pinch of cinnamon or nutmeg (optional)
 1 The night before, put the oats, figs, nuts, and shredded coconut together in a bowl and 
cover with water to soak overnight.
 2 In the morning, carefully rinse the ingredients in fresh water to eliminate residue.
 3 Put the soaked mixture in a blender or food processor with the coconut juice or water 
and blend until smooth.
 4 Pour the coconut milk over the blended mixture and serve with a pinch of cinnamon or 
nutmeg (if desired).
Tip: For all grains (whether raw, sprouted, or cooked), vegetables, fruits, dried fruit, and 
nuts, use 5 drops of grapefruit seed extract in the soaking water to eliminate fungi and bac-
teria. Sensitivity to fungi, mold, and bacteria may be a major reason why some people with 
an already-sensitive gut can’t digest grains, vegetables, or nuts.

Ghee is a type of butter from which all the milk solids have been removed, which makes 
it safer for people who have both lactose intolerance and casein (milk protein) allergies. 
(Butter has no lactose but does contain casein.) Ghee has been used for centuries in 
India; it’s prized by practitioners of Ayurvedic medicine (see Chapter 3).
Making ghee is a fairly simple procedure to heat the butter and separate the fat and the 
solids. The results are magical. Ghee looks semisolid at room temperature. You don’t 
need to refrigerate it, and it can keep for several months. Always use a clean utensil in 
the ghee bottle.
Tools: 4 sheets of cheesecloth
Preparation time: 2 minutes
Cooking time: 10 minutes
Yield: About 1 pound
1 pound unsalted butter (organic if available)
 
 1 Melt the butter gradually over low heat in a deep pot with a thick bottom. Do not stir.
 2 Continue cooking over low heat until the melted butter is a clear golden liquid. It will 
bubble and may foam but won’t boil over if you have a deep enough pot. The milk 
solids will turn golden or light brown and may settle at bottom. You can skim off and 
discard the thick foam.
 3 Remove from heat while the liquid is a clear gold. A darker color means overdone ghee.
 4 Line a sieve with the 4 sheets of cheesecloth and place the sieve over a clean pot. Strain 
the still-hot ghee through the sieve.
 5 Transfer the strained ghee into a clean jar and screw the lid on securely.

Basking in Bread
Would we eliminate the staff of life from your world? Not a chance. You can 
still enjoy bread that is healthy and delicious; this section gives you a couple 
delicious breakfast options, and Chapter 12 has the recipe for our great-with-
any-meal sourdough bread.

T Gluten-Free Pumpkin Spice Bread
You don’t have to be gluten-intolerant to enjoy this great gluten-free recipe. Personal chef, 
nutritional consultant, and cooking instructor Andrea Boje (www.myfoodmyhealth.
com/OurChefs/index.php?chefid=23) provided this morning recipe that’s even 
tastier the next day.
You can substitute 1 cup maple crystals plus 1⁄2 cup sucanat plus 1⁄2 cup brown sugar for 
the 2 cups of sugar. In place of gluten-free flour, you can also try 1⁄2 cup brown rice plus 
1⁄2 cup quinoa flour plus 1⁄4 cup each of sorghum, potato starch, tapioca flour, and millet 
flour. Cover the finished bread with plastic wrap and keep in the refrigerator for a week 
to 10 days. You can also freeze it for up to 3 weeks.

Devouring Dairy (And Dairyless) Yogurt
We love dairy, but because of dairy sensitivity, which causes some nasal 
mucus, we limit our intake to one serving of plain, unsweetened organic 
yogurt to which we add bananas, raspberries, or strawberries. Properly-made 

103
 Chapter 6: Beginning Your Day with Breakfast (Without the Consequences)
yogurt should have no lactose sugars left. The bacteria growing in the yogurt 
should digest all the lactose, leaving nothing for your lactose-intolerant body 
to deal with.
However, not all yogurts are this well made. Because some dairy lovers can’t 
digest milk sugar or even the casein in those yogurts, the Raw food com-
munity has found ways around that specific problem with non-dairy yogurt, 
which recreates the taste and consistency without the side effects. You can 
read more about the Raw food movement in Chapter 3.
 
T Shannon’s Non-Dairy “Yogurt”
This dairy-free yogurt replacement from Shannon Leone (www.rawmom.com) is a

T Kendall’s SCD Dairy Yogurt
Thanks to Kendall Conrad at www.eatwellfeelwellthebook.com for this 32-hour 
yogurt that makes a half-gallon of fresh, rich, Greek-style yogurt.
You need a yogurt machine for this one. You also need Yogourmet (pronounced yo-
gourmet), a freeze-dried yogurt starter containing L. Bulgaricus, S. thermophilus, and L. 
acidophilus bacteria. One box of starter has three 10-gram packs (each pack makes 2 
fresh quarts of yogurt).
Tools: Yogurt maker
Preparation time: 45 minutes (including cooling time)
Incubation time: 32 hours
Yield: Sixteen 1⁄2-cup servings (1⁄2 gallon total)
1 quart organic whole milk
1 quart organic half and half (no careegenan)
One 10-gram package of Yogourmet starter
 1 Bring milk and half and half to a simmer. Remove from stove and cover. Place in the 
fridge until lukewarm, about 25 to 30 minutes. When lukewarm, pour a cup of the liquid 
through a strainer into the inner bucket of the yogurt maker.
 2 Add the contents of the starter packets and whisk 20 times in each direction. Strain the 
remaining milk mixture into the bucket and whisk 10 more times each way. Put the top 
on the bucket and place in the outer container of the yogurt maker with 11⁄2 cups of 
water.
 3 Plug in the machine and leave it for 24 hours. After the 24 hours has passed, leave the 
lid on the inner container and place it in the fridge for 8 hours more.
 4 Spoon into a bowl, add honey and vanilla, and eat!

Savoring Eggcellence
First, we want to bust some misconceptions about eggs. Eggs don’t count as 
dairy, so don’t even go there. You can have eggs — the whites and the yolks. 
The story about egg yolks causing cholesterol problems is just a myth prob-
ably cooked up to sell margarine.

105
 Chapter 6: Beginning Your Day with Breakfast (Without the Consequences)
Eggs do have cholesterol; cholesterol is a fat, and some people are more sen-
sitive to fat, but that doesn’t translate into egg yolks triggering IBS. In sum-
mary, enjoy your eggs!
Having said all that, yes, some people don’t digest eggs well. Neither of us 
do, and we drink powdered eggs for breakfast. Our eggs come in serving-size 
pouches mixed with pea powder and apple flakes. We shake the powder with 
water, and we’re good to go.
 
T Herb Scramble
Chef and nutritionist Caroline Nation, who founded www.myfoodmyhealth.com, con-
tributed this high protein kick-off to the day. You can enjoy it with any herbs you find 
tasty and healthy. For a generally nutritious scramble, try parsley, but it’s also delicious 
with chives, dill, basil, or cilantro. Blanching the herbs for one minute keeps them 
bright green if that’s important to you.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 5 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1 bunch parsley, finely chopped
8 eggs
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
1⁄4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
 1 Bring a medium pot of water to a boil over high heat. Add the parsley (and any other 
herbs) and cook for 1 minute. Drain and rinse under cold water.
 2 Whisk the eggs in a medium bowl. Add the parsley, salt, and several grinds of pepper 
and whisk to combine.
 3 Warm the oil in a large nonstick or cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Pour in the eggs 
and stir gently and constantly until the eggs form large curds and are cooked to your 
preference, about 2 to 3 minutes. Serve immediately.

T Huevos Rancheros 
 
(Eggs Country-Style)
Raman Prasad (www.scdrecipe.com/cookbook) provided us with this traditional 
Mexican breakfast dish from his book Recipes for the Specific Carbohydrate Diet™ (Fair 
Winds Press). This dish, which is featured in the color section, translates from Spanish 
as “eggs country-style,” because it was often served as a late-morning or early afternoon 
treat for farm laborers working since the crack of dawn.
The snap peas in this recipe add an unusual crunch. Anaheim chili is a mild green chili 
that most people with IBS may be able to tolerate. Start slowly and let your body 
decide. If you’re on the SCD (see Chapter 3), don’t worry about the Gruyère cheese — 
it’s SCD-safe.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 15 to 18 minutes
Yield: 3 servings
6 eggs
1 teaspoon olive oil
1 small onion, finely chopped
1 Anaheim chili, deseeded and finely chopped
9 chives, finely chopped
10 snow peas, finely chopped
1 medium tomato, finely chopped
1⁄4 teaspoon oregano
1⁄4 cup fresh cilantro leaves, finely chopped
1⁄8 teaspoon each salt and pepper, or to taste
1⁄4 to 1⁄2 ounce grated Gruyère cheese
 1 Break the eggs into a bowl, mix, and set aside.
 2 Heat the olive oil in a nonstick pan over medium heat. Add the onion and Anaheim chili. 
Sauté and allow the onion and chili to brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the chives and snow 
peas to the pan and cook together for about 1 minute.
 3 Add the chopped tomato and cook until soft, 2 to 4 minutes. Sprinkle the oregano into 
the mixture, and add the eggs. Throw in the cilantro immediately. Add salt and pepper 
to taste.
 4 Allow the eggs to cook for 3 to 5 minutes until they reach the desired consistency, stir-
ring often to make sure they don’t stick to the pan. Top with the grated cheese.

Satisfying the Munchies and Your 
Stomach: Snacks and Appetizers
In This Chapter
▶ Whetting your taste buds with appetizers
▶ Dunking into dips and spreads
▶ Dishing out the fish snacks
S
ome people are convinced that snacking 
is the answer to IBS. Preparation time is 
short, so you can eat quickly if you’re ravenous. 
The snack size is small, and the after effects are 
minimal; as we mention in Chapter 1, comfort-
able eating has to do with the sphincters in your 
gastrointestinal (GI) tract not being stretched to 
the max, allowing food to sneak in and out without 
you really noticing it! Now, those are magic words 
to someone with IBS.
You don’t have to skimp on the appetizers at your next dinner party, either. 
The recipes we provide here let you nosh right along with your guests worry-
free. But don’t wait for a dinner party to prepare your favorites. Spend an 
afternoon in the kitchen whipping up a bunch of these “snackatizers” and put 
them in the freezer for another day.
Of course you can take any meal in this book and make it a small portion and 
achieve the desired results. However, when you want something fast and tasty 
or a few dishes to get the party started right, you’re in the right chapter.

Choosing Soluble-Fiber Finger Foods
The following foods are your best bets for incorporating soluble fiber in your 
snacks and appetizers. Ideally, your munchies and starters should include at 
least 50 percent soluble fiber. Although this chapter’s recipes don’t feature 
all these ingredients, they’re foods that you can add or substitute to raise 
your food-solubility factor. For a broader list, check out Appendix C for the 
fiber contents of lots of common foods.
 
✓ Grains: Barley, brown rice, cornmeal, non-wheat pasta, non-wheat flour 
tortillas, and quinoa
 
✓ Vegetables: Beets, carrots, mushrooms, parsnips, potatoes, pumpkins, 
rutabagas, squash, sweet potatoes, turnips, and yams
 
✓ Fruit: Avocado
Starting Things Off with 
Creative Appetizers
One man’s appetizer is another woman’s snack. We’ve called these appetiz-
ers because they kick any meal off to a great start, but don’t limit yourself! 
They are great on their own to quiet the hungries at any time of day or night. 
If you’re making hors d’oeuvres for a dinner party, double the recipe and 
keep the rest for yourself.
 
T Asian Tempeh Kabobs
Andrea Boje (www.myfoodmyhealth.com/OurChefs/index.php?chefid=23) 
shared with us her favorite recipe for kabobs. Tempeh is fermented soybeans molded 
into a cake that you can cut up into cubes or other entertaining shapes. It’s a great 
source of protein for people with IBS because it’s fermented, which means it’s easy to 
digest and doesn’t produce gas. The key to really good tempeh is all in the simmering 
sauce — it gives it a rich, meaty flavor. Make extra sauce and save it in the refrigerator 
for quick meal prep later, or use it in preparing beef for a stir fry. Frying the tempeh 
first creates a crunchier texture and keeps it from falling apart.

109
 Chapter 7: Satisfying the Munchies and Your Stomach: Snacks and Appetizers
 1 Heat the oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Add the tempeh and cook until browned 
on each side (about 2 minutes per side), turning over with tongs.
 2 Pour the simmering sauce into the frying pan and simmer for about 8 minutes, turning 
the tempeh occasionally so that it soaks up the sauce evenly.
 3 Remove from heat. Put 4 to 5 tempeh cubes onto each skewer and place on a 
serving dish.
 4 Drizzle the remaining liquid from the pan over the skewers and serve.
Simmering Sauce
One 8 3⁄4-ounce package tempeh, cut into 
1-inch cubes
3 tablespoons olive oil or high heat 
safflower oil
Simmering Sauce (see the following recipe)
Six 6-inch skewers
Tools: Garlic press (optional)
Preparation time: 6 minutes
Cooking time: 18 minutes
Yield: 3 servings
1⁄4 cup tamari or soy sauce
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
2 tablespoons rice syrup, honey, or agave 
syrup
1 teaspoon ginger juice, or small piece of 
ginger, peeled and grated
1 tablespoon minced garlic, or 2 to 3 garlic 
cloves run through a garlic press
 1 In a small bowl, mix the tamari, vinegar, rice syrup, ginger juice, and garlic until rice 
syrup has dissolved.
Vary It! Add 2 teaspoons of chopped lemongrass to the sauce for a Thai influence, or add 
1⁄4 cup of pineapple or orange juice and 1⁄2 teaspoon of lemon zest to marinade for a tropi-
cal tang.
Tip: Having a barbeque? Make the skewers up to 2 days ahead of time and then put them 
on the grill for about 5 minutes to reheat.

T Oven-Baked Yam 
 
(or Potato) UnFries
Thanks to our healing chef, Colleen Robinson (www.crimsondoorhealing.com) for 
this simple but delicious substitution for the universal fries. Lots of restaurants have 
the deep-fried version on the appetizer menu, but the baked yam version is a great 
alternative for IBS because it has less fat, which can be a trigger. And the UnFries have a 
sweet taste, so they quickly become a treat. Don’t forgo the parchment paper here. It 
seems silly but trust us — it lets you get away with making the fries all crispy and 
happy with very little oil. Parsley or a French herb mix works well for the dried herb.
Tools: Parchment paper
Preparation time: 45 minutes
Cooking time: 30 minutes
Yield: 1 serving
1 medium yam or potato, or 1 large handful 
new baby potatoes
1⁄4 teaspoon sea salt
1⁄2 teaspoon dried herbs of choice
 1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Cover a couple of cookie sheets with parchment 
paper.
 2 Coarsely chop the yam/potatoes into pieces roughly the same size (so they cook 
evenly). Soak the yam/potato pieces in a bowl of cold water for 30 minutes to pull out 
extra starch and make them crispier.
 3 Strain out the water but do not leave the yams/potatoes to dry. Instead, immediately 
toss them with the sea salt and herbs.
 4 Lightly spray the parchment paper with cooking spray and then spread the yams/
potatoes out in a single layer. Don’t cram them in — they won’t cook as crispily and 
they’ll take longer.
 5 Bake for about 15 minutes, flip them over with a spatula, and cook for another 15 min-
utes so that they’re nice and soft on the inside and crisp on the outside.
Tip: If you really fall in love with this recipe, invest in a mandoline slicer to cut your yams/
potatoes up in a jiffy.

Green Chicken Egg Bake
Thanks to Michelle Gay (www.eatingjourney.wordpress.com) from Australia for this 
quick and easy starter for one, which is featured in the color section. Michelle is a farm girl 
from Oregon who is a house mom for students at an Australian university. We don’t know 
whether she feeds her students her delicious recipes, but they would certainly benefit!
For this recipe, we recommend you use free-range chicken because they are grain-fed and 
free of growth hormones and antibiotics and are therefore healthier for the IBS tummy. 
With any chicken dish, be sure to cook whatever kind of chicken you use well. As you 
become more familiar with this dish, you may find that you don’t need to grease the pan.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 35 minutes
Yield: 1 serving
4 ounces of chicken breast meat, diced
1 stalk of celery, diced
1 teaspoon olive or peanut oil
2 eggs
3⁄8 cup water
1 cup spinach
1⁄8 teaspoon each salt and pepper
1⁄4 cup cheese, onions, peppers, bacon, or 
other leftovers (optional)
 1 Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Grease a loaf pan and set aside.
 2 In a skillet, heat the olive or peanut oil over medium heat. Add in the celery and cook 
for about 1 to 2 minutes.
 3 Season the chicken with salt and pepper and add it to the skillet with about 1⁄4 cup of the 
water. Continue stirring until the chicken is cooked and remove from the heat.
 4 In a separate bowl, whisk or beat the eggs and 1⁄8 cup of water with a fork. Add the spin-
ach and any optional ingredients (if desired).
 5 Place the chicken/celery mixture in the bottom of the loaf pan and cover with the egg/
spinach mixture. Bake for about 20 minutes or until a knife comes out clean, meaning 
the egg is cooked.
Vary It! Sprinkle the cheese on top of the dish as it bakes instead of mixing it in with the 
eggs.
Tip: If the spinach is poking out and getting burned, you can add more eggs to cover every-
thing up.

Quick ‘n’ Easy Quiche
Thanks to Colleen Robinson (www.crimsondoorhealing.com) for her contribution 
of this appetizer for the whole family. This recipe is easy to assemble, but it does take 
40 minutes to cook, which gives you time to clean the kitchen! If you’re looking for 
cheeses that are compatible with the Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD), you can use 
cheddar, havarti, brick cheese, Colby, Gruyère, or Swiss. (Check out Chapter 3 for more 
on the SCD.) Use soy creamer so that the creamer doesn’t separate. And don’t skip the 
hole-poking in the pie crust; it really does make a difference.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 40 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
3 egg whites, beaten with a fork
2⁄3 cup chicken broth, preferably organic
1⁄4 cup soy creamer
2 teaspoons fresh parsley, finely chopped
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
1⁄4 cup Parmesan cheese
1 cup mushrooms, cleaned and sliced
1⁄3 of a 10-ounce package frozen chopped 
spinach, thawed and drained
1⁄4 cup green onions (tops only), sliced thinly
9-inch frozen pie crust, unbaked
 1 Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.
 2 In a bowl beat egg whites with the broth, soy creamer, parsley, and salt. Set aside.
 3 Use a fork to poke holes in the bottom of the frozen pie crust. Bake the crust for 5 min-
utes and take it out of the oven.
 4 Spread the spinach over the bottom of the crust and then sprinkle the green onions and 
mushrooms over the spinach. Pour the egg mixture over the spinach, onions, and 
mushrooms and sprinkle the Parmesan on top.
 5 Bake for 10 minutes and then lower the heat to 325 and bake for 25 minutes more. It’s 
done when you can stick a knife in the middle and it doesn’t come out with raw egg on it.
Tip: Clean your mushrooms by brushing them rather than washing them. Although you may 
be inclined to wash a fungus that grows in cool, dark, moist soil, chefs insist that washing 
mushrooms makes them mushy. You can buy a mushroom brush or cheat and buy a cheap, 
soft toothbrush; brush all the junk off them and cut the bottom bit off, and you’re good to go.

T Nori Rolls
Chef and nutritionist Shannon Leone at www.rawmom.com provided this recipe. If 
you’re in a rush, you can substitute avocado for the nut pâté. The nut pâté, nori, and 
zucchini are all IBS-friendly because of their soluble-fiber content. If you’re worried 
about digesting the carrots, either eliminate them or shred them with a vegetable 
peeler. The same goes for green onions — cut them extra fine if you tend to have prob-
lems stomaching them.
Preparation time: 45 minutes
Yield: 8 servings
4 sheets nori
1 cup Basic Nut or Seed Pâté (see the recipe 
later in this chapter), or 1 cup Shannon’s 
Quick Rice (see the recipe in Chapter 12)
1 carrot, julienned or grated
1 zucchini or cucumber, julienned
1 green onion, chopped
1⁄2 a green apple or pineapple, sliced thinly and 
julienned
 1 Lay out one sheet of the nori at a time on a cutting board. Spread the nut pâté on the 
nori sheet and then place vegetables and fruit lengthwise on top of the pâté.
 2 Roll the sheet into a cylinder and seal it with a wet finger. Let it stand for 30 minutes 
and then slice it into 6 pieces. Repeat Steps 1 and 2 for the rest of the nori sheets.

Dipping for Chips
Dips are great snack treats if you have IBS. The fact that they’re in paste form 
means the insoluble fiber is easier to digest because it’s already been broken 
down. With seed and nut butters, the nasty sharp bits of the nuts and seeds 
are ground down so that they’re friendlier to sensitive stomachs. 
 
You can try any assortment of chips available in your grocery store or health 
food store as edible scoops. You can also dip with cut up vegetables, or 
slather the goodness on pieces of flat bread or sprouted bread (bread made 
from whole grains that have sprouted or germinated).

114
Part II: Eating For Your Intestinal Health 
Note that some of these dip recipes contain somewhat involved processes or 
unusual ingredients you may not be familiar with. We encourage you to make 
the leap and wander down those uncharted aisles of the grocery store — you 
never know what other treasures you may find.
 
T Mango Salsa
Raman Prasad created this cool and delicious SCD mango salsa for his book Recipes for 
the Specific Carbohydrate Diet™ (Fair Winds Press); check him out at www.scdrecipe.
com/cookbook, and find a photo of the salsa in this book’s color section. The serrano 
chili is optional in this dish, and leaving it out makes the salsa IBS-friendly, especially if 
eaten with a soluble side like quinoa or organic baked corn chips. Raman also suggests 
partnering it with the Herbed Tilapia with Lime in Chapter 11. 
The raw onions and peppers in this dish may be setting off your IBS alarm, and if these 
foods have been a problem for you in the past, you’re right to shy away. But if these 
ingredients don’t specifically trigger you, consider the following: This recipe was cre-
ated by a young gentleman who suffered ulcerative colitis from age 17 until he found his 
cure in the SCD, which allows vegetables and some spices while outlawing grains, lac-
tose, and sucrose. If your IBS is triggered by lactose, sucrose, or grains, vegetables may 
not be such a problem for you, and this salsa may help you find health, not hurt.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: 6 servings
2 ripe mangoes, peeled and diced
1 serrano chili, finely chopped (optional)
2 green onions, finely chopped
1⁄2 red pepper, finely chopped
1⁄2 yellow pepper, finely chopped
1 cup fresh cilantro, finely chopped
Juice of 1 lime (about 2 tablespoons), 
or to taste
 1 Mix the mango pieces with the chopped chili, green onions, red and yellow bell pep-
pers, cilantro, and lime juice in a bowl to serve as a dip or as an accompaniment to 
guacamole.
Tip: You also can serve Mango Salsa as a side with any of our chicken, turkey, or fish main 
dishes in Chapter 11 (except maybe curried shrimp). We pair it with Coconut Panko 
Shrimp in the color insert.

T Celery Root Tahini Dip
You can eat this dip on its own or with vegetables and/or crackers. Herbs de Provence is 
just a fancy name for a blend of herbs like savory, fennel, basil, thyme, and lavender. 
Tahini is a paste made of ground sesame seeds. Julie Beyer has modified many recipes 
such as this one to accommodate her own food sensitivities and teaches people to cook 
their own special, healthy meals using organic ingredients.
Tools: Potato masher (optional)
Preparation Time: 20 minutes
Cooking Time: 12 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1 medium celery root, skinned and chopped 
(about 2 cups)
2 tablespoons of olive oil or coconut oil
1⁄2 an onion
1 to 2 cloves garlic
1 teaspoon turmeric
1⁄2 to 1 teaspoon sea salt
11⁄2 teaspoons of Herbs de Provence mixture 
or rosemary
2 tablespoons tahini
Juice of 1⁄2 a lemon (about 1⁄8 cup)
1⁄8 teaspoon each sea salt and pepper, 
or to taste 
 1 Boil the celery root for about 5 minutes or until tender and then drain it and place it in a 
bowl.
 2 Fry the onions and garlic in the oil and then add the celery root, turmeric, sea salt, and 
herbs. Stir until the celery root is lightly browned.
 3 Add the tahini and lemon juice. You can eat the mixture as-is at this point, mash it with 
a potato masher, or process it in a blender.
 4 Add sea salt and pepper to taste.
Vary It! If you don’t have celery root, you can try celery as the base of this dip, although it 
doesn’t give as rich a taste.

T Basic Nut or Seed Pâté
Every Raw food chef has his favorite nut pâté, but all the recipes begin with the basic five 
ingredients: nuts or seeds, lemon juice, garlic, salt, and water. Juliano’s Nut Cheeze is our 
inspiration for this nut pâté. His recipe boasts about 10 ingredients and takes a few min-
utes longer to prepare, but this recipe couldn’t be any simpler, and it’s all you need.
Twelve servings may seem like a lot, but the serving size is 2 tablespoons. It’s so rich 
and concentrated that that’s the perfect amount for a wrap or a salad dressing. For 
wraps, make the pâté a thicker consistency like peanut butter; for sauces (such as to 
pour over pasta), make it a thinner consistency. This recipe will keep in the fridge for 
several days because the garlic is a natural preservative.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: Twenty-four 2-tablespoon servings (3 cups total)
2 cups of seeds or nuts (such as sunflower 
seeds, pumpkin seeds, almonds, macadamia 
nuts, or cashews)
Juice of 3 lemons (about 3⁄4 cup)
1⁄4 cup of water
1 heaping teaspoon of sea salt
4 cloves garlic
 1 Grind the nuts or seeds in a coffee grinder or high-speed blender. If you use a coffee 
grinder, we recommend grinding 1⁄4 cup at a time. Set aside the powdered mixture in 
a bowl.
 2 Blend the lemon juice, water, salt, and garlic in a blender or food processor.
 3 Add the powdered mixture to the lemon juice mixture and blend. To create the desired 
consistency, you may have to add another few tablespoons of water and lemon juice.
Solving the solubility problem with pea powder
Grinding nuts and seeds helps their insoluble 
fiber become much more digestible. However, if 
you still find powdered nuts and seeds slightly 
irritating, we have a solution for you. We both 
use a protein powder consisting of pea powder, 
whole eggs, and apple flakes, and our tummies 
love it. We suggest adding soluble-fiber pea 
powder in nut- and seed-based recipes to 
increase the soluble fiber content and help neu-
tralize any possibility of irritation. One to two 
ounces of pea powder in a recipe can usually 
balance one to two cups of ground nuts or seeds.

117
 Chapter 7: Satisfying the Munchies and Your Stomach: Snacks and Appetizers
Vary It! To change the color, taste, and texture of the pâté, you can add 1⁄2 cup finely 
chopped or food-processed onion, or 1 teaspoon turmeric, or 1 teaspoon of powdered 
ginger, or 1⁄4 cup of finely chopped fresh basil.
Tip: Add pea powder to increase the soluble fiber content. Add 1 ounce of powder and an 
extra ounce of water per cup of seeds. (See the nearby sidebar “Solving the solubility prob-
lem with pea powder” for more on using pea powder for digestibility.)
Tip: Take 2 ounces of the nut pâté and add 1 ounce of lemon juice and 1 ounce of water to 
create a wonderful mayonnaise or the basis of a Caesar-like salad dressing!

Featuring Fish
High in protein and rich in essential fatty acids, fish is a fabulous snack food 
and good for your brain too! Try smoked wild salmon (or any smoked fish) 
on a thin slice of sprouted manna bread brushed with stone ground mustard, 
with a side of avocado. It’s a snack that takes seconds to prepare.
 
Every chemical and heavy metal used in the world end up in the ocean and 
become food for fish, and many people have justifiable concerns about some 
kinds of fish having high levels of mercury. Keep large game fish such as tuna, 
swordfish, and marlin off your snack list. For safer snacking, look to mid-sized 
deep-ocean fish such as cod or small tuna and smaller to mid-sized fish like 
tilapia, trout, and striped bass. The best fish by far is wild Alaska salmon.
 
Online sources of wild Alaska salmon and mercury-free or low mercury tuna 
are www.vitalchoice.com and www.vitacost.com/WildPlanet.

Tuna Cakes
Michelle Gay (www.eatingjourney.wordpress.com) provided us with this tasty 
high-protein snack that just takes moments to prepare. For this recipe, make sure you 
use a white albacore tuna that has been troll caught. No, we don’t mean snagged by 
weird-looking gnomes with fishing poles. Trolling lines catch smaller tuna, protect dol-
phins, and allow fishermen to determine the size of the fish they keep. Because the level 
of mercury in fish is determined by the size of the fish, you want to eat the smallest fish 
you can. But don’t go as far as eating tiny shrimp-like krill — leave those for the whales! 
These lovely cakes are featured in the color section.
Preparation time: 3 minutes
Cooking time: 3 minutes
Yield: 1 serving
One 5-ounce can of tuna, drained
2 to 3 tablespoons almond meal
1 egg
1⁄8 teaspoon each salt and pepper, or to taste
1 to 2 teaspoons of olive oil, sunflower oil, 
or safflower oil, or ghee (see the recipe in 
Chapter 6)
 1 In a small bowl, mix together the tuna, almond meal, egg, salt, and pepper. Set aside.
 2 Heat the oil or ghee in frying pan over high heat.
 3 Work the tuna mix into little cakes and drop them into the frying pan. Cook on one side 
for 3 to 4 minutes and then flip over and cook for 3 minutes or until crispy brown.
Tip: Believe it or not, pesto is a great addition to this tuna treat. You can find a recipe for 
Pesto without the Pain in Chapter 11.

 Chapter 7: Satisfying the Munchies and Your Stomach: Snacks and Appetizers
1 hardboiled egg, diced small
1⁄4 of an avocado
2 to 3 tablespoons of Kendall’s SCD Dairy 
Yogurt (see the recipe in Chapter 6), or any 
plain yogurt
1 teaspoon curry powder (optional)
One 5-ounce can of tuna in water, drained
1⁄8 teaspoon each salt and pepper, or to taste
 
 1 Place the egg and avocado in a small bowl. Add the yogurt; you may only need 2 table-
spoons if your yogurt of choice isn’t very thick. Add the curry powder (if desired).
 2 Add the tuna, salt, and pepper and mash all together.
Vary It! Add celery, onions, different seasonings, or apples to jazz up this tuna salad even 
more.
Vary It! Instead of yogurt, you can use our Basic Seed or Nut Pâté (see the recipe earlier in 
this chapter). You may have to dilute it with more water and lemon juice first to make it 
the right consistency.

Sardine Spread
Contributing chef Caroline Nation (founder of www.myfoodmyhealth.com) recommends 
serving this snack on pumpernickel bread, but you may also want to try it on sprouted 
bread if you avoid wheat. Sardines are a good source of calcium and vitamin D, as well as 
omega-3 fatty acids, which are known to help reduce levels of inflammation. 
Preparation time: 2 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: 2 servings
One 3.75-ounce tin sardines
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons finely chopped red onion
1⁄2 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
2 pieces bread of your choice
 1 Drain the sardines. In a bowl, mash the sardines and the mustard with a fork. Add the 
onion and lemon juice and stir to combine.
 2 Spread generously on the bread to make two open-faced sandwiches.

Chapter 8
Drinks for Any Time 
of Day or Night
In This Chapter
▶ Enjoying stomach-soothing smoothies any time of day
▶ Turning to homemade juice for some essential nutrients
▶ Going nuts for milk substitutes
▶ Checking out teas and coffees that go easy on your tummy
You’ve probably been told that coffee, strong 
tea, sodas, and alcohol aren’t so great for 
IBS, but they aren’t the only drinks in the world 
(although advertising can certainly make you 
think that). Perhaps you feel that water is your 
only safe liquid of choice. Au contraire! As this 
chapter shows, you have a wide variety of drink 
options to enjoy that won’t set off your IBS. In fact, 
some of our drinks can even be called medicinal 
because of their healthy and healing ingredients.
Where’s the Fiber?
Most of the chapters in this part give you tips on working soluble fiber into 
your recipes, but that’s not the case here. In fact, in most of the recipes that 
follow, you remove all the fiber in the process of juicing or making nut milks. 
Even the teas are strained so that no particles of solid substance touch your 
tummy — just liquid. Fiber aside, though, you can use a high-speed blender 
to make foods more soluble — they significantly reduce food particle size, 
which means they shred insoluble fiber to the point of oblivion. See the nearby 
sidebar “The power of high-speed blending” for more on these handy machines.

Part II: Eating For Your Intestinal Health 
In terms of IBS triggers, one factor you need to watch out for in drinks is 
temperature. Digestion, according to Ayurvedic medicine, is the way humans 
cook their foods in their stomachs, absorb nutrients in their small intestines, 
and relieve themselves of waste through the large intestine. Starting with a 
warm or cool food affects how you digest it and how your intestines react to 
it. Flip to Chapter 3 for the skinny on the Ayurvedic doshas or constitutions; 
Vatas already have cool tendencies, so a cold drink is going to make them 
shiver. Pittas have more fire and sometimes needs to be cooled down, so if 
you have this kind of constitution, cold drinks are okay.
Soothing Your Stomach with Smoothies
A smoothie is defined as a blended fruit drink, but it can be so much more. A 
smoothie meets the needs of people who are in a rush, and in the case of IBS, 
it’s a concentrated food source in only a few ounces.
 
When you consider that your stomach is only the size of your two cupped 
hands, you realize that you really don’t need to eat too much to begin stretch-
ing the stomach, which triggers the opening of sphincters throughout the 
body. A few ounces of smoothie are therefore a perfect way to take in nutri-
ents without feeling overly full.
 
Smoothies are also great to have any time of the day. Just make sure you sip 
them slowly. In fact, try chewing ’em. Swish a smoothie around in your mouth 
to get your salivary enzymes activated so they can help digest your smoothie 
before it even hits your stomach. And only drink a few ounces at a time. Then 
put your drink in the fridge or keep it in a thermos at work and sip it through-
out the day. That way you’re giving your intestines enough time to digest it 
The power of high-speed blending
Want to get rid of that irritating insoluble fiber 
as you fix your drinks? Invest in a high-speed 
blender. In 2008, researchers at the University 
of Toronto studied what happens to food when 
processed in a high-speed blender. They wanted 
to determine whether the blending process 
can enhance nutrient intake from whole foods. 
They tested high-speed blenders (specifically 
the Vita-Mix 5200) and found that the blenders 
are able to break down plant cell walls, reduc-
ing particle size and potentially increasing 
how quickly essential nutrients in vegetables 
and fruits end up in the bloodstream. You can 
see the microscopic details of this research 
at www.vita-mix.com/household/
infocenter/research.asp#.

and extract the goodness, ensuring you get the most nourishment possible 
from your smoothie.
Most people think of bananas when they hear the word smoothie. Bananas 
are high in potassium and help reduce hypertension, but you may have 
heard mixed stories about the benefits of bananas for the bowels. According 
to Carolyn’s Chinese medicine teacher, unripe bananas that are still about 
one-third green are more lubricating for the intestines than ripe bananas and 
can be used to treat constipation. When they’re ripe, with some brown spots 
forming, they can treat diarrhea. (Browning of a fruit just means the fruit is 
fermenting, so it’s already starting to digest itself and causes less stress on a 
weak digestive system.)
So bananas are really like a bowel cure-all. But don’t take our word for it. Try 
them either ripe or unripe and see how your body responds. If you’ve done your 
avoidance and challenge testing (refer to Chapter 2) and found that you can eat 
bananas, you’re in for a smoothie treat, as the following recipes show you.
 
T Nutty Breakfast Smoothie
Michele Gay (www.eatingjourney.wordpress.com) offers this tasty and smooth 
way to start your day. It features the all-powerful banana as well as spinach and almond 
butter. We discuss the IBS benefits of bananas earlier in this section; raw spinach is 
high in soluble fiber when you blend it. Almond butter in its creamy state doesn’t irri-
tate the intestines.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: 2 servings
2 bananas
2 cups spinach
1 cup water
1 tablespoon almond butter
 1 Cut up the bananas and spinach.
 2 Put all the ingredients in a blender. Blend until smooth and enjoy.

T Safe and Soothing Smoothie
Making a meal doesn’t have to be a big deal. You don’t have to turn the kitchen upside 
down and get out all of your pots and pans to make breakfast, but you do need break-
fast. This Safe and Soothing Smoothie helps keep your blood sugar up while soothing 
your stomach. You can experiment with two to three of the ingredients in this recipe, 
and later, with the help of your food diary (outlined in Chapter 2), you can substitute 
different ingredients that are on your safe list.
With all the mixing and matching possibilities, you have a dozen recipes at your finger-
tips. We encourage you to keep it simple, though. Don’t make an “everything but the 
kitchen sink” smoothie that can cause some intestinal distress. Stick with a few ingredi-
ents and keep a record of what your body likes and dislikes. As you experiment, you 
can also adjust the amount of liquid to reach your desired consistency. Check out this 
delicious drink in the color insert.
Tools: High-speed blender (optional)
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: 1 serving
1 small, ripe banana
1 cup strawberries, fresh or frozen
2 tablespoons hulled hemp seeds (no soaking 
required)
1 to 2 tablespoons pea powder protein (such 
as Provide)
1 cup liquid (water, coconut juice, or half 
coconut juice and half coconut milk)
Natural sweetener (such as agave, stevia, or 
Just Like Sugar) to taste (optional)
 1 Put the banana, strawberries, hemp seeds, and pea powder in a high-speed blender or a 
food processor. Add the liquid, making sure all the ingredients are covered, and blend 
well.
 2 Taste the blended mixture and add sweetener to taste (if desired). Give the mixture 
another quick blend to incorporate any sweetener.
Tip: Other IBS-friendly fruit includes peeled apples, apricots, peeled pears, peeled peaches, 
and mangoes.

T Banana and Greens 
 
Delight Smoothie
Here’s another smoothie creation from Michele Gay (www.eatingjourney.wordpress.
com). Like bananas, apples are a food that can swing both ways in treating IBS. Raw 
apples are high in pectin and fiber and can help bring fluids into the bowel and treat 
IBS-C. Apples in applesauce form treat IBS-D, according to the well-known BRATTY diet 
(bananas, rice, applesauce, toast, tea, and yogurt).
Tools: Hand blender (optional)
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: 4 servings
1 banana, cut up
2 cups baby spinach, chopped
1 apple, cored, peeled, and cut up
1 pear, cored, peeled, and cut up
2 cups water
 1 Put all the ingredients in a blender or use a strong hand blender.
 2 Blend until smooth and enjoy.
Vary It! If you’re experiencing diarrhea, use 1 cup applesauce in place of the cut-up apple.

Drinking Up Your Nutrients with Juices
Everyone needs nutrition, especially people with IBS-D, who often limit them-
selves to white rice and white bread and can become malnourished. One of 
the best ways to get this nutrition is by drinking healthy juices. If you have 
IBS-C, juices are good for you too because they’re high in antioxidants to deal 
with the toxins being absorbed through the large intestines along with water 
as you wait and wait and wait.
 
If you’re experiencing IBS-C, prune juice and lots of water may be just what you 
need. Prune juice is a very gentle yet effective laxative. It contains an unpro-
nounceable substance called dihydrophenylisatin (hey, we warned you it was a 

126
Part II: Eating For Your Intestinal Health 
toughie) that’s responsible for its laxative action. Water provides lubrication 
and bulk to help things move along and replace fluids that are continually 
reabsorbed through the colon.
Juices are so rich in nutrients that a couple of mouthfuls can give you a 
boost, especially if you chew your juice. No, don’t leave chunks of juice ingre-
dients in your drink, but do take a mouthful of juice and swish it around your 
mouth before swallowing. (You may recall that food absorption starts in your 
mouth, where your saliva begins to break down your food. In fact, one-third 
of your carbohydrate digestion process is completed in your mouth before it 
hits your stomach.)
Some nutritionists say that drinking juices isn’t a good way to get nutrition 
because the contents of your glass pass too quickly through your system. 
We don’t know if that’s been studied, but Christine actually stopped drinking 
juices and smoothies for a while, heeding their advice, only to find that she 
was missing the benefits. She went back to her drinks, realizing that she felt 
better when she had them and really was getting nourishment from them.
 
If you don’t know whether you’re absorbing a food or drink, just do a quick 
survey of the contents of your toilet bowl. You’ll see the color of the juice you 
just drank or some bits of food that you thought you chewed and digested. 
If that happens, eat more slowly, chew more thoroughly, and add digestive 
enzymes, which we cover in Chapter 1.
 
Chop up your vegetables and fruits somewhat before putting them in a juicer. 
Doing so causes less wear and tear on your appliance.
Juicer or nut milk bag: That is the question
If you want to make your own juice at home, 
you have two choices for juicing: a juicer and 
a blender/nut milk bag combo. Just about any 
juicer will do the trick (unless you want a juice 
press where you crush out your juice and no 
metal blades tear up your ingredients). Nut milk 
bags, however, are just a bit more complex.
Nut milk bags first started as a way to strain the 
fiber from nuts in the making of nut milk. Then 
one fine day a brilliant mom decided that she 
could strain a vegetable drink in the very same 
way. All you have to do to juice the nut milk bag 
way is cut up some vegetables and fruits that 
you’d normally feed through your juicer, add a 
cup of water, blend thoroughly, and then pour 
the contents through a nut milk bag. Voilà! You 
have your juice.
The great part about using a nut bag versus 
a juicer is that you only have to rinse out the 
nut milk bag and not all the parts of a juicer. 
Cleanup is therefore a breeze!

T Ginger Love!
Thanks to Angela Elliott for this recipe from her e-book A Diva’s Guide to Juices and 
Cocktails (www.she-zencuisine.com); it’s great because we love ginger! Ginger is a 
true friend to people with IBS. Not only does it soothe the digestive system but it can 
also help alleviate the uncomfortable gas that plagues many people. Ginger has some 
anti-inflammatory compounds called gingerols that are powerful enough to work on 
arthritis and can soothe an inflamed colon.
Tools: Nut milk bag (optional)
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: 2 servings
1⁄4 inch ginger
2 apples, quartered
Juice of 1⁄2 a lemon (about 1⁄8 cup)
 1 Run ginger and then the quartered apples through a juicer, or chop them, blend them, 
and strain them through a nut milk bag.
 2 Mix in the lemon juice and serve.

T Pick Me Up
This recipe, also from Angela Elliott’s A Diva’s Guide to Juices and Cocktails (www.
she-zencuisine.com), focuses on apples, which are rich in antioxidants. For people 
with IBS, apples are a mainstay and help with both ends of the IBS spectrum. Take them 
raw but peeled for IBS-C. Sauce them up into applesauce or bake them in the oven for 
IBS-D, again removing the peel, which has too much insoluble fiber. Cilantro gives this juice 
a distinct flavor that most people love. You can use just the juice of the lemons, or you can 
peel off the outer skin (leaving the white rind) and run the lemons through a juicer.

Examining Milk Substitutes
Lactose intolerance can be absolutely intolerable. Many people have been 
raised on milk, that staple of meals and bedtime treats, yet your headaches, 
rashes, fatigue, indigestion, diarrhea, or constipation may be coming from 
milk. Never fear. You can easily substitute homemade nut milk (or seed milk) 
for store-bought milk. We share some terrific milk-replacement options for 
you in this section. Although store-bought milk-replacement options exist, 
the following homemade recipes allow you to control all the ingredients and 
the amount of added sugars.
 
Organic nuts may be more expensive, but they’re free of pesticides, which is a 
real health bonus.
 
The recipes in this section (and others throughout the book) call for soaked 
nuts or seeds, so we’ve also included easy soaking instructions here.

130
Part II: Eating For Your Intestinal Health 
 
T Soaking Nuts and Seeds
Soaking nuts and seeds helps remove enzyme blockers called phytates that block the 
absorption of minerals. It also begins the process of sprouting, which releases even 
more nutrients that are meant for the developing plant but end up in your mouth. Plus, 
wet nuts and seeds are easier to blend without grinding first, increasing the chances 
that you’ll pulverize any IBS-irritating shards.
Soaking time: At least 4 hours for seeds and 8 hours for nuts, or overnight
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: 1 cup
1 cup nuts or seeds of your choice
1⁄4 teaspoon of sea salt
Water (enough to cover nuts/seeds)
 1 Rinse the nuts or seeds three times in a fine colander and set aside.
 2 Combine the salt and water in a bowl or other soaking container and add the nuts/
seeds. Soak seeds for at least 4 hours and nuts for at least 8 hours. Discard the soaking 
liquid and rinse the nuts/seeds thoroughly with fresh water.
 
T Cashew Milk
This recipe from Angela Elliott’s e-book, A Diva’s Guide to Juices and Cocktails, is a 
simple twist on our Essential Nut Milk recipe (presented later in this chapter). Thick 
and creamy cashew milk is as rich as whole milk. Like the other nut milks, it removes all 
nut fiber and provides no dairy irritants like lactose and casein, so it’s very IBS-friendly.
Tools: Nut milk bag
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: 3 servings
1 cup raw cashews, soaked (see Soaking Nuts 
and Seeds earlier in this chapter)
10 honey dates, soaked for 1 hour
2 cups water
 1 Combine the cashews and honey dates in a blender with 1 cup of the water and blend on high 
until a thick cream forms. Slowly add the rest of the water and blend on high for 2 minutes.
 2 Strain the mixture through a nut milk bag and collect the milk in a bowl.

T Silky Chai Nut Milk
If you’re feeling ill and need nutrients, this milk from Shannon Leone (www.rawmom.
com) can be a great, soothing drink. Although raw nuts can be difficult to digest, you can 
enjoy them quite safely in milk form. Chai is a well-known digestive tea from India. The 
herbs you add make it that way. In this recipe, Shannon uses nutmeg, cinnamon, and car-
damom, but you can experiment with fennel and even a touch of ginger if you want to.
Tools: Nut milk bag
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: 6 servings
2 cups raw almonds, soaked (see Soaking 
Nuts and Seeds earlier in this chapter)
5 to 6 cups pure water
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoons raw honey or agave or 6 pitted 
dates (optional)
1 teaspoon nutmeg, or to taste
11⁄2 teaspoon cinnamon, or to taste
1⁄2 teaspoon cardamom, or to taste
 1 Add the soaked almonds and water to the blender and blend until the mixture is liquefied.
 2 Over a large bowl, strain the mixture through a nut milk bag.
 3 Pour the milk back into the blender, add the rest of the ingredients, and lightly blend to 
incorporate everything.
Vary It! For a special treat, add 1 or 2 frozen or fresh ripe bananas.
Vary It! If you want chocolate milk, substitute 2 tablespoons raw cacao powder (if it’s a 
food on your list, of course) for the chai spices. You can also use carob powder if chocolate 
isn’t for you.
Vary It! Not an almond fan? Try making this recipe with soaked sesame seeds or pecans 
instead.

T Essential Nut Milk
Carolyn’s work as medical director of www.yeastconnection.com and co-author of 
The Yeast Connection and Women’s Health (Square One Publishers) led to including this 
recipe from that Web site and from The Yeast Connection Cookbook (Professional 
Books/Future Health). And we’re reprinting it here because it’s a simple, IBS-friendly 
way to substitute for dairy. Nuts don’t have lactose or the dairy protein casein, the 
ingredients that typically cause adverse reactions. The nuts are safe because you’re 
eliminating the fiber by pulverizing it. This yummy nut milk, which is featured in the 
color section, keeps in the refrigerator for 4 or 5 days if stored in a jar with a lid.
Tools: Cheesecloth or cloth coffee filter
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: 2 servings
1⁄2 cup shelled raw almonds, soaked (see 
Soaking Nuts and Seeds earlier in this 
chapter)
2 cups water
1 ripe banana or 1 teaspoon pure maple syrup 
or honey (optional)
 1 Add 1 cup of the water and the banana, maple syrup, honey, or (if desired). Blend again 
for 1 to 2 minutes to form a smooth cream. With the blender running, add the second 
cup of water slowly and blend for 2 minutes.
 2 Place the strainer over a large bowl and line it with cheesecloth or a cloth coffee filter. 
Pour the milk slowly into the strainer and allow it to filter through, using a spatula to 
increase the flow if desired. Pull the edges of the cheesecloth together to form some-
thing like a ball and then squeeze to extract another half cup of nut milk.
Vary It! You can use several other nuts and seeds, including macadamia nuts, sesame 
seeds, sunflower seeds, pecans, walnuts, Brazil nuts, or cashews to make this recipe. If 
using seeds, be sure to soak them before grinding them in your blender.
Tip: If you don’t want flecks of brown in your nut milk, you can blanch the almonds by plac-
ing them in 1 cup boiling water. Let them stand until the water has cooled slightly and then 
peel off the nut skins. Be sure to dry the nuts before grinding them.
Tip: If you’re using a high-speed blender, you don’t have to grind your nuts and seeds first. 
Just cover them with 1 cup water and blend them into a paste. Then add the second cup of 
water to liquefy.

Tasting Tea and Coffee that 
Won’t Upset Your Tummy
Tea and coffee may be the bad guys on some level, but you can still have 
decaffeinated green tea, lots of herbal teas, and grain/herbal coffee. So wipe 
that pout from your lips and wrap them around a good cup o’ joe (or tea)!
Getting more than taste from tea
We grew up in a tea-drinking household, so the soothing comfort of tea is 
no secret to us. That’s what many folks with IBS love about tea: its ability to 
soothe certain symptoms. Whether you use loose leaves or teabags, you can 
just add hot water for a taste of comfort.
Laxative herbs have a mixed reputation. Using senna tea alone can have 
an irritating effect on the intestines and cause cramping as it forces stool 
through the intestines. Cascara can be even more forceful in its action.
Gentler teas include Yogi Tea’s Get Regular tea, which is mostly organic and 
made up of 16 herbs (840 milligrams of senna and 1,160 milligrams of the 15 
other herbs). Senna contains anthraquinone compounds that stimulate the 
intestines, promoting them to expel their contents. The formula is balanced 
with warming, gas-reducing ingredients such as anise, cardamom, and ginger 
that can help alleviate gas and reduce any harsh effects of senna. The Get 
Regular tea also features peppermint to help speed digestion; licorice to 
soothe and coat the bowels, allowing for easier bowel movements; Triphala, 
a blend of three herbal berries (amla, bibhitaki, and haritaki), to tone and 
rejuvenate the eliminative functions; and yellow dock and dandelion to help 
the liver release more bile, assisting in promoting bowel movement through 
your system. Other herbal ingredients include black pepper, clove bud, 
celery seed, coriander seed, and stevia.
Traditional Medicinals’ Organic Smooth Move is made up of eight herbs (1,080 
milligrams of senna and 920 milligrams of the other seven herbs). Similar ingre-
dients are senna, licorice root, sweet orange peel, and ginger. Smooth Move 
also uses bitter fennel fruit, cinnamon bark, and coriander fruit.
We like the fact that both of these teas are essentially organic. Get Regular 
is probably more favored because it has less senna and more healing herbs. 
However, people with IBS may not do so well with so many different herbs. 
So, once again, you must experiment to see how products react in your body.

Herbs for the teapot
Herbs are age-old healers and helpers for all 
sorts of ills, including the gut variety. When 
foods make you feel worse, brew up some of 
these herbs and maybe grab a hot water bottle 
to sit and soothe your tummy.
 ✓ Peppermint is most known for its ability to 
soothe intestinal spasms and cramps.
 ✓ Ginger is an anti-inflammatory that also 
treats nausea.
 ✓ Chamomile creates a general calming tea 
for the nerves and the intestines.
 ✓ Fennel is an antispasmodic that can relieve 
gas and bloating.
 
T A Fine Pot of Tea
Tea made the old fashioned way — the way our mother loved it — involves warming a 
teapot with a swish of boiling water and using a tea ball filled with loose leaves. We sug-
gest you boil the water the old-fashioned way too — in a kettle or a pot on the stove. 
Don’t settle for microwaved water or water poured through a coffee maker. Boiling 
water really lets the tea flavor fly and releases the tea’s healing abilities. This herb tea 
has no irritants and is actually medicinal, making it perfect for IBS. Pick your favorite 
soothing herb, dried or fresh, and get ready to enjoy it. (See the nearby “Herbs for the 
teapot” sidebar for ideas and info on the medicinal properties of some common herbs.)
Tools: Teapot, tea strainer
Preparation time: 2 minutes
Brewing time: 10 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
4 teaspoons dried peppermint, or 12 teaspoons 
fresh peppermint
4 cups hot water
1 teaspoon honey, or to taste
 1 Warm up a teapot and add your desired herbs.
 2 Pour the water into the pot. Cover the opening immediately so steam won’t escape, 
taking the flavor and healing with it.
 3 Steep the herbs for 10 minutes and strain the tea through a fine-meshed tea strainer 
into a cup. Add the honey to taste.

 Chapter 8: Drinks for Any Time of Day or Night
Catching up with coffee
Unfortunately for coffee lovers, the coffee bean itself, not just the caffeine, is 
what aggravates IBS-D — both irritate the gastrointestinal tract. That means 
switching to decaf coffee is not likely to help your IBS-D, so finding a hot 
drink alternative is the best idea. This section discusses a few coffee substi-
tutes you may want to try; if you’re not tied to that coffee feeling, check out 
the preceding section on tea for more hot beverage options.
Coffee substitutes have come a long way from Postum and roasted chicory, 
which used to be the only choices. Nowadays Nestlé makes a product called 
Caro made of roasted barley, malted barley, chicory, and rye. (Note: The 
barley and rye make it a gluten product.)
The newest coffee substitute is a product with the unlikely name Teeccino. 
It’s ground and ready to brew, just like coffee, and according to reviews on 
the subject, it tastes just like coffee too. Teeccino comes in both regular and 
organic lines in single-serving pouches, 8.5-ounce cans, and 5-pound bags. 
Its ingredients include barley, so it’s not gluten free. It also contains roasted 
carob, chicory root, figs, dates, and almonds. The organic Maya line adds 
roasted ramon nuts from Guatemala to the mix. Teeccino comes in a range of 
flavors: Original, Mocha, Almond Amaretto, Vanilla Nut, Hazelnut, Chocolate 
Mint, Java, Maya Chai, Maya Caffe, and Maya Mocha. Our first choice for IBS 
sufferers is the Maya Chai with its cinnamon, cloves, and ginger.
 
If regular coffee is on your list of safe beverages, but you’re missing the cream-
iness of adding milk or cream because those aren’t friendly foods for you, try 
adding nut milk. Christine was surprised by how tasty adding almond milk to 
her coffee turned out to be. You can even kick things up a notch and heat the 
nut milk to make yourself a latte that rivals the sugary syrup-flavored version 
you can get at the local coffee shop. To make your own nut milk, head to the 
earlier “Examining Milk Substitutes” section to peruse the recipes there.
Enjoying a Lively Lemonade
Water, lemons, and sugar are the traditional ingredients for lemonade, but 
we have a sweet twist for you. Lemon in the morning is a common pick-me-up 
for a lot of people, and it also should be one for those with IBS. It clears the 
palate, wakes up the brain with its pungency, and stimulates the liver just 
enough to get your bile flowing and jumpstart its detoxification pathways — 
all great things for someone with IBS.

136
Part II: Eating For Your Intestinal Health 
 
T Lemonade
Everyone needs water, and taking it in the form of lemonade makes it much more fun. 
Lemons are astringent, which means they help detoxify the body and although they 
may taste acidic, they turn alkaline and help neutralize toxins in the body.
According to its manufacturer, Just Like Sugar looks like sugar, tastes like sugar, cooks 
like sugar, bakes like sugar and dissolves instantly in any type of drink, hot or cold. 
It’s made of chicory root with some added vitamin C and calcium; it’s not sugar, so it 
doesn’t elevate your blood sugar or stimulate the growth of intestinal yeast or bacteria. 
However, the chicory in Just Like Sugar may be irritating to some stomachs. The other 
natural sweetener we recommend is stevia. You can find so many forms and brands of 
stevia that you may have to experiment before you find one you really like. Because 
stevia is 200 times sweeter than sugar, you can use far less of it in a recipe than you 
would sugar or Just Like Sugar. But with either one, you have to be the judge.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: 6 servings
Juice of 6 lemons (about 11⁄2 cups)
6 cups cold water
1 cup Just Like Sugar, or 1⁄2 to 1 teaspoon 
stevia
 1 In a large pitcher, mix the lemon juice, water, and Just Like Sugar or stevia.
 2 Stir lemonade well and serve over ice, with a lemon slice or two to garnish.
Vary It: Use 10 to 12 limes in place of the lemons to make limeade.

▶ Brushing up on basics with a few key stock recipes
S
oups are so much more than an appetizer. 
They’re comfort foods that can be a meal in 
themselves. A hot soup on a cold day can warm 
you both physically and emotionally, and a cold 
soup on a blazing hot day can cool you down 
instantly. Soups are also a good cause for cleaning 
out your fridge, because you can put all of your 
leftovers and slightly wilted vegetables in a pot 
and cook them up into something tasty.
You may not necessarily want to cook and eat 
a hearty entrée for lunch and supper, so soups 
make the perfect light meal. Soup is especially convenient if you cook lots 
of it and freeze it in zippered freezer bags, BPA-free plastic containers, or 
freezer-safe mason jars. Just sit the frozen soup container on the counter 
when you leave for work, and it’ll be ready to heat up in a few minutes when 
you get home all tired and hungry. Preparing foods like this ahead of time 
prevents the inevitable snacking on foods that don’t sit well in your tummy.

Part II: Eating For Your Intestinal Health 
Many soups are great sources of protein, vegetables, and soluble fiber all 
in one pot. The fact that you’re cooking and simmering your soup for a long 
time means that you’re making your vegetables even friendlier to digestion. 
Remember that the longer you cook your soup, the less soup you end up 
with, but what good is having a lot of soup if you can’t digest it easily?
 
Bisphenol-A (BPA) is a chemical used in the manufacture of plastic. It’s a hor-
mone disruptor and therefore poses a potential danger to your health.
Finding Soluble Fiber in Soup
Cooking soups helps break down plant cell walls, eliminating some of the 
insoluble fiber and making soups IBS-friendlier. You can pump up the digest-
ibility factor by adding a soluble side of safe bread.
 
The more soluble foods you eat at a meal, the more likely your gut will behave.
Most of the soup recipes in this chapter focus on lentils, as well as vegetables 
that are high in soluble fiber (think beets, carrots, mushrooms, parsnips, pota-
toes, rutabagas, squash, sweet potatoes, turnips, and yams). But soups are 
also the type of food that you want to sop up with some safe grain products. 
Your soluble grain choices include brown rice cereal, oatmeal, cornmeal or 
polenta, barley, quinoa, sourdough bread, sprouted bread (bread made from 
whole grains that have sprouted or germinated), and pita or flax bread.
Taking Stock
Broths (also known as stocks) are an essential staple to have on hand. Like 
juices, stocks provide great nutrition in just a few sips. They’re the basis 
for building many other soups, but they can be satisfying all alone. Stocks 
are basically well-flavored liquid with no other ingredients, so they’re espe-
cially handy if you have an IBS flare-up. Because you control the ingredients, 
homemade stocks are better than the store-bought varieties that often sneak 
in MSG, hydrolyzed yeast, and artificial colorings and flavorings. Be sure to 
keep some in your freezer at all times.

 Chapter 9: Settling Your Stomach with Stellar Soups
 
Chicken Stock
Chef and author Victoria Amory at www.victoriaamory.com suggests saving cooked 
chicken carcasses in plastic bags in your freezer and making this broth after you’ve col-
lected two or three of ’em. Just make sure they have some meat left on them and include 
drippings if you want a good chicken flavor. You can use any vegetables that are on your 
food list, except for broccoli and potatoes because they’ll make the broth cloudy, and broc-
coli can overwhelm the flavor. Chicken broth is the official meal for people starting off on 
the Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD). According to the SCD, chicken broth is almost guar-
anteed to soothe your gut and begin the healing process. You can store the stock in the 
fridge for up to 2 days, or in the freezer for up to 2 months. We suggest making several 
batches at a time and freezing containers of 1 or 2 cups each for future use.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 3 hours
Yield: Eight 1-cup servings
2 onions, skin on, roughly chopped
1 leek, cleaned and sliced
1 turnip, peeled and roughly chopped
4 carrots, chopped
4 stalks celery, chopped
2 cooked chicken carcasses
1 sprig marjoram
1 sprig thyme
1 sprig rosemary
4 fresh bay leaves
10 peppercorns
Cold water (enough to cover the bones — 
about 10 cups)
 1 Put all the ingredients in a large pot and add enough water to cover the chicken bones.
 2 Bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer over low heat for 2 to 3 hours, 
adding more water if the water level falls below the bones. While the stock simmers, use 
a spoon to remove the foam that collects on the surface.
 3 Strain the stock once through a sieve. Then strain the stock a second time through a 
finer mesh sieve, kitchen towel, or muslin cloth.
 4 Pour the stock into containers to cool, removing the fat that rises to the top.
Vary It! If black peppercorns are one of your trigger foods, leave them out or substitute 
white peppercorns, which are less harsh on the intestines.

Part II: Eating For Your Intestinal Health 
 
Beef Stock
The bones from ham, veal, and beef are the key to making this stock, which also comes 
from chef Victoria Amory (www.victoriaamory.com). You can mix them all for a rich 
and flavorful broth that’s good for making soups and sauces that won’t irritate your gut 
and avoids all the additives and ingredients from commercially made broths. As with 
the chicken stock (see the preceding recipe), any vegetables except for broccoli and 
potato will lend this stock a fine flavor. You can add more water during the cooking pro-
cess as the stock evaporates so that you end up with 8 cups in the end.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 3 hours
Yield: Eight 1-cup servings
2 onions, skin on, roughly chopped
1 leek, washed and chopped
1 turnip, peeled and chopped
4 carrots, peeled and chopped
1 cup mushroom stems, chopped
4 stalks celery, chopped
1-pound mix of veal, beef, or pork bones
2 tablespoons tomato paste
4 cloves garlic, peeled
8 stems parsley
8 black peppercorns
Cold water (enough to cover the bones — 
about 10 to 12 cups)
 1 Put all the ingredients in a large pot and add enough water to cover the bones. Bring to 
a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer over low heat for 2 to 3 hours, adding more water if 
the water level falls below the bones. While the stock simmers, remove the foam that 
collects on the surface with a spoon.
 2 Strain the stock once through a sieve. Strain it a second time through a finer mesh 
sieve, kitchen towel, or muslin cloth.
 3 Pour the soup into containers to cool, removing any fat that rises to the top and then 
covering and storing them.
Tip: Throw in the skins of the onions to give the broth a wonderful golden color.
Vary It! You can use white peppercorns if black peppercorns are a trigger for you, or leave 
the peppercorns out altogether.

Shellfish Stock
Victory Amory at www.victoriaamory.com suggests saving the heads of shrimp or lob-
sters in the freezer until you collect enough to make this tasty stock (that’d be about 24 
shrimp heads or 4 lobster heads and carcasses as well). A broth without any solid ingredi-
ents is an IBS-safe meal and can also be the base of a great fish soup. You can whip up this 
stock in less than 30 minutes; refrigerate it for up to 2 days or freeze it for up to a month.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: Eight 1-cup servings
2 pounds mixed seafood shells, such as 
shrimp and lobster
1 onion, peel on, quartered
10 whole black peppercorns
1 lemon, halved
1 bay leaf
Cold water (enough to cover the ingredients 
by at least 1 inch — at least 10 cups)
 1 In a large stockpot, combine the shrimp and or lobster shells, onion, black pepper-
corns, lemon, and bay leaf. Cover the ingredients by at least 1 inch with cold water and 
bring everything to a boil.
 2 Reduce the heat to low and simmer for about 20 minutes. Strain the stock through a fine 
mesh strainer or tea towel. Pour the stock into 1 cup containers to cool and then cover 
and store them.
Vary It! If black peppercorns are one of your trigger foods, leave them out or substitute 
white peppercorns — they aren’t as harsh on the intestines.

T Vegetable Stock
We can’t think of a better way to use up the vegetables inevitably lurking in the crisper 
than this yummy vegetable stock! This recipe, provided by chef Victoria Amory (www.
victoriaamory.com), is another staple that can be a flavorful base for soups and sauces. 
As with the three other stocks in this chapter, it can be a meal in itself if your IBS is 
acting up because it’s devoid of solids and contains no synthetic flavorings or colorings. 
Asparagus ends, broccoli stems, cauliflowers, carrots, pea shells, and mushroom stems 
all make a sensational broth. You can also use leeks, scallions, turnips, and artichokes. 
Refrain from using potatoes and broccoli florets though, because they’ll cloud the broth 
and give too strong a broccoli taste. Even the stems that we list below may be too much 
for some. You can store this stock in the fridge for 2 days or freeze it for up to 6 months.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 60 minutes
Yield: Eight 1-cup servings
2⁄3 pound each chopped mushrooms, chopped 
asparagus, and chopped broccoli stems
1 onion
10 black peppercorns
1 bay leaf
Cold water (enough to cover the vegetables — 
about 10 cups)
 1 In a large stockpot, combine the vegetables, onion, and black peppercorns. Fill the pot 
with cold water to cover the veggies and bring it all to a boil. Add the bay leaf. Reduce 
the heat and simmer for about 50 minutes.
 2 Strain through a fine mesh sieve, kitchen towel, or muslin cloth. Pour into containers to 
cool, removing any fat that rises to the top.
Vary It! You can substitute white peppercorns if black peppercorns are one of your trigger 
foods, or leave the peppercorns out completely.

Serving Up Hot, Healthy, 
and Healing Soups
Hot soups, like hot drinks, are more appealing when you’re chilled, during the 
winter, or when you don’t have time to prepare a big meal. Don’t get us wrong, our 
soups can double for a meal in themselves. They are especially welcome when 
you’ve managed to freeze some soup and cut the preparation time down to minutes.

143
 Chapter 9: Settling Your Stomach with Stellar Soups
Easily digestible soups typically have longer cooking times to help break 
down all the ingredients. Many of the following soups are filling; they stick to 
your ribs but not your intestines.
 
If you like chunky soup, chop up your veggies. If you prefer a smoother soup, 
grate vegetables such as potatoes, beets, and carrots. And if you want a creamy 
soup but don’t want to add the milk or cream, use a hand blender (also known 
as an immersion blender) and blend your ingredients to a creamy consistency.
 
Quinoa Soup with Miso
Thanks to chef Ela Guidon (www.myfoodmyhealth.com/OurChefs/index.
php?chefid=17) for reminding us of the many uses of quinoa and providing this dairy-
free recipe. Perfect any time, this delicious integration of miso and quinoa is a great use 
for any leftover quinoa from last night’s gluten-free dinner. Quinoa is high in soluble 
fiber, making it a suitable grain for IBS. Miso is a fermented soybean; the fermentation 
process actually predigests the miso to some extent, so your gut has to do less work.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 30 minutes
Yield: Four 1-cup servings
2 tablespoons olive oil
1⁄2 cup diced onion
2 garlic cloves, finely diced
2 carrots, sliced and cut in half moons
2 celery stalks, sliced
2 medium red potatoes, cut in quarter moons 
with skin
1 zucchini, cut in quarter moons
1 teaspoon salt
3 cups chicken stock
2 cups water
1 cup cooked quinoa
1⁄2 teaspoon dry basil
1⁄4 teaspoon dry oregano
3 tablespoons white miso paste
 1 In a medium-sized pot, heat the olive oil and sauté the onion until it’s translucent. Add 
the garlic, carrots, and celery and cook all that together for 5 minutes.
 2 Add the potatoes, zucchini, salt, chicken stock, and water. Bring everything to a boil 
and then simmer for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, cook the quinoa per package directions.
 3 Add the cooked quinoa, basil, and oregano to the medium-sized pot and simmer for 5 
minutes. Turn off the heat. Add the white miso paste and stir until dissolved.

T Red Lentil and Coconut Soup
This luxurious gluten- and dairy-free soup is from chef Andrea Boje (www.myfoodmy
health.com/OurChefs/index.php?chefid=23). Red lentils are low in fat and high 
in protein and fiber. Also, the addition of coconut milk gives this recipe a rich, tropical 
flavor, as well as a little sweetness. Your body will thank you for eating this soup 
because coconut milk contains immune-boosting and easy-to-digest fatty acids called 
lauric acids, which help soothe and even heal the GI tract. For even more nutrients, you 
can add other vegetables, such as broccoli stalks.
If they’re on your food list, you can garnish your soup with a dollop of sour cream, crème 
fraîche, or Greek yogurt. This soup also tastes great when served with warm pieces of fresh 
whole-grain bread. You can keep this soup in the fridge for a week, or in the freezer to enjoy 
later. To reheat, warm the soup in a pot over low heat for 5 to 10 minutes, stirring occasion-
ally. If the soup has thickened, add a little more vegetable stock or coconut milk.

Yield: Six 11⁄4-cup servings
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, chopped
2 carrots, chopped
13⁄4 cups red lentils, rinsed
4 cups vegetable stock
One 14-ounce can coconut milk
4 cloves garlic
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons lemon juice
11⁄2 tablespoons white miso paste
 1 In large soup pot, heat the olive oil over medium-low heat. Add the onion and carrot 
and sauté until the onions are soft, about 2 minutes. Add the lentils, stock, coconut 
milk, garlic, and salt to the pot. Stir and bring to a boil.
 2 When the liquid is boiling, stir it some more. Reduce the heat to minimum, cover the 
pot, and cook for 30 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat after the lentils are com-
pletely soft.
 3 Pour half of the soup into a blender and blend until smooth. Return the soup to the pot, 
add the lemon juice, white miso paste, and any additional desired seasonings and stir 
to mix. If the soup gets too thick, add additional vegetable stock.
 4 Pour into bowls and serve.

Vary It! Some alternative seasonings you can use in Step 3 include 3 teaspoons grated 
ginger, 2 teaspoons ginger juice, and 2 teaspoons cumin or curry powder.
Tip: If you’re worried about too much fat from the coconut milk stimulating your intestines, 
try low-fat coconut milk.
Tip: If you don’t want a chunky soup, make sure to capture all the bits of vegetables you’ve 
thrown in, including the garlic cloves, when you blend the soup in Step 2.

Blanching tomatoes
Some people with sensitivities to tomatoes have 
trouble digesting the skins, which is why blanch-
ing and skinning tomatoes can be helpful. Thanks 
to Colleen Robinson (www.crimsondoor
healing.com) for demystifying the art of 
blanching tomatoes. It’s easier than you think, 
and it makes tomatoes easier for IBS sufferers 
to digest. Blanching and skinning takes about 
20 minutes to prep and another 1 to 2 minutes per 
batch for the actual cooking. Here’s the process:
 1. Get a big pot of water boiling on the stove.
 2. While it’s boiling, rinse your tomatoes, flip 
them over, and cut a small, shallow X on 
the bottom.
 3. Fill your sink half full with very cold water.
 4. Put a few tomatoes at a time in the boiling 
water.
 
 After about a minute, the skin starts to look 
wrinkled and/or peel away from the cut you 
made in Step 2.
 5. Take the tomatoes out of the pot (using 
tongs or a slotted spoon) and put them in 
the sink of cold water.
 6. Repeat Steps 2 through 5 until you’ve 
blanched all your tomatoes.
 7. When the tomatoes are cool enough to 
touch, remove the skin by pulling it away 
from the X.
To deseed your blanched, skinned tomatoes, cut 
them in half. (For the small, oval Roma tomatoes, 
cut top to bottom and for most other tomatoes, 
cut side to side.) You can squish the halves to get 
the seeds out or scoop them out with your fingers.

Pasta e Fagioli (Yummy Italian 
 
Pasta and Bean Soup)
Pasta e Fagioli is one of our healing chef Colleen Robinson’s favorite nurturing recipes; 
check her out at www.crimsondoorhealing.com. This thick, hearty soup of rice and 
beans, which is featured in the color section, seems meaty even though it’s meat-free. 
The white rice cooks down to create a nice soluble fiber element, and pinto beans are 
also high in soluble fiber. See the “Blanching tomatoes” sidebar in this chapter for 
instructions on blanching the skins off tomatoes.
Tools: Potato masher
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 30 minutes
Yield: Four 1-cup servings
One 15-ounce can pinto beans, rinsed well
2 cups water
1⁄3 cup white rice
1 tablespoon olive oil
1⁄4 cup chopped celery
1⁄2 cup chopped onion
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 cups blanched tomatoes
Two 32-ounce containers chicken broth
1⁄4 cup chopped fresh parsley
1 teaspoon dried basil
1⁄4 teaspoon ground black pepper
11⁄2 cups dried short pasta (such as shells, 
macaroni, or fusilli)
 1 Take 3⁄4 of the can of pinto beans and put it in a medium-sized bowl. Mash the beans 
with a potato masher.
 2 Boil the water on high heat in a medium saucepan. Add the white rice and stir. Cover 
the saucepan and lower the heat to just below medium, keeping the water at a slow boil 
(it should still be bubbling, but it shouldn’t be making the lid jump up and down).
 3 Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat until a drop of water flicked from your 
fingers sizzles in it. Add the celery, onion, and garlic and stir off and on for 3 to 5 min-
utes, or until the onion softens and turns translucent.
 4 Add the tomatoes, pinto beans (mashed and not mashed), chicken broth, parsley, basil, and 
black pepper and bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally. After a minute or so, 
lower the heat to about halfway between medium and low and simmer for at least 10 minutes.
 5 Add the pasta, raise the heat just a little bit, and boil slowly for 8 to 12 minutes, or until 
the pasta is cooked.
Vary It! To make this recipe vegetarian, substitute vegetable broth for the chicken broth.
Tip: Want to make the celery a little friendlier to your digestive system? Chop off the 
bottom and top and then cut the celery in half, but don’t try to hack through all the fibers on 
the outside. You’ll be able to peel off the really stringy bits quite quickly and easily.

T Lentil Soup from the Source
This recipe comes from chef Michelle Gay (www.eatingjourney.wordpress.com). 
Lentils are a great source of protein often chosen by vegetarians. They’ve got none of the fat 
that’s in meat protein, a fact that hikes up the digestibility factor for some people with IBS.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 40 minutes
Yield: Four 1-cup servings
2 teaspoons butter
1 carrot, chopped
1⁄2 of a medium yellow onion, chopped
1⁄2 of a capsicum (a type of red pepper)
41⁄2 cups water
11⁄2 to 2 cups raw pumpkin, de-skinned and 
chopped into small chunks
Two 15-ounce cans cooked lentils, drained 
and rinsed, or 12 ounces of dry lentils, rinsed 
well but not soaked
3 to 4 cups fresh spinach
 1 In a large saucepan, add the butter and sauté the carrot, onion, and capsicum for a few 
minutes. Add in the water and pumpkin and boil the vegetables until they’re soft. If 
you’re using dry lentils, add them here to let them cook for about 30 minutes.
 2 If you’re using canned lentils, add them and the fresh spinach.
 3 Take 1⁄3 of the mixture out of the pan and blend it down with a blender, hand blender, or 
food processor. Add the blended-down portion back into the saucepan, stir, and serve.
Vary It! If you’re not quite up to facing a hot pepper in your lentil soup, just use 1⁄8 to 1⁄4 
teaspoon cayenne pepper instead. Cayenne pepper is an excellent herb for balancing the 
flow of stomach juices and eliminating gas. It can also help stop internal bleeding. Before 
you use any hot pepper products, note that at least one study has shown that people with 
IBS have increased nerve fibers that react with a substance in chili peppers. Use your judg-
ment as to whether chilis, capsicum, or cayenne are safe for you to eat.
Vary It! You can replace the water with vegetable stock to add a different flavor and the 
nutrients that come from a good vegetable stock.

Borscht (Beet Soup)
Borscht. People can’t seem to spell it right, but they can eat it happily! This recipe from 
our healing chef Colleen Robinson at www.crimsondoorhealing.com, calls for chicken 
broth, but you can easily swap that for vegetable broth if you want to make this a vegetar-
ian dish. Beets are good for the liver and high enough in soluble fiber to pass through 
your intestines without a glitch. All the other vegetables are easy to digest in their well-
cooked state. Think about doubling the recipe to have lots of leftovers. For instructions 
on blanching tomatoes, check out the “Blanching tomatoes” sidebar in this chapter.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 45 minutes
Yield: Eight 1-cup servings
Two 32-ounce containers chicken broth
2 medium potatoes, chopped into small 
squares or grated
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 small onion, chopped
1⁄3 cup red or green cabbage, grated or chopped
2 carrots, grated
5 medium beets, grated
1 tomato, blanched and chopped coarsely
1 tablespoon fresh parsley, or 1 tablespoon 
dried parsley
1 teaspoon dried dill, or 1 tablespoon fresh dill
1 bay leaf (optional)
1 teaspoon lemon juice
 1 In a large pot, bring the chicken broth to a boil and then add the potatoes. Boil for 3 
minutes if the potatoes are grated and 5 minutes if the potatoes are in chunks.
 2 Put the olive oil in a medium pot, toss in the onion, and cook over medium-low heat 
until the onion is a little translucent (about 2 to 5 minutes), stirring occasionally.
 3 After the 3 or 5 minutes from Step 1 have passed, add the cabbage to the first pot and 
boil for another 5 minutes.
 4 When the onion in the second pot is clear, add the carrots and stir occasionally for 2 to 
3 minutes.
 5 Put the grated beets into the pot with the carrots and onions and cook for a minute. 
Then add the tomato and stir-fry for another minute. Add the parsley, dill, and bay leaf 
(if desired) and stir for another minute.
 6 Throw everything into the pot with the chicken broth, add the lemon juice, and simmer 
for about 30 minutes.
 7 Serve when the vegetables are tender (making sure to remove any bay leaf).

 Chapter 9: Settling Your Stomach with Stellar Soups
Tip: Do you like your soup chunky? Leave it as is. If you want your soup smooth, puree it 
right in the pot with a hand blender. Craving a creamy soup? In a bowl, mix a 12-ounce 
package of soft tofu with a cup of the broth, puree it with a hand blender, and add it to the 
broth after it has simmered for 20 minutes. And if you want a sharper taste in your soup, 
grate the onion (big chunks of onion become sweet when you cook them).
Tip: If you’re going to grate the veggies in this recipe, using a decent food processor will 
save you grated knuckles and loads of time. Grate the beets first and empty them into a 
bowl. Repeat the process with the carrots, the potatoes, and then the cabbage. Don’t bother 
cleaning the grater in between. If you have a little beet mixed in with the cabbage, it’ll boil 
longer, which is great; you just don’t want the cabbage to get mixed in and boil less.

A souper food
Somewhere in history, a hungry human threw 
leftovers into a pot of water and invented soup, 
one of the cornerstones of comfort food. Soup 
is certainly a comforting meal for people who 
are ill — little to chew and easy to digest. And 
mom’s chicken soup is always special, maybe 
because you know she’s prepared it with love 
even if she just opened a can. 
In 2008, a definitive study proved that chicken 
soup can help heal the common flu. Studies 
also show that people find soup more filling 
and satisfying. Feed the solids by themselves to 
a group, and folks feel less full than when they 
eat those same solids floating around in a tasty 
broth. It’s all about the volume: Your mind reg-
isters a full bowl of soup as a big meal, but soup 
doesn’t seem to make you feel too full, which is 
good news for people with IBS.

Orange Chicken Soup
This soup from healing chef Colleen Robinson (www.crimsondoorhealing.com) is 
beautiful, hearty, and delicious. The carrots and apple bring some nice sweetness to the 
soup without adding sugar. Cooked apple without the skin is a treatment for IBS-D, but 
the amount used here won’t contribute to IBS-C. And of course rice is high in soluble 
fiber; white rice has more soluble fiber than brown rice, but the longer cooking time in 
a soup makes brown rice more soluble than it would be otherwise. Either kind of rice 
cooks and eventually dissolves, thickening the soup and balancing out the insoluble 
fiber in some of the vegetables.
You can use a hand blender and puree the soup right in the pot. But if you choose to 
scoop the hot soup into a blender or food processor, make sure you puree in quick 
short bursts. Otherwise, the steam can build up inside the lid and blow it off — hot, 
messy, dangerous, and a waste of good soup!
Tools: Hand blender (optional)
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 60 minutes
Yield: Sixteen 1-cup servings
4 quarts chicken broth
1⁄4 cup uncooked white or brown rice
1 pound carrots, peeled and coarsely chopped
1 small butternut or acorn squash, peeled and 
coarsely chopped
2 medium yams/sweet potatoes, peeled and 
coarsely chopped
1 apple, peeled and coarsely chopped
1⁄2 teaspoon cinnamon (optional)
1⁄2 teaspoon nutmeg (optional)
1 teaspoon lemon juice
 1 In a large pot, combine the chicken broth and rice, and start simmering. Add the chopped 
carrots, squash, yams, and apple. Add the cinnamon and/or nutmeg (if desired).
 2 Cover the pot and allow the soup to cook at a low boil (you should still see bubbles, but 
the lid shouldn’t be jumping up and down), stirring every 10 to 15 minutes until the veg-
gies are soft and mushy (about 20 to 60 minutes; you can start checking them with a 
fork after about 30 minutes).
 3 Puree the soup when it’s still hot or lukewarm. (Don’t wait until the soup is cold to perform 
this step, because it’ll be harder to puree that way.) Put the pureed soup back into the pot 
(if you used a regular blender or food processor). Stir in the lemon juice. Eat and enjoy.
Vary It! Roasting your vegetables makes the whole process take longer, but it makes peel-
ing the veggies a breeze. To roast the vegetables called for in this recipe, leave the yams 
whole and cut the squash in half. Put everything on a baking sheet and pop into a 350-
degree oven for about 45 to 60 minutes, or until you can easily scoop out the insides. Then 
when you’re boiling the soup, be careful to just boil it long enough for the rice to dissolve 
and the veggie flavors to mingle nicely, about 30 to 40 minutes.

Cooling Off with Cool Soups
Sometimes a cool soup is just the sort of refreshment you need. Cool soup 
isn’t cooked, so the vegetables are raw, but if you blend them well they 
become more soluble and digestible. Here are some raw soup selections that 
have never been near a stove.
 
T Creamy Broccoli Soup in the Raw
Chef Angela Elliott (www.she-zencuisine.com) contributed this surprising creamy 
and cool broccoli soup that’s nutritious, easy to make, and tasty while being kind to 
your tummy. Cashews are high in soluble fiber, and blending reduces their insoluble-
fiber content. Blended broccoli may not be your first thought for a cool soup, but it’s 
got almost as much soluble as insoluble fiber, so it’s not going to irritate your IBS 
tummy. It’s also very high in vitamins and minerals.
Soaking time: 2 hours
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: Four 1-cup servings
11⁄2 cups raw cashews, soaked for 2 hours
2 cups chopped broccoli
2 cups water
1⁄8 teaspoon each salt and black pepper, 
or to taste
1⁄4 teaspoon each powdered sage, dried thyme, 
and garlic powder
 1 Soak the raw cashews for at least 2 hours and then drain and rinse them.
 2 Blend the soaked cashews, broccoli, water, and desired seasonings in a blender until 
smooth. Chill the soup in the fridge after blending for about 30 minutes.
 3 Serve with chunks of sprouted bread (such as manna or Essene, found in the freezer 
section of your local health food store), Rice Mochi (pounded rice formed into flat 
cakes also found in your health food store’s freezer), or corn chips.

T Raw Curry Spinach Soup
Shannon Leone’s Raw recipes are a tasty surprise (check out www.rawmom.com). Who 
knew to put creamy avocado in a curry spinach soup? Shannon did. Both avocado and 
spinach are high in soluble fiber, and the vegetables in the rest of the recipe offset the 
fat in the avocado. You can blanch and remove the skins of the bell peppers and toma-
toes if you want (see the “Blanching tomatoes” sidebar in this chapter), but blending 
this dish chops out a lot of insoluble fiber on its own. (A food processor may give you a 
better blend, but the blender works too.)
Preparation time: 5 to 8 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: Two 1-cup servings
1 bunch fresh spinach
1⁄4 cup fresh dill
1⁄2 of a red bell pepper
1 small ripe tomato
1⁄2 of an avocado
1⁄4 of a small onion (optional)
1 tablespoon Nama Shoyu (raw organic 
soy sauce)
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 teaspoon curry powder
1⁄2 cup water
1⁄2 diced red or orange bell pepper
 1 Combine all the ingredients in a blender or food processor.
 2 Blend and enjoy.
Vary It! If you can’t find Nama Shoyu, substitute 1 teaspoon Braggs Liquid Aminos, 1⁄2 tea-
spoon powdered kelp, 1 teaspoon powdered dulse (both seaweeds taste salty but are low 
sodium and high in minerals), or 1⁄2 teaspoon Celtic sea salt.

T Carrot Ginger Soup
Chef Andrea Boje (www.myfoodmyhealth.com/OurChefs/index.php?chefid=23) 
contributed this soup that’s easy to make and has a beautiful rich orange color. The ginger 
is a tummy-soother, and carrot juice has all the goodness of carrots without any of the irri-
tating fiber. You can serve it cold or at room temperature, but serving it freshly made is 
best. Use this dish as a first course or enjoy it for lunch with some fresh bread and grapes 
or cut apples. This soup will keep in the refrigerator for 5 days; avoid freezing it.
Tools: Juicer (optional)
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Yield: Four 1-cup servings
2 pounds organic carrots, or 3 cups carrot 
juice
2 ripe avocados, peeled and pitted
11⁄2 teaspoon salt
11⁄2 teaspoons lemon juice
1 teaspoon peeled and grated ginger
Diced avocado or crème fraîche for serving 
 1 If using carrots, run them through a juicer to make approximately 3 cups of carrot juice.
 2 Place the carrot juice, avocados, salt, lemon juice, and ginger into a blender and blend 
on high until smooth.
 3 Taste and add more lemon, ginger, or salt if desired. Pour into bowls, top with diced 
avocado or crème fraîche, and serve.
Vary It! For a sweeter taste to your soup, add 1 tablespoon agave nectar.
Tip: If you don’t want to make your own carrot juice, Odwalla and Bolthouse Farms both 
make great store-bought alternatives.

Serving Up Stomach-Safe Salads
In This Chapter
▶ Giving salads a fair shake
▶ Creating simple salads
▶ Kicking up your salads with unique ingredients and 
techniques
S
alads may be at the bottom of your safe food 
list because of the potential for difficult diges-
tion of the raw veggies. But as you progress through 
your own personalized IBS diet, you’re likely to feel 
a lessening of your symptoms and be in a position to 
begin adding new foods to your weekly menu. And 
raw vegetables can be a nutritious addition.
We absolutely acknowledge that raw salads 
are not a good choice for people who are in the 
midst of regular IBS-D flare-ups and attacks, but if you’ve graduated to a 
point where your attacks are minimal, you may be ready to add a safe salad. 
Consider trying the salad ingredients on their own before mixing them 
together in a salad to check for individual reactions.
Some research shows that fiber (including that found in veggies) can be a relief 
for about 80 percent of people with constipation, including IBS-C. Although 20 
percent find fiber irritating, the soluble and insoluble fiber in vegetables may 
be okay for many people with IBS-C. Tread carefully, but don’t be afraid.
For an IBS sufferer, salads are all about chewing. Foods like corn may not 
properly digest if you don’t chew them thoroughly. Let your teeth do more 
work and you’ll digest and absorb much better as a result. An old-time cure 
for digestive disorders is to chew your food 40 to 50 times per bite!
If you chew long enough, you can digest a portion of the carbs in your meal with 
the amylase enzyme in your saliva. That action sets the stage for your stom-
ach juices to start flowing and things to start gearing up in your gut. If you’re 
extremely sensitive to food moving through your gut, you may cringe at that 
thought, assuming you’re going to have a reaction to the food you’re just starting

to eat. However, if your stomach is presented with mush and not chunks, it has 
less work to do and can proceed with digestion much more calmly and smoothly.
Your constitution also plays a big role in determining how you react to salads. 
According to Ayurvedic practice, the Pitta constitution has enough stomach 
fire to digest raw salads, but the Vata constitution has very low stomach fire 
and therefore a difficult time digesting raw vegetables. Flip to Chapter 5 for 
more guidance on determining your constitution, and check out the following 
section to discover ways to combat the insoluble fiber in raw veggie salads.
 
Wash your vegetables in a sink full of water with about ten drops of grapefruit 
seed extract. The oil from grapefruit seeds is poisonous to parasites and bacteria 
and kills them on contact but it’s harmless to humans. In Chapter 16, we remind 
you to take grapefruit seed extract capsules or tablets when you’re dining out.
Sneaking Soluble Fiber into Your Salads
When you eat salads, you’re consuming more plant cellulose (called insoluble 
fiber, which doesn’t break down in your intestines) than the soluble fiber 
that’s less irritating. If you want to eat salads without worry, include soluble-
fiber vegetables like beets, carrots, potatoes, parsnips, squash, sweet pota-
toes, turnips, or yams in your salad.
You can also balance the insoluble fiber in your salad with a side of soluble-
fiber bread — store-bought manna bread or pita bread, or homemade 
sourdough or coconut bread (see Chapters 12 and 13 respectively for these 
recipes). Another simple soluble solution is to use miracle noodles as a 
salad ingredient. Made from glucomannan, a highly soluble plant fiber, these 
noodles are just what you need to balance the fiber in your meal without 
adding carbs.
Sensational Salad Recipes
We are strong advocates of organic produce for all people, but if you have 
IBS, we recommend getting organic greens and salad fixings whenever 
possible. You want to minimize the amount of non-salad stuff you get with 
your salad, and organic greens are free of pesticides, genetic modifications, 
and any “freshening” sprays or chemicals. We’ve had many reports of folks 
with IBS who were introducing salads into their diet to find that they reacted 
to conventional lettuce but not organic lettuce of the same sort.
You also want to keep an eye on cleanliness: Even if your greens come 
prewashed in a bag, somebody’s hands or gloves have touched them. Just 
because a salad-bar worker is wearing gloves doesn’t mean your salad 
greens are safe. People wearing gloves often perform the same tasks (making 
change, picking up phones, and so on) that bare-handed folks do, so don’t 
assume gloves equal total sanitation.

 Chapter 10: Serving Up Stomach-Safe Salads
 
T French Lentil Salad
This recipe is one of Kendall Conrad’s favorite salads from her book Eat Well Feel Well 
(www.eatwellfeelwellthebook.com) because it’s satisfying and exotic, with lovely 
grapefruit and cumin flavors and the interesting combination of fresh, crunchy vegeta-
bles and sweet currants. You can serve it warm or chilled, but letting it meld for 3 to 6 
hours really brings out the flavors.
This salad has a lot of ingredients but it’s easy to put together. If you’re worried about 
one or two of the ingredients not agreeing with you, just remove them. Just remember 
that Kendall created this dish for a family member who had severe digestive issues, so 
it was formulated with digestive compatibility in mind. The obvious foods you may 
have to be careful of are shallots and cayenne, although cayenne can be used to treat 
constipation and folklore credits it with stopping bleeding in the intestines. The main 
soluble factor in this salad is the main ingredient — lentils. Cumin, coriander, and 
fennel relieve gas and bloating; thyme and cilantro soothe the stomach. Garlic may help 
your symptoms if your IBS is being triggered by bacteria and yeast; leave it out if you 
know you react to it. A 2004 study showed that curry relieves abdominal pain.
Soaking time: 24 hours
Preparation time: About 15 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: 7 servings
2 tablespoons fresh thyme
1⁄2 cup (about 3 large) shallots, finely chopped
Juice of one lemon (about 1⁄4 cup)
Juice of 1⁄2 grapefruit (about 1⁄4 cup)
2 tablespoons ground cumin
1 tablespoon celery salt
2 teaspoons curry powder (no fillers or 
starches added)
1 teaspoon ground coriander
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon freshly grated lemon zest
1⁄2 cup extra virgin olive oil
1⁄2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
2 cups cooked French green lentils
1⁄2 cup currants
1 fennel bulb, sliced very thinly with fronds 
removed
4 stalks of celery (about 1 cup), strings 
removed and finely chopped
1 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley, chopped
1⁄2 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
 1 In a large mixing bowl add the thyme, shallots, lemon juice, grapefruit juice, cumin, 
celery salt, curry powder, coriander, garlic, lemon zest, olive oil, and cayenne pepper. 
Whisk ingredients together.
 2 Pour the juice mixture over the lentils and add the currants, fennel, celery, parsley, and 
cilantro. Mix well.

T Cauliflower Salad with 
 
Dairy-Free Dill Dressing
Andrea Boje (www.myfoodmyhealth.com/OurChefs/index.php?chefid=23) sub-
mitted this recipe that is appropriate for those whose stomachs are quite tolerant of 
salads. It does contain three vegetables that veer more toward insoluble fiber, but if 
you feel you’re ready to add some peppers and onions to your diet, this recipe is a very 
tasty way to do it. Steaming the cauliflower makes it more digestible, as does very finely 
dicing and mincing the peppers and onions — you can even use a food processor and 
really break down the fiber that way. The dressing that goes with this recipe provides 
dill, an herb that’s very good for digestion and soothing for the intestines.
Tools: Steamer basket
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 3 to 5 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1 large head of cauliflower
1 medium red bell pepper, finely diced
1⁄4 cup red onion, minced
1⁄4 teaspoon salt, or more to taste
4 grinder-turns freshly ground pepper (about 1⁄8 
teaspoon), or more to taste
Dairy-Free Dill Dressing (enough to coat; see 
the following recipe)
 1 Remove and discard the cauliflower stem and cut the head into small florets. Place the 
cauliflower in a steamer basket and steam over boiling water until slightly soft but still 
firm and crunchy, about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from steam and set aside to cool.
 2 Place the cooled cauliflower in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse until the cauliflower 
is coarsely chopped. Pour into a medium mixing bowl and cut any remaining large 
pieces with a knife.
 3 Add the red bell pepper, red onion, salt and pepper, and enough dressing to coat. 
Adjust seasonings to taste. Reserve a little minced onion or bell pepper for garnishing.

Dairy-Free Dill Dressing
This dressing is a great summertime recipe from chef Andrea Boje (www.myfoodmy-
health.com/OurChefs/index.php?chefid=23) that accentuates the sweetness of 
cauliflower in the salad. If you don’t heat the ingredients over 118 degrees, this dressing 
can complement a Raw diet (see Chapter 3).
Silken tofu is great for making creamy, dairy-free dressings. Andrea does recommend 
that you simmer the tofu to help with digestion, especially if you have problems digest-
ing soy.

T Sprouted Salad
For easy digestibility and great nutrition, try one of our favorites. The servings are 
small, but the sprouts are a great way to enjoy seeds packed with powerful nutrition — 
they’re rich with enzymes and easy to digest. The ingredients in this salad are few, but 
you can add your favorite salad ingredients and make it your own recipe; we recom-
mend dressing it with a tasty vinaigrette. Enjoy it with a thick slice of manna bread.

T Soba Salad
This salad from chef Caroline Nation at www.myfoodmyhealth.com is a meal in itself; 
check out a photo of it in the color section. It’s versatile because you can easily substitute 
your favorite vegetables for the ones listed here. For a gluten-free salad, make sure your 
noodles are 100 percent buckwheat, which doesn’t contain gluten. This salad is even tastier 
on the second day, so you may want to make it a day ahead of a planned event. (But gener-
ally speaking, we don’t recommend eating the same dish two days in a row, especially if you 
are newly graduated into enjoying salads — see Chapter 3 for more on rotating foods.) This 
salad contains many raw vegetables, so it may not be for you if you’re just dipping your 
toes into salads (which we don’t recommend you do literally). Soba noodles (or substituted 
miracle noodles) give you a good amount of soluble fiber to balance the insoluble fiber in 
the raw vegetables. Remember to cut your vegetables very finely and chew them well to 
make them more digestible and to get the nutrients that are concentrated in raw foods.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 10 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
4 quarts water, salted
1⁄2 cup broccoli florets
1⁄2 cup cauliflower florets
8 ounces soba noodles
1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
1 cup thinly sliced red cabbage
1 head green or ruby leaf lettuce, washed, 
drained and thinly sliced
1⁄2 cup tahini
1⁄2 cup water
2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice or brown rice 
vinegar
4 medium radishes, thinly sliced into rounds
2 medium carrots, shredded
1 scallion, white and green parts, thinly sliced
 1 In a large pot, bring 4 quarts of salted water to a boil. Add the broccoli and blanch until 
barely tender, about 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and immediately plunge into 
a bowl of ice water or rinse under cold water to stop the cooking. Repeat the process with 
the cauliflower, using the same water. When cool, drain the vegetables and set aside.
 2 Add the noodles to the boiling pot and cook for 6 to 8 minutes until just tender. Drain 
the noodles and immediately rinse under cold water. Sprinkle with the sesame oil and 
toss to keep the noodles from sticking.
 3 Combine the cabbage and lettuce in a serving bowl. Place the noodles on top and 
arrange the cauliflower and broccoli around the edges.
 4 Whisk the tahini, water, and lemon juice or vinegar in a small bowl until well combined. 
Pour the dressing over the salad and top with the radishes, carrots and scallions.

T Citrus Marinated Salad
Andrea Boje (www.myfoodmyhealth.com/OurChefs/index.php?chefid=23) cre-
ated this refreshing summertime salad that you can enjoy on its own or on a bed of torn 
lettuce with canned tuna and toasted sesame oil. The longer the vegetables sit in the 
citrus/umeboshi vinegar marinade, the softer and more flavorful they become. Consider 
making the salad in large quantities because it stores in the fridge for 2 weeks.
The timing of the marinade is the key to making this recipe a safe, IBS-friendly salad. If 
you’re comfortable with raw vegetables and want the crunch, simply pull your vegeta-
bles out of the marinade in 30 to 45 minutes. Otherwise, you can allow the marinade to 
do its magic for up to 3 hours. The marinade breaks down the vegetable fibers, allowing 
smoother digestion. You may not know umeboshi vinegar, but it’s available in health 
food stores. It’s a Japanese vinegar made from umeboshi plums and has a tart, fruity 
taste that’s very different from apple cider vinegar but has the same ability to assist 
digestion. Check out this lovely salad in the color section.
Marinating time: 30 minutes to 3 hours
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: 6 servings
1⁄2 a medium green cabbage
2 large carrots
4 cups orange juice
Juice of 4 lemons (about 1 cup)
1⁄4 cup umeboshi plum vinegar
2 tablespoons salt, divided
1⁄2 a medium red cabbage
1⁄4 cup apple cider vinegar
1 tablespoon salt
2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds
 1 Thinly slice the green cabbage and cut the carrots into 2-inch long sticks and then cut 
again lengthwise to make several thin wafers. Place in a large bowl.
 2 Add 2 cups of the orange juice, 1⁄2 cup of the lemon juice, and the umeboshi vinegar to 
the vegetables and mix the ingredients with your hands. Making sure the liquid com-
pletely covers the vegetables (weighting them down with a plate if necessary), let the 
mixture marinate for 1 hour or to your desired tenderness (anywhere between 30 min-
utes and 3 hours).
 3 Thinly slice the red cabbage and place in another large bowl with the apple cider vine-
gar and remaining orange and lemon juice. Sprinkle with the salt and mix with your 
hands. Let the cabbage mixture marinate for 1 hour or to your desired tenderness (any-
where between 30 minutes and 3 hours).
 4 When you’re done marinating, drain both bowls of vegetables and combine them into 
one bowl, stirring to mix. Sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds and serve.

 Chapter 10: Serving Up Stomach-Safe Salads
Vary It! You can also add cauliflower florets to the veggies in this salad. Marinate 1 cup of 
chopped cauliflower florets in 1 cup of orange juice and 1⁄4 cup of umeboshi or rice vinegar 
for 2 hours and then drain them and add them to the other drained vegetables.
Tip: You can save and reuse the vegetable marinade. Mix a little marinade with olive oil 
for a quick salad dressing.

Delightful Dressings and 
Magnificent Mayos
Dressing up a salad is an art in itself, and here we give you some great 
options to choose from. We love these dressings because they are made from 
scratch but still deliver flavor, and you know exactly what goes in them.
In contrast, the ingredient lists of many commercial salad dressings read 
like a who’s who of chemicals, additives, flavorings, and preservatives. In 
general, commercial dressings may contain starchy, wheat-based thickeners; 
MSG; dairy; and yeast. Fat-free or low-fat dressings often have extra sugars to 
create a palatable taste in the absence of the missing fat, so your “healthier” 
dressing may not be as beneficial as you think.
Mayonnaise is typically made with soybean oil, eggs, egg yolks, sugar, and 
other flavorings. Some products have less fat than the original versions, but 
they also contain something like twice the number of ingredients, including 
sulfites, which are used as a preservative but can cause headaches, heart-
burn, and intestinal cramps.
 
If you’re very liberal with your condiments, be sure to use chemical-free condi-
ments as much as possible.

T Lemon Gone Wild Dressing
Angela Elliott (www.she-zencuisine.com) shares her zesty, lemony salad dressing; 
she suggests you serve it on arugula, but you can also quickly open a 6-ounce package 
of mesclun green salad. Add a side of high soluble-fiber bread (such as sourdough 
white — see the recipe in Chapter 12 — or manna) and you have a meal suitable for 
IBS-D and IBS-C. Bottom line: Any salad will do.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: 6 servings (2⁄3 cup total)
1⁄4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
3⁄4 teaspoon minced fresh garlic
3⁄4 teaspoon salt
1⁄8 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper
3⁄4 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves
 1 Combine all the ingredients gently in a bowl to blend fully but leave the vinaigrette clear 
(not emulsified) for a better presentation.

T Asian Dressing
Living on Maui, artist, writer, and chef Marilyn Jansen (www.amaryllisofhawaii.com) 
cooks with a Pacific Rim flair. Her Asian Dressing is best over non-wheat noodles — try 
thin buckwheat, rice noodles, or the no-carb miracle noodles we discuss earlier in the 
chapter over a bed of soft lettuce. The combination is good for IBS-C, but go light on the 
dressing and heavy on the soluble noodles for IBS-D.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: Eight 2-tablespoon servings (1 cup total)
1⁄4 cup sesame oil
4 tablespoons vegetable oil
1⁄4 cup soy sauce
1⁄4 cup rice wine vinegar
2 tablespoons maple syrup
1 tablespoon light miso paste (optional)

T Shannon’s Spicy Caesar Dressing
If you find that you’re craving the zest of a Caesar salad dressing, consider this one-step 
IBS-friendly alternative from the kitchen of Shannon Leone (www.rawmom.com). We 
assure you this is IBS-friendly, especially when you read the ingredients of one of the 
popular commercial brands, which has about 35 ingredients including milk, cheese, 
cream, yeast, and flavor enhancers, any of which can act as an IBS trigger.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: 15 servings (nearly 2 cups total)
1 cup flaxseed, olive, or hemp oil
Juice of 1 to 2 lemons (about 1⁄2 cup)
1⁄3 cup raw tahini
1 to 2 cloves garlic
Nama Shoyu, or 1⁄2 teaspoon sea salt
 1 Blend all ingredients until creamy.

Substituting potential condiment triggers
We know how much people can be attached 
to their condiments. Carolyn always teased her 
foster son for seeming to subsist entirely on 
condiments. His fridge, to this day, is condiment-
heavy, and he’s not alone. Whether condiment 
use is a habit, a comfort food, or a way to mask 
the flavor of a healthy food, people with IBS can 
really miss their add-ons.
You know from reading the labels that grocery 
store condiments are full of sugar, wheat, and 
additives that may be messing with your guts. 
And we know that you reason that using a dash 
of ketchup or mayonnaise shouldn’t hurt, but 
depending on your level of sensitivity, they may 
really have an ill effect.
Never fear. Here are a couple of safer condi-
ments that you can find at most health food and 
grocery stores.
 ✓ If you’re sensitive to the wheat and soy in 
soy sauce, try Braggs Liquid Aminos.
 ✓ If you’re sensitive to the fat in regular may-
onnaise, try nut pâté (see the recipe in 
Chapter 7) or Angela’s Happy Mayo (which 
we include in this chapter)
Make sure you read the labels first and are 
aware that these substitutes don’t taste exactly 
like your high-sugar condiments, but they may 
get the job done.
 
T Angela’s Happy Mayo
Thanks to Angela Elliot (www.she-zencuisine.com) for this Raw twist on mayonnaise. 
It’s low on fat (which makes it IBS-friendly) and high on taste, and compared to commer-
cial mayonnaise, it’s a miracle. You may even want to use it as a dressing for a salad.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: Eight 2-tablespoon servings (1 cup total)
1⁄2 cup raw tahini
1 to 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
2 tablespoons yacon syrup, or 6 soaked honey 
dates, pitted
1 teaspoon sea salt
Juice of 1 orange (about 1⁄4 cup)
2 tablespoons fresh dill
1 cup water
 1 Blend all the ingredients and mix with your favorite salad or spread on your favorite 
sandwich.

T Homestyle Mayonnaise
Although Carolyn remembers the days when people made mayonnaise using egg 
beaters, we doubt many people these days even know what an egg beater is! The may-
onnaise-making job is much easier now with the use of blenders, which emulsify (create 
a suspension of the ingredients) without the elbow grease. Using a high-speed blender 
means you don’t even have to slowly drizzle the oil into the mixture to get complete 
emulsification. Use a free-range or pasteurized egg to eliminate salmonella concerns, 
and then eat this mayo immediately or refrigerate it in a covered container for up to 
a week.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: Ten 2-tablespoon servings (11⁄4 cups total)
1 egg
1 teaspoon dry mustard
1⁄2 teaspoon each white pepper and sea salt
Pinch of cayenne pepper
3 tablespoons lemon juice
1 cup olive oil or safflower oil
1 tablespoon hot water
 1 In a blender, combine the egg, mustard, white pepper, salt, cayenne pepper, and lemon 
juice and blend well.
 2 With the blender still running, add the oil in a slow, steady stream and blend until all oil 
is emulsified. Blend in 1 tablespoon hot water at the end.

Marvelous Main Dishes that 
Won’t Torment Your Gut
In This Chapter
▶ Chowing down on beef, poultry, and seafood entrees
▶ Getting that pasta sensation without the wheat
▶ Combining your main dish and side dish
W
hether you’re cooking and eating for one 
or for your whole family, we know that 
dinner can be a stressful time for people with IBS. 
You may be tired of preparing special plates for 
yourself while you make family favorites for every-
one else that you can’t enjoy.
What if you could cook one meal that the whole 
family can devour? In this chapter, we offer lots of 
IBS-friendly twists on dinner favorites as well as 
unique IBS recipes. Nobody needs to know they’re 
IBS-friendly! We often hear that when people feel 
like they’re eating typical meals, they feel better 
about themselves and seem to be less preoccu-
pied about their symptoms.
The recipes in this chapter provide something for 
everyone, with meat, poultry, fish, and vegetarian 
options. You may already know that meat, poul-
try, and fish are high in protein; no evidence sug-
gests that these protein foods trigger or worsen 
IBS. However, the company they keep can be the 
problem, such as the fatty skin on chicken or turkey or the marbled fat on 
beef. In some people with IBS, fat can increase gastric motility and lead to IBS 
symptoms. The fat content in fatty fish like mackerel and salmon can some-
times cause faster meal transit time. The trick is to avoid that particular part 
of the food or sample very little of it. Or add a side dish high in soluble fiber 
to help absorb the fat.

Savoring the Solubility Factor
Finding enough soluble fiber in your main dish may be easier than you think 
because you can work with more ingredients. Great soluble-fiber main dish ingre-
dients include rice, pasta, barley, mushrooms, carrots, potatoes, sweet potatoes, 
yams, turnips, beets, squash, and pumpkin. You want at least half of your fiber to 
be the soluble kind. If your dish of choice isn’t as high in fiber as you want, add a 
side of miracle noodles (no-carb noodles made from soluble plant fiber) or your 
homemade sourdough white bread (see Chapter 12 for the recipe).
To improve the solubility picture, you can reduce insoluble fiber by peeling 
your tomatoes and potatoes and stripping the fibrous strings from celery. 
When cooking and preparing your meals, the more you puree, cook, and 
blend your vegetables, beans, and nuts, the easier your food is to digest!
A helpful tool is the soluble/insoluble fiber chart in Appendix C. At a glance you 
can see the fiber content of many common foods. Choose the ones that have 
nearly the same amount of soluble as insoluble fiber (give or take .7 grams).
Beefing Up Your Stew 
for a Meaty Main Dish
If you have a sensitive gut, limit the portion size of your meat. The size of a 
pack of playing cards (about 3 to 4 ounces) is enough meat to satisfy your 
protein needs, with each ounce providing 7 grams of protein. Cooked meat 
freezes well, so you can make the full recipe and save some for later.
Beef has a nice hearty flavor (unlike the delicate flavor of chicken), so you 
want to pair it with hearty vegetables like potatoes and carrots. We forgo 
steak recipes in this section because they’re pretty straightforward: Season 
the meat, heat the grill, and cook for 6 minutes on each side. Just remember 
to buy lean meat and pass on the ribeye — the eye is all fat.
 
Beef Pumpkin Stew
Here’s an IBS-friendly twist on a classic beef stew; it’s from chef Michelle Gay (www.
eatingjourney.wordpress.com). Pumpkin is a great IBS fruit (yes, it’s a fruit) that’s 
high in soluble fiber. Cooked onions, carrots, and mushrooms are all great IBS vegeta-
bles because they are also high in soluble fiber. You can peel some of the long threads 
of fiber from the celery to make it more digestible. We’ve kept in the tomatoes; you can 
make them more stomach-compatible by blanching off the skins — see Chapter 9 for 
easy blanching instructions.

 Chapter 11: Marvelous Main Dishes that Won’t Torment Your Gut
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 3 to 5 hours
Yield: 4 servings
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 medium or 1⁄2 of a large onion, cut up
4 cloves garlic, pressed
31⁄2 cups raw pumpkin, cut into 1-inch squares
1⁄2 of a chili pepper, diced
1 carrot, sliced
6 to 7 cups water
2 large celery stalks
3 tomatoes, chopped
6 standard-size mushrooms, sliced
3 tablespoons tomato sauce (jarred, canned, 
or from the Marinara Sauce recipe later in 
this chapter)
1 pound stew beef (top round)
1⁄2 teaspoon each salt and pepper
11⁄2 tablespoons Italian seasoning
4 to 5 bay leaves
 1 Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over high heat. Add the onion and garlic and sauté 
until the onion is translucent (about 8 minutes).
 2 Add in the pumpkin, chili pepper, and carrots along with 1 cup of water. Cover and 
steam for about 1 minute. Add the celery, tomatoes, and mushrooms. Cover and steam 
for about 2 minutes.
 3 While the veggies are steaming, coat your meat with a liberal amount of salt and pepper 
and the Italian seasoning. Add the beef to the pot and cover for about 1 to 2 minutes 
(the meat doesn’t need to cook through).
 4 Add 5 to 6 cups of water and 3 tablespoons of tomato sauce. Top with the bay leaves, 
cover and simmer for 3 to 5 hours.
Vary It! Because fresh pumpkins aren’t always available, you can substitute butternut 
squash or even yams for similar results with this recipe.
Tip: You can add another cup or two of water in Step 4 if you want a thinner stew.

Perking Up Poultry without 
Ravaging Your Stomach
Some may find chicken and turkey easier to digest than beef, but crispy, fatty 
skin and BBQ chicken wings may trigger some symptoms of IBS-D. Luckily, 
you can easily remove that type of fat. All in all, chicken has the lowest fat 
content of any meat you may eat. The following recipes give you lots of 
chicken options, as well as a turkey twist on a classic.

Sabra Chicken
Chef/nutritionist Caroline Nation (www.myfoodmyhealth.com) adapted this recipe 
from Oded Schwartz. The marinade makes it particularly tasty, even without fat, and 
the sweet, tangy, salty mix of oranges and olives is particularly delicious. Make sure to 
dry the chicken breasts thoroughly after you remove them from the marinade to ensure 
even browning. This dish is a fine choice for both IBS-C and -D because chicken has 
very little insoluble fiber to worry about. You can easily balance potentially tricky ingre-
dients like the olive oil and olives with a sourdough dinner roll or a soluble side (such 
as Basic Quinoa, Oven-Baked UnFried Rice, or Shannon’s Quick “Rice” — you can find 
recipes for all these dishes in Chapter 12). This dish will keep in the fridge, covered, 
for 4 days. Take a peek at this lovely dish in the color section.
Marinating time: 2 hours
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 50 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
2 cups chicken stock
Zest of 1⁄2 an orange, grated or julienned
1⁄2 cup fresh orange juice
1⁄8 teaspoon paprika
1⁄4 teaspoon each salt and freshly ground black 
pepper
Six 5-ounce chicken breasts, with skin and 
bones
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 medium onion, finely chopped
8 green olives, pitted
Chopped fresh mint to garnish
 1 In a shallow baking dish, mix together 1 cup of the chicken stock and the zest, orange 
juice, and paprika with a sprinkling of salt and pepper. Add the chicken and marinate 
refrigerated for 2 hours, turning the chicken a couple of times to make sure it’s all sub-
merged in the marinade.
 2 Remove the chicken breasts from the marinade, shake off, and pat dry thoroughly.
 3 In a large skillet with sides, heat the oil over medium-high heat until your hand feels hot 
when held 1 inch above the pan. Add the chicken, skin side down, and cook until golden 
brown, about 4 minutes per side, adding more oil if the pan is too dry. Transfer the 
cooked chicken to a plate and set aside. Pour off all but a thin film of fat.
 4 Lower the heat to medium and add the onions and the rest of the chicken stock to the 
skillet after a few minutes. Scrape up any brown bits and cook until the onions are 
translucent, about 5 minutes.
 5 Return the chicken to the pan, cover, and simmer gently over low heat for another 30 
minutes or until the chicken is cooked through. Transfer the chicken to a plate and tent 
with foil to keep hot.
 6 Add the olives to the liquid, raise the heat, and cook until the sauce bubbles and thickens, 
about 3 to 5 minutes. Pour the sauce over the chicken. Sprinkle with the mint and serve hot.

Meatloaf (Turkey-Style)
Colleen Robinson (www.crimsondoorhealing.com) has adapted this family favorite 
for IBS sufferers by adding IBS-friendly high soluble-fiber oatmeal. Turkey has a bit more 
fat than chicken, but that’s mainly in the skin; this recipe uses ground turkey, so the skin 
isn’t an issue. Adding the optional tofu increases your protein intake and solubility factor. 
It also keeps the turkey moist, which is a bonus. For added fun, mix the ingredients with 
your hands; just be sure to thoroughly wash them before and after you mix.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 1 hour, 30 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
2 pounds ground white-meat turkey
1 package extra-firm tofu, drained and mashed 
(optional)
1⁄2 cup quick-cooking rolled oats
1⁄2 cup finely chopped onions
1⁄3 cup finely chopped red bell pepper
1 large or 2 small eggs, gently beaten with a 
fork
1⁄2 teaspoon each salt, black pepper, and chili 
powder
1 teaspoon dried parsley, plus extra for the top
1⁄4 cup ketchup
 1 Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
 2 Gently mix everything but the ketchup and cooking spray — the more you work it, the 
tougher the meat becomes.
 3 Lightly grease a loaf pan and put the mixture into the pan, patting it down gently. Pour 
the ketchup on top and sprinkle with a bit more dried parsley. Bake at 325 for about 
90 minutes.
Tip: You can buy red pepper in a jar — it’s more expensive, but the skin is off and it’s 
super fast!

Fancy Chicken Roll-Ups
Thanks to our healing chef, Colleen Robinson (www.crimsondoorhealing.com) for 
this IBS-friendly version of Chicken Cordon Bleu. The low-fat chicken makes it a good 
option for both IBS-D and IBS-C. Asparagus is also very high in soluble fiber, but you 
can make it even more digestible by chopping the asparagus very finely (although you 
compromise the look of the dish by doing so). Soy is also high in soluble fiber.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 45 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
Four 5-ounce chicken breast fillets, butterflied
1⁄2 teaspoon butter
1 large clove garlic, minced
12 spears asparagus
4 slices Tofutti soy cheese
1 teaspoon sea salt
1 teaspoon sage
1 cup chicken broth
2 tablespoons flour, such as brown rice flour
 1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
 2 Lay the chicken fillets, cut side up, on a cutting board, dot them with butter, and sprin-
kle the garlic onto one side of each fillet.
 3 Wash the asparagus, get rid of the ends and chop into pieces just a tiny bit longer than 
the chicken fillets breasts. Divide asparagus evenly among the fillets, placing them on 
top of the garlic and leaving the tips hanging out a little bit for enhanced appearance.
 4 Place one piece of soy cheese over the asparagus on each fillet and then roll the 
chicken up, sealing edges with toothpicks soaked for 10 minutes in water (so they don’t 
burn). Sprinkle the sea salt and sage over the top of each breast, crushing the sage with 
your fingers to break it up and release more of the flavor.
 5 Pour the chicken broth in a roasting pan and add the fillets. Bake for 45 minutes, or 
until the juices run clear when you stick a knife in the middle of a fillet.
 6 Remove the fillets and thicken the remaining pan juices with the flour to create a sauce 
to pour over the dish.
Vary It! If you’re avoiding soy, you can replace the soy cheese with rice cheese. If you’re 
just avoiding the lactose, you can substitute one of these Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD) 
safe cheeses: cheddar, Colby, Swiss, or havarti
Tip: Butterflying chicken means that the breast has been split open and laid flat. You can 
buy chicken that is already flying or split it yourself.

Sun-Dried and Wined Chicken
Michelle Gay in Western Australia (www.eatingjourney.wordpress.com) shared her 
favorite chicken recipe with us. Chicken is a safe IBS food; it has a very low fat content, and 
the onion, garlic, and basil in this recipe make it great for yeast-busting (see Chapter 18 for 
more on yeast problems). Plus, cooked onions are very high in soluble fiber, bringing the 
whole recipe up another notch in IBS-friendliness. Some folks feel like mushrooms shouldn’t 
appear in a yeast-free recipe; they’re high in soluble fiber, but leave them out if you prefer.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 25 minutes
Yield: 3 servings
3 teaspoons olive oil
2 to 3 cloves of garlic, diced
1 small onion, cut up
4 to 5 sun-dried tomatoes, diced up
4 to 6 mushrooms, sliced
Generous splash of white wine (about 3 
tablespoons)
10 to 15 basil leaves
Three 5-ounce boneless, skinless chicken 
breasts
 1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
 2 In a small pan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the garlic, onion, and sun-dried 
tomatoes and sauté for about 3 to 4 minutes.
 3 Add the mushrooms. When the mushrooms cook down to half their size (about 5 min-
utes), splash in white wine and cook for about 1 to 2 minutes. Turn off heat and sprinkle 
basil over the top of the wine mixture.
 4 Measure out 3 pieces of tinfoil big enough to fully surround one chicken breast each.
 5 Place one chicken breast onto each piece of foil and cover with 1⁄3 of the white wine mix-
ture. Seal off the foil packets, place them on a cookie sheet, and bake them for about 20 
to 25 minutes.
Vary It! If tomato skins are irritating to your tummy and you can’t find skinless sun-dried 
tomatoes at the store, you can substitute fresh skinless tomatoes or make your own sun-
dried tomatoes. Blanch the skins off your tomatoes (you can find instructions for blanching 
tomatoes in Chapter 9) and then slice them into strips (discarding the seeds) and dry them 
in your oven on small wire cake racks (to expose the whole tomato) at 150 degrees for 10 
to 15 hours. You can season with garlic powder, basil, and/or sea salt before baking if 
desired. A properly dried sun-dried tomato is chewy and flexible, not brittle.
Tip: If you don’t use wine in your cooking, you can leave it out. Remember, the alcohol 
evaporates during cooking, leaving just the (concentrated) flavor of the wine.

What is zest?
Zest  (and we don’t know why it’s called that) is 
the outer, colorful portion of the peel of citrus 
fruits like limes, lemons, oranges, and tangerines. 
If you scrape it with your fingernail, you get an 
almost oily and very aromatic liquid on your 
finger. Zest contains aromatic oils that add a 
boost to certain recipes.
The trick to zesting is to scrape off the colored 
portion only and avoid the white pithy (meaning 
spongy, not humorous) part of the rind. Of 
course, that part contains bioflavonoids and is 
very healthy, but it’s also bitter and not called 
for in any recipes we’ve heard of. You can buy 
a tool called a zester, or you can just use a veg-
etable peeler, food grater, or sharp knife to cut 
strips of zest (though if you go that route, you 
have to cut them into finer and finer strips).
 
Spiced Honey Chicken
This low-fat chicken dish appears in Grain-Free Gourmet: Delicious Recipes for Healthy 
Living by Jodi Bager and Jenny Lass (Whitecap Books) and became a favorite among 
their readers; check them out at www.grainfreegourmet.com. It may become one of 
your IBS favorites too; chicken is a low-fat meat, and the other ingredients shouldn’t 
give you any trouble, although you may want to powder your almonds instead of sliver-
ing them if almonds are one of your triggers. This dish is simple to make and brings a 
touch of Morocco to the table. Try baking it with a head of high soluble-fiber cauliflower 
cut into florets to make it a one-pot meal.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 1 hour, 20 minutes
Yield: 7 servings
1⁄2 cup honey
2 garlic cloves, pressed
2 tablespoons plain yogurt
1 teaspoon lemon zest
1 tablespoon lemon juice
3 to 4 pounds chicken parts with bones and skin
1⁄2 teaspoon each salt and black pepper
1⁄4 teaspoon each ground nutmeg and ground 
cloves
1 cup almond slivers
1 cup raisins
6 cinnamon sticks

 1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Place the chicken skin side up in a 10-x-15-inch casse-
role dish.
 2 Combine the honey, garlic, yogurt, lemon rind, and lemon juice in a bowl and drizzle 
half of the mixture over the meat.
 3 Sprinkle the meat with the salt, pepper, nutmeg, cloves, almonds, and raisins and place 
the cinnamon sticks evenly around the casserole dish. Pour the rest of the honey mix-
ture over the chicken and spices.
 4 Bake for 1 hour and 20 minutes, basting every 30 minutes. Check at the one hour point 
to test for doneness.

Something’s Fishy: Fantastic Fish Dishes
Fish is good for your brain and for the brain in your stomach (the one that 
sets off your IBS), too, because of the anti-inflammatory properties of fish’s 
omega-3 fatty acids. Fish seems to digest faster than meat or poultry, so it 
can be a safer food for IBS. Smaller fish are healthier for you because they 
eat fewer other fish and therefore ingest less mercury and fewer other toxins 
from increasingly polluted oceans and lakes. The best fish for your main 
course is wild Alaska salmon.
 
In IBS For Dummies (Wiley), we talk about serotonin, the feel-good neurotrans-
mitter that’s mostly found in the gut. In fact, 90 percent of the serotonin in the 
whole body is found in the gut, making up what is referred to as “the second 
brain.”

Seared Salmon with Sautéed 
 
Summer Vegetables
Ela Guidon, a New York personal chef, whole-food educator, cooking instructor, and 
health counselor originally from Peru, contributed this quick, easy, colorful, and easy-
to-digest recipe. You can find her at www.myfoodmyhealth.com/OurChefs/index.
php?chefid=17.
The vegetable fiber in this recipe is made more digestible by steaming and sautéing. 
Cooked carrots, cucumber, and peppers have a high soluble-fiber content, more so than 
broccoli. To make the recipe even more IBS-friendly, you can steam the broccoli for 6 
minutes, or use less broccoli and substitute more of the other vegetables. The fiber 
content of radish is unclear, so you can leave that vegetable out or chop it finely. You 
may also offset the insoluble fiber in this recipe with soluble sides such as basmati rice, 
millet, or sourdough white or manna bread. Make sure you pay attention to your timer 
so you don’t overcook the salmon.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 15 to 20 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
3 cups broccoli florets
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 carrot, peeled and cut into 1⁄4-inch-thick 
rounds
1 yellow pepper, chopped
1 red pepper, chopped
1 cucumber, peeled, seeded, and cut 
into 2-inch spears
1 bunch of radishes (about 5 radishes), 
quartered and keeping some of the greens 
attached
1 teaspoon lemon juice
4 basil leaves, chopped
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon coconut oil
Four 5-ounce salmon fillets
 1 Steam the broccoli florets for 3 to 6 minutes and set aside.
 2 In a large skillet heat the olive oil. Add the carrot and sauté for 1 to 3 minutes. Add the 
peppers, broccoli, cucumber, and radishes and sauté for 1 to 3 minutes. Remove to a 
bowl and sprinkle with lemon juice, basil, and salt.
 3 Heat the coconut oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Season the salmon with salt 
and then add it to the skillet searing for about 4 minutes on each side. At 8 minutes, 
check to make sure the salmon is cooked through. If not, cook one more minute on 
each side.
 4 Serve the salmon on top of the sautéed vegetables.

Herbed Tilapia with Lime
This recipe comes from Raman Prasad’s Recipes for the Specific Carbohydrate Diet™ 
(Fair Winds Press). Visit Raman at his Web site (www.scdrecipe.com/cookbook). 
You can also use other kinds of white fish for this recipe, but you may need to reduce 
the cooking time accordingly if the fish fillets are thinner.
Tilapia is a very soft type of fish that doesn’t require too much fuss; just be careful not 
to overcook it. It’s a low-fat fish, and the seasonings in this recipe are safe for IBS, so 
this dish is a very IBS-friendly meal.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 15 minutes
Yield: 2 servings
1 tablespoon olive oil
1⁄8 teaspoon each thyme and dried basil
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
Two 6-ounce tilapia fillets
Juice of 1⁄2 a lime (about 1⁄8 cup)
 1 Heat the olive oil over medium heat in a stovetop pan.
 2 Sprinkle the thyme, basil, and salt equally on both sides of the fillets. Add the fillets to 
the pan and cook for 5 to 7 minutes on each side, or until cooked through.
 3 Place on serving plates, sprinkle the lime juice over the fillets, and serve.
Tip: Mango Salsa makes a great side for this recipe — see the recipe in Chapter 7.

Panko: Fancy flake or basic crumb?
Although panko has been elevated to exotic 
status and prices in food circles, it’s basically 
just crumbed stale bread. But panko is said to 
be lighter, crispier, and crunchier than Western 
bread crumbs, with a coarser grind and more 
surface area to absorb spices and season-
ings. Panko’s other purported powers include 
a lacy, airy layering of breading; a surface that 
doesn’t absorb grease as easily; and the abil-
ity to create a great crusty topping under the 
broiler. You can find panko in most foodie stores 
and even some supermarkets, and the nearby 
recipe for Coconut Panko Shrimp shows you 
how to make your own flakes.
 
Coconut Panko Shrimp
Marilyn Jansen is an artist, writer, and chef Carolyn sees every Saturday morning at the 
farmer’s market in Kahului, Maui. She contributed this recipe from her book Amaryllis 
of Hawaii Loves to Cook: Recipes for Life (Amaryllisofhawaii). You can find Marilyn at 
www.amaryllisofhawaii.com.
Shrimp is IBS-friendly, the eggs are fiber free, and the fat in the yolk is balanced by the 
healing properties of coconut, so this recipe, which is featured in the color section, 
shouldn’t give your stomach any trouble. To make it even more of an IBS delight, make 
your own panko flakes from sourdough white bread. You can also add extra coconut 
flakes for IBS-D.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 8 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
2 pounds large or jumbo shrimp, tail on and 
deveined
1⁄2 cup rough or fine panko flakes (see the 
following recipe or use store-bought)
One 4-ounce bag sweetened coconut flakes
4 eggs, lightly beaten
1 cup coconut oil
 1 Butterfly the shrimp and set aside in a bowl. Combine the panko flakes and coconut 
flakes in a bowl and put the eggs in a separate bowl.
 2 Dip the shrimp into the egg and then panko/coconut mixture and place on a platter. 
When all the shrimp are dressed and ready to go, heat the coconut oil in a skillet over 
medium-high heat.

Panko
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 20 minutes to 1 hour
Yield: 3 cups
1 loaf of day-old French or sourdough white 
bread
 1 Preheat the oven to 150 degrees. Remove the bread crusts and rub or flake the bread 
into crumbs by rubbing it between your hands or using a cheese grater; you should get 
about 3 cups of crumbs.
 2 Spread the crumbs onto baking sheets and dry in the oven for about an hour or until 
crunchy but not browned at all — start checking after 20 minutes. Store panko in plastic 
zippered bags in the fridge or glass jars inside or outside the fridge.
Tip: To test whether your oil is hot enough for frying, place one coated shrimp into the hot 
oil to see whether the oil bubbles and sizzles.
Tip: If you’re making your own panko, don’t use a knife or food processor to flake; your 
crumbs will either be too big or completely powdered.

Easy Chicken Curry
A taste for curry can become addictive, but horror stories of gut-burning curry flood IBS 
forums. Thanks to our healing chef Colleen Robinson at www.crimsondoorhealing.
com, we may have a solution to your curry needs. This recipe contains mostly soluble 
ingredients like onion, raisins, and potatoes that are easier to digest when they’re all 
cooked. Cumin, cinnamon, and cardamom are spices known to help treat IBS, and good 
yogurt is lactose-free and soothing to the gut. The addition of some mild curry is 
enough to give you the taste but not the torture. Enjoy!
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 25 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1⁄2 tablespoon olive oil
1 to 11⁄2 pounds white-meat chicken breast, cut 
into chunks
1 medium onion (optional)
1⁄4 cup golden raisins (optional)
1 cup cooked potatoes, chopped into about 
1-inch squares
1⁄2 teaspoon each cumin, cinnamon, and 
cardamom
1 teaspoon mild yellow curry powder
1 cup plain yogurt (see Chapter 6 for IBS 
yogurt recipes)
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
1⁄4 teaspoon pepper
 1 Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. When the pot is hot, add the 
chicken and quick-fry on both sides (less than one minute on each side — you don’t 
need to worry about cooking it through yet). Set the chicken aside.
 2 Add the onions, raisins (if desired), and potatoes to the pot and cook for about 5 min-
utes, stirring occasionally. Lower the heat to medium and add the cumin, cinnamon, 
cardamom, and curry powder. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about a minute to wake 
up the flavors in the spices.
 3 Add the quick-fried chicken and cook until cooked through (about 10 to 15 minutes 
depending on the chunk size — to check, cut a piece in half; if it’s not pink, you’re safe). 
Add the yogurt and lower heat to medium-low. Cook, stirring continuously, until thick — 
about 5 minutes. Serve over rice or miracle noodles.
Vary It! To turn this into a shrimp curry, thaw and chunk 1 to 11⁄2 pounds of frozen shrimp. 
Follow the chicken recipe (minus the chicken, of course), but use 2 teaspoons of curry 
powder in Step 2 and allow that mixture to simmer for 5 minutes before adding the shrimp 
and cooking over medium heat until the shrimp are warm. Add the yogurt and finish the 
recipe as you would for chicken.

183
 Chapter 11: Marvelous Main Dishes that Won’t Torment Your Gut
Tip: Be careful not to boil the yogurt — it’ll curdle. It doesn’t affect the taste, but it does 
mess with the texture and appearance.
Tip: Some people say a curry has to have onions, but if you can’t stomach them, an onion-
free curry is a very different but yummy experience. Who says you have to follow the rules?
Tip: The safest way to thaw precooked shrimp is in the fridge, which takes a few hours or 
overnight. A lot of people thaw it in cold water, which is faster but not necessarily the safest 
way. If you decide to thaw in cold water, keep the shrimp in a sealed plastic bag to keep 
bacteria out and to prevent the shrimp from absorbing water and getting soggy. Submerge 
the sealed bag in a bowl of cold water; your shrimp should thaw in an hour or so.

T Zucchini Lasagna
Chef Kendall Conrad (www.eatwellfeelwellthebook.com) finds that this dish is a 
great one to make with kids. You can put all of the ingredients in separate bowls and let 
the children assemble their own servings just how they like ’em.
Zucchini has a good soluble fiber rating for IBS, as do mushrooms and peppers. Don’t 
be daunted by the display of cheeses in this recipe. They’re all low-lactose and safe on 
the SCD.
Tools: Mandoline
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 45 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
2 zucchinis, peeled and trimmed
1 cup farmer’s cheese, crumbled
1 cup Asiago cheese, freshly grated
1 cup Monterey Jack cheese, freshly grated
1 cup Parmesan cheese, freshly grated
1 cup Classic Tomato Sauce (see the following 
recipe)
1⁄4 cup of olive oil
 1 Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Using a mandoline, slice the zucchinis lengthwise into 
long, thin slices and set aside. Put each cheese and the tomato sauce into its own bowl.
 2 Spread 1⁄2 cup of the tomato sauce in a casserole pan. Layer in some zucchini and drizzle 
olive oil on top. Sprinkle the cheeses on top of the zucchini (in any order you want) and 
repeat the process, creating several layers until all the ingredients are used, ending 
with the Parmesan. Top with the remaining tomato sauce.
 3 Bake for 40 to 45 minutes or until bubbling on top. Let stand for 15 minutes to set the 
melted cheese and then slice and serve.
Vary It! This lasagna is pretty cheesy. If you want to break some of that cheesiness up, you 
can also add sautéed mushrooms, sliced olives, sautéed ground beef or chicken, prosciutto, 
capers, and/or bell peppers (although adding meat makes the recipe non-vegetarian).

Classic Tomato Sauce
This great classic tomato sauce is meant for Kendall’s Zucchini Lasagna, but it can also 
be your base for pizzas, mock pastas, and casseroles. Removing the skins from the 
tomatoes (see the sidebar in Chapter 9), the recipe is very IBS-friendly. You can store it 
in a big jar in the refrigerator for 1 week or in plastic bags in the freezer for 3 months.
Tools: Hand blender (optional)
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 1 hour, 15 minutes
Yield: Twelve 1⁄2-cup servings (6 cups total)
4 tablespoons olive oil
1⁄2 cup chopped onion
6 cloves chopped garlic
1 carrot, chopped
1⁄8 teaspoon each sea salt and freshly cracked 
pepper
Two 28-ounce cans or cartons Italian 
no-sugar-added whole tomatoes
1 bay leaf
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 big handful (about 1 cup) fresh basil
 1 In a large saucepan, heat the oil over medium-high heat; add the onions and cook until 
they’re translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for one minute. Add the 
carrot, salt, and pepper and cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent 
burning.
 2 Add the tomatoes and bay leaf and simmer for 1 hour uncovered. Remove the bay leaf 
and add the butter. Puree in a food processor in batches (to avoid a saucy explosion), 
adding basil into each batch. Or use a hand (immersion) blender if you have one handy 
(no pun intended).

T Eggplant Lasagna
Michelle Gay (www.eatingjourney.wordpress.com) in Western Australia shares 
this hearty yet meatless lasagna recipe It does contain more insoluble fiber than soluble 
fiber, so it’s probably more suitable for IBS-C than IBS-D. However, you can make the 
eggplant friendlier by peeling off the skin. The more thinly you slice the pumpkin, the 
better you can digest it. The marinara sauce uses skinless tomatoes, which makes it 
work for anyone with IBS; it’s also SCD-friendly. (The sauce is great in many other 
dishes as well; you can even use it as a ketchup substitute.)
Roasting time: 15 minutes
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 25 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1 large eggplant
1⁄4 of a medium pumpkin
1⁄8 teaspoon each salt and pepper
2 cups Marinara Sauce (see the following 
recipe)
7 ounces SCD-safe cheddar cheese
 1 Slice the eggplant into about 1⁄4-inch round pieces and thinly slice the pumpkin.
 2 Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.
 3 Place the pumpkin on tinfoil on a flat baking sheet and roast it for 15 minutes. While it’s 
roasting, season the eggplant with salt and pepper and add it to the baking sheet after 
the pumpkin has roasted for about 5 minutes, so that the eggplant roasts for about 10 
minutes and finishes at about the same time as the pumpkin. You can also roast them 
on separate sheets. Cool them down on a rack when they’re done.
 4 After the eggplant and pumpkin are cool, oil a baking dish and assemble the lasagna 
in the following order: sauce, eggplant, pumpkin, and cheese. Repeat the layering, 
making sure you end up with cheese on top. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until the 
cheese is melted.
Vary It! You can use SCD-safe Colby, Swiss, or havarti cheese in place of the cheddar 
cheese.

Marinara Sauce
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 3 hours
Yield: Eight 1⁄2-cup servings (4 cups total)
2 teaspoons olive oil
1 small onion, diced
4 cloves garlic, pressed
4 to 6 mushrooms, chopped
1 small red pepper, diced
1⁄3 to 1⁄2 of a chili pepper, diced
1⁄3 to 1⁄2 of a zucchini, diced
2 to 3 fresh tomatoes, diced
Two 15-ounce cans skinless stewed tomatoes, 
juice included
2 tablespoons tomato paste
 1 Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan. Add the onion and garlic and sauté for 5 minutes. 
You can add a tablespoon or two of water rather than more oil during this process to 
prevent sticking.
 2 Add the mushrooms and red pepper and sauté for another 5 minutes.
 3 Add the chili, zucchini, fresh tomatoes, stewed tomatoes, and tomato paste; cover and 
simmer on very low heat for 2 to 3 hours.
Tip: Keep this sauce on hand to add to all kinds of dishes. Try it on turkey meatloaf (see 
the Meatloaf (Turkey-Style) recipe earlier in this chapter), pasta, rice, lentils, or beans.
Tip: Skin your own tomatoes by using the blanching technique in Chapter 9.

T Shannon’s Gourmet Zucchini 
 
Angel-Hair “Pasta”
Thanks to Shannon Leone from www.rawmom.com for this offering. It does contain a lot 
of raw vegetable ingredients and a fair amount of insoluble fiber, so it’s best for those 
who know they can tolerate raw veggies well. To minimize the effects of the insoluble 
fiber, eat this meal with a soluble-fiber side of miracle noodles or sourdough white 
bread (see the recipe in Chapter 12). To minimize the fat (a common IBS trigger) in 
olives, use olives packed in water rather than oil. And, as always, chew well!
To make this dish, we recommend using a spiralizer or mandoline slicer. A spiralizer 
(also known as The Garnishing Machine or saladacco) may be new to you, but it’s a 
great way to slice up zucchini pasta or any other vegetable. The thin slicing makes 
digestion easier. But if you don’t have a spiralizer or mandoline, just grate the zucchini, 
or even peel it with a peeler for a flat fettuccine-type “noodle.”
Tools: Spiralizer or mandoline (optional)
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: 4 servings
1 large or 2 medium green or yellow zucchinis
12 black olives, pitted
1 cup tiny broccoli florets
4 sun-dried tomatoes, sliced
1 to 2 fresh tomatoes, finely diced
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
1 clove of garlic, minced
3 oyster mushrooms, sliced
1⁄4 teaspoon each sea salt and cracked pepper, 
or to taste
1⁄8 teaspoon oregano, or to taste
 1 Cut the zucchini into thin strips with a spiralizer, mandoline, grater, or vegetable peeler 
and set aside on a large serving platter.
 2 Toss the olives, broccoli, and both kinds of tomatoes with the vinegar and garlic in a 
bowl. Add the olive mixture to the mushrooms, salt, pepper, and oregano.
 3 Top the zucchini “pasta” with the olive-mushroom mixture and serve.
Tip: If this recipe isn’t saucy enough for you, add our Marinara Sauce (see the recipe ear-
lier in this chapter).

T Creamy Vegan Stroganoff 
 
with Caramelized Onions
This stroganoff by chef Andrea Boje (www.myfoodmyhealth.com/OurChefs/index.
php?chefid=23) is dairy- and gluten-free (unlike its Russian ancestor). The combina-
tion of miso and lemon juice in the “sour cream” really makes it taste like the dairy ver-
sion. The brown rice fettuccine, the onions, and the tofu in the sour cream make this 
dish a high soluble-fiber recipe good for anyone with IBS.
Andrea recommends using Tinkyada brand Brown Rice Fettuccini (and Christine 
agrees). Reduce the package-direction cooking time to 8 minutes to keep the noodles al 
dente. The noodles will absorb some liquid from the sauce, so you want to have them a 
little underdone at the beginning.
Tools: Garlic press (optional)
Preparation time: 7 minutes
Cooking time: 24 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 large yellow onion, sliced from root to tip in 
long slices
1⁄2 cup white wine
7 ounces brown rice fettuccine, cooked and 
drained
1 cup tofu “Sour Cream” (see the following 
recipe)
2 cups tempeh, cubed
Salt and pepper to taste (optional)
1⁄2 cup olive oil-fried gluten-free breadcrumbs
 1 Heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add onions and sauté until slightly 
brown, about 15 minutes. Add wine and continue cooking until liquid reduces a little.
 2 Reduce the heat to the lowest setting and add the cooked fettuccine to the wine mix-
ture. Toss to coat the noodles.
 3 Pour 1 cup of tofu “sour cream” into the pan and stir. Add the tempeh and continue to 
warm over low heat, seasoning with salt and pepper to taste (if desired).
 4 Pour the noodles into a serving dish and garnish with fried gluten-free bread crumbs.
“Sour Cream”
One 12-ounce package silken tofu
2 teaspoons umeboshi vinegar
2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon white miso
1 teaspoon salt
1⁄2 teaspoon freshly cracked pepper
2 medium garlic cloves, minced or crushed in 
garlic press
1 tablespoon lemon juice
2 tablespoons olive oil (optional)

191
 Chapter 11: Marvelous Main Dishes that Won’t Torment Your Gut
 1 Blend tofu, vinegar, miso, salt, pepper, garlic, and lemon juice in a blender on high until 
smooth. If the mixture is too thick, begin adding the olive oil a little at a time until the 
cream moves freely.
 2 Adjust seasonings to taste.
Vary It! For a non-vegan alternative, substitute 2 cups of chopped cooked chicken for the 
tempeh. The chicken is low-fat and has no fiber, so it works well for IBS. Add it to the dish 
at the same time you would the tempeh.
Tip: Use homemade panko flakes (see the recipe in Coconut Panko Shrimp earlier in this chap-
ter) in place of the breadcrumbs; they don’t need to be fried, which makes them more IBS-friendly. 
And you can use gluten-free bread for the panko if you want to keep the recipe gluten-free.
Tip: The sour cream lasts in the refrigerator for about a week and a half. The finished stro-
ganoff will be good for 2 to 3 days; after that, the noodles continue to get mushy as they sit 
in the sauce. If you know ahead of time that you’re going to save some of the dish for later, 
keep the sour cream out of that part of the dish until you’re ready to reheat. Reheat in a 
small frying pan with a little oil or butter over low heat for 5 minutes, stirring once.

You put the knife in the coconut . . .
Living in Maui, Carolyn sees coconuts being dis-
membered every week at the local farmer’s market. 
Fearless souls hold ripe coconuts in their hands 
and machete off the outer green rind, somehow 
managing to leave their hands intact. Then they 
slice across the top and make a hole for a straw 
so you can drink the liquid. After that’s gone (and it 
takes a while because one coconut holds a lot of 
juice), another deft swipe with the knife splits the 
nut in half for you to scoop out a thin, jelly-like layer 
of pure white pulp. Left to dry, a denuded (with it’s 
green rind removed) coconut becomes the brown, 
shriveled-up, dried coconut on the mainland.
If your machete is in the shop, never fear. Here’s 
how contributing chef Angela Elliot opens about 
eight coconuts a day with common tools:
 1. Pick your nut, one without any soft spots, 
wet spots, or signs of spoilage.
 2. Hold the coconut on its side, with the coni-
cal top toward your knife hand.
 3. Using a large chef’s knife, trim away the 
cone to reveal the rounded shell under-
neath. This inner shell is the part you get 
when you buy a mature coconut that’s all 
dried up.
 4. Set the coconut on its bottom; using the 
heel of your knife or, even more safely, 
a hammer, strike the place where the 
inner shell meets the thick outer rind at a 
45-degree angle. If you hit it hard enough, 
the shell should crack so that you can flip it 
back like a lid.
 5. Pour out the liquid (it should be clear or 
just very slightly yellowish) and scoop out 
the flesh.

T Vegetarian Dreamy Coconut Curry
Thanks to Angela Elliott (www.she-zencuisine.com) for this sensational, exotic 
concoction. Look for young coconuts at Asian grocery stores; you can also substitute 
four 14-ounce cans of coconut milk and 1 cup of shredded coconut. Coconut is thought 
to be very healing for the gut, and onions and carrots are high in soluble fiber. If you 
want to make the recipe even more IBS-friendly, you can substitute white basmati rice 
for the wild rice and use only 1 tablespoon of mild curry powder.
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Cooking time: 45 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
4 Thai young coconuts, water (6 2⁄3 cups liquid 
total) and meat
2 cloves of garlic
2 tablespoons Thai basil
Juice of 1⁄2 a lemon (about 1⁄8 cup)
1⁄2 cup cilantro
3 green onions
1⁄4 teaspoon Celtic salt, or to taste
2 tablespoons yellow curry powder
1 hot green chili pepper
1 fresh lemongrass stick
3⁄4 cup julienned carrot
3⁄4 cup julienned Asian cabbage
1⁄2 cup soaked and drained wild rice
 1 In a blender, blend everything except the lemongrass stick, julienned vegetables, and 
rice. Transfer the blended curry to a double boiler, add the lemongrass stick, and gently 
warm. Cover and cook for 30 minutes.
 2 Remove the lemongrass stick and check the consistency of the curry. Add water or 
coconut juice as necessary to thin it out. Add the julienned veggies and rice; the curry 
should still be warm and ready to serve.
Tip: A double boiler (a pot of boiling water with a bowl or another pot on top) helps you 
control the heat in the top pot, but it isn’t necessary here. If you don’t want to mess with a 
double boiler, just use a regular pot over low heat.

Gourmet Pizza
You may have thought you had to give up pizza forever because of your IBS, but thanks to 
Jodi Bager and Jenny Lass at www.grainfreegourmet.com, pizza is back on the menu. 
This delectable recipe features an almond-flour pizza crust that appeared in their book, 
Grain-Free Gourmet: Delicious Recipes for Healthy Living (Whitecap Books). It’s an SCD recipe, 

193
 Chapter 11: Marvelous Main Dishes that Won’t Torment Your Gut
so it’s safe for IBS (as well as colitis and Crohn’s disease). The almond flour is much easier to 
digest and less irritating to the intestines in its pulverized form; the cheese is virtually lac-
tose-free; and you can buy skinless tomato sauce or make your own blanched tomatoes (see 
Chapter 9) and marinara sauce (from the Marinara Sauce recipe earlier in this chapter).
This pizza takes minutes to throw together and tastes gourmet! You can eat it straight 
out of the oven, at room temperature on the go, or cold the next day. Toss your left-
overs in your lunch bag — the whole office will be envious.
Tools: Parchment paper
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: 1 serving
1⁄2 cup almond flour
1 tablespoon plus 1 cup grated Parmesan 
cheese
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
1⁄2 teaspoon dried basil
1⁄2 teaspoon dried oregano
1⁄4 teaspoon dried thyme (optional)
1 teaspoon olive oil, plus more for greasing the 
baking sheet and drizzling
1 large egg
1⁄4 cup tomato sauce, or to taste depending on 
your level of tomato sensitivity
1⁄4 to 1⁄2 cup each of mushrooms, red peppers, 
zucchini, and onions
 1 Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper and grease 
with olive oil.
 2 Combine the almond flour, 1 tablespoon of the Parmesan, and the salt, basil, oregano, 
thyme (if desired), olive oil, and egg in a mixing bowl until the dough is the consistency 
of cookie batter.
 3 Spread the dough thinly into a 6-to-8-inch circle on the cookie sheet. Top with tomato paste 
or sauce, spread on your pizza toppings, and sprinkle generously with parmesan cheese.
 4 Drizzle olive oil over the pizza and bake for 18 to 20 minutes.
Vary It! To get a thin-crust pizza, make the dough and flatten it with a rolling pin between 
two pieces of parchment paper or plastic wrap until it’s the appropriate diameter.
Vary It! The toppings here are just suggestions; use any IBS-friendly pizza toppings of your 
choice.
Tip: Freeze the pizza dough for almost instant pizza. Flatten your prepared dough with a 
rolling pin between parchment paper or plastic wrap and then freeze the flattened dough, 
still between the parchment paper or plastic wrap, in a plastic freezer bag or sealed con-
tainer to prevent freezer burn. No need to thaw before baking — just add the sauce and 
toppings, and bake at 325 degrees for 20 minutes.

Pesto without the Pain
Thanks to Colleen Robinson (www.crismondoorhealing.com) for this creamy pesto 
that doesn’t irritate an IBS gut. You can use it on pasta, rice, or slathered on your nut 
pâté wraps. Basil and parsley are high in antioxidants and vitamins, and basil and garlic 
are anti-microbial herbs, which can be helpful in reducing yeast or bacterial overgrowth 
in the intestines that may be a trigger for IBS symptoms. To make up for the insoluble 
fiber in garlic, basil, parsley, and almonds, pair your pesto with a high soluble-fiber 
pasta or rice.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: Sixteen 2-tablespoon servings (2 cups total)
2 cloves of garlic
1⁄2 cup almonds
1 cup fresh basil leaves, lightly packed
1 cup fresh parsley, lightly packed
1⁄3 cup lemon juice
1⁄4 cup olive oil
1⁄3 cup chicken broth
 1 In a food processor or blender, mix the garlic and almonds until they form a chunky 
paste. Add the basil and parsley and blend again. Add the lemon juice and blend again.
 2 Drizzle in the olive oil slowly until you have a nice puree. Add the chicken broth and 
blend until it’s well incorporated.
Tip: If you don’t serve the whole batch at once freeze it in ice cube trays and thaw out a 
few cubes at a time for a fast topping over your next meal.
Tip: You can use any nut for a nutty flavor, including macadamia or walnuts.

Siding with Side Dishes
In This Chapter
▶ Reaping the benefits of grain and rice sides
▶ Mixing it up with veggie sides
▶ Making your own sourdough bread
▶ Tossing out the taters for potato alternatives
O
ne definition of a side dish is a dish served 
with, but subordinate to, a main course. 
We don’t think our sides are subordinate to any-
thing, so we prefer to think of them as dishes that 
accompany, complete, or accentuate the entrée or 
main course at a meal.
Our side dishes can give you lots of variety with 
your meals, especially if you feel like you have lim-
ited choice in your main dishes. We’ve made them 
IBS-friendly by choosing gluten-free, dairy-free, 
and soluble-fiber ingredients to create them.
Sizing Up Soluble Fiber in Sides
Sides that are loaded with soluble fiber help balance the insoluble fiber in 
your diet. Because sides are often heavy on grains and vegetables, you can 
easily choose options that are at least 50 percent soluble fiber (which should 
be your goal).
So with a wealth of soluble fiber ingredients to choose from for your side 
dishes, where do you start? We know the old standby is homemade white 
sourdough bread (and we provide a recipe for that later in this chapter), but 
we want you to have many other delicious and more nutritious options avail-
able as well. The grains with the highest amount of soluble fiber are quinoa, 
rice, and barley. Great vegetables options include carrots, mushrooms, sweet 
potatoes, turnips, and yams. If you prefer a fruit side, try pumpkin or papaya

plethora of common foods.
Getting Familiar with Grains
 
If you’re experimenting with the Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD), you’re 
avoiding all grains and can skip this section.
Grains are the fruits or seeds of various plants, including cereal grasses. 
Although many foods that people think are grains are actually pseudograins 
or grain-like products, we include them here anyway. This section introduces 
you to several grains and gives you information on their basic preparations.
Contrary to what many may believe, wheat isn’t the only grain on the planet. 
It’s certainly a staple, at least in the Western world, where many people 
eat it three times a day, but that may be why it’s become a problem for so 
many. Undigested wheat molecules can be absorbed through a leaky gut (see 
Chapter 18) into the blood and can set up a reaction in the body, creating a 
wheat sensitivity.
Even if you aren’t avoiding wheat or gluten (contained in wheat, rye, and barley 
and sometimes contaminating oats) because of sensitivity, get ready to meet 
your new best friends: quinoa, amaranth, millet, kamut, spelt, and rice. With 
six choices of grains, you don’t have to eat the same grain every day and run 
the risk of developing a sensitivity to it like many have done with wheat. The 
following list introduces you to quinoa, amaranth, millet, kamut, and spelt; the 
section “Reveling in Rice” later in this chapter gives you the lowdown on rice.
 
✓ Quinoa: Originally from the Andes in South America, quinoa (pro-
nounced keen-wah) is an ancient, gluten-free substance. We have to say 
“substance” because it’s actually a pseudocereal — a grainlike plant with 
edible seeds. Quinoa has only recently entered mainstream food produc-
tion, so fewer people seem to be sensitive to it. Believe it or not, its clos-
est relatives are beets, spinach, and tumbleweed! Quinoa has a naturally 
bitter coating that you rinse off before cooking; this step is especially 
important for those with IBS-D, because the bitter substance is some-
what laxative.
 
 Cooked quinoa has a fluffy, light consistency and a mild, slightly nutty 
flavor with a protein content registering around 16 percent. In compari-
son, rice has a protein content of about 7 percent. We also love the fact 
that quinoa is a good source of magnesium and iron.
 
 You can use quinoa flour along with sorghum flour, tapioca starch, and 
potato starch to make a gluten-free baking mix. The ratio is three parts 
of the quinoa flour and sorghum flour, two parts of the potato starch, 
and one part of the tapioca starch.

197
 Chapter 12: Siding with Side Dishes
 
✓ Amaranth: Amaranth (known in its weed form as pigweed) is a beautiful 
plant with pretty pink blossoms. It has many purposes, but several vari-
eties are grown in Asia and North and South America as a pseudocereal. 
Amaranth is a balanced protein like quinoa with a similar high protein 
content of 15 to 18 percent. One interesting nutrition fact is that amaranth 
contains twice as much calcium as milk. It’s also a source of Vitamin E.
 
 When cooked, amaranth has a tacky texture, which turns gummy if you 
overcook it. The flavor of amaranth flavor is sweet, nutty, and almost 
malt-like.
 
✓ Millet: After rice, millet is the second most widely used non-gluten grain 
(and it’s a grain, not a pseudocereal or a grainlike plant). Its seeds are 
larger than quinoa’s but smaller than rice’s; it’s easily digestible and one 
of the least-allergenic grains. It’s said to be the first cereal grain used for 
human food and animal fodder, and it’s grown around the world. The 
protein content is close to wheat at 11 percent. Cooked millet has a mild 
flavor and a heavier texture than amaranth, but it’s still fluffy like rice.
 
✓ Buckwheat: Buckwheat is a pseudocereal with a triangular grain. It origi-
nated in Eastern Asia, and you may recognize it as the ingredient used 
to make Japanese soba noodles. Buckwheat is gluten-free, so it’s great 
as a cereal, as a side dish, or in flour mixes (for things like waffles and 
pancakes) for those who can’t tolerate gluten. It has a richer nutty flavor 
than other grains. Toasted buckwheat, called kasha, has an even stron-
ger nutty taste. It’s high in soluble fiber, much like oatmeal. Buckwheat 
has a higher fat content than most other grains, so store it in jars in the 
fridge to prevent it from spoiling.
 
 Buckwheat helps keep blood sugar under control and has significant 
amounts of a flavonoid (part of the vitamin C family) called rutin, which 
can help lower cholesterol. The protein in buckwheat is only 11 percent, 
but it contains all the essential amino acids.
 
✓ Kamut: Kamut is a grain related to wheat, although it’s twice the size, 
and also contains gluten. If you want a wheat substitute but aren’t wor-
ried about the gluten, kamut may be just what you’re looking for. The 
story goes that this grain was found, quite literally, in the Egyptian 
pyramids. It has the same protein content as wheat, around 11 percent. 
Cooked kamut’s texture is chewy, and it has a nutty taste.
 
✓ Spelt: Spelt is another relative of wheat; it’s a grain identified from the 
Bronze Age in Europe. It does contain gluten, though much less than 
wheat, so you want to pass on this one if you’re gluten-intolerant. Spelt 
is more common in Europe but has made its way into American kitchens 
through health food stores. Its protein content is high at 17 percent. 
It can be used in a combination of grains but isn’t usually eaten as a 
cooked cereal. Spelt bread is slightly sweet and has a nutty flavor.
Buy all these grains in bulk at your local health food store and store them in 
sealed glass containers on your shelf or kitchen counter (except buckwheat, 
as noted in the earlier bullet). Be sure to soak quinoa and spelt in water for 

198
Part II: Eating For Your Intestinal Health 
four hours and overnight (respectively) and then drain and rinse before using. 
All the other grains need washing and rinsing as well. This step is especially 
important for quinoa (because of its coating; see the earlier bullet) and for 
millet, kamut, and spelt, which may have small stones and debris from storage.
Cook these grain products according to package directions; however, you 
can substitute vegetable, beef, or chicken broth for the cooking water. 
(Check out Chapter 9 for broth recipes.) You can also use half water and half 
apple juice for sweeter tasting buckwheat and amaranth. Adding fresh herbs 
or ginger powder to the cooking pot is another way to pump up the flavor.
 
T Quinoa Vegetable Pilaf
Thanks to Andrea Boje (www.myfoodmyhealth.com/OurChefs/index.
php?chefid=23) for taking quinoa to the next level with this tasty side dish. If you 
have leftover quinoa, you can use that instead of making it from scratch; just double 
the amount and cut the stock/water from the recipe. Quinoa is high in soluble fiber, so 
it’s IBS-friendly. This pilaf goes well with baked or grilled chicken, but it’s so versatile, 
you can use it as a main dish by adding cooked cannellini beans and diced tomatoes. 
This dish keeps in the fridge for a week and is still tasty after being frozen.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 35 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1 cup uncooked quinoa
2 cups vegetable stock or water
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 medium onion, finely diced
2 medium carrots, finely diced
5 to 6 button or cremini mushrooms, sliced 
(optional)
1⁄4 teaspoon each salt and pepper
2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil (optional)
1 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds
 1 Cook quinoa according to the package directions, using stock or water, and set aside.
 2 Heat the olive oil in medium frying pan over medium-high heat and sauté the onion and 
carrots. When the carrots have started to soften, add the mushrooms (if desired) and 
continue to sauté until the mushrooms are cooked.
 3 Add the quinoa to the frying pan and stir until the vegetables are mixed in. Season to 
taste with salt and pepper and transfer to serving dish. Drizzle a little toasted sesame 
oil over the quinoa if desired. Top with toasted sesame seeds and serve.
Tip: For a nuttier flavor, toast the quinoa before cooking it. Put the dry quinoa in the sauce-
pan over low heat, stirring frequently until you can smell a nutty aroma from the pan. Add 
stock or water and cook.

199
 Chapter 12: Siding with Side Dishes
Tip: Add fresh thyme to the water when cooking quinoa. You can place one or two sprigs 
directly into the water with the quinoa, and the small thyme leaves fall off the twigs as they 
cook. Remove twigs before serving.
Tip: Use half white quinoa and half red to make a more colorful dish. They have the same 
cooking time, so you can throw them in the pot together.

T Rainbow Vegetarian Quinoa
Here’s Shannon Leone’s simple quinoa vegetable blend; you can find Shannon at 
www.rawmom.com. This dish only has a few ingredients, so it’s less likely to set off your 
stomach, and the quinoa is a great soluble-fiber food. Liquid aminos are a low-sodium, 
non-fermented soybean substitute for salty, fermented soy sauce.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 15 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
2 cups uncooked quinoa, rinsed
4 cups water
2 cups mix of chopped carrots, peas, and corn
Dash of olive oil
Dash of Braggs Liquid Aminos, or Nama 
Shoyu, or miso, or pinch of salt
 1 Place the quinoa in pot with the water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover 
the pot, and simmer for 15 minutes until the quinoa is fluffy.
 2 Add the vegetables to the pot, turn off the heat, and let stand for 5 minutes until the 
vegetables are warm.
 3 Lightly garnish with olive oil and Braggs Liquid Aminos, Nama Shoyu, miso, or salt.

Reveling in Rice
Rice is a grain, but it’s so popular that we’ve devoted a separate section to 
it. In fact, rice is eaten more than wheat on a global level. Rice comes in two 
main varieties: brown and white.
Brown rice is rice with its brown outer coating of bran and germ still intact. 
It’s a staple for many people with IBS and colitis because it’s hypoallergenic 
and high in soluble fiber, so it’s a great grain to have on hand as a safe side 
or to balance a main meal with high amounts of insoluble fiber. Most view 
white rice as an important soluble-fiber food for IBS, but brown rice actually 
has more soluble fiber than white does (although it also has more insoluble 
fiber). Check out Appendix C for the actual numbers.
White rice is brown rice with the bran and germ removed. It gets a bad rap 
because it has been stripped of its goodness, but some people with IBS find it 
to be a mildly comforting food because it has no traces of rice bran to cause 
irritation. But we caution you against getting too friendly with white rice; like 
white bread, it has very few nutrients, and if you can tolerate brown rice, 
that’s the more nutritious option.
Cook whatever rice you choose according to the package directions; for extra 
flavor, you can substitute chicken or vegetable stock for the water during cook-
ing. You can cook and freeze rice in plastic containers for quick use or to throw in 
your survival kit (discussed in Chapter 14). If you want a more adventurous side, 
the following recipes give you a few interesting alternatives to straight-up rice.
 
If you love rice, try aromatic varieties like basmati or jasmine. They both have 
distinctive, nutty flavors and pleasing aromas that occur naturally in the rice. 
Basmati and jasmine can both be either brown or white.
 
T Oven-Baked UnFried Rice
Thanks to Colleen Robinson (www.crimsondoorhealing.com) for modifying this old 
favorite to feed our IBS-friendly needs by avoiding the frying pan. It calls for chestnuts, 
which unlike many nuts are high in soluble fiber. Rice is also high in soluble fiber, and 
cooking makes the vegetables easier to digest. This recipe is suitable for IBS-C and IBS-D.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 1 hour
Yield: 5 servings
2 cups long grain rice, uncooked
1 small onion, chopped into small pieces
1 cup chicken broth
1⁄4 cup olive oil
1⁄4 cup tamari, or low-sodium soy sauce
1⁄3 cup fresh parsley, chopped

 1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
 2 Spray a small frying pan with cooking spray and quickly cook the egg white, breaking it 
into bits as it cooks for 1 or 2 minutes to get the look of authentic fried rice (if desired).
 3 Mix all the ingredients (including the egg, if desired) into a casserole dish. Cover with 
tinfoil and bake for an hour.
Vary It! Chop leftover chicken or any other meat your stomach can handle into small pieces and 
add it to the casserole before baking. (Of course, this addition makes the recipe non-vegetarian.)

T Shannon’s Quick “Rice”
This raw, vegetable-based rice alternative comes from the kitchen of Shannon Leone 
(www.rawmom.com). The key is to blend the ingredients until you get a rice-like texture. 
The blending chops through the fiber and makes your meal much easier to digest and 
suitable for IBS-C, which benefits from both soluble and insoluble fiber.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1 cup parsnips, scrubbed, peeled, and chopped
1 cup chopped cauliflower
1 cup pine nuts
1 clove of garlic
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon Nama Shoyu (organic soy sauce)
1 to 2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon agave, or 2 dates, pitted (optional)
 1 Blend all the ingredients into a food processor and process until the mixture becomes 
somewhat rice-like in texture.
Tip: You can substitute the Nama Shoyu with 1 tablespoon miso, 1 teaspoon Braggs Liquid 
Aminos (a low-sodium soy sauce alternative), 1⁄2 teaspoon powdered kelp, 1 teaspoon pow-
dered dulse (a seaweed; both it and kelp taste salty but are low sodium and high in miner-
als), or 1⁄2 teaspoon Celtic sea salt.

T Brown Rice Powder Stuffing
Thanks to Julie Beyer for this stuffing; she created it as a remedy for her own intestinal 
sensitivities, so you can rest assured that it’s probably safer for your sensitive gut than 
the usual bread stuffing. Flaxseed is high in soluble fiber, and chopping and sautéing 
or steaming the vegetables makes them easier to digest. The addition of brown rice 
powder in this recipe gives you all benefits of brown rice but helps its digestibility by 
breaking down the fiber. Consider this brown rice stuffing as a gluten-free soluble side 
to go along with any of the entrees in Chapter 11.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: 6 servings
1⁄2 cup ground flaxseeds
1⁄2 cup brown rice protein powder
1 teaspoon sea salt
1⁄2 cup flaxseed oil
5 tablespoons water
2 to 3 tablespoons olive or coconut oil
1 medium onion, chopped
2 to 3 cloves garlic
1⁄2 cup pecans or walnuts, soaked (optional; 
see the Soaking Nuts and Seeds recipe in 
Chapter 8)
3 celery stalks, diced
3 apples, peeled, cored and diced
4 Swiss chard leaves, chopped
1 to 2 teaspoons nutmeg
3 to 4 teaspoons Italian herb mixture
2 to 3 teaspoons maple syrup
2 teaspoons freshly squeezed lemon juice, or 
to taste
1⁄4 teaspoon each celery salt and pepper, or 
to taste
Fresh oregano and mint to garnish (optional)
 1 Mix the ground flaxseeds, brown rice protein powder, and sea salt in a large bowl. Mix 
in the flaxseed oil and enough water to form a dry, doughy paste and set aside.
 2 In a large skillet, heat 2 to 3 tablespoons of olive oil or coconut oil and sauté the onion, 
garlic, nuts (if desired), celery, and apples over medium heat until all the produce is 
almost tender. Add the Swiss chard and continue sautéing until all the produce is tender.
 3 Add the protein powder mixture to the produce mixture and mix in the nutmeg, Italian 
herbs, maple syrup, lemon juice, celery salt, and pepper. Garnish with fresh oregano 
and mint (if desired).

203
 Chapter 12: Siding with Side Dishes
Tip: You can also lightly steam the vegetables instead of sautéing. Make sure to steam 
them separately because they all require different amounts of time in the steamer.
Tip: If nuts are difficult for you to digest, you can presoak them in filtered water with sea 
salt for seven hours. This process neutralizes enzyme inhibitors and makes the nuts easier 
to digest. After thoroughly rinsing them, you can either add them directly to your recipe or 
dry them in the oven at a maximum of 150 degrees or in a dehydrator for 12 to 24 hours.

Vegetables Take Sides
The sound of parents telling their children to eat their vegetables is heard in 
dining rooms around the world. Childhood is the best time to introduce fresh 
vegetables because the tastier they are when you’re a kid, the likelier you are to 
keep coming back for more. The overcooked, tasteless vegetables you had 
when you were may have turned you off from veggies when you were young may 
have turned you off, but try the vibrant, fresh-picked produce at a local farmers’ 
market — it may bring you around on these vitamin- and mineral-rich foods.
 
We know we’re going out on a limb by even talking about too many vegetables 
in conjunction with an IBS diet. However, one of the intricacies of IBS is that 
it can be two opposite conditions — what’s good for IBS-D may be a bomb for 
IBS-C. We do want people with IBS-D to eat more vegetables, but you have to 
take it slow. We heartily encourage those with IBS-C to increase their vegetables 
for the fiber and the nutrients that they may need to help treat their condition.

T Green Beans Almandine
Okay, that’s just a fancy way to say “green beans with almonds.” You can say it however 
you like, but do yourself a favor and make it — it’s a fast and easy side from healing 
chef Colleen Robinson (www.crimsondoorhealing.com). If you can buy green beans 
fresh, please do; they’re way more flavorful than the canned stuff. Buying fresh beans 
by the pound generally serves four people. If you can’t get fresh, go for the Grade-A 
frozen ones (preferably organic) because you get the least-mushy ones that way. 
Speaking of mush, you can make your beans more easily digestible by chewing them to 
mush or overcooking them a tad so they’re more broken down.
If you’re avoiding slivered or sliced nuts, just toast them and grind them to a powder in 
your food processor and dust your beans with that. To make this simple and tasty dish 
even IBS-friendlier, serve it with a simple cooked rice of your choice (flip to “Reveling in 
Rice” earlier in this chapter for more on this lovely grain). Check out a photo of this 
healthy side dish in the color insert.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 10 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1 pound fresh green beans, trimmed
2 to 4 tablespoons sliced or slivered almonds
1 teaspoon butter
1⁄4 teaspoon each salt and pepper, or to taste
 1 Boil a large pot of water over high heat. While you wait for it to boil, toast the almonds 
in a pan over medium heat for 5 to 7 minutes, stirring constantly. Remove the almonds 
from the heat when they’re toasted and set aside.
 2 Cook the green beans in the boiling water for several minutes, until they’re crisp.
 3 Drain the cooked beans and toss them with the almonds, butter, and a bit of salt and 
pepper.
Tip: Snap the pointy ends of the beans off with your fingers; if they have a stringy bit down 
the side, you can peel it off and get less insoluble fiber. You can cut the ends off with a 
knife, but you may not get the stringy bits off.
Tip: You can also toast the almonds in a toaster oven, but make sure you watch them 
carefully — they go from toasted to burnt very quickly.
Tip: Whether you like your almonds sliced or slivered is up to you. Sliced almonds toast 
more quickly, but slivered almonds are more substantial.

T Creamed Spinach
Thanks to our healing chef Colleen Robinson at www.crimsondoorhealing.com for 
showing that taking most of the dairy out of the childhood favorite creamed spinach 
can make it IBS- and taste bud-friendly. Spinach has more soluble fiber in its raw state, 
although it tends to be less digested (possibly because people don’t chew their salads 
enough). Cooked spinach may shrivel considerably from its raw form, but it’s still sub-
stantial, especially in vitamins. In the cooked state, spinach is higher in insoluble fiber 
and therefore more suited to IBS-C, even though it’s high in iron, which can be binding. 
Small amounts of Parmesan are okay on the SCD, so if you’re using the SCD to help con-
trol your IBS, don’t worry about the cheese.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 10 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1 pound fresh spinach, or two 10-ounce boxes 
frozen spinach, drained and chopped
2 cloves of garlic, or 1 large clove of 
elephant garlic
1 teaspoon olive oil
1⁄4 cup plain soy milk
1⁄4 teaspoon each salt and pepper, or to taste
2 teaspoons grated Parmesan cheese to 
garnish
 1 Sauté the garlic over medium-low heat until translucent.
 2 Add the spinach. For frozen spinach, mix it in with the garlic until combined. For fresh 
spinach, stir it into the pan with the garlic with a large spoon until it wilts to a quarter 
of the original size.
 3 Add the soy milk and stir to warm the soy and cover the spinach. Add salt and pepper 
to taste, garnish with the Parmesan, and serve hot.
Vary It! For a creamier creamed spinach, puree 1⁄4 of the raw spinach in a blender on high 
speed and add it to the cooked spinach mixture when you add the soy milk. (If you’re using 
fresh spinach, boil it for 1 minute and rinse with cold water before blending.)
Tip: Wash your spinach even if it comes pre-washed in a sealed bag. You want to rule out 
the possibility of any trace amounts of pesticides getting into your system. Fill a sink or 
large bowl with cool water and add 5 drops of grapefruit seed extract.
Tip: You can substitute 1 clove of elephant garlic for the 2 cloves of regular garlic. Elephant 
garlic is milder and may irritate your stomach less.

T Ginger Carrots
Victoria Amory (www.victoriaamory.com) brings out the flavor of carrot with gin-
ger’s earthy, fiery qualities. In IBS terms, ginger is an anti-inflammatory and anti-nausea 
herb, so it may be beneficial for both IBS-D and IBS-C. The vegetables are simmered for 
about 20 minutes, which makes them even easier to digest. Victoria suggests cutting the 
carrots in matchsticks or rounds for a pretty dish.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 25 minutes
Yield: 7 servings
4 tablespoons olive oil
One 3-inch piece of ginger, peeled and diced
1 clove of garlic, peeled and chopped
2 pounds carrots, cut into matchsticks or 
1⁄4-inch rounds
1 cup Vegetable Stock (see the recipe in 
Chapter 9) or low-sodium canned vegetable 
broth
1 tablespoon butter
1⁄2 cup parsley, chopped
 1 In a large sauté pan, heat the olive oil over high heat. Add the ginger and garlic and 
sauté for a few seconds to release the aroma. Add the carrots and stir to coat.
 2 Add the broth and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cover. Simmer 
until the carrots are tender, about 20 minutes.
 3 Remove the cover, stir in the butter and parsley, and serve hot.

T Marinated Kale
Angela Elliott at www.she-zencuisine.com contributed this wonderfully healthy 
uncooked recipe. We know we’re breaking the mold for an IBS diet by including kale 
that’s not even cooked, so this recipe is for folks who know they can tolerate greens 
well or those with IBS-C who need the extra bulk and fiber. The kale here is marinated, 
which does break down fibers and make them more digestible. To really soften the kale 
up, prepare the dish the day before and let it marinate in the fridge overnight. Then you 
can add a side of rice, barley, or bread to make this a balanced meal especially for IBS-C.

207
 Chapter 12: Siding with Side Dishes
Marinating time: 60 minutes or overnight
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: 6 servings
3 large leaves organic green leaf kale
1⁄4 of a sweet onion
3 tablespoons fresh tarragon
3 tablespoons fresh basil
Juice of 1 lemon (about 1⁄4 cup)
3 tablespoons olive oil
11⁄2 teaspoons salt
1⁄4 teaspoon cayenne, or to taste
1 teaspoon raw agave
1⁄4 teaspoon each garlic powder and chili 
powder, or to taste
 1 Gently pulse or chop the kale in a food processor and then transfer it to a bowl.
 2 Add the rest of the ingredients to the kale. Toss, allow to marinate for 1 hour, and serve.
Tip: Chopped olives make a good addition to garnish this tasty dish.

Most people’s dairy problems have to do with lactose. If you have dairy 
issues, avoid high-lactose cheeses, including cottage cheese, cream cheese, 
feta, mozzarella, ricotta, processed cheeses, and cheese spreads. Very low-
lactose cheeses that you may be able to handle are cheddar, Colby, Swiss, 
havarti, and dry curd cottage cheese.
Bringing on the Bread
We’ve said it before and we’ll say it again: Stay away from white bread as 
much as possible. It just doesn’t give you the nutrients that other IBS-friendly 
foods do. But if you’re going to eat white bread, we want you to have a good 
one, so in this section we give you our recipe for sourdough white bread. We 
recommend it because it is high in soluble fiber but doesn’t contain commer-
cial yeast, which can cause many people with yeast overgrowth to react. (See 
Chapter 18 for more on yeast overgrowth).

T Savoring Sourdough Bread
We’ve spoken about sourdough bread as a great soluble fiber food, so we want to 
make sure you have a great recipe to make your own. Sourdough bread is also called 
yeast-free bread, but the only reason it becomes bread at all is because of the yeast and 
bacteria in the air that settle on the dough! Who knew? The recipe does call for white 
flour, but you can make it a bit healthier by using organic white flour, which is free of 
any genetic modifications and chemical residues used in commercial farming or milling. 
Keep the extra sponge around so you don’t have to make one from scratch the next 
time you want to bake bread.
Tools: Bread machine (optional), wide-mouth jar with a rubber-sealed lid (such as a 
mason jar)
Preparation time: 21⁄2 hours, including rising times
Starter time: 4 to 7 days
Sponge time: 2 to 8 hours
Cooking time: 45 to 50 minutes
Yield: 1 loaf (13 servings/slices)
4 teaspoons sugar
2 teaspoons salt
2 tablespoons olive oil, soft butter, or ghee 
(see the recipe in Chapter 6)
2 cups sponge (fermented starter; see the 
following recipes)
3 cups unbleached all-purpose flour, or more 
as necessary
 1 Add the sugar, salt, and oil to the sponge. Mix well and (using your hands, a bread 
machine, or a food processor) begin to knead in the flour 1⁄2 cup at a time, using as much 
flour as you need to make a good, elastic bread dough.
 2 Put the dough in a bowl (if it’s not already in one), cover it with a towel, and set it in a 
warm place (70 to 80 degrees; 100 degrees is too warm). Let the dough grow to twice its 
original size, until poking with your finger creates a hole that doesn’t spring back (this 
process may take 1 to 2 hours).
 3 Knead the bread again and then make a loaf and place it in a 9-x-5-inch loaf pan lightly 
greased with olive oil or coconut oil. Cover it with a damp towel or paper towel and 
place it in a warm place to rise a second time for 40 minutes to an hour or until doubled 
in bulk.
 4 Place the pan in a cold oven, set the oven temperature to 350 degrees, and bake for 45 
to 50 minutes or until the crust is brown; you can turn the loaf out on a cooling rack to 
check the bottom for doneness, poking the bottom with a toothpick to see whether it 
comes out clean if desired. Cool for about 1 hour before cutting.

 Chapter 12: Siding with Side Dishes
Making the Starter
1 cup organic, unbleached all-purpose flour 
plus up to 31⁄2 cups flour for feeding
1 cup water plus up to 31⁄2 cups warm water 
for feeding
 1 Using your blender or mixer, blend the flour and water. Pour the mixture into a wide-
mouth jar and cover with a washcloth to keep out dust and bugs.
 2 Keep the starter in a 70-to-80-degree environment, which allows airborne and flour-
borne yeast to grow rapidly. Don’t go above 100 degrees; you kill the starter.
 3 Every 24 hours, pour off half the mixture and add 1⁄2 cup warm water and 1⁄2 cup flour 
blended together. On Day 3, start checking for lots of bubbles, the smell of beer, or a 
nice sour smell (these may take 7 days to develop from the time you begin the starter). 
When a bubbly froth develops, your starter has started and is ready for breadmaking.
 4 Punch a hole in the jar lid and put the lid on the jar. Keep the starter in the fridge until 
you’re ready to make bread. Continue to feed the starter with an extra 1⁄2 cup flour/1⁄2 cup 
water mixture once a week; you may have to stir the mix every day or two.
Making the Sponge
1 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
1 cup warm water
1 cup starter (see the preceding recipe)
 1 Pour the starter into a mixing bowl.
 2 Blend the water and the flour and add to the starter; stir well and set in a warm place 
for several hours to ferment until the mixture is bubbly, frothy, and sour smelling; this 
process may take anywhere from 2 to 8 hours or longer.
Tip: Bread dough can rise in a temperature from 80 to 110 degrees. If you can set your 
stove to 95 degrees, you can use your oven and keep a uniform temperature.
Tip: If you’re living in such sterile quarters that your starter doesn’t grow within 2 hours, 
add 1⁄4 packet of commercial yeast to the starter to give it a nudge.
Tip: Wash the empty jar and dry it. You may also want to pour boiling water over it, 
because you don’t want other things growing in there with your pet!
Tip: Make your first sponge attempt in the morning to see how long it takes. If it does take 8 
hours and you want to bake in the morning, set your sponge out to ferment overnight.
Tip: Save your leftover sponge as your starter for next time: Put it back into the jar and feed 
it 1⁄2 cup each of flour and warm water weekly. Keep it in the fridge as before.

Potato Pretenders: Creating 
Potato-esque Side Dishes
Whether baked, mashed, or fried, potatoes in various forms are a traditional side 
dish that many people with IBS have on their safe lists. We offer a kid-friendly 
side recipe (Smashed Potatoes with Rosemary) made with real-deal potatoes in 
Chapter 15, but here give you some interesting takes on potato alternatives.
 
T Fresh Fries with Raw Jicama
These raw treats from Shannon Leone (www.rawmom.com) are shaped like French fries 
and have some seasoning, but they aren’t fried. Jicama is a crispy, sweet, edible root 
that looks and feels like a turnip on the outside. It’s often hidden in the vegetable sec-
tion of grocery stores and passed over by most shoppers. It’s high in soluble fiber, so 
it’s considered a friendly food for IBS, especially IBS-C. Not many vegetables have more 
soluble fiber than insoluble fiber, but jicama is one of them, so it’s a great place to start 
eating raw. The small amounts of chili, garlic, and onion powders are for taste and a bit 
of color on your fries and should not be cause for concern.
Tools: Mandoline (optional)
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: 2 servings
1 medium jicama
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon sea salt
1 teaspoon onion and/or garlic powder
1⁄2 teaspoon chili powder
 1 Peel the jicama and slice it into your favorite French fry shape with a mandoline or by 
hand with a sharp knife.
 2 Mix the olive oil with the salt, onion/garlic powder, and chili powder and toss with the fries.
Vary It! If you want your Fresh Fries coated in gravy but not coated in gluten, try them with 
the Rockin’ Gravy recipe later in the chapter.
Tip: Try your fries with a squeeze of lemon or lime.

T Curried Spice-Baked 
 
Sweet Potatoes
Chef Laura Pole (www.eatingforalifetime.com/) used to suffer with IBS and now 
applies what she learned about diet in her own recovery to her clients who have bowel 
inflammation. This recipe, which is featured in the color insert, is a delicious hit with lots 
of anti-inflammatory ingredients and ingredients that also aid digestion. It’s also high in 
magnesium, which relaxes the smooth muscle in the colon and can help prevent or relieve 
symptoms of IBS-C. Laura recommends using garnet or jewel yams, which are actually 
sweet potatoes even though they’re called yams in the grocery store; see the nearby side-
bar for more on the yam–sweet potato distinction. You can use the alternate curry powder 
mixture shared at the end of the recipe if you want to avoid too much peppery spice.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 70 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
2 medium sweet potatoes, washed and 
pierced in the center with a fork
1 teaspoon of fresh ginger, finely grated
1⁄2 to 1 teaspoon mild curry powder
1⁄2 teaspoon turmeric
Pinch of cinnamon
1⁄8 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1 teaspoon coconut oil or extra virgin olive oil
 1 Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Bake the sweet potatoes in a low-sided roasting pan for 
30 to 45 minutes or until soft and then remove them from the oven and allow them to cool.
 2 Slice the cooled potatoes in half lengthwise and scoop out the center flesh, leaving a 
1⁄4-inch rim of sweet potato attached to the skin to help hold the skin together.
 3 Mix the flesh and the remaining ingredients in a bowl until smooth and creamy. Refill 
the potato skins with the flesh mixture, place them on a baking sheet, and put them 
back in the oven until heated through and slightly golden on top — about 25 minutes. 
Serve hot.
Tip: To quicken the original cooking time, cut the sweet potatoes in half lengthwise and 
place them face down in a roasting pan with about 1⁄2 cup water. Bake for 40 minutes.
Tip: Step 1 on its own produces a simple baked sweet potato great as a side dish to any meat.
Tip: Before putting all the curry into the bowl, check the spiciness of your curry powder. If it 
seems very peppery, reduce the amount to 1⁄4 to 1⁄2 teaspoon. You can also use this alterna-
tive curry mix: 1⁄4 teaspoon turmeric, 1⁄2 teaspoon cumin, 1⁄8 teaspoon each coriander and 
cinnamon, a pinch each of cardamom and cloves, and a pinch of cayenne (optional).

And the Rest Is Gravy
Typical gravy is made by stirring flour into the fatty juice left over from cook-
ing meats. But when you have IBS, you may have to set aside the gravy boat 
because of its floury base. This gravy recipe gives you the chance to add a 
little more moisture and flavor to many of the meat and vegetable recipes in 
this book.
A yam by any other name still 
wouldn’t be a sweet potato
Though many people think yam and sweet 
potato are basically synonyms, they’re actually 
two different animals (well, plants):
 ✓ Sweet potatoes are yellow or orange elon-
gated tubers with tapering ends; they’re 
grown in the southern United States. The 
yellow sweet potato isn’t sweet, and its 
cooked texture is like that of a white potato. 
The orange variety has vivid orange flesh 
and is sweet and moist when cooked.
 ✓ Yams are brown- or black-skinned tubers; 
they come from a tropical vine (Dioscorea 
batatas) and aren’t related to the sweet 
potato. Yams grow in tropical climates, 
especially in South America, Africa, and 
the Caribbean, and they’re usually sweeter 
than sweet potatoes. The flesh is off-white, 
purple, or red, depending on the variety.
 
T Rockin’ Gravy
Do you want gravy with your Fresh Fries (see the recipe earlier in this chapter)? It may 
not be your traditional side of gravy, but this mushroom-based raw gravy from Angela 
Elliot’s e-book The Raw Divas Holiday Fare (www.she-zencuisine.com) can satisfy 
anybody’s gravy craving. Almonds have more insoluble than soluble fiber, but in nut 
butter form, they are easier to digest. The amount of soluble fiber in the mushrooms 
and flaxseed makes this a high soluble-fiber side. To keep the insoluble fiber to a mini-
mum, strip the fibrous outer strings off the celery before chopping it very finely.

 1 Process the celery, garlic powder, onion powder, Nama Shoyu, and pepper in a blender 
until smooth. Transfer to a bowl.
 2 Add the chopped mushrooms and powdered flaxseed until the mixture is thick and 
gravy-like. Warm with the warming setting of a dehydrator or in an oven on the lowest 
setting with the door open (if desired)
Tip: You can substitute other nut butters for the almond butter.

Diving Into Worry-Free Desserts
In This Chapter
▶ Making IBS-friendly cake, cobbler, pie, and pudding
▶ Crowning your desserts with safe, sweet sauces
▶ Using coconut to help soothe your gut
N
ever again will you feel like you’re losing out 
on dessert. The tasty recipes in this chap-
ter give you healthy desserts that are low on the 
white flour, fats, and sugars that may have caused 
you IBS grief in the past. Of course, that’s if you 
eat them in normal servings; don’t feel you have 
to eat them all in one sitting — go easy and share 
what you make. And we aren’t just talking about 
fruit salads, either. This chapter gives you recipes 
for classics like chocolate cake and cherry cob-
bler, as well as pudding, pie, and other naughty-
sounding favorites.
 
Satisfying your cravings with a minor indulgence 
is better than letting them build up into a major 
binge.
Like with many foods, your body’s constitution plays a role in how desserts 
affect your stomach (read more about Ayurvedic constitutions in Chapter 2). 
People with Vata constitutions are able to process natural sugars like honey 
but should avoid white sugar because it can become a stimulant. Folks with 
Pitta constitutions have higher metabolisms and burn off sugar faster, so 
after a sugar treat, the blood sugar can soar and then plunge. Eating dessert 
with a main meal can help slow down the absorption of sugar and avoid the 
plunge. The way they handle sugar means that Pitta’s have to keep their 
blood sugar balanced with regular meals or they can run into problems with 
hypoglycemia.

Filling Your Desserts with Fiber
When you’re searching for ways to work soluble fiber into your desserts, look 
to ingredients like nuts (though you may have to blend them as in almond 
flour), fresh and dried fruits without the skins, non-gluten flours, and chia 
seeds. The fiber table in Appendix C can help you figure out which other 
ingredients you may want to use in your desserts; as with all eating, shoot to 
include soluble-fiber ingredients at least 50 percent of the time.
Having Your Cake (And Cobbler!) 
and Eating It Too
Most cake is made with sugar, white flour, and lots of butter or lard, ingre-
dients that can even make sawdust tasty. But if you have IBS, the pleasures 
these foods elicit turn into pain when the excess fat stimulates the intestines 
and causes contractions, and the sugar feeds a few billion microorganisms, 
which leads to gas and bloating. However, you don’t have to write cake off 
just yet; the recipes in this section show you some ingenious ways around 
the triggers.
As for cobbler, it’s typically made with fruit and some kind of pastry or 
crumb topping, but we have a raw version here for those of you who are 
still avoiding grains. So this won’t be a cakey cobbler, but it’ll be delicious 
nonetheless.
 
T Rich and Moist Chocolate Cake
Andrea Boje (www.myfoodmyhealth.com/OurChefs/index.php?chefid=23) is our 
hero for contributing this gluten- and dairy-free (but incredibly moist) chocolate cake. 
These factors make is safe for you if gluten and dairy are your IBS triggers. It has 
enough flavor and sweetness that you can enjoy it without the extra sugar in frosting. 
Or you can use the sugar substitute Just Like Sugar in powder form to dust the top of 
the cake (see the color section). Check out a photo of it in the color section.
Andrea uses Bob’s Red Mill brand flours, which you can find in your local health food 
store. If you aren’t sensitive to dairy, you can use regular milk and butter in place of the 
almond milk and Earth Balance margarine. (Earth Balance is a brand of margarine made 
from a blend of soybean, palm fruit, canola, and olive oils. It’s similar to the brand 
Smart Balance.) For an alternate flavor, replace the coffee with an equal amount of your 

217
 Chapter 13: Diving Into Worry-Free Desserts
favorite brewed tea (such as chai or lavender). The cake will stay moist covered in the 
refrigerator or on the counter for a week and a half.
Tools: Parchment paper (optional)
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 35 minutes
Yield: 7 servings
1⁄2 cup brown rice flour
1⁄4 cup millet or sorghum flour
1⁄4 cup potato starch
1⁄4 cup tapioca flour
1⁄2 cup plus 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa 
powder
1 teaspoon xanthan gum
11⁄4 teaspoons baking soda
1 cup maple crystals
3⁄4 teaspoon sea salt
1 tablespoon organic vanilla
1⁄2 cup almond or rice milk
1⁄2 cup Earth Balance margarine, room 
temperature, plus more for pan greasing
1 egg, beaten
3⁄4 cup brewed coffee, room temperature
 1 Heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease an 8-inch round cake pan with margarine or coconut 
oil, adding and greasing a round sheet of parchment paper if your pan tends to stick.
 2 Mix the flours, potato starch, cocoa powder, xanthan gum, baking soda, maple crystals, 
and salt in a large bowl. 
 3 In another large bowl, put the vanilla, milk, margarine, and egg and mix on low speed 
with a hand mixer. Add the dry ingredients and continue to mix with the hand mixer. 
Add the coffee and blend again until mixed.
 4 Pour the batter into the cake pan and smooth out the top. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, 
giving the pan a half turn halfway through baking time. Remove from oven when a 
toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean.
 5 Let the cake cool in pan for 5 minutes and then remove it and set it on a rack. 
Tip: If you can’t find maple crystals, substitute an equal amount of brown sugar, organic 
white sugar, or turbinado sugar.
Tip: Store your unused portions of flour in your freezer for freshness.
Vary It! To make this recipe as cupcakes, follow the recipe instructions but pour the batter 
into a greased cupcake tin or cupcake liners. Reduce the baking time to 20 minutes. You 
get 12 cupcakes.

T Pineapple Upside-Down Cake
Raman Prasad (www.scdrecipe.com/cookbook) contributed this American classic 
from his book Recipes for the Specific Carbohydrate Diet™ (Fair Winds Press). SCD is a 
diet that is safe for colitis, Crohn’s disease, and IBS that avoids the carbs in grains and 
root vegetables that are the trigger for intestinal microorganism overgrowth. Use fresh 
pineapple if you possibly can; if you use canned, make sure it doesn’t have any preser-
vatives or sugars added. We prefer a fresh, ripe pineapple because the juices from the 
slices seep into the batter and flavor it nicely.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 30 to 40 minutes
Yield: 15 to 20 servings
2 cups almond flour, or more as needed for 
consistency
3 eggs
4 tablespoons butter, melted
1⁄2 cup honey
3⁄4 teaspoon organic vanilla extract
1⁄4 teaspoon cinnamon powder
1⁄2 pound fresh pineapple, thinly sliced (about 
8 slices)
 1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 9-x-12-inch baking dish.
 2 Mix the almond flour, eggs, butter, honey, vanilla, and cinnamon by hand or with a hand 
mixer until smooth. Add more almond flour if necessary to make sure the batter isn’t 
too thin.
 3 Layer the pineapple slices on the bottom of the baking dish. Pour in the cake batter and 
spread it evenly in the pan. Bake the cake for 30 to 40 minutes, or until a toothpick 
inserted into the center comes out clean.

T Cherry Cobbler
Cookbook author Angela Elliott (www.she-zencuisine.com) contributed this deli-
cious raw version of the classic cobbler. It contains coconut, our favorite IBS-friendly 
dessert food; coconut is safe for both IBS-D and IBS-C, making this dessert safe for 
everybody. (Check out “Creating Coconut Cookies and Bread” later in this chapter for 
more treats starring coconut and info on its benefits.)

 Chapter 13: Diving Into Worry-Free Desserts
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: 8 servings
11⁄2 cups shredded coconut
11⁄2 cups walnuts
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
1⁄3 cup plus 1⁄2 cup pitted dates
3 cups frozen cherries, thawed and drained
2 teaspoons lemon juice
1⁄8 teaspoon cinnamon
 1 Combine the coconut, walnuts, and salt in a food processor. Add 1⁄3 cup of the pitted 
dates one at a time, processing to form coarse crumbs; set aside.
 2 In a blender, combine 1 cup of the cherries with the rest of the dates and the lemon 
juice and cinnamon. Blend until it is a chunky mixture. Toss with the remaining 2 cups 
of cherries.
 3 Put cherry mixture in a square glass baking dish. Top with crumble topping and refrig-
erate until ready to serve.
Tip: You can soak the walnuts for 6 hours (see the Soaking Nuts and Seeds recipe in 
Chapter 8) and dehydrate them for 18 hours at 150 degrees to make them dry and crispy 
and easier to process.
Tip: For instant gratification, you can also just put the cherry mixture directly into serving 
dishes and top with the crumble topping.

The Pies Have It! Making Pies 
without the Baking
When you think of pies, you probably think of lard and white flour, maybe 
with a bit of salt and egg (and, if your mother made six pies at a time like ours 
did, some white vinegar). That’s not much to rave about in terms of nutri-
tional content, except for the egg. 
Folks with IBS have stomachs that just won’t stand for the empty calories of 
white sugar, lard, and flour. They rebel. But that doesn’t mean you don’t still 
like the taste and feel of pie, so the recipes in this section show you how to 
have the best of both worlds. You’re going to be amazed how you can satisfy 
your pie craving and eliminate lard, sugar, and white flour at the same time.

Part II: Eating For Your Intestinal Health 
 
T Vegan Lemon Meringue Pie
Healing chef Julie Beyer provided this healthy dessert recipe. You often find coconut 
milk and shredded coconut listed as IBS no-no’s simply because of the fat content, but 
that’s not our experience. Those writers don’t take into consideration the type of fat. 
Coconut is high in fat, but it’s the easily digested kind of fat (see “Creating Coconut 
Cookies and Bread” later in this chapter for more on coconut). Coconut milk and shred-
ded coconut actually make this pie friendly for IBS-D.
You may also wonder about the nuts in this recipe, but fear not: Grinding the cashews 
to smithereens makes them into a creamy paste. Cashew paste is thought to be sooth-
ing to the gut, not irritating. Nuts? We don’t see any nuts!
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: 8 servings
2 cups cashews, soaked (see the Soaking 
Nuts and Seeds recipe in Chapter 8)
Pinch of sea salt
4 tablespoons unsweetened coconut milk
Juice of 1 lemon (about 1⁄4 cup)
2 to 4 tablespoons maple or agave syrup 
(optional)
4 to 8 tablespoons water
Lemon Meringue Pie Crust (see the following 
recipe)
1⁄4 cup unsweetened shredded coconut
 1 Blend the salt, coconut milk, cashews, lemon juice, syrup (if desired), and half the water 
in a blender until you get a thick, creamy consistency, adding the rest of the water 
toward the end to achieve the correct consistency without causing the filling to sepa-
rate. Pour the filling on top of the crust and sprinkle with the shredded coconut. Chill 
the pie in the fridge for 30 minutes to allow it to firm up before cutting
Per serving: Calories 373; Fat 28.4 g (Saturated 14.8 g); Cholesterol 0 mg; Sodium 28 mg; Carbohydrate 27.4 g 
(Fiber 2.4 g); Protein 11.3 g; Sugar 8.4 g.

 Chapter 13: Diving Into Worry-Free Desserts
 1 Mix the ground flaxseed, brown rice protein powder, stevia, flax seed oil, cinnamon, and 
water in a 9-inch pie plate.
 2  Spread the mixture over the bottom of the pie plate.
Vary It! For an easy, crustless upside-down alternative, spread the filling evenly in a dish 
and then sprinkle shredded coconut (if desired) and ground flaxseeds on top.
Tip: The longer you soak the nuts, the more the natural nut enzyme inhibitors break down 
and the creamier the texture of your filling. However, if you don’t have much time, you can 
get a creamy, easy-to-digest paste by soaking the nuts for only 1 hour. You can soak them 
for less than 1 hour, but the cream has a stronger taste and is a bit less creamy.
Tip: To get the best results, use a good sea salt such as Himalayan Rock Salt or Harvest of 
France, found at your local health food store. These salts have all the minerals still in 
them, so they’re actually good for you (unlike some others) as well as tasty. Try to get No. 3 
maple syrup — it’s harvested at the end of the season and is richer in minerals. But any 
good maple syrup works fine. We also recommend Thai Kitchen coconut milk because it’s 
one of the few preservative-free brands.

T Shannon’s Pumpky Pie
Thanks to Shannon Leone from www.rawmom.com for this healthy, hearty confection. 
The sweet potatoes, blended cashews, and pine nuts are safe and soothing for IBS suf-
ferers. This recipe may not actually include pumpkin, but the taste, especially with the 
pumpkin pie herbs, is very pumpky. Besides the pumpkin pie taste, allspice, cinnamon, 
and nutmeg are all IBS-friendly and even IBS-healing, especially cinnamon, which is a 
digestive aid and settles IBS cramps. This pie keeps well in the fridge for up to a week.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: 8 servings
3 uncooked sweet potatoes, washed, peeled, 
and chopped
1 cup raw cashews, soaked 2 hours to soften
1 cup raw pine nuts
1⁄3 to 1⁄2 cup raw honey
1 teaspoon organic vanilla
1 teaspoon allspice
1⁄2 teaspoon cinnamon
1⁄4 teaspoon nutmeg
1⁄4 teaspoon sea salt
Pumpky Pie Crust (see the following recipe)
8 to 10 whole pecans for decoration
 1 Blend the sweet potatoes, cashews, pine nuts, honey, vanilla, spices, and sea salt in 
food processor until smooth, adding more spice or honey to taste if necessary.
 2 Spoon the filling into the crust with a spatula and decorate with the pecans.
Vary It! You can replace the honey with agave nectar if you prefer the flavor or don’t have 
honey on your safe food list.

Pudding Your Best Food Forward: 
Enjoying Smooth Treats
Some people like crunchy desserts, and some like smooth indulgences that 
are less likely to stir up IBS symptoms. This section is for the smoothies in 
the audience — you know who you are. Just think of dipping your spoon into 
soft, creamy sweetness that’s so good you’ll want to lick the bowl.
 
T Chocolate Mousse
We love the innovation of Raw chefs who have discovered that avocado has many more uses 
than guacamole! Angela Elliott (www.she-zencuisine.com) whipped up this chocolate 
wonder. Chocolate, the key ingredient in this recipe, is high in magnesium, which relieves 
cramps, and antioxidants, which neutralize toxins (see Chapter 1). Avocado is a healthy fat 
that most people with IBS can enjoy and it gives a rich taste to the mousse that you would 
only get from added fats or oils. Date syrup (see the recipe later in this chapter) is a safe 
sweetener, and carob powder has therapeutic uses for IBS-D (but it’s also safe for IBS-C).
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Chilling time: 30 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
11⁄2 ripe avocados, peeled
1⁄4 cup date syrup or agave
1⁄2 cup cacao powder
1 tablespoon organic vanilla 
1⁄4 cup carob powder (optional)
 1 In a food processor or blender, combine all ingredients and process or blend until smooth.
 2 Chill for 30 minutes and then serve.
Tip: Top with sliced strawberries for a contrasting color and taste.

T Carolyn’s Chocolate Banana 
 
Cream Pudding
The name says it all! This recipe is probably already out there, but Carolyn hasn’t found 
the original chef. It popped into her head when all she had on hand for company was 
frozen bananas, 100-percent raw chocolate powder (cacao), and coconut milk. And 
voilà: A dreamy dessert with healthy ingredients was born . . . and quickly eaten. 
Bananas are usually frozen ripe, so this recipe can be a treatment for IBS-D.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: 2 servings
4 small frozen bananas, cut into rounds
4 ounces full-fat coconut milk
2 tablespoons cacao powder
Strawberries or blueberries, for serving
 1 Pulse the bananas, coconut milk, and cacao powder in a food processor or high-speed 
blender until smooth and creamy.
 2 Serve with sliced strawberries and/or blueberries. Eat immediately to avoid browning.
Tip: Cacao powder is all the rage on the Raw culinary scene, so it’s getting easier to obtain 
at health food stores or online at stores like www.vitacost.com.

 1 Blend the two fruits until creamy.
 2 Add a squeeze of lime and serve.
Vary It! To create a thicker pudding, add 1 tablespoon of psyllium powder to the recipe. 
Bonus: Psyllium powder is 75 percent soluble fiber.
Tip: Pair this recipe with either of the crust recipes in this chapter for a tasty pie.
Tip: Decorate the top of your pudding or pie with bananas, papaya, and coconut flakes.

Thickening agents in the food industry are varied. Gums come from plant and 
tree exudates (discharges). Algin and agar come from marine plants or sea-
weed extracts. Pectin is produced from fruit and vegetable extracts. Xanthan 
gum is a fermentation product. Psyllium powder is comes from a family of 
plants called Plantago, which you probably know better as plantains.
 
T Fast, Colorful Papaya Pudding
Thanks to Shannon Leone (www.rawmom.com) for this warp-speed offering. It’s made 
with banana and papaya and taken from her e-book Eating for Beauty, Health & Pleasure 
(available at www.bottlinghealth.com). A ripe banana may help IBS-D, and a slightly 
green one is best for IBS-C. So pick a banana based on your symptoms right now. The 
second ingredient, papaya, is great for anyone with IBS because of its high soluble-fiber 
content and therapeutic amounts of digestive enzymes.
Preparation time: 8 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: 2 servings
1⁄2 of a large papaya, peeled and deseeded
1 large banana, peeled
Squeeze of lime juice

T Key Lime Mousse
This recipe, also from Shannon Leone’s Raw kitchen (www.rawmom.com), is fast and so 
delicious that it hits the spot every time! Avocados are non-sweet fruits, a source of 
healing vitamin E, and a source of healthy fat that keeps joints lubricated, provides 
insulation around nerve sheathes, and is great for the hair and skin.
Most people with IBS can tolerate some avocado, but just be aware that eating too 
much of any kind of fat may trigger IBS side effects. Used in moderation, however, IBS 
sufferers can digest avocado; it may even have a healing effect.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: 2 servings
2 ripe avocados, pitted and peeled
Juice of 2 limes (about 1⁄4 cup)
1 teaspoon organic vanilla extract
2 tablespoons raw, organic honey 
Sprig of mint for garnish
2 strawberries, thinly sliced, for garnish
 1 Blend the avocados, lime, vanilla, and honey in a food processor until smooth and creamy.
 2 Serve in a dessert cup with a sprig of mint and very thinly sliced strawberries.
Vary It! You can substitute 1 lemon for the 2 limes if that’s all you have on hand. Add more lime 
or lemon juice for a stronger citrus taste. You also can use agave nectar instead of honey.
Tip: To save yourself time, you can purchase organic lemon juice in the health food store 
to keep on hand for when you don’t have lemons to squeeze.

T Goji Berry Tapioca
Shannon Leone’s tapioca from her e-book The Healthy Lunch Box (available at www.
rawmom.com/HealthyLunchbox) is a delight. You can find goji berries (also called 
wolfberries) and chia seeds in your health food store or online. Chia seeds are mild 
tasting and high in protein and essential fatty acids. It’s also very high in soluble fiber, 
absorbing up to 12 times its weight in water making it an excellent way to relieve diar-
rhea. And if you have constipation, you can drink extra water with your dessert and 
turn it into the safe bulk you need.

 Chapter 13: Diving Into Worry-Free Desserts
The great thing about this recipe is that it creates some great little extras you can use 
for other recipes. Save the almond pulp for cookies or pie crust, and store the extra 
almond milk in the fridge as a tasty beverage. 
Tools: High-speed blender
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: 4 servings
1⁄2 to 1 cup goji berries
1⁄2 to 1 cup white or black chia seeds
1 teaspoon honey, or to taste
Pinch of sea salt
Drop of organic vanilla (optional)
 1 Blend the almonds and water in a high-speed blender until completely liquefied. Strain 
the almond milk using a fine mesh strainer, and then add the honey, salt, and vanilla (if 
desired).
 2 Use about 1 to 2 cups per person of the almond milk for the tapioca, and store the rest 
in the fridge as a beverage.
 3 Add the goji berries and chia seeds to the almond milk and let set for 30 minutes. Enjoy!
Vary It! You can use agave in place of the honey.

Isn’t chia that seed-growing thing?
Chia (Salvia hispanica) is a member of the mint 
family, though you use the seeds rather than 
the leaves. And, yes, it’s the pet that grows. 
Originating in Mexico, chia was part of the 
Aztec and Mayan diets, but the Spanish con-
quest hampered its cultivation. In the past few 
decades production has increased, especially 
since Ricardo Ayerza Jr. and Wayne Coates 
wrote Chia: Rediscovering a Forgotten Crop of 
the Aztecs (University of Arizona Press), the 
definitive book on the subject, in 2005.
Chia is 16 percent protein, 31 percent fat, and 
44 percent carbohydrate (and 38 percent of that 
carbohydrate is fiber). It has more insoluble 
than soluble fiber, but its soluble fiber is denser 
and more absorbent than other dietary fibers, 
making it act more like a high soluble fiber.

T Vegan Khir Pudding
Healing chef Julie Beyer needed a way to use up leftover rice or noodles, so she came 
up with this vegan version of an Indian delight. Use non-wheat grains or noodles. 
Blending the cashews may make them easier to digest, making this pudding safe for 
both IBS-C and IBS-D.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: 4 servings
1 cup cashews, soaked in water for 4 hours 
and drained
1 to 11⁄2 cups water
2 to 3 tablespoons maple syrup, or to taste
Pinch of sea salt
1 to 2 teaspoons of cardamom, or to taste
1⁄2 cup cooked brown rice or whole-grain 
noodles (such as rice or buckwheat noodles 
of your choice)
Dash of saffron (optional)
1⁄4 cup slivered almonds (optional)
 1 Blend the cashews, water, maple syrup, sea salt, and cardamom in a blender and adjust 
seasoning to taste.
 2 Add cooked rice or noodles to cashew milk and, if desired, sprinkle with a dash of saf-
fron and almonds as well as an extra drizzle of maple syrup.
Tip: If you want the nutty taste of almonds but not the slivers, blend the almonds separately 
to a powder and then sprinkle over the finished pudding.

Creating Coconut Cookies and Bread
Living in Maui, Carolyn is exposed to considerable amounts of coconut. Every 
week at the farmer’s market, she samples Lori Steer’s Maui Macaroons (www.
mauimacaroon.com). If she’s feeling a little rumbly, just one macaroon is 
enough to settle her gut down. We bring that up because so much folklore 
surrounds the healing power of coconut macaroons for IBS-D. The meat of 
the coconut in the form of macaroons can relieve diarrhea.

People with IBS-C can also enjoy macaroons because they aren’t binding. 
If you really want a coconut treatment for IBS-C, it’s coconut oil. The oil in 
coconut helps lubricate the intestines and can relieve constipation. Even 
though it’s a fat, it doesn’t go rancid. Coconut oil is the closest to mother’s 
milk in its medium-chain fatty acid (MCFA) content, and MCFAs are very 
digestible and aren’t as readily stored as fat. Add a teaspoon of coconut oil 
once or twice a day to create a lubricating effect on the intestines. Combining 
coconut oil with getting enough water, exercise, fiber, magnesium, and vita-
min C is very beneficial for IBS-C.
 
MCFAs raise metabolism, so you actually can lose weight and lower your cho-
lesterol with coconut. MCFAs boost the immune system and fight yeast, bad 
bacteria and viruses. They have a huge reputation in the chronic fatigue and 
AIDS community.
 
T Coconut Currant Cookies
Coconut is very healing for IBS-D and safe for IBS-C. This recipe, contributed by Jody to 
www.pecanbread.com, is SCD-safe for people with colitis and Crohn’s disease, making 
it safe for folks with IBS as well.

T Coconut Bread
Michelle Gay, our Australian chef at www.eatingjourney.wordpress.com, contrib-
uted this delicious recipe. Coconut is a very healing food for the intestines, killing intes-
tinal infectious microorganisms; eggs are a neutral food, and the rest of the ingredients 
are safe and healthy. Honey does contain natural sugar, but it’s a very low amount that 
your body can digest quickly, leaving none to feed your intestinal microorganisms. And 
it’s also far less sugar than most dessert breads and cakes contain. If you can’t find 
coconut flour, you can buy shredded coconut and blend it down until it’s very fine. Just 
be sure not too blend it down too far because it turns into a paste.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 50 minutes
Yield: 10 servings
12⁄3 cups coconut flour 
5 eggs
1 teaspoon organic vanilla
2 teaspoons cinnamon
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon of gluten-free baking powder
1⁄4 cup plus 1 tablespoon honey
 1 Preheat the oven to 330 degrees.
 2 Mix 1 teaspoon of the cinnamon with the salt, baking powder, and 1⁄4 cup of the honey in 
a bowl.
 3 Place the batter into a greased 9-x-5-inch loaf pan or an ungreased silicone bread pan.
 4 Top the dough with a sprinkle of the remaining cinnamon and honey and bake for 
45 to 50 minutes.
Tip: Slice warm or cold and spread with whipped butter and honey.

Topping Things Off: Decadent 
Dessert Toppers
Many people just can’t eat pudding, pie, or cake without a little something 
to put on top. But many store-bought toppings can wreak havoc on your IBS. 
Beware of the whipped products that are dairy-free alternatives to whipped 
cream. Just because they’re lactose-free doesn’t mean they’re IBS-friendly — 
in fact, they often include casein, a milk protein that triggers some people’s 
IBS, and high-fructose corn syrup, a processed sweetener that’s not a good 
addition to any diet. The recipes in this section give you a few options for 
homemade toppers that you can enjoy worry-free.
 
T Date Syrup
If you find that you’re very sensitive to sweeteners but would love to have something 
safe, try Angela Elliott’s (www.she-zencuisine.com) Date Syrup. It’s high in soluble 
fiber, and any insoluble fiber is blended to be more digestible, so folks with all kinds of 
IBS can enjoy it as they would honey: as a tea sweetener, on pancakes, or in recipes like 
the chocolate mousse in this chapter. You can store the date syrup in a glass jar in the 
refrigerator for 2 weeks, but it’s better if you use it fresh.
Soaking time: 3 to 4 hours
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: Six 1⁄4-cup servings (11⁄2 cups total)
20 to 25 honey or medjool dates
1 cup filtered, spring, or alkaline water
 1 Pit the dates and cover them with the water in a bowl. Soak for 3 to 4 hours.
 2 Blend the dates and the soaking water in a blender until smooth.
Tip: Pour this syrup on the pancakes in Chapter 6.

1 cup macadamia nuts, soaked in water for 4 
hours and drained
1⁄2 cup water
1⁄2 cup Date Syrup (see the preceding recipe) 
or agave, or more to taste
1 teaspoon organic vanilla 
1 tablespoon cold-pressed coconut oil
 1 Blend all the ingredients in a blender until smooth and creamy in texture.
Tip: If your cream doesn’t seem thick enough, blending it for a few seconds more should 
thicken it up.

T Angel’s Decadent 
 
Whipped Cream
This recipe comes from Angela Elliott (www.she-zencuisine.com), author of many 
Raw cookbooks. The message here is that something doesn’t have to be cream to be 
creamy! Because of the antimicrobial and lubricant effect of coconut oil and bowel stim-
ulating effect of the oil in macadamia nuts, this recipe is very beneficial for IBS-C. Cold 
pressed coconut oil avoids heat processing that can destroy some of the nutrient value 
of this valuable nut.

Simple Solutions 
for Specific 
Situations

In this part . . .
H
ere we tackle three common situations where eat-
ing for IBS can be the most challenging. Chapter 14 
makes eating on the go less daunting, and Chapter 15 
helps you satisfy even the pickiest IBS kid (without gross-
ing out the rest of the family). Chapter 16 shows you how 
to find IBS-friendly meals when you eat out — even IBS 
cooks need a night off.

Chapter 14
Eating On the Go
In This Chapter
▶ Preparing and packing meals and snacks ahead of time
▶ Controlling your IBS away from home
▶ Taking the worry out of travelling with IBS
F
or many people with IBS, leaving the house can be a major challenge even 
on good days. We know that virtually every time you leave the house 
you’re worried that you’ll have an IBS attack. In fact, some IBS sufferers have 
secret maps to the bathrooms all over their cities; at least one Web site even 
maps clean bathrooms all over the world (that’s www.sitorsquat.com if 
you’re interested).
But the number two worry (pardon the pun) for people with IBS is what 
they’re going to eat when they leave the house. We’re not talking about what 
you can eat at restaurants — that’s in Chapter 16. We’re talking about plan-
ning your food when you’re away from the house for work, school, or a visit 
to Grandma’s. You’re ready to venture out into the world after being stuck at 
home with your symptoms, and we want to help you plan a successful outing. 
In this chapter, we offer ideas and suggestions for creating a self-contained, 
portable survival kit you can grab whenever you head out the door. You have 
to take your finicky digestive system with you wherever you go, and we want 
to help you prepare.
Being Prepared Keeps You in Control
Yes, things were absolutely much easier when you could grab a prepared 
meal or snack at the coffee shop, corner store, or lunchroom. But now you 
have IBS — you can’t just grab any old munchies if you want to stave off an 
attack. This section shows you how a little preparation can help you avoid 
getting stuck without an appropriate way to satisfy your hunger.

236
Part III: Simple Solutions for Specific Situations 
 
Eating small portions is important for controlling IBS. As you prep and 
pack meals ahead of time, make sure you aren’t sabotaging yourself with por-
tion size.
Preparation starts in the kitchen: 
Cooking meals in advance
Planning for eating on the go takes some time and dedication, but we want to 
help take the torture out of the chore. The plan is that in just a short couple 
of hours a week, you can have days of dishes ready to go. So clear the family 
out of the kitchen, crank up your favorite music, and get started. Just remem-
ber that you’re setting this time aside to celebrate your healthy approach to 
food — and to living safely in the world.
Deciding what you’re going to eat for the week is a great start. Create a 
weekly menu (see Chapter 4) and check your menu for recipes that you can 
make in multiples and store or freeze the extras to pack for work or school. 
Make sure the ingredients you need are on your shopping list. (Chapter 4 
also provides tips for shopping success.)
 
Roast a large chicken on your cooking day and use the left over meat and veg-
etables to make a soup or stew that you can freeze for several meals to come.
Gather together the vegetables that you want to cut up. No matter what 
shape, size, or density, chopping piles of veggies all at once can be fun and 
therapeutic. After you’ve got them chopped, separate the veggies you want 
to blanch (to make them more digestible) and dip them in boiling water for 
the allotted time. You can cool and then freeze them in freezer baggies to 
grab when you go.
Stacking soups to save space
If you find that you’re running out of space in 
the freezer for all your tiny tubs of soups and 
stews, we’ve got you covered. Our healing chef 
Colleen Robinson suggests pouring cooled soup 
into heavy-duty zippered plastic storage bags 
and stacking the bags on top of each other on 
a cookie sheet. Put the sheet of soups or stews 
in the freezer until frozen. Your final product will 
be flat bags of soup that you can stack in your 
freezer rather than a mixed bag of frozen shapes 
and sizes that take up much more space. If you’re 
worried about the bags sticking together while 
they’re freezing, put a sheet of waxed paper 
between the layers of soup bags. The added 
bonus is that when you take your soup bag to 
work or school, it helps keep the other food cool.

237
 Chapter 14: Eating On the Go
 
If you’re chopping zucchini, you can bag some raw because it’s high in soluble 
fiber and IBS-friendly.
A couple of dips you can make ahead are nut pâté (see the recipe in Chapter 7) 
and pesto (see the recipe in Chapter 11). They’re not meals, but they make 
great pasta toppings or wrap sauces. Nut pâté doesn’t freeze well, but the garlic 
in the recipe keeps it fresh for a week. You can freeze pesto for about 3 months.
Keeping a portable snack pack on hand
Chapter 2 helps you understand the foods that work best for you and your 
sensitive self. Copies of your safe food list are likely laminated and placed 
strategically around your home, office, and car (and if they aren’t, they 
should be). Take a copy of your safe food list and assign numbers based on 
how safe those foods are for you: Put a 1 next to foods you know you can 
absolutely always eat safely, a 2 next to those foods that are usually very safe, 
and a 3 beside those foods that are safe but only under certain circumstances.
 
We strongly recommend that you always have a supply of at least one of your 
number one safe foods on your person whenever you’re away from your own 
kitchen. For example, if applesauce is one of your top safe foods, buy small, 
sealed containers and keep a couple in your desk at work, a couple in your car 
(depending on the temperature outside), and a couple in your handbag, com-
puter bag, or somewhere else handy. That way, when hunger hits, you have 
safe food to eat immediately and won’t be tempted to grab a less-safe snack 
from the vending machine.
The following list details the foods that are easiest to pack and safest for IBS 
stomachs in general. You know your gut better than we do, so you can cer-
tainly add other foods you have flagged on your safe food list. If you’re trying 
out the Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD, see Chapter 3), check out the exten-
sive list of legal and illegal foods at www.pecanbread.com/c.
 
✓ Applesauce: You can purchase individual containers of applesauce or 
make your own and store it in small containers.
 
✓ Avocados: They come with their own container (a pretty durable shell), 
and you can slice them in half with a sharp knife, remove the pit, and eat 
them plain or with a teaspoon of lemon juice. If you’re a Vata constitution 
(see Chapter 5), you can even sprinkle in a few drops of a mild chili sauce.
 
✓ Bananas: More great foods with their own baggies. As we mention in 
Chapter 3, unripe bananas are suitable for IBS-C and ripe ones for IBS-D.
 
✓ Barley: Bring some barley soup with you when you travel and cook it up 
when you can. Amy’s brand has a tasty canned Organic Vegetable Barley 
Soup (www.amys.com). One can is 398 milliliters, which is about 1.5 cups 
of soup.

238
Part III: Simple Solutions for Specific Situations 
 
✓ Beets: Mixing cut-up cooked beets with carrots, corn, some brown rice, 
and a bit of lemon and olive oil can make a great snack. Add some chest-
nuts, and you’ve got a gourmet meal. All these foods are high in soluble 
fiber and can be packed alone or in combination.
 
✓ Currants, figs, raisins, and prunes: These dried fruits are great choices 
separately and together are a good combination for IBS-C. High in solu-
ble fiber and stimulating to the intestines, they help to keep your bowels 
working when you’re traveling.
 
✓ French bread and sourdough bread: A long stick of French bread is a 
great soluble-fiber food to add to any meal on the road. It can counteract 
insoluble fiber or fill a vacuum when you can’t find anything else safe 
to eat. Sourdough bread isn’t made from yeast, so it’s a good option for 
folks who may be following a yeast-free diet.
 
✓ Oatmeal: This standby is the IBS traveler’s breakfast of choice. Check 
out Chapter 6 for oatmeal recipes and tips on making it in your hotel 
room.
 
✓ Mangos and papayas: These fruits are high in soluble fiber, and papaya 
is high in enzymes, making it especially easy on the stomach. Cut them 
in half, scoop out the seeds and pit, and eat the goodness inside.
 
✓ Parsnips: If you love parsnips, mix and match them with brown rice, 
yams, sweet potato, carrots, beets, turnips, squash, and pumpkins.
 
✓ Peas: Put fresh peas in a container with some potato and yam for a great 
meal on the go; you can add a bit of olive oil and vinegar to help mix 
the flavors. All three vegetables are high in soluble fiber. If you’re into 
cooked peas, adding butter or ghee (see the recipe in Chapter 6) gives 
them a rich taste.
 
✓ Psyllium seed husks: These bad boys may sound pretty intimidating, 
but they’re what you find in powdered fiber supplements like Metamucil. 
They’re a great soluble-fiber addition to your travel pack; a tablespoon 
or two a day when you travel helps regulate your bowels — take a table-
spoon with 6 or 12 ounces of water for IBS-D and -C, respectively.
 
✓ Quinoa: Rice and barley aren’t the only safe grains. Use cooked, cooled 
quinoa as a base for the safe soluble vegetables you can tolerate.
 
✓ Rice: It’s generally safe for IBS-D and IBS-C, so you may want to have a 
small covered container of cooked brown rice as your personal portable 
soluble fiber.
 
Always make sure that your survival kit has a vegetable peeler. Matches (for 
dispelling odors caused by flaring symptoms) are another good addition.

 Chapter 14: Eating On the Go
Enjoying Common Events without 
Worrying About Side Effects
Most people without irritable bowels have no idea how much thought and 
care goes into getting out the door for those who do. As an IBS sufferer, you 
never know whether that pressure in your rectum is a gas or a solid, which 
makes planning any trip outside the house somewhat difficult. But we assure 
you it won’t always be like that. In this section, we show you how a little fore-
thought can help IBS sufferers function in everyday situations.
Enjoying food at the office
Even if you love your job and have a positive workplace, anywhere but home 
can be stressful if you have IBS. To help keep control over your situation, 
make sure you have lots of nourishing, nurturing foods and drinks with you 
when you head to work; in fact, stash a stockpile of your top safe foods at 
your desk so you’re always prepared. We also recommend keeping a supply 
of soothing drinks (such as peppermint, black, and ginger tea and lemonade) 
as well for those times your IBS day doesn’t go quite as planned.
Of course, the office-eating issue is lunch; head to “Preparation Starts in 
the Kitchen: Cooking Meals in Advance” earlier in this chapter for tips on 
cooking grab-and-go lunches in advance, and check out the recipes in Parts II 
and III for tons of IBS-friendly food ideas. If you miss going out to lunch 
with your work pals, check out Chapter 16 for some ideas on making that 
easier as well.
 
One of Christine’s favorite portable foods is cooked low-fat turkey sausages. 
Shop for a selection that doesn’t have fillers like wheat or additives like nitrates. 
Cook up a bunch and let them cool and then wrap each one in tinfoil and pop 
them in the freezer. Christine drops one in her purse in the morning — by 
lunch it’s a thawed and tasty protein boost.
 
Feeling deprived during that 3-p.m. slump when everyone in the office is 
feeding dollar bills into the candy machine? Check out the dessert recipes in 
Chapter 13 and tuck some safe sweets in your desk at your office.
If your office is prone to pitch-ins, check out “The potluck dinner” section 
later in this chapter for info on navigating these parties.

Part III: Simple Solutions for Specific Situations 
Sending kids to school
Most kids just want to fit in with their friends and not stand out as different — 
especially at school, where standing out can be brutal. If your child has IBS, 
she’s probably feeling the anxiety of being different on top of the anxiety 
caused by her condition. Try packing a discreet survival kit with things to 
help her feel safer at school, such as a thermos of her favorite soothing tea, 
soup, or stew, or some rice crackers or plain mini rice cakes. Just be sure to 
check the school’s regulations for bringing in outside food (and you should 
probably forgo the matches in this case).
Preparation is the key for helping your child feel safe at school. It may take some 
time to settle on lunches that nourish without embarrassing. Chapter 15 
shows you how to do avoidance and challenging and create a food diary with 
your child; after she has a better understanding of food’s effect on her condi-
tion, let her help you shop for the foods she’s put on her own safe list and work 
together to create lunches that satisfy both hunger and the need to fit in.
For kids with IBS, sitting in a classroom under scrutiny of the teacher can be 
upsetting. Putting her hand up to be excused to go to the bathroom can be 
difficult for any kid, but if your IBS kid has to raise her hand to be excused 
five or six times a day, that can feel like torture (and that emotional strain 
isn’t going to help the situation any). And the bathroom isn’t the only issue. 
Kids tend to get hungry throughout the day, and a standard tip for people 
with IBS is to eat smaller meals throughout the day, but your student’s snack 
and mealtimes are limited when she’s in school.
Explain your child’s condition to her teacher, principal, and school nurse so 
that they understand what may happen in the course of the day. Her teacher 
may already be aware that frequent bathroom breaks have been necessary, 
but a sit-down meeting can drive the point home. You also want to work out 
a plan for necessary snacking, such as having your student keep a stash of 
snacks in her locker or in the nurse’s office and duck out of class to keep her 
eating schedule on track.
 
Class celebrations are another challenge for kids with IBS. Having a conversa-
tion about why she can’t share in the cupcakes is mandatory, and if you’ve 
already done the food diary and elimination diet with your kid, she knows that 
the sweet treat, no matter how delicious, can still send her to the bathroom in 
an unpleasant way. Teachers generally send home a note to let parents know 
when a cupcake or pizza day is pending. Make sure you’ve put a treat from 
Chapter 13 in your kid’s lunchbag to help soften the blow.

241
 Chapter 14: Eating On the Go
 
No matter what age you are, in many ways, school and IBS do not mix well. If 
you are an adult with IBS going to school, you can let your instructor know 
that you have a condition that may require you to leave the room occasionally. 
Sit near the door so your comings and goings are less distracting. Your class 
schedule may be more flexible around your eating schedule, but you may also 
want to mention that you may sometimes need to bring a snack to class.
Socializing with IBS: Functioning 
at a function
No, we don’t mean that you’re going to invite your bowels to a party. Like 
any public event, social functions can be very stressful for people with IBS. 
They have to deal with tempting but potentially triggering foods, strange 
(and sometimes public) washrooms, and folks who may not understand their 
restrictions. The good news is that you can overcome these obstacles with a 
little preplanning.
If your event’s venue is a public place, you can always call or drop by to 
check out the bathroom facilities to help to ease your mind. If food will be 
served, make sure you’ve eaten a safe and balanced meal beforehand. You 
don’t want to show up hungry and be tempted to eat unidentified foods or 
foods you know are bad but look reaaallly good to your growling stomach. If 
you see foods that you know are safe for you, try them out. Otherwise, just 
pop a few drops of mint essential oil into a glass of mineral water and enjoy 
conversation rather than canapés. The following sections give you more tips 
for surviving more-specific kinds of shindigs.
The dreaded dinner party
We’ve heard so many stories about dinner party mishaps. Rule number one: 
If you don’t know what it is, don’t eat it. Period. Experts tell us that they 
would rather be a bit rude for turning down the creamed artichoke dip they 
know they can’t handle than be embarrassed (and even ruder) for spending 
dessert in the bathroom with the fan working and matches burning.
 
If you’ve accepted an invitation to a dinner party because you’re feeling like 
your symptoms have been behaving lately, great. However, keep in mind that 
they can still throw a tantrum at any moment. This setting isn’t the place to 
test unknown foods or go back to foods that have been a problem in the past. 
Save testing foods for the privacy of your own home.

242
Part III: Simple Solutions for Specific Situations 
Many hosts ask their guests if they have any food allergies or sensitivities. 
Although you may be able to tell someone that you’re gluten intolerant and 
lactose intolerant, they may not be too tolerant of you giving them your 
whole IBS trigger list. Instead, give them some or all of your safe food list, or 
rely on the following version of the safe soluble food list in Chapter 2, which 
we’ve modified here for common dinner party ingredients:
 
✓ Applesauce
 
✓ Avocados
 
✓ Bananas
 
✓ Barley
 
✓ Beets
 
✓ Brown rice
 
✓ Carrots
 
✓ Corn
 
✓ French bread
 ✓ Fresh peas
 ✓ Mangos
 ✓ Papayas
 ✓ Pasta
 ✓ Potatoes
 ✓ Rice
 ✓ Squash
 ✓ Sweet potatoes
 ✓ Yams
We haven’t included any salad greens here — those have to come from your 
personal preferences and experiments. Fish, chicken, and lean meats are usu-
ally fine as long as they’re not fried.
The potluck dinner
We love the idea of potluck dinners because you know you can find at least 
one food you can eat safely — the dish you bring! In addition to bringing a 
safe dish, have a safe snack beforehand at home and, as always, have your 
survival kit with you. Make sure to make plenty of your dish; you need to be 
able to get some even if it’s the hit of the party (and if you use one of the reci-
pes in this book, it very well may be).
If you’re having a potluck lunch at work, offer to organize the menu and add 
a couple of safe side dishes to the sign-up sheet like steamed rice and baked 
yams.
 
At your next potluck, suggest that everyone bring copies of the written recipe 
for their dishes for everyone at the party. That way, you can read the ingredi-
ents and determine what’s safe fare for you. It’s also a great way to collect rec-
ipes. Or if this book is your book club’s selection this month, meet somewhere 
with a big kitchen and have a cooking party where everyone gets to take home 
a few meals for the freezer.

 Chapter 14: Eating On the Go
Venturing Further Afield: 
Eating On the Road
Whether you’re taking a day trip or a long holiday, you have to do your 
homework before you leave. The following list provides tips for keeping your 
tummy happy while you travel.
 
✓ Make sure everyone’s on the same page. If they don’t know already, let 
your travelling companions know that you have special considerations 
to keep in mind when travelling. If you’re visiting family or friends, send 
them an e-mail with your safe food list and let them know that you’ll be 
bringing some food with you and doing some of your own grocery shop-
ping after you get there and may need to do some of your own cooking.
 
✓ Scope out your destinations for grocery stores and health food stores 
that carry the foods you need. You want to stock up on soluble-fiber 
staples after you reach your destination. If you’re headed somewhere 
that may not have the ingredients you need, take them with you. For 
example, coconut flour may be hard to get in the middle of nowhere, so 
if you anticipate needing it, pack some up in a heavy-duty zipper bag 
that can withstand travel.
 
✓ Prepack food in to-go portions. You can easily find snack-sized plastic 
bags and containers so that you always have munchies on hand regard-
less of your vacation activities. (See “Keeping a portable snack pack on 
hand” for snack suggestions.)
 
 For quick, safe on-the-go meals, throw a cooked chicken leg into a baggie 
and head out. It comes with its own stick, and you can hold it with the 
baggie to keep your fingers clean. Other protein sources you can easily 
store in baggies are thick slices of meat (so they don’t fall apart), lamb 
or pork chops, and even a chicken breast. Just be sure to keep them 
cold if you’re going to be out for a while before eating them. Freezing 
them beforehand and popping them in your bag before you leave will 
keep them cool for a few hours. By the time you’re ready to eat, your 
food will be thawed.
 
✓ Make the best of rest stop offerings. Nothing is worse than being on a 
long drive without a prepacked meal and knowing that the convenient 
restaurants at the travel plazas are fast-food nightmares. That’s why we 
encourage you to take food with you when you travel. If you stop to use 
the restroom and want to grab a cool drink, remember that the safest 
thing to buy is water. And you can put a drop of peppermint essential oil 
in the water to soothe your travel worn intestines.

244
Part III: Simple Solutions for Specific Situations 
 
✓ Stick to your routine as much as possible. Try to stay on schedule 
with your meals and bathroom breaks. If you see a rest stop, use it. 
This strategy will ease your mind and stomach in the long run. If you 
know that your bowels typically like to empty themselves three times 
before you leave the house in the morning, make sure you honor this 
when you’re on the road. You may get up earlier than your travelling 
companions (the same as you do at home) to relieve yourself. If you take 
off after only two bowel movements, you may set up a problem later. If 
you’re traveling with IBS-C, visiting rest stops along the way gives you a 
chance to stretch your legs, and maybe your colon will get the message!
 
✓ Take charge of your own meals. Although it may be more work, you 
can be assured you have the right meals if you make them yourself. 
Your host may appreciate the help, and you’ll know exactly what you’re 
eating. However, keep in mind that some folks are pretty territorial 
about their kitchens; be sure to verify with your host in advance that it’s 
okay for you to do your own cooking.

likely to be healthier, get fewer colds and flus, and 
take fewer antibiotics. And finding the right foods 
can play a major role in helping kids with IBS feel 
normal. You can even tell your kids, and it won’t 
be a lie, that they will be healthier and miss less school if they eat an IBS diet. 
Wait, maybe you shouldn’t say the part about school.
Figuring Out Your Kid’s Trigger Foods
Your IBS-D child may already be aware that sometimes she has an urgent, 
painful, explosive need to go to the bathroom and may have even had an 
embarrassing accident or two along the way. An IBS-C child may recognize his 
symptoms (the pain and bloated feeling in his stomach) but not their cause. 
If you haven’t connected your child’s symptoms to the foods he or she eats, 
chances are the kid isn’t going to make the connection either. Regardless of 
IBS variety, children need to understand that paying attention to food choices 
can lead to more comfort in their bodies and doesn’t have to be a chore.

Part III: Simple Solutions for Specific Situations 
Finding fiber that satisfies 
your tot’s tastes
We address soluble fiber in several of the chapters in Part II, but the soluble 
foods children favor may be different from adult choices. Applesauce, apri-
cots, bananas, peaches, papayas, carrots, potatoes, squash, zucchini, oat-
meal, rice, miracle noodles, and non-gluten pasta are some examples of safe 
soluble foods for kids.
Suspecting food sensitivities
In Chapter 2, we tell you about the food diary that helps adults monitor 
what they eat and the physical and emotional symptoms that may go along 
with their favorite foods. You can use the same technique to help determine 
which foods trigger your child’s IBS symptoms. Quietly pay attention to how 
your child seems to feel or behave after eating a meal or a snack. The goal is 
to notice any patterns he has around normal mealtimes and snack times or 
after holidays and parties. Track your observations in a notebook. How many 
times a day did he visit the bathroom? Was he grouchy or complaining of 
pain? Was he demanding or indulging in more of a specific food (such as ice 
cream, cake, or bread)?
 
We encourage you to be subtle about recording his eating habits — no need to 
tell him you’re watching every piece of food that he puts into his mouth!
A weekend is a great time to start your detective work because your child 
isn’t away at school for several hours during the day and you likely have 
more time free to observe him.
If you prepare food for your kid, just carry on with your typical menu. 
Remember, you want to notice what is in his current diet that may be causing 
IBS symptoms (and we suspect that if your kid has an IBS reaction to certain 
foods, you’ll start making that connection very quickly). At this stage, you’re 
just observing and making notes.
After a few weeks of being a private detective, do a simple experiment. Pick 
a weekend when your child will be having all his meals at home. Plan your 
menu for the weekend and leave out one or two foods that your research 
suggests may be the IBS culprits. You may want to start with dairy and/or 
wheat, which are often in the top two. Instead of the typical milk-on-cereal 
breakfast and cheese sandwich at lunch, plan ahead for alternatives; you can 
check out the recipes later in this chapter or the information in Chapter 3 for 
ideas. Remember, you’re just avoiding one or two things for a couple of days. 
Make notes about any changes (or lack thereof) you observe in your child’s 

247
 Chapter 15: Making Mealtime Easier for Kids with IBS
symptoms. If you see no perceivable improvements, experiment with two dif-
ferent foods on another weekend. But if you feel ready to introduce your kid 
to the avoidance and challenge experiment, read on.
Challenging foods to find the culprits
We talk about doing avoidance and challenge testing of certain foods in 
Chapter 2. We acknowledge that it can be a tough experiment, even for 
adults. After all, who wants to give up favorite foods? It can be even harder 
with kids because their trigger foods are often the ones they love most and 
will fight you tooth and nail for. When a kid craves a food, it can be like an 
addiction, and she won’t give it up easily.
So if you want to encourage your child to do the challenge, be ready with 
your sales pitch. One idea is to wait until she complains about spending too 
much time in the bathroom or being uncomfortable from pain and bloating. 
If you’ve been monitoring her food habits and reactions (see the preceding 
section), present some of your detective work in a way that doesn’t make her 
feel like you’ve been stalking her! Mention that you noticed her running to the 
bathroom after the pizza and movie night and that you’ve read that the ingre-
dients in pizza can have that effect on some people. Then ask her whether 
she wants to do an experiment to see what foods her body does and doesn’t 
like. Have her pick a Saturday when she can eat as much junk food as she 
likes and explain that you want her to avoid sugar, wheat, and dairy for six 
days leading up to that splurge day. During this time, you both will note how 
she feels emotionally and physically and keep track of her bowel movements.
 
We highly recommend that you do the experiment together and invite any 
other family members to participate. The more family members who partici-
pate in this experiment, the better. Not only does full participation make food 
preparation easier, but even those without IBS also feel some benefit from the 
exercise. In our experience, anyone who does the avoidance and challenge 
test comes away with a greater insight into how food affects their mind and 
body. The stomach ache after eating ice cream gets explained, as do the ongo-
ing sugar cravings that can follow. It’s a great opportunity to explore family 
health and support the kid who has IBS trouble.
Your child may be miserable for a few days while going through junk food 
withdrawal, but by Saturday she just may be healthier and happier than 
you’ve seen her in a long time. Make sure you check in with her during those 
six days to see how she’s feeling and how her relationship has been with the 
bathroom. If you’re participating yourself, you can compare notes.
When Saturday rolls around, let her eat all the pizza, soda, ice cream, sugar-
coated cereal, and sweets she can stomach. The aftermath of such a day 

248
Part III: Simple Solutions for Specific Situations 
may be filled with stomachache, headache, irritability, gas, bloating, lethargy, 
diarrhea, or constipation. Have her write down how she feels after indulging 
in these foods. If it’s in her own handwriting that she made seven bathroom 
trips after eating pizza and ice cream, she may be more likely to believe it two 
months down the line when she is tempted by pizza. The experiment should 
give you and your child some great insight into the part food plays in her health 
picture. In our experience, kids become very conscientious about avoiding 
foods that are making them feel that bad. Now, it’s your job to keep the kitchen 
stocked with foods they can eat, and we’re here to help you with that chore.
 
You may have to conduct the challenge adventure a few times a year to 
remind your child of the connection between food and her symptoms. The 
body remembers how to react to trigger foods, but cravings for treats have a 
short attention span.
Keeping a kid’s food diary to connect 
symptoms and triggers
When your child isn’t doing avoidance and challenge testing (which we dis-
cuss in the preceding section), keeping a food diary (like the adult version in 
Chapter 2) can help him make a connection between food and his physical 
and emotional symptoms. Depending on age, your child can keep a paper 
diary, an electronic one on his computer or cellphone, or put all the facts on 
a big chalkboard. Younger children can use happy faces, neutral faces, or 
sad faces to illustrate how they feel after eating various foods. You can even 
make a game out of collecting happy faces in your child’s food diary; he feels 
like he’s winning at something, and you know he really is winning because 
he’s eating more safe food.
 
Keep in mind that younger kids may not be able to make the connection 
between food and symptoms, even with a food diary. You may have to explain 
that what your child eats may be what’s affecting his body.
If your child is older, she’s more likely to make those connections, so encour-
age her to do so. If she notes in her diary that she was terrified her guts 
would explode at the birthday party, help her to reason that this reaction 
happened after eating the birthday cake.
Helping Your Kid (And the Family) 
Cope Emotionally with IBS
Being diagnosed with something like IBS is stressful for your child and for the 
family. Kids especially take their cues from you on how upset they should be 

249
 Chapter 15: Making Mealtime Easier for Kids with IBS
about this condition. The more you highlight your child’s IBS, the more he 
feels like it makes him stick out. The more worried you are, the more likely he 
is to think he has a serious illness.
Your job as a parent is to keep life as normal as possible. Downplay the fact 
that your child is different or sick as much as possible. You have to acknowl-
edge the fact that he has symptoms and do whatever you can to help give 
him relief, but that doesn’t mean it needs to be a production. Be conscious of 
labeling him as sensitive, different, and so on, because those labels can hurt 
(and stick). And make sure you respect your child’s privacy; for example, 
don’t talk about his bowel movement in front of his friends or siblings.
That said, don’t pay so little attention to your child’s IBS that he feels alone. 
Try to keep chatting with your IBS child. If he doesn’t feel like you under-
stand, he may close up and avoid talking about his bathroom experiences 
and symptoms, feeling like he has to deal with them on his own. 
 
Remember that one child’s IBS affects other kids in the family as well. 
Suddenly, brother is getting more attention and special food treatment, which 
if left unchecked may lead to resentment (especially if the non-IBSers feel like 
they’re having to throw out their cheese puffs to accommodate the IBS kid’s 
new restrictions). Make sure everyone is getting attention, information about 
the new changes, and healthy snacks, and check out the following section for 
more on keeping everybody feeling well fed.
Creating As Little Headache 
As Possible in the Kitchen
 
One of the most important steps to take when you have an IBS sufferer in 
the house is to make sure that your kitchen is stocked with IBS-friendly food. 
Everyone has seen (or been) the kid who stands in front of the full fridge — 
door wide open — and proclaims that there is nothing to eat. Multiply that 
with the feelings of deprivation that come when a kid’s favorite foods are 
deemed unsafe, and you can understand why loading your kitchen with fabu-
lous IBS-safe foods and keeping the unsafe foods out of sight is crucial for 
making your child’s IBS journey a little easier. We show you how to create an 
IBS-friendly kitchen in Chapter 4.
 
Have several types of IBS-safe snacks available to encourage your kid to eat dif-
ferent things each day. Munching on the same thing day after day can lead to 
food sensitivities, and providing lots of options helps your IBS child feel less 
restricted — like she’s making a choice rather than not having any choices.
We already hear you say that making special food for your kid with IBS seems 
like a lot of extra work, but we encourage you to have a look at the recipes 

250
Part III: Simple Solutions for Specific Situations 
and tips in this book and consider introducing some new IBS-friendly dishes 
in the whole family’s diet.
 
While the family is transitioning into this new way with food, have everyone write 
their names on the packages of one or two of their favorite snacks or foods. This 
way, everyone (parents, siblings, and your child with IBS) has foods that nobody 
else will touch. And because kids can be territorial, bogarting their own snacks 
may actually take their minds off the fact that those snacks are different.
What about siblings who don’t have IBS challenges? They’re going to insist 
on eating their favorite foods no matter what. We suggest some creative 
healthy snack swapping (such as fruit leather for a chocolate bar; Carolyn’s 
Chocolate Banana Cream Pudding (see Chapter 13) instead of chocolate ice 
cream, and apple chips for potato chips). Chapter 7 is full of snacks that the 
whole family can enjoy and Chapter 13 has safe desserts to snack on. Great 
snacks show siblings that the fact that one person has IBS isn’t going to force 
them to gag down inedible food!
Involving Kids in Shopping
Letting your little IBS sufferer help you shop for his foods is a great way to 
help him feel like he has choices in spite of his restrictions. Work together to 
come up with safe snack and meal favorites.
 
Before heading to the market, make sure your child has had a satisfying snack 
or meal to diminish his cravings for unfriendly foods. All shoppers know that 
shopping hungry tends to make people want to grab everything in sight. We 
suggest putting aside time to make the first shopping excursion a fun and thor-
ough one. Leave the rest of the family at home for this one so you can both 
focus your attention on finding foods that fit.
At the store, give your kid as much control as possible when choosing IBS-
friendly foods. Teach him how to read nutrition labels; a great rule of thumb 
is that if you can’t pronounce the ingredient, you should keep it off the IBS-
friendly list. See how quickly he can identify the sugar, wheat, and dairy on 
the labels, because he’s most likely avoiding these ingredients. You may want 
to do some detective work beforehand and have a list of IBS-friendly prod-
ucts to direct him towards.
Making IBS-Friendly Foods for Your Kids
If your kid is like most kids, her favorite foods are probably French fries, hot 
dogs, milk, PB&J, and sugar-coated cereals. We’ve tried to include recipes in this 
section that are safe substitutes (though not necessarily exact replacements) 

251
 Chapter 15: Making Mealtime Easier for Kids with IBS
for these standbys, and you can also adapt any of the recipes in this book for 
your child.
Breakfasting for kids
What do kids usually eat for breakfast before they go off to a stressful or 
exciting day at school? You may already be curbing the morning ritual of 
acidic orange juice and milk-drenched, sugar-coated wheat cereal, but a lot of 
the available alternatives aren’t much friendlier. This section gives you reci-
pes to replace your kid’s trigger-loaded breakfast with friendlier fare. Check 
out Chapter 6 for more breakfast recipes.
 
Beef in a Pillow
We were inspired to create Beef in a Pillow using two kid-friendly and IBS-friendly foods: 
eggs and beef. Neither ingredient has the insoluble fiber that can irritate your gut, but 
both do have some fat. Be sure to drain the cooked beef well as the recipe calls for to 
help keep some of that fat out of your system. The egg fat comes in the yolk; if you’re 
concerned about the fat irritating the intestines, you can substitute two egg whites for 
one egg, although the yolk is the most nutritious part of the egg. 
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 10 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
2 tablespoons coconut oil
1⁄4 pound free-range lean ground beef
4 eggs
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
 1 Heat a medium skillet over medium heat and add 1 tablespoon of the coconut oil. Add 
the ground beef, cooking thoroughly while breaking it up into small chunks. Remove 
from the skillet and sit on paper towels to drain off the beef fat.
 2 Beat the eggs and salt in a bowl.
 3 In a clean, hot pan, heat the rest of the coconut oil and add the eggs. As the eggs begin 
to set (about 3 minutes), sprinkle the cooked beef into the center of the omelet. Flip the 
omelet in half, slide it halfway down the pan, and flip it over for another minute of cooking.
 4 Remove the pan from the heat and cover for a few minutes so the center of the omelet 
finishes cooking. Cut into four servings and serve.

T Eggs in a Basket
This recipe is basically poached eggs on bread, but Eggs in a Basket makes it sound a 
little more fun. Eggs are a safe food for IBS; add them to an IBS-safe bread (such as the 
homemade sourdough in Chapter 12), and you have a winning combination. You can 
toast or not toast the bread depending on your child’s preference.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 5 minutes
Yield: 2 servings
2 eggs
2 slices of sourdough bread (store-bought, or 
see the recipe in Chapter 12)
2 teaspoons butter or ghee (see the recipe in 
Chapter 6)
Dash of paprika (optional)
 1 Put 3 to 4 inches of water in a deep skillet (with a lid) and place on high heat. Crack 
each egg into a separate small cup; when the water in the skillet boils, gently slip the 
egg into the water and cover immediately.
 2 Turn off the heat and cook until the eggs are just slightly runny, about 3 minutes. While 
the eggs are cooking, toast the bread (if desired), spread butter or ghee on each piece, 
and then cut a hole in the center of each piece. After the eggs are done, use a slotted 
spoon to put each egg in the hole of one piece of bread. Garnish with a dash of paprika 
(if desired).

T Sheila’s Tea Biscuits
This recipe contributed by Sheila to www.pecanbread.com for tea biscuits gives kids 
a safe biscuit option that also includes that childhood standby, peanut butter. These 
biscuits are safe for colitis and Crohn’s disease, so they’re safe for kids with IBS. We 
recommend Organic Maranatha Peanut Butter because the nuts are grown in a dry 
climate and not exposed to the dampness that can cause mold to grow on peanut crops 
in wet climates.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 15 minutes
Yield: 7 servings (14 biscuits total)

 Chapter 15: Making Mealtime Easier for Kids with IBS
 1 Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Mix the almond flour and peanut butter well and set aside.
 2 Beat the eggs and then mix in the yogurt or water, salt, honey (if desired) and baking 
soda. Add the egg mixture to the flour mixture and beat until it firms up.
 3 Roll heaping tablespoons between barely wet hands, keeping a bowl of water nearby to 
rewet your hands as necessary. Place biscuits on a buttered baking sheet and flatten to 
about 3⁄4 inch in height. Bake for approximately 15 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool 
and enjoy.
Vary It! Add about 1⁄2 cup of raisins after all other ingredients are mixed well.
Tip: Enjoy with butter and homemade strawberry jam.

Munching lunches for little munchkins
Brown-bagging kids’ lunches can be a challenge regardless of age because of 
their food restrictions and the added limitations of getting foods to school 
or day care. In this section, we give you some lunch alternatives that won’t 
tempt your kids to go for the mystery meat.
Nuts are being regulated out of school lunches, so peanut butter sandwiches 
and snacks will soon be a thing of the past. What’s left for snacks, you ask? 
Shannon Leone, author of The Healthy Lunch Box (available at www.rawmom.
com/HealthyLunchbox), offers these suggestions from an article she wrote 
for www.naturallysavy.com:
 
✓ Loads of fresh fruits and berries
 
✓ Freshly ground sesame seeds mixed with a bit of honey
 
✓ Manna bread (sprouted grain breads)
 
✓ Rice and sushi loaded with veggie strips
 
✓ Vegetable crudités
 
✓ A cool pack with a smoothie
 
✓ Bean salads (made with chick peas, sprouted lentils, and so on)
21⁄3 cups almond flour
1⁄2 cup creamy peanut butter
3 eggs
1⁄4 cup plain yogurt (or water)
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon honey (optional)

Black ‘n’ White Chicken Nuggets
This great kids’ recipe, which is featured in the color section, comes from Colleen 
Robinson at www.crimsondoorhealing.com. It gives them the chicken nuggets they 
love minus the wheat batter, additives, and deep frying that can upset their tummies. 
They can even help make it! The sesame seeds do have some insoluble fiber, but you 
can grind them down in a food processor to make them more IBS-friendly.
Tools: Parchment paper (optional)
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 20 to 25 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1⁄2 cup black sesame seeds
1⁄2 cup white sesame seeds
1⁄4 cup honey
2 egg whites, beaten
1 tablespoon tamari or low-sodium soy sauce
1 teaspoon water
1⁄4 teaspoon each salt and pepper
4 boneless, skinless 6-ounce chicken breasts, 
cut into nugget-sized chunks
2 teaspoons olive oil
 1 Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Put half of the black sesame seeds in a large plastic 
zipper bag and repeat with a separate bag for the white sesame seeds.
 2 In a medium bowl, whisk or fork-beat the honey, egg whites, tamari or soy sauce, water, 
salt, and pepper. Add the chicken and stir with a slotted spoon until all the chicken 
pieces are evenly coated. Remove the chicken with the slotted spoon, allowing the 
extra liquid to drip off the chicken.
 3 Put half the chicken in the black sesame seed bag and the other half in the white 
sesame seed bag. Seal the bags and shake, shake, shake until the chicken is all coated in 
seeds, adding more seeds if you need to.
 4 Cover two cookie sheets with a very thin coating of olive oil or parchment paper. Using 
a clean slotted spoon, take the chicken chunks out of the bags and put them on the 
cookie sheets, making sure the chunks don’t touch each other to ensure faster cooking. 
Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until a chunk cut open has no pink in the center. 
Tip: Honey makes a tasty dipping sauce if it’s on your safe list.

Pita Pizza
Kids long for pizza, a classic treat, reward, and party food. Here’s a recipe from Colleen 
Robinson (www.crimsondoorhealing.com) that puts pizza control in the hands of 
your children. These basic instructions are for 1 serving, but you can easily multiply by 
adding an extra pita per person.
This dish, which is featured in the color section, is as IBS-friendly as you make it 
because pretty much all of the ingredients are optional; leave off any trigger ingredients 
to avoid reactions. You can use either the tomato sauce or soy cream cheese (or both, 
if that’s what floats your boat) as your topping base, and add the toppings here or any-
thing else you have in your fridge. (Try chopped broccoli.) If you can handle cheese, 
choose an SCD variety such as brick cheese, white cheddar, or Colby.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 15 minutes
Yield: 1 serving
1 piece of non-wheat pita bread
1 tablespoon tomato sauce 
4 medium mushrooms, sliced
1⁄4 cup SCD-safe medium cheddar cheese
1⁄8 teaspoon each dried basil and dried 
oregano
 1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees (for a softer crust) or turn on the broiler (for a crispier 
crust). 
 2 Spread the pita with a small amount of tomato sauce. Sprinkle on the mushrooms, a bit 
of cheese as a highlight rather than a blanket, and the dried basil and oregano. Put the 
pizza on a cookie sheet and bake or broil until the mushrooms are a little wilted and 
any cheese is melted/browned to your liking.
Vary It! You can use soy cream cheese in place of the tomato paste, and feel free to add 
whatever cheese and toppings you prefer from your safe foods list.
Tip: Kids enjoy cleaning spinach and other leafy greens when they get to put the greens in 
a towel and whirl it around their heads to dry them.

Colorful Kids Pasta Salad
You cook the pasta — the kiddies put the salad together. Everybody wins. This family-
friendly favorite comes from Colleen Robinson (www.crimsondoorhealing.com) and 
lets everybody get involved with their dinner. Use gluten-free, Orgran Rice & Corn 
Vegetable Pasta, which comes in multicolored animal shapes. You can also use gluten-
free Tinkyada Organic Brown Rice Pasta, but then you have to change the name to Kids 
Pasta Salad — just as tasty, but less fun. Peas are high in soluble fiber and make this 
dish very IBS-friendly.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 10 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
One 8.8-ounce package dried pasta, cooked 
and drained
1 cup frozen peas, thawed under running water
One 12-ounce can of tuna packed in water, 
drained
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1⁄2 tablespoon olive oil
¼ teaspoon each salt and pepper, or to taste
 1 Place the cooked pasta in a big bowl; have the kid(s) add in the peas and tuna and stir.
 2 Put the lemon juice and olive oil in a small jar and let the kid(s) shake it and pour it 
over the pasta mixture. Add salt and pepper to taste.

Dining in
Certain dishes are just plain kid-friendly. Fish sticks and macaroni and cheese 
are a couple of kid cravings you may have to watch out for with IBS tots. So 
our healing chef Colleen Robinson has adapted these faves to enhance their 
friendliness. After your IBS kid knows that he can still eat “normally,” the 
impact of IBS on his diet may lessen a little.

Fried-Free Fish for Four
Colleen Robinson (www.crimsondoorhealing.com) presents this simple-to-make, 
kid-friendly recipe. To increase its IBS-friendliness, use breadcrumbs from homemade 
sourdough bread (see Chapter 12 for the recipe).
For those of you who are scared of baking fish, tilapia is your friend. It’s a firm, user-
friendly fish that holds its moisture well and doesn’t easily fall apart, dry out, or get 
mushy or mealy. You can also use whatever fish looks good at the store — salmon, 
tuna, and cod are other good options.
Tools: Parchment paper
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
Four 8-ounce tilapia fillets
1 egg white, beaten
1⁄2 to 1 cup dry breadcrumbs or panko 
breadcrumbs (see Chapter 11 for the recipe)
1 teaspoon dried parsley
1⁄2 teaspoon dried sage or basil
 1 Rinse the fish under cold running water and pat dry with a paper towel. Preheat the 
oven to 350 degrees.
 2 In a bowl big enough to fit the fish pieces in, combine the breadcrumbs or panko and 
the herbs. Dip the fish into the egg white and then into bread crumbs, turning to coat. 
Place the coated fish on a cookie sheet covered with parchment paper and sprayed 
with a cooking spray.
 3 Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until the outside is a dark golden brown and the inside 
flakes when you stick a fork into it, turning after about 10 minutes so both sides get 
crispy.
Vary It! For even more kid points, cut the fish into 4-inch fish sticks before coating in the 
egg and breadcrumbs. Bake for 15 minutes because the smaller portions cook faster — and 
get to the table faster.
Tip: Serve with Oven Baked Yam (or Potato) UnFries (see the recipe in Chapter 7).

T Happy Mac ‘n’ Cheese
Colleen Robinson (www.crimsondoorhealing.com) knows kids (and, heck, adults) 
love macaroni and cheese, so she gave us this IBS-friendly version of the classic com-
fort food. This dish is far less likely to trigger your tyke’s IBS than the boxed stuff or the 
lactose-heavy, fat-laden traditional version.
If all cheese is a trigger for you, skip this recipe, but otherwise the cheese options here 
are generally well-tolerated, naturally low in lactose, and approved for the SCD. SCD-
legal cheeses include cheddar, Colby, Swiss, Havarti, and an occasional bit of Asiago; 
Colleen likes a combo of 4 ounces of cheddar, 3 ounces of brick cheese or Colby, and 
1 ounce of Asiago, but you can mix it up depending on your child’s preferences and 
trigger foods. If your kid has wheat problems, you can leave off the breadcrumbs or try 
spelt or rye breadcrumbs.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 30 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
8 ounces dry short rice or wheat pasta (such 
as elbow macaroni, penne, shells, or fusilli)
1⁄2 tablespoon butter
11⁄2 tablespoons flour
1 teaspoon powdered mustard
21⁄2 cups plain soymilk
1 teaspoon paprika
8 ounces grated cheddar cheese
1 teaspoon dry parsley, or 1 tablespoon fresh
1⁄2 cup breadcrumbs or panko crumbs (see the 
recipe in Chapter 11) (optional)
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
 1 Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook the pasta according to package directions, 
subtracting 1 minute from the cooking time to allow for oven time later. Drain and rinse 
with cold water to stop the pasta from cooking.
 2 Turn the broiler on and place the oven rack about 1⁄3 of the way from the top.
 3 In a large pot, melt 1⁄2 tablespoon of butter over medium heat. Sprinkle in the flour and 
powdered mustard and whisk or fork-mix for about a minute to cook the flour so it doesn’t 
taste pasty in the sauce. Stir in the soymilk slowly in a gentle pour, whisking like mad so 
the flour mixture distributes evenly and doesn’t get lumpy. Add 1⁄2 teaspoon of the paprika.
 4 Crank the heat up to high to bring the sauce mixture to a boil and then lower the heat to 
low until the sauce is barely bubbling. Simmer to thicken (3 to 5 minutes), stirring a lot.
 5 Sprinkle in the cheese by handfuls, stirring as you add each handful, until it melts and 
the sauce is smooth and gooey. Add the cooked pasta and turn the heat to medium-low, 
stirring for a couple of minutes to heat the pasta and make sure it’s well coated.
 6 Pour the cheesy pasta into an 8- or 9-inch baking dish sprayed with cooking spray. Sprinkle 
the breadcrumbs over the top (if desired) and then the remaining paprika and the parsley.
 7 Place the pan under the hot broiler and broil until the crumbs are golden brown or the 
pasta is toasty-brown, keeping the oven door cracked so the dish doesn’t overheat. 
Remove it from the oven and let it sit for about 5 minutes to allow everything to set nicely.

Tip: Rice pasta is a great option here. Christine recommends Tinkyada Organic Brown Rice 
Pasta, which comes in many shapes and sizes.
Tip: Try miracle noodles if your child doesn’t seem to be able to digest grains. Miracle noo-
dles are a soluble fiber product.

T Smashed Potatoes with Rosemary
Chef Victoria Amory (www.victoriaamory.com) contributed this recipe that’s a bit like 
making mud pies (or at least, you can tell the kids it is), and they’re like potato pancakes 
when they’re done! Little ones love to do the smashing part of the job, which is essential for 
exposing as much potato as possible to the high heat, resulting in a super crisp shell encas-
ing creamy potatoes. When the potatoes are soft, use a meat mallet, the back of a spoon, or 
even your fist to smash or press the potatoes into patties (just watch the heat if you’re 
going the hand route — the taters did just come off the stove). A drizzle of olive oil, a sprin-
kle of sea salt, and a pinch of rosemary is all it takes to elevate them to dinner party status.
Tools: Parchment paper
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 35 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
2 pounds white, red, or purple baby potatoes
2 sprigs fresh rosemary, needles stripped and 
chopped
2 cloves garlic, peeled and chopped
6 tablespoons olive oil
1⁄8 teaspoon each salt and pepper
 1 Heat the oven to 350 degrees. In a stock pot filled with salted water, boil the potatoes 
for about 15 minutes until a fork can be inserted into one with slight resistance.
 2 In a bowl, combine the rosemary, garlic, olive oil, salt, and pepper. Using a slotted 
spoon, transfer the potatoes to a cutting board and invite kids to smash them with the 
back of a large spoon to form a disk. An inch in thickness is good to shoot for, but your 
kids may not be into symmetry. 
 3 Place the disks on a rimmed cookie sheet lined with parchment paper and brush the fla-
vored olive oil on top. Roast in the oven until golden and crispy, about 15 to 20 minutes

T Frozen Fruit Pops
This great treat from Colleen Robinson (www.crimsondoorhealing.com) is for kids 
who may be missing the high-sugar frozen treats their friends seem to enjoy. If fresh 
fruit is a trigger food for your child, the skins are likely the problem, and this recipe 
eliminates the skins and the worry. Use whatever fruit you have on hand; mango is a 
favorite of Carolyn’s from her perch in paradise in Maui.
Tools: Popsicle sticks
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Freezing time: 30 minutes to 2 hours
Yield: Five 3-ounce pops
2 cups fresh mango 
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon brown sugar or agave (optional)
1⁄2 cup water
 1 Puree the fruit and lemon juice in a food processor until it’s super-smooth; taste and 
sweeten with the brown sugar or agave if necessary. Pour into small cups or large ice 
cube trays and place them in the freezer until they get slushy (15 to 45 minutes, 
depending on cup size and the temperature of your freezer).
 2 When slushy, insert the popsicle sticks and let them finish freezing, up to 2 hours.
Tip: You can buy plastic frozen popsicle molds with the sticks included and you won’t have 
to wait to put in the sticks.
Vary It! You can use other fresh fruits in place of the mango such as peaches, nectarines, 
apricots, and pears, peeled and cored or pitted.

Don’t desert dessert
It’s a treat to know that your kids can eat and enjoy some safe sweets that 
don’t involve 10 to 27 teaspoons of sugar like some sodas and milkshakes do. 
We include a special kid-friendly dessert here, but they’ll be just as pleased 
to eat any of the desserts from Chapter 13.

Finding Safe Dishes When 
You’re Dining Out
In This Chapter
▶ Working to ensure a successful restaurant outing
▶ Scrutinizing fast food
▶ Knowing what to order at different kinds of restaurants
B
eing cooped up at home and eating the contents of your kitchen may 
be safe for you and your bowels, but continually missing out on Friday-
night dinner with friends can be gut-wrenching. We’re pretty confident that if 
you follow the eating guidelines we give you in this book, you’re going to feel 
more at peace with your gastrointestinal tract (GIT). And when you’ve got a 
handle on what foods feel friendly, you may just find that some of your favor-
ite restaurants are safer than you thought.
 
A big part of eating out is splurging on your favorite treat, but ordering that 
breaded mozzarella stick appetizer and eating it guiltily can send your IBS into 
a frenzy before you can say “Check, please!” So we suggest that you allow the 
experience of eating out to be the treat and save the splurges for a time when 
you know that your body is immune to reaction, or that reaction isn’t going to 
compromise your plans for the rest of the night.
In this chapter, we give you plenty of tips to ensure your restaurant experience 
is a positive one that doesn’t leave you spending dessert in the restroom.
Planning Ahead for an 
Enjoyable Experience
When you’re feeling up to a meal on the town, a bit of planning can make for a 
great time. As you’re healing and dealing with your IBS, we want you to enjoy 
yourself, so the planning tips in this section show you that you have more 

262
Part III: Simple Solutions for Specific Situations 
control in your life and dining experiences than you thought you had. You 
may need some practice to get up the nerve to ask for what you want and 
how you want it in a restaurant, but having the guts to order your sauces on 
the side will have your gut thanking you.
 
Check out the washroom facility beforehand so you encounter no surprises 
if you have an emergency while you’re there. Is it a one-seater that you may 
have to wait for if it’s occupied? Does it look like the kind of place you want 
to spend a significant amount of time in if necessary? Is it equipped with a 
ventilation fan and plenty of toilet paper? Is it situated far enough away from 
a common area so that you won’t be worried about smells and sounds leaking 
out? Knowing your bathroom options ahead of time can help you determine 
how adventurous you’re willing to be.
Eating out when you have IBS-D
You may recognize this common scene: You’re enjoying a birthday party 
with friends at a local restaurant. After a dinner of cheeseburgers and fries, 
the waiter shows up with some sort of chocolate ice cream explosion smoth-
ered in whipped cream and nuts. You can’t say no to the birthday boy’s ice-
cream toast, so you take a spoonful — and then another, and then about 17 
more. You enjoy the festivities for a while until you start to feel the familiar 
rumblings; despite your best attempts to reason with your intestines, you’re 
forced to flee to the restroom while the rest of the party finishes the sundae.
Although simply avoiding the temptation of cheeseburgers and ice cream 
seems like a no-brainer, this story is a classic tale for people with IBS. You get 
lulled into the magic of the party and feel like the stomach gods simply won’t 
let you have an attack. But the stress and excitement of a party can also put 
your body on high alert, actually making you more susceptible to an attack. 
Here are some steps you can take at restaurant shindigs to avoid goading 
your guts into turning on you:
 
✓ Consult your safe food list as a reminder of the reality of your current 
safe food choices. If you haven’t compiled a safe food list yet, we encour-
age you to head to Chapter 2 now to do so. A food list is a great way to 
remind yourself of which foods work for you and which ones you’ve 
already challenged and dismissed from your diet. Because IBS triggers 
vary so widely from person to person, we can’t give you a one-size-fits-all 
crib sheet of foods to avoid, but making your own is entirely worthwhile 
and in fact could be a huge key to staying in the attack-free zone.
 
✓ Pick a restaurant that has a lot of variety on the menu. The more vari-
ety a menu offers, the more likely you are to find something that works 

263
 Chapter 16: Finding Safe Dishes When You’re Dining Out
for you. Plus, many restaurants these days are more conscious of the 
healthy choices their customers are making and have adjusted their 
menus to reflect that. But before you rush off to a drive-through, please 
read “Avoiding Fast Food” later in the chapter for a caveat about the so-
called healthy options some fast food places offer.
 
✓ Review restaurant menus online. This way, you can have some idea 
ahead of time of what food choices seem safer than others. When 
searching for a new restaurant, always be conscious of words like 
creamy, crispy (may mean fried), and rich in the menu descriptions; 
these terms mean to lure in folks craving a decadent treat, but they may 
serve as a trigger warning to you.
 
✓ Call the restaurant ahead of time and ask whether the chef can prepare 
specific ingredients in a safer way for you. For example, many restaurants 
have items like chicken strips that they may be able to grill for you instead 
of breading and frying. Get the chef’s name and her permission to tell the 
waiter that she’s confirmed the kitchen can prepare your dish according 
to your request. Although chain restaurants often have staff trained to deal 
with special requests, we find that smaller family-owned restaurants are 
also often happy to oblige when you make specific requests.
 
✓ Write down what you plan to order and stick to that decision. Don’t 
be tempted by those visions of chicken fries dancing in your head 
when you see what all your friends are ordering. If you have to, close 
your eyes when the waiter wheels the dessert tray to your table. And 
don’t sample from your friends’ plates. Just because you didn’t order it 
doesn’t make it safe!
 
✓ Order takeout to take a practice run with the food. Of course, the con-
ditions and environment are different from a dinner out with friends, but 
at least you can test the food in the safety of your own dining room.
 
✓ Let your companions know what’s up ahead of time. Sure, admitting 
to friends that you have IBS is embarrassing (although IBS affects about 
20 percent of the population, so you may find that someone else in the 
group suffers too). But telling friends upfront that you have some stom-
ach sensitivities and may be making special requests of the kitchen is 
less embarrassing than telling them through the wall of the washroom 
stall in the restaurant.
 
✓ Don’t eat and drive! We’re largely kidding here, but if being the group’s 
driver adds extra stress to your evening, meet your friends at the restau-
rant. That way, if a bathroom emergency comes up, you can make your 
apologies and leave rather than strand everybody else at the table while 
you take care of business.
 
✓ Instead of BYOB, try BYOR (bring your own rice). Having a soluble-fiber 
side on hand can help you diffuse a less-than-ideal restaurant meal. If 

264
Part III: Simple Solutions for Specific Situations 
rice isn’t on the menu of the restaurant you’re visiting, call ahead and 
ask if you can BYOR because you have food sensitivities. Some kitchens 
will even heat it up for you.
 
✓ Learn the art of substituting. As you get into a natural rhythm of eating 
for IBS and get used to your safe food list, you’ll discover uses for food 
that you didn’t think about before. Think about the job you need a food 
to do in your meal. For example, a bun typically holds a hamburger and 
fixings, but if you’re avoiding bread, then you need a substitute. So if 
you’re craving a burger, ask the restaurant to wrap it in romaine lettuce 
(if that’s on your safe food list) rather than a wheat bun. If lettuce isn’t 
on your list, ask for a burger without the bun and transfer it to a thin 
rice cake at your table. If that isn’t appealing, just eat your burger with a 
knife and fork.
Eating out when you have IBS-C
People who have IBS-C aren’t blindsided by the sudden bathroom rush that 
can hit IBS-D sufferers in the middle of the meal. We know eating out with 
IBS-C presents its own challenges because it seems like you simply can’t do 
enough to prepare, so we hope the following tips help you hit the town:
 
✓ Don’t overdo it if you’re having a bout of constipation. We’re not sug-
gesting that you don’t eat at all, but do realize that whatever you eat 
goes into your already-plugged gastrointestinal tract (GIT), so getting 
carried away isn’t going to help your evening.
 
✓ To prepare for an event, be extra vigilant about drinking extra water, 
up your fiber intake, and get lots of exercise. This is the normal advice 
we give for IBS-C, and it may just work well enough for you to enjoy your 
evening.
 
✓ Wear clothing that is loose and comfortable, especially around your 
waist. If you have IBS-C, you likely have a closet full of stretchy pants 
that don’t restrict your stomach. But make sure you have a couple of 
comfortable and flattering outfits that you can wear when socializing. 
The “I have nothing to wear syndrome” feels even worse when your tight 
pants are a painful reminder of your days without relief.
 
✓ Keep soothing tea with you. If you feel discomfort during your meal 
and you’ve found the tea that soothes your stomach, always keep 
several bags on hand. Ask your server for a pot of hot water, and they 
usually oblige. Just pop your teabag into the pot and sip through the 
discomfort.
 
✓ Avoid your trigger foods even if you’re feeling good. As tempting as 
that questionable dish may look, you don’t want to risk setting off your 
IBS on your night out.

 Chapter 16: Finding Safe Dishes When You’re Dining Out
Avoiding Fast Food
The point of fast food restaurants is to feed you quick, tasty food. Although 
fast food places may be modifying their menus to attract people looking 
for healthier meals, they’re doing so within their prefabricated, prepared, 
and quickly cooked format. Any investment they may be making to provide 
healthier options is likely more of a marketing ploy than a health plan.
As an IBS sufferer, you have to see through the hype and consider what con-
stitutes a safe meal for you. As painful a step as it may be, we suggest you 
steer clear of anything with a fast food feel, drive-through access, or mascots. 
If your family insists on a trip to a burger-iffic chain, do your homework first. 
Compare your food list to the lists of ingredients on the Web sites of the 
restaurants in question. Most restaurant chain Web sites have a tab or link 
labeled something like “Nutrition” for this information.
 
You can quickly search a particular Web page for specific words without 
having to slog through everything. In your browser toolbar, just click Edit and 
then choose the Find on this Page option to search that page for ingredients 
that bug you.
At first glance, you can easily find the basic ingredients: a burger patty, 
a bun, and a couple of condiments. But dig a little deeper. What’s in the 
burger? What’s in the bun? How many ingredients are in the condiments, 
sauces, and side dishes?
A basic burger at Joint A says it’s 100 percent beef with salt and pepper 
seasoning. But not all burgers — even different offerings from the same 
restaurant — are created equal. A different burger at the same restaurant 
has a list of 25 ingredients including milk, wheat, soy, MSG (under one of its 
many pseudonyms), and several types of sugar. Certain sauces that go on 
some burgers have about 30 different ingredients, including wheat, different 
forms of sugar, high fructose corn syrup, and a few unpronounceable items 
that sound more like chemicals than food (probably because they are).
 
This advice comes straight from a fast food worker: If you want to be sure 
the restaurant makes your burger plain, tell them you have an allergy. Many 
burgers are already prepared, packaged, and ready to drop in your drive 
through bag; a plain order often means workers just scrape the toppings off 
one of these premade patties.
What about the healthier options like grilled chicken breasts? We were 
shocked to find that a grilled chicken breast at one fast food restaurant 
involved nearly 50 ingredients. And that didn’t include the bun! Many preser-
vatives, sugars, yeasts, and flavorings all go into that grilled chicken breast 
(which may actually be made from chicken rib meat).

266
Part III: Simple Solutions for Specific Situations 
 
Read what’s in the parentheses and brackets beside certain ingredients on 
the ingredient list. These are the sub-ingredients (and sometimes sub-sub-
ingredients) of the main ingredients. Don’t assume you know what seasoning 
is — next to one seasoning, we found 19 different ingredients.
Finding IBS-Friendlier Food 
in Your Favorite Restaurant
Going out to eat doesn’t have to be a source of torture, although we know it 
can be. People with IBS have to have creative solutions to their dining dilem-
mas, so here we share some tried and true tricks of the trade. You may be 
surprised to find you have more options than you thought for dining out 
with IBS. Just remember that in general your basic foods to avoid are those 
that include dairy, wheat, and sugar, and check out the tips for dining out in 
Getting a glimpse into the kitchen
We’ve done a bunch of the detective work for 
you about what may be going on in the kitchen 
of your favorite eateries, and you may be sur-
prised (as we were) to find that lots of res-
taurants take shortcuts that can spell trouble 
for your intestines. Here are some restaurant 
habits to be aware of when dining out:
 ✓ Making items from mixes: Many restau-
rants don’t make everything fresh on site. 
Shocking! Instead, they use mixes for 
sauces, gravies, scrambled eggs, desserts, 
and toppings that can be full of preserva-
tives and other nasties your stomach can’t 
tolerate. Ask your server to ask the chef for 
clarification on what’s in the sauces before 
you order them.
 ✓ Warming frozen food: Christine was pretty 
surprised to get a peek into a kitchen at a 
local diner to find the cook pulling a giant bag 
of breaded chicken strips out of the freezer 
and dumping them in the deep fryer. Ask your 
waiter to find out whether the chef makes 
his own dishes (especially appetizers). 
If you see food on a menu that you’ve also 
seen in the freezer at a big-box store, the 
chances are it’s not handmade and may 
be full of additives and ingredients that you 
can’t tolerate.
 ✓ Adding unexpected extras: Christine is often 
surprised by what the chef puts on the plate 
as a sauce or garnish despite it not being in 
the menu. Her rule of thumb is to ask for any 
sauces or toppings on the side. Asking for 
the condiments on the side gives you control 
of what goes into your mouth! Sometimes 
her dinner companions cringe when she 
asks, but they’ve learned that it’s a better 
alternative to her sending back the whole 
plate when it’s smothered in a béarnaise 
sauce that wasn’t mentioned on the menu.

267
 Chapter 16: Finding Safe Dishes When You’re Dining Out
general in the section “Planning Ahead for an Enjoyable Experience” earlier in 
this chapter.
 
We give you tips for enjoying lots of ethnic cuisines in this section, but French 
cooking is really one to stay away from. It has so many pâtés, cheeses, breads, 
and creamy sauces that we don’t know how to make it safe.
 
If you think your waiter isn’t listening, say you have a serious food allergy so 
the cooks legitimately leave the problem ingredients out instead of just scrap-
ing, say, the mayo off your dish. Or if you’ve arranged to have your chicken 
cooked without being breaded first, feel free to spell it out to your waiter that 
no breadcrumb should come in contact with your chicken. Carolyn has been 
known to mention that a certain food will surely kill her if she eats it. Gets 
their attention every time!
Mastering the meat-and-potatoes 
breakfast
If you find yourself eating the most important meal of the day in a restaurant, 
you may have to dig a little as you search the menu for a safe breakfast. The 
offerings are usually, bacon, fried eggs, cereal, coffee, donuts, and bagels — 
nothing there to get your day off to a good start when you have IBS. But 
if you look a little further on the menu you can order oatmeal without the 
brown sugar, poached or soft boiled eggs without the bacon, and even a 
small steak (grilled, not fried) without the fried hash browns.
Making Mexican work for you
Most Mexican restaurants start you out with chips and salsa; the chips are 
usually corn, which is likely safe, and you may be able to handle mild salsa, 
but pass on the hot salsa and people who challenge you to a chili pepper 
eating contest!
Many dishes come with or actually incorporate tortillas, which are generally 
corn or flour (which means wheat) — make sure you get the corn variety if 
you have wheat sensitivities.
Cheese can be shaky, but ask what type of cheese they use; if it’s on your safe 
food list, it may work for you. Lean portions of chicken, beef, and pork are 
also safe.

268
Part III: Simple Solutions for Specific Situations 
Many Mexican menus have complex dishes that have meat, beans, cheese 
in a wrap covered in sauce and more melted cheese. Such an adventure 
may not work for you, but fajitas are a great alternative. They often consist 
of simply grilled meat and vegetables with tortillas and condiments on the 
side so you can build your own dish. If you don’t want to be tempted by sour 
cream, ask for a safer alternative, such as more guacamole or mild salsa. 
If the flour tortilla doesn’t work for you, ask for romaine or iceberg lettuce 
leaves to stuff with your fajita mixture, or just use a knife and fork instead.
Inviting Italian back to the table
Although you may consider lasagna, garlic bread, and wine comfort food, 
your bowels may not agree. Bread, wheat pasta, and sauces made with 
creams can pose a real hazard to your IBS; you especially want to stay away 
from the stuffed pastas that can be too creamy, cheesy, and dense for your 
sensitive system. Pizza probably isn’t the best choice for you either, although 
you may be able to remove the meat and vegetables and enjoy the crust (if 
you’re not wheat sensitive), sauce, and a safe cheese.
But never fear — you may still be able to find some great, friendly options at 
the local Italian eatery. Veal, chicken, and fish are common in Italian cuisine, 
and many restaurants that are conscious of their customers’ dietary needs 
will happily grill the meat instead of cooking it in a sauce. Most Italian restau-
rants serve risotto, which is a rice dish, so they likely have rice on hand; try 
ordering plain rice with a basic tomato sauce. Or if tomato isn’t on your safe 
list, make it risotto in clear broth.
Also ask about the soup of the day — it’s often made with simple ingredients. 
Salads and side dishes of cooked vegetables like potatoes and broccoli may 
be available plain — always ask for sauces on the side so you can control the 
amounts.
Staying safe with Chinese
A meal of Chinese is exciting because you have lots of choices, but one big 
drawback is that the biggest flavor enhancer in Chinese food is MSG, which is 
often built into the sauces that you order.
 
Pay close attention to what your server says. If you’ve asked him for your food 
to have no MSG, he may repeat back “No added MSG,” which likely means 
you’re still getting some MSG in your sauces, soups, and prepared items like 
egg rolls.

269
 Chapter 16: Finding Safe Dishes When You’re Dining Out
Favorites like egg rolls, spring rolls, and wontons are usually meat and/or 
vegetables wrapped in a flour pastry and deep fried. They’re tasty (that’s 
why they’re favorites), but they may not be the best choice for your IBS. 
Sweet-and-sour pork is breaded, deep fried, and smothered in a sugary sauce, 
which can present all sorts of triggers. And don’t forget that Chinese staple 
soy sauce — it contains wheat and sugar that may set off your symptoms.
Your best dish may be a simple bowl of steamed rice with stir-fried meat, 
chicken, or fish and vegetables. Some Chinese soups can be quite simple; for 
example, egg drop soup is a broth with threads of egg and peas (just make 
sure it doesn’t also include MSG). You may also be able to get some plain rice 
noodles on the side or that you can dip into your soup. Moo shu meals can 
be another good choice because they come with lettuce leaves that you can 
fill with the marinated meat and vegetable mixture.
Treating yourself to Thai
Thai food is one of our very favorites because it’s got lots of mild flavor and 
is generally light, but watch out for some pitfalls. Many appetizers include 
fried items, and they’re big on coconut, peanut sauce, and cooking oils, 
which are in almost all their entrées and may be potentially problematic 
ingredients. Pad Thai, for example, has peanuts plus sesame and canola oils.
Luckily, you can get some much better options. Grilled marinated squid and 
prawns have less fat than fried appetizers. Satay, substituting the peanut 
sauce with fresh lime, is another great choice. Most Thai noodles served 
are made from rice and boiled or steamed, so they should be safe as well. 
Steamed rice is preferable to Thai Fried Rice, which is sautéed in oil.
Tom Yum Gai, is a very light flavorful broth featuring Asian mushrooms and 
lemongrass. Finally, we suggest you take the fresh tropical fruit over the 
deep-fried bananas for dessert — many Thai restaurants offer an exotic selec-
tion including mango, papaya, and pineapple.
Enjoying Japanese food
Yes, we know we told you to avoid sushi because of the safety of raw fish, 
and we stick to that. You can, however, have vegetable sushi, or even sushi 
with cooked fish. The avocado roll and California roll are good choices, but 
avoid the tempura roll or fried salmon skin roll. Most menus list all the ingre-
dients of each roll so you can scan the list for your safe ingredients. Keep a 
safe distance from the wasabi green hot sauce — it may light a fire in your 

270
Part III: Simple Solutions for Specific Situations 
intestines. For a safe sushi dip, look for wheat-free soy sauce in the larger 
restaurants.
Japanese cuisine isn’t all about sushi, though. Rice is a staple of Japanese 
fare, so you can simply order teriyaki beef or chicken with a side of rice. 
Japanese soups can be a very safe IBS choice. Soba (buckwheat) noodle 
soup, egg drop soup, or miso soup are three common offerings that you may 
want to try. Just be sure to ask about MSG if the restaurant uses prepackaged 
soups instead of preparing them fresh.
Surviving steak- and chophouses
You don’t have to give up the steakhouse! They may be more expensive, but 
you can have a well-prepared yet simple grilled steak, fish, or chicken and 
side order of cooked vegetables and call it a great night.
The first items that appear to the table are ice water and the bread basket, 
but if you stay away from both, you should be fine. For most people, ice 
water chills the stomach and may cause cramping. French bread is an accept-
able soluble side, so if you need one and it’s great French bread, go ahead.
 
Don’t be afraid of doggie bags so you can eat lightly and take the rest home 
and enjoy it later. We recommend freezing your leftovers right away and 
eating them a few days later so that you aren’t overloading on certain foods.
 
Be aware of salad bar offerings. Many people have reported IBS reactions after 
having been to a salad bar. Turns out many restaurants with large buffets and 
salad bars use a preservative spray on the vegetables to keep them looking 
fresh and crisp, which is likely what’s causing the problems. Just check with 
the restaurant staff to see whether a particular place uses the spray.

Cook Your Fruits and Vegetables
In the raw state, fruits and veggies are packed with insoluble fiber, which can 
be agitating if you tend towards IBS-D (but you may need it if you have IBS-C). 
If raw fruits and vegetables give you problems, you can cook them to make 
them behave better in your gut.
Cooking breaks down the cell walls of plants, making them less rigid and 
less irritating to your sensitive gut. Some well-tolerated cooked vegetables 
for IBS-D are zucchini, potatoes, and yams. Fruits are a little more forgiving 
than vegetables; raw pineapple, kiwi, papaya, and figs have plant enzymes 
that help your digestion when you eat small amounts. Friendly cooked fruits 
include apples, pears, pumpkin, and plums with the skin removed for IBS-D 
and the skin intact for the extra fiber for IBS-C.

Puree Your Foods
If you favor the flavor of a Raw food diet but can’t handle its digestion, you 
can puree your foods in a high-speed blender. This process breaks down cell 
walls and reduces the load of insoluble fiber, making foods more digestible. 
Many people report that eating puréed food does help them get some nutri-
tion while going through a bad patch of IBS.
 
Pureeing is different from juicing because it keeps some of the fiber from the 
vegetables, whereas juicing removes all the fiber from the vegetable. Head to 
the following section for more on juicing.
Pureeing cooked food may not seem as appetizing because a steak is no 
longer a steak if you don’t have to cut it with a knife, but whizzing it in a food 
processor for a few seconds to break down the meat fibers may help you 
digest it better. Cooked and pureed yams, cauliflower, and carrots are tasty, 
even though they may remind you of baby food.
 
If you do puree your food, make sure that you just eat a teaspoon or so at a 
time and hold the food in your mouth for a few seconds to let your saliva start 
the digestion process.
Juice Your Fruits and Vegetables
If you want to take insoluble fiber completely out of the fruit and veggie equa-
tion, try juicing, which leaves the nourishment but gets rid of all the fiber and 
But you don’t have to take our word for it . . .
We’re not the only people who believe cooked 
food is easier on the stomach. Chinese medi-
cine teaches that raw vegetables take longer 
to digest than cooked ones because the stom-
ach has to warm the food before it can break it 
down. Cold food has to get up to your body tem-
perature (98.6 degrees for the average person) 
to begin digestion, so cooking vegetables can 
be like predigestion, doing some of the work 
that your body may not have the energy to do. 
Quickly boiling or steaming vegetables can start 
the process for you.
Additionally, during the macrobiotic diet boom 
many years ago some people said the brown 
rice, vegetable, and seaweed diet was healing 
for people with cancer because the fact that 
all the food was cooked put less strain on the 
digestion. For more on the macrobiotic lifestyle, 
check out Verne Varona’s Macrobiotics For 
Dummies (Wiley).

 Chapter 17: Ten Tips for Making Foods Friendlier to Your Tummy
especially the insoluble fiber that may set off your intestines. You can turn 
your juice into a healing drink by adding peppermint leaves, ginger, or fennel 
to help support your gastrointestinal system. For some tasty juice options, 
try the recipes in Chapter 8.
Have a Side of Soluble Fiber
Whether you’re eating out or eating in, you can make a questionable main 
dish more IBS-friendly if you have a side of soluble fiber handy. Rice is one 
of your best soluble side choices, especially in a restaurant, and cooked 
or steamed rice is great to keep in your fridge all the time. Applesauce and 
bananas are other good sources of soluble fiber.
 
Keep bananas around in different stages of ripeness. You can treat IBS-D with 
a green banana and IBS-C with a ripe one.
The latest soluble safety net to hit the shelves is chia seeds. Chia absorbs 
twelve times its weight in water and turns into a soluble jelly that can help 
bind up your IBS-D or break through your IBS-C. A teaspoon in your smoothie 
or stirred in water can be a useful remedy before, during, or after your meal. 
Remember to take it with a large glass of water if you have IBS-C and only a 
few ounces of water for IBS-D.
Consider the Fit for Life Strategy
In 1985, Harvey and Marilyn Diamond wrote Fit for Life (Warner Books, Inc.), 
which was based on the premise that you shouldn’t mix certain food groups. 
It suggested that combining foods like protein with foods like fruit causes 
incomplete digestion of both because protein requires more acidic gastric 
juices than fruit does. By paying attention to what foods you eat together, 
you may take some of the pressure off your digestive juices.
Although this program may not be the right way to eat for everyone, we’ve 
seen people have success with it. If nothing else, it may be a way to give your 
digestive system a break from its usual way of dealing with food. Here are 
some of the main Fit for Life rules with some commentary from us:
 
✓ Eat fruits by themselves. Fruit passes through your digestive system 
very quickly and should be allowed to do so without interruption from 
other foods needing more acidic digestive juices. If you eat fruit with 
protein, the meat can hog all the digestive powers you have, leaving 
the fruit to ferment in your belly. Fermenting fruit can open the door to 

276
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
yeast (see Chapter 18) and cause gas and bloating in your gastrointesti-
nal tract (GIT).
 
 You may have trouble digesting fruit because of the fructose whether or 
not you eat it by itself.
 
✓ Eat carbs and proteins separately. Much like fruit, these items can fer-
ment in your stomach because you don’t have enough digestive juices to 
go around.
 
✓ Never drink water with meals. Drinking water with your meals dilutes 
the enzymes and acids that help you to digest your food completely and 
properly. This rule doesn’t apply to drinking liquid soups, or to drink-
ing a teaspoon or two of apple cider vinegar with 4 ounces of water at a 
meal to enhance digestion.
 
✓ Avoid dairy products. The Diamonds believed that we did not digest 
dairy products in general and made them out of bounds. We do agree 
that you should avoid dairy products, with the possible exception of 
some safe cheeses and yogurts that we talk about in Chapters 3 and 6.
Change Up Your Drink Routine
The best way to make your drinks IBS-friendly is to make sure they don’t con-
tain alcohol, caffeine, or carbonation. Caffeine can annoy your colon if you 
have IBS-D; carbonation is gas, and you don’t want more gas in an already 
gassy stomach. Alcohol is a laxative and feeds intestinal organisms; check 
out Chapter 19 for more on why you should avoid these substances.
So what do you drink instead? You can make safe and soothing teas from 
chamomile, peppermint, ginger, and fennel. Brew the tea and leave it to cool 
before keeping it covered in the fridge for a delicious summer treat. Sweeten it 
with stevia, and you have a sweet, friendly, and soothing beverage. We suggest 
taking a bottle of cooled tea with you rather than bottled water if you’re going 
to dinner — a few sips of peppermint tea can soothe your stomach while you’re 
waiting for the food to be served. You can also put one drop of essential oil of 
peppermint in a bottle or jug of water and have a delicious drink in seconds.
Watch Fatty Meats (And Grill, 
Don’t Fry)
Greasy burgers and fried chicken slow down your digestive system for hours 
and cause IBS cramping and abdominal pain. If you eat animal protein, go lean. 

277
 Chapter 17: Ten Tips for Making Foods Friendlier to Your Tummy
If you can, talk to your neighborhood butcher about the cuts of meat that are 
leanest; you can typically get extra-lean ground beef. If chicken is your thing, 
try grilled chicken breast rather than fried chicken wings. (And of course, you 
should be getting free-range, hormone-free meat to avoid the chemicals.)
When grilling, keep the fire to a minimum; burned meat may be kind of tasty, 
but the charcoal is hard to digest. We like the indoor countertop grills that 
drain the fat from your food while you’re cooking. You can grill vegetables 
and meat at the same time and have a full tasty meal while using just one 
appliance. Just don’t be tempted to slather oil on your grill — you don’t need 
to when a quick spritz will do.
Defuse Dairy
If you have difficulty digesting lactose, you can try lactose-free dairy prod-
ucts or lactase enzyme pills that aid in dairy digestion. Check out Chapters 3 
and 6 for both cheese suggestions and yogurt recipes that may be easier on 
your gut. You can also try warming your milk, which makes it more digestible 
than cold milk and less likely to cause constipation, or go for organic milk 
and non-homogenized milk, which are also easier to digest. You may also 
find limiting your dairy portion size helpful; head to the following section for 
more on portion control.
Minimize Serving Size
You may remember a time when you had an enormous Thanksgiving dinner 
and your stomach and intestines felt like a cyclone had hit them. Many 
people who don’t have and have never heard of IBS have had those symp-
toms just because they ate a meal the size of a small car. IBS-friendly foods 
come in small portions; you may even get away with something that you 
don’t think is good for your IBS if you only eat a little bit. A good guideline is 
that your meat serving should be about the size of a deck of cards (and not 
one of those giant novelty decks, either); many single servings by today’s 
standards can easily feed three people.
Think Food Friendly
Monitoring your thoughts is a powerful exercise for people who have IBS. You 
may have a column in your food diary to keep track of what you’re thinking 

278
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
when you’re eating so you can easily see the correlation between your 
thoughts and your IBS symptoms.
We’ve said it before, but we’ll repeat it: When you’re thinking negative 
thoughts as you eat something, you’re associating that thought with the food. 
So when you reach for a food that you’re concerned may be a trigger for your 
IBS, stop for a moment and consider how often thoughts like the following 
take you in a negative direction:
 
✓ I know if I eat this item I’ll pay for it later.
 
✓ I don’t care whether I get a bad reaction from eating this food.
 
✓ I shouldn’t eat this dish.
As you think these thoughts, even without having food around you, can you 
feel how uncomfortable it feels? You may even feel a gripping sensation in 
your stomach or feel it tightening as if you’re holding your breath. But now 
practice thinking positive thoughts about food:
 
✓ This treat is so delicious.
 
✓ This dish is really one of my favorite things to eat.
 
✓ I’m so happy to be eating this snack.
We don’t expect you to believe these new thoughts right away, but we do ask 
you to practice thinking positive or even neutral thoughts while you eat. The 
more you tell your body that what you’re eating is good, the more your body 
believes you. Of course, this exercise doesn’t apply to eating a pint of rocky 
road ice cream after a plate of ribs washed down by a quart of beer. It’s part 
of the comprehensive IBS healing program that you are developing.

Ten Ways to Keep Yeast in Check
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding yeast overgrowth’s symptoms and effects
▶ Getting rid of yeast
▶ Treating other conditions without contributing to a yeast problem
Yeast has been around forever; it’s not some mystery bug just now dis-
covered. The real mystery is why it’s not recognized as a trigger for IBS. 
It lives happily and harmlessly in your gut as tiny little yeast buds playing tag 
with good bacteria and even the occasional parasite. But yeast turns into a 
rampaging monster when the conditions in your gut are right. Trouble can 
start when you take antibiotics that kill all the good bacteria in your gut that 
serve as a barrier to keep yeast in check. If you feed yeast with lots of sugar 
and carbs and nothing to check its growth, it turns into an invading army of 
threads.
How can a thread be dangerous? The problem isn’t a thread — it’s a billion 
threads that together can irritate and even penetrate the gut lining. This pen-
etration causes a recognized medical condition called leaky gut that allows 
the absorption of yeast toxins into the blood stream. You can read more 
about yeast in Chapter 1, but here we give you ten ways to keep yeast under 
wraps so you don’t have to deal with these conditions. They’re not all cook-
ing or eating tips, but together they can help you manage your yeast situation 
and therefore your IBS.
Quickly Identifying a Yeast-Related 
Flare-Up
Answering the following seven fungal questions can give you a heads up on 
what’s causing those gut symptoms that you think are untreatable IBS. If you 
answer yes to two or more bullets, it’s likely yeast, which means it’s treatable 

280
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
and you’re ahead of the game. Several sections later in this chapter help get 
you on the antifungal path.
 
✓ Have you recently taken antibiotics? Whether it’s one dose or dozens 
of doses, the effect of antibiotics is that they kill off intestinal bacteria 
and leave lots of room for yeast to grow. Most people with yeast over-
growth recall that their symptoms started after a long course of these 
killing drugs.
 
✓ Do you crave sugar? Yeast is like the Borg in Star Trek: a mass mind that 
has taken over your body. Whatever it wants, it gets, and what it wants 
is sugar and carbs (foods that may trigger your IBS on their own). The 
number of microorganisms in your intestines is ten times your body cell 
count, so if you have yeast overgrowth, you may be outnumbered and 
outvoted when it comes to ordering that pizza and milkshake. After you 
starve and kill your abnormal yeast population, outside of having hypo-
glycemia or diabetes, you may find you don’t crave sugar anymore. 
 
✓ Do you feel worse on wet, damp days or in moldy places? Addams 
family aside, most people prefer sunny, warm, dry environments, so 
we’re not talking about feeling great when you’re vacationing in Arizona. 
If you find yourself sneezing up a storm on rainy days or in your damp 
basement, one reason may be that mold spores are irritating your nasal 
passages because your nose is already being poked with marauding 
yeast just like your gut. These micropunctures in your nasal passages 
allow molecules of chemicals and allergens to be absorbed, causing you 
to react to mold, dust, pollens, and animal dander, as well as to per-
fumes and cleaning products. Carolyn has had depressed patients and 
clients who’ve seen their depression worsen on damp days. Treating 
their yeast and eliminating mold in their environment turned their 
depression around and took away their rainy-day melancholy.
 
✓ Do you feel you have extremely low energy? When you have yeast 
overgrowth, your energy is low because of all the time your immune 
system has to spend defending against 178 different yeast toxins. Now 
that’s an energy drain! One really potent yeast toxin is acetaldehyde, 
which can damage all the tissues in the body, including the brain. 
Another factor: When yeast is having a party in your gut, it produces 
alcohol in your body. For some folks, it’s enough to make them feel 
drunk and even show up on a breathalyzer test or a blood alcohol read-
ing. It sounds bizarre, but it’s a documented condition called Drunken 
Syndrome in Japan. Maybe that’s why people with yeast problems 
tell us they feel like they have a perpetual hangover. Of course, your 
energy drain may also be affected by the exhaustion that goes along 
with trying to figure out what’s wrong with you and find a doctor who 
actually listens to all your symptoms instead of just diagnosing you with 
depression and handing over a prescription for an antidepressant. How 
depressing is that?

281
 Chapter 18: Ten Ways to Keep Yeast in Check
 
✓ Are you bothered by vaginal burning, itching, or discharge? Not quite 
a game-show question, or even cookbook conversation. Nevertheless, 
yeast ends up in these orifices, too. Most doctors think that yeast is only 
a pesky inflammation, but we know different. It can also be an intestinal 
overgrowth that comes from the intestine and crawls down your rectum 
and anus into the vagina. Yuck! That’s why you can also have rectal itch 
along with vaginal itch.
 
✓ Do you have frequent sinus infections? The Mayo Clinic reported in 
one study several years ago that 97 percent of chronic sinus infections 
were fungal-related. What do doctors use to treat sinus infections? 
Antibiotics! And what causes fungal overgrowth? Antibiotics! It’s a 
vicious cycle that you can break only by understanding the origins of 
yeast overgrowth and treating yeast as an underlying cause.
 
 Any mucus membrane in your body can have yeast overgrowth. Stick 
out your tongue. If it’s coated with white, that can be a dead giveaway 
that you have yeast overgrowth. A yeast infection in your esophagus 
can contribute to heartburn and gas, which sometimes can make such a 
stretching pain around your diaphragm or upper stomach that you think 
you’re having a heart attack.
 
✓ Do you suffer from burning, itching, or tearing of the eyes and ears? 
Carolyn tells her clients that when you have an itchy, tearing eye dis-
charge, you probably have yeast up to your eyeballs and it’s high time 
you did something about it!
 
 Yeast can grow from your sinuses through the Eustachian tube that runs 
from your nose to your ear, causing itchy ears. One of the first cases of 
yeast infection that Carolyn saw in her practice was a 10-month-old boy 
who had been on eight courses of antibiotics for ear discharge found at 
birth. His mother was a nurse, and even though she said the discharge 
smelled yeasty, nobody listened. Finally, she had a swab taken of the dis-
charge; sure enough, it was yeast, and the antibiotics were only making 
the problem worse.
Making Sure Your Doctor Considers 
All Courses of Action
Doctors simply don’t learn about yeast overgrowth in medical school. Most 
either think of yeast problems as either vaginitis (vaginal inflammation) or 
the worst case scenario that it’s infecting your blood and is life threatening 
and only happens in the hospital from IV antibiotics, cancer chemotherapy, 
or AIDS. You may have to suggest the third option: that what you have is an 
overgrowth of yeast in your intestines.

282
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Even if your doctor does understand the intestinal option, he may think the 
treatment is simply a matter of giving you an antifungal drug like Nystatin or 
Diflucan for a week or two. You can use an antifungal, but the best results 
come from a long-term diet, probiotics (supplements that replace good bacte-
ria), and natural antifungals.
Starving Yeast
Like annoying party guests, if you feed yeast, it will come, and if you don’t 
feed it, it will go. Simple. Okay, not exactly simple, but doable. All you have to 
do is begin a very strict anti-yeast diet. For the first few weeks, avoid sugar, 
dairy, gluten grains (rye, wheat, and barley), most fruit, and fermented foods. 
(You may notice that this plan looks an awful lot like the elimination diet for 
determining IBS triggers in Chapter 2.) What’s left? Plenty: dozens of vegeta-
bles, some fruit, gluten-free grains (millet, rice, amaranth, kamut, quinoa, and 
oats), fish, and antibiotic- and hormone-free chicken, turkey, lamb, and beef.
After the second or third week of a yeast-free diet, you should begin to feel 
much better. And we promise that you will feel better enough to make up for 
having endured this diet! But in the meantime, don’t be discouraged if you 
feel worse before you feel better. During the first week, you may feel some 
aggravation of symptoms as the dying yeast floods the system with its toxic 
byproducts. The most common of these die-off symptoms are rashes, head-
ache, shifting bowel movement, and aches and pains.
After several weeks on a strict diet, reintroduce foods, one by one, to get an 
indication of whether you have any reaction to that food. You can also take 
bentonite clay, which we talk about later in this chapter and in Chapter 1, to 
absorb toxins and lessen the die-off that you may otherwise experience.
If you reintroduce a food that your body doesn’t like (and we’re not talking 
taste buds here), you may find that it’s a food allergy or an IBS trigger. Or 
you may just start feeling awful simply because you’ve eaten a sugar or carb 
food that grows yeast in your newly cleaned gut. If your yeast has irritated 
the lining of your gastrointestinal tract, you may also have a leaky gut, which 
means that undigested foods can leak through the injured intestinal wall into 
the blood stream and set up a reaction with the immune system.
Replacing Yeast
Add lactobacillus acidophilus bacteria to your diet in the form of organic yogurt 
without added sugar. Lactobacillus acidophilus is a good bacteria, called a 
probiotic, that helps build up the normal bacteria in the bowel as the yeast are 
killed off and leave vacancies in the intestines and vagina. This bacteria is a 
friendly one that produces lactic acid that poisons yeast and keeps it in check.

283
 Chapter 18: Ten Ways to Keep Yeast in Check
You can also take lactobacillus acidophilus capsules. The criteria for choos-
ing a good lactobacillus acidophilus is one that has 2 to 10 billion live organ-
isms in each capsule; make sure that amount is guaranteed through the 
expiration date. You usually take the capsules on an empty stomach at least 
one hour before or two hours after food. Most people take them before bed 
and allow the lactobacillus acidophilus to populate their bowel overnight.
 
Though we’re happy that the yogurt companies have jumped on the probiotic 
bandwagon, please be aware of the other ingredients in probiotic yogurts, 
specifically sugar. If you’re on mission to purge yeast from your system, eating 
any kind sugary yogurt, probiotic or not, isn’t going to help matters at all — it 
just feeds the yeast.
Killing Yeast in the Gut
You can begin getting yeast under control by eating antifungal foods that are 
natural yeast killers; garlic, onions, coconut milk, and coconut oil are a few of 
the most common ones. You can also add antifungal herbs such as hops and 
Pau d’Arco (also called Lapacho or Taheebo) taken in the form of herbal tea.
A comprehensive treatment for killing yeast and eliminating yeast toxins 
includes psyllium powder, bentonite clay liquid, and liquid caprylic acid 
(caproyl). Put one teaspoon to one tablespoon of each in 2 ounces of water 
in a bottle with a lid. Shake and drink quickly so the psyllium doesn’t turn 
immediately into a gel. Then drink another 8 to 10 ounces of water. Drinking 
extra water is very important; otherwise, psyllium can cause constipation by 
absorbing water from your gut.
Start with one detox shake a day and then, under a naturopath’s supervision, 
increase to two daily. Your doctor will help you decide if you should continue 
the treatment for two or three weeks and how often you repeat it. If you use 
this treatment, make sure to take it one hour before or at least two hours 
after eating or taking supplements. Otherwise, the shake pulls the goodness 
out of your meal or supplement.
Treating Yeast Where It Lies
Yeast problems may start in the intestines, but they can cause aggravation 
in various parts of the body if the yeast spreads. The following list gives you 
some tips for dealing with these secondary yeast sources:
 
✓ Vagina/penis: Vaginal yeast can be treated locally with douches or sup-
positories. You can buy all sorts of drugstore antifungal vaginal creams 
and suppositories over the counter, but they may not work unless you 
also do the yeast-free diet and probiotics.

284
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
 You can use boric acid (found in your local drugstore) in a vaginal 
douche. It comes in powdered form and is also used as an eyewash, so 
it’s considered safe for vaginal use. Add one teaspoon per pint of warm 
water. Boric acid is also conveniently made into suppositories (such as 
Yeast Arrest). Another type of douche can be made with diluted sugar-
free yogurt or by inserting a small tampon soaked in yogurt.
 
 Yeast can form a redness and irritation around the head of the penis. 
You can treat it with vaginal antifungal cream or rinse it with a boric 
acid wash or diluted yogurt. But diet and probiotics are also a must.
 
✓ Sinuses: You can treat yeast in the sinuses with a neti pot. Health food 
or yoga supply stores carry neti pots, items specifically designed with a 
spout that fits into one nostril and allows saline water to flow through 
the sinuses and out the other nostril. Add one drop of tea tree oil for an 
antifungal effect. It will take some practice to master the use of the neti 
pot, but the results are great. If you don’t have access to a health food 
store, you can also have your pharmacist order NeilMed Sinus Rinse and 
use it in the same way as a neti pot.
 
 The recipe for rinsing the sinuses is 1⁄4 teaspoon of noniodized sea salt in 1 
cup of boiled water — cool and use in a neti pot or in a NeilMed syringe.
 
✓ Nails: Fungal nails are difficult to treat, especially if you don’t treat the 
whole body. Some of the drugs used to treat fungal nails are very harsh; 
some natural treatments include rubbing tea tree oil or oregano oil into 
the nails once or twice per day.
Avoiding Overuse of Antibiotics
As a society, Americans use way too many antibiotics. Bacteria are becoming 
resistant to most current antibiotics, which leads researchers to create stron-
ger drugs, which kill even more of the good bacteria in your body and give 
yeast a chance to take hold.
The best way to keep yeast in check is to stop using antibiotics unless abso-
lutely necessary. So think twice before your doctor gives you an antibiotic 
for your cold or flu. Most colds and flus are viral, and antibiotics don’t kill 
viruses anyway! The antibiotic won’t be helping your symptoms, and it may 
very well be contributing to a yeast problem. Save the antibiotics for when 
you really need them; in the next three sections, we give you a host of natu-
ral remedies for colds and flus. Carolyn is an expert in natural cures and 
staying healthy; her health program, Future Health Now! and remedies 
from her e-book Future Health Now! Encyclopedia (available online at www.
drcarolyndean.com) can help you stay on top of life.

285
 Chapter 18: Ten Ways to Keep Yeast in Check
Treating Infections with Supplements
The best way to avoid taking medications and ending up in the hospital is 
to stay healthy. Sounds silly, right? But with the right tools such as supple-
ments, you can avoid unnecessary medications that can lead to side effects 
and more meds for the side effects. Consider taking some of the following 
supplements to help you stay healthy. 
 
✓ Vitamin D: Taking 2,000 international units (IU) daily is a proven cold 
and flu prevention.
 
✓ Vitamin C: Take a daily dose of 500 milligrams; increase the amount 
to 1,000 milligrams every 1 to 2 hours during infection.
 
✓ Vitamin A: A daily dose of 20,000 IU strengthens mucus membranes 
against infection.
 
✓ Zinc: Chew zinc lozenges, 10 milligrams several times a day, to kill 
throat infection.
 
✓ Ionic silver: Silver liquid in nanogram size is a natural antibiotic, and 
research shows it can kill just about anything. Follow the dosing instruc-
tions on the label. Like with many products, quality fluctuates from 
brand to brand; we trust Natural Immunogenics, Sovereign Silver.
Helping with Herbs
Herbal helpers have been around for centuries, and here are some of our 
favorites for treating colds and flus. Remember to stop yourself before you 
put sugar in your herbal tea; you may not be using antibiotics, but you still 
don’t want to feed yeast. Keep it natural!
 
✓ Garlic: Place a small clove or half a clove of garlic in your mouth and 
let it sit without chewing. Swallow it with water when it starts breaking 
down in your mouth. A great side benefit is that vampires will keep their 
distance (but so will human folk)! You can also use it as a natural antibi-
otic, antiviral, and antifungal.
 
✓ Sage: Steep sage for 20 minutes to make a tea that treats cough.
 
✓ Fenugreek: Steeping fenugreek for 5 minutes brews a tea that helps 
reduce mucus.
 
✓ Ginger: To treat a sore throat and swollen neck glands, grate two table-
spoons of ginger and boil it in 3 cups of water to make a gargle. You 

286
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
can also use it as a poultice by saturating a hand towel and wrapping it 
around your throat.
 
✓ Herbal antibiotics: Use wild oregano oil, garlic, or echinacea herbal 
antibiotics as drops, tablets, or tea at least three times a day for colds 
or flus.
 
✓ Mullein and lobelia: These little-known herbs are great for chest 
congestion — just take 1⁄2 teaspoon of each in hot water three times a 
day. They can also be used as a chest poultice for pleurisy, bronchitis, 
or pneumonia.
Healing with Homeopathy
Homeopathy is a form of medicine that uses mostly plants and mineral 
extracts that are diluted in alcohol or water to infinitesimal amounts. When 
used correctly, it has no side effects, does not interact with medications, and 
can be used safely by pregnant women and infants. Here are a few options:
 
✓ Oscillococcinum is probably the most ridiculous name for a flu remedy 
that you’ll ever hear (so we call it Oscillo instead). It works for many 
people when used at the first signs of a cold or flu — it has proven 
about 70 percent effective in clinical trials to boost the immune system 
against viruses. Take one vial of pellets three times a day at the onset of 
symptoms. Some people use it as a preventative when they travel or are 
in crowds, or throughout the flu season on a weekly basis. Considering 
that flu vaccines are only about 8 percent effective and may have side 
effects, this remedy is an important addition to your medicine cabinet.
 
✓ Gelsemium treats colds and flus caused by overwork and exhaustion.
 
✓ Dulcamara helps knock out colds and flus that develop at the end of 
summer and into fall.
 
✓ Aconite can be used to nip cold and flu symptoms in the bud at their 
first signs.
 
✓ Ferrum phos also takes care of symptoms at the beginning of a cold.
 
✓ Kali bich treats colds and sinusitis with tough, stringy mucus.

hen you have IBS, sometimes you flare and sometimes you’re flying. 
Whatever end of the spectrum you’re on, the last thing you want to 
do is make your IBS worse. The following sections list the top foods you may 
have heard that people with IBS steer clear of if they want the closest thing to 
a happy-stomach guarantee. But, we’re here to tell you that you may not be 
that IBS person. So tread carefully through these foods knowing that every-
one is different, and you may not be the one these foods are going to attack.
Steering Clear of Artificial Sweeteners
Whether or not you have IBS, you may have replaced some sugary items in 
your diet with an artificial sweetener in an effort to avoid sugar (perhaps as 
a calorie-counting measure). However, these artificial sweeteners can have 
as much of an effect on your IBS as sugar does. Although studies may show 
these substances to be scientifically safe, many people still report reactions.
Artificial sweeteners come in several varieties:
 
✓ Aspartame: Sold under the brand names Equal and NutraSweet, aspar-
tame is a chemical that breaks down into methanol and formaldehyde 
when you drink it. Reports have been made to the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) that related aspartame to two dozen illnesses and 
conditions like headaches, nausea, and stomach disorders. When you 
drink a can of aspartame-sweetened cola, the dual effects of carbonation 

288
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
and the chemical can cause gas and bloating in your stomach, so we rec-
ommend you avoid it.
 
✓ Sucralose: Sucralose, which you may know by the brand name Splenda, 
can affect thyroid function and your ability to absorb minerals like mag-
nesium which are crucial to your intestinal health. Reports of stomach 
pain, diarrhea, and anxiety are also linked to the use of sucralose.
 
✓ Saccharin: You may be familiar with saccharin as Sweet’N Low. Use of 
saccharin is linked to diarrhea, headaches, and breathing problems. We 
remember our parents dropping pellets of saccharin in their tea many 
times a day for many years even after health warnings showed up on the 
packages.
 
✓ Sorbitol: Sorbitol is a sugar alcohol found in many products made for 
diabetics. This sugar alcohol passes into the intestines where it fer-
ments, and you know what happens with fermentation; bubbles form 
and fill the container with gas. When that container is your intestines, 
you’re dealing with discomfort and diarrhea. We strongly suggest 
staying away from any sorbitol products as we know that even small 
amounts can cause discomfort in your system.
 
 You are more likely to find sorbitol in chewing gum and candies which 
are small items because in larger amounts (10 grams), sorbitol is also 
a laxative. In fact, sorbitol is also sold by pharmaceutical companies 
as a laxative.
Guarding your health
Don’t be caught off guard because you’re feel-
ing good! Even if you’ve gone weeks or months 
since your last flare-up, you have to stay 
vigilant about your food intake. We don’t mean 
to sound negative — we really want you to 
enjoy your healthy feeling colon! — but just 
be alert, because if you’re feeling pretty 
good you may decide to eat something on your 
not-so-safe list.
Don’t assume that a risky food is now suddenly 
safe just because you eat it one or two days 
with no effects. That’s an easy trap to fall into — 
that first day, you feel fine after snacking on a 
favorite food that’s been on your forbidden list 
for ages, so the next day, you reason that you 
don’t need to deprive yourself and you delve in 
again with no ill effects.
Day three is about the time you need to worry 
about getting smug. By day three, continued 
eating of the previously forbidden food may 
start to overload your system and set off the 
alarm in your bowels. To avoid this situation, 
just remember that how much you eat is also an 
important component of IBS. You may be able to 
eat small amounts of certain trigger foods and 
not pay the price, but too much of that good 
thing may send your bowels into a tizzy. We 
aren’t recommending deprivation, just caution.

289
 Chapter 19: Ten Tempting Trigger Foods You May Want to Avoid
Distancing Yourself from Dairy
Dairy is the first food group to avoid when you have a symptom flare-up. 
Dairy-digesting enzymes are most active and plentiful in infancy and decline 
after weaning, so many adults don’t have enough of those lactase enzymes to 
digest dairy products. Even when you’re flying along without problems, we 
recommend that you only eat dairy once every three days, but introduce it 
in reasonable ways — don’t pound back a cheesecake to celebrate the libera-
tion of your colon.
Waving Good-bye to Wheat
You may have eaten wheat three times a day for decades and not even given it a 
second thought, but your bowels have calculated every wheat particle and are 
coming up with an overload. Some theorists believe that if you don’t chew your 
food well, undigested wheat can be absorbed through the gut wall (although 
this situation tends to happen more to folks with leaky gut, a condition we 
describe in Chapter 18). The undigested wheat molecules can set up antigen/
antibody reactions in your blood stream and cause widespread symptoms.
One way to weaken wheat’s hold on you is to stop eating it altogether for 
two weeks. Then you may be able to eat it once every three days, but let your 
bowels be the judge of that. Any kind of rumbling in any part of your gastroin-
testinal tract (GIT) may be a sign to back off the wheat. We often hear of people 
who report a feeling of heartburn but ignore it because it doesn’t involve a 
terror trip to the toilet. Then a morning wheat muffin sends rumblings farther 
into the GIT; the ensuing panic alone can be enough to set off an attack.
Saying “Sayonara, Sushi”
When you have a sensitive stomach, the last thing you need is to expose 
yourself to the parasites that are fairly common in raw fish. If they’re micro-
scopic, and some of them are, nobody’s going to notice them decorating your 
raw tuna or salmon. And don’t count on the heat from the wasabi to kill any 
lurking bacteria — that’s a myth.
Eating cooked or vegetable sushi may not keep you out of the woods either. 
Even if the sushi chef keeps a spotless work area, raw fish bits can creep over 
into cooked fish.

290
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
Soy sauce is another sushi caution — most soy sauces are wheat based (see 
the preceding section) and can launch an IBS missile.
Pushing Away Popcorn
You may be tempted to grab a $12 tub of popcorn at the movie theater, but 
even if fat isn’t an issue for you, this stuff has the fat power to launch its own 
IBS attack. In fact, a large tub of buttered movie popcorn can have as much 
as 125 grams of fat. That’s more than double the recommended daily amount 
for an adult with a high-functioning GIT.
“But what about that light-butter microwave popcorn, or my air popper?” you 
ask. Those options may be better on the fat front, but fat isn’t the only issue 
with popcorn: It’s simply impossible to chew down the insoluble fiber parti-
cles of popcorn that can irritate a sensitive gut. Have you ever found popcorn 
casings lodged between your teeth days after having eaten popcorn? Imagine 
those bits lurking in your colon. If something has survived in your mouth for 
three days without ever showing signs of being digested, you simply don’t 
want to go near the stuff if you have IBS.
Trashing Trail Mix and 
Ditching Dried Fruit
Christine doesn’t remember tasting a trail mix that didn’t have a moldy taste 
(and to her, Brazil nuts always taste moldy anyway). Trail mixes are great 
lab experiments for growing bacteria and fungus because nuts, especially 
peanuts grow mold and fruit provides a sugary meal for bacteria. This fact is 
especially true of the big bags that the whole family puts their unsterilized 
hands into. And the bulk bins at the store are worse; who knows who’s been 
ignoring the signs and dipping in for a snack?
The germ factor aside, the foods that make up trail mix can cause problems 
on their own. Nuts can produce gut-irritating shards if you don’t chew them 
completely and thoroughly. The sugar in dried fruit draws fluids into the 
intestine and can cause a flushing of diarrhea because your body doesn’t dis-
tinguish fruit sugar from plain old sugar. Plus, some dried fruit still includes 
fruit skins, which are high in insoluble fiber and irritating to an IBS gut.

291
 Chapter 19: Ten Tempting Trigger Foods You May Want to Avoid
Marooning MSG and Other 
Unpronounceable Ingredients
Granted, the acronym MSG is pretty pronounceable, but try saying its full name 
(monosodium glutamate) five times fast. Labeling often doesn’t help because 
MSG is hidden in various foods like seasonings, flavorings, hydrolyzed foods, 
bouillon cubes, cans of broth, and barley malt. Now that you’re familiar with its 
aliases, keep away from it! MSG reactions may include stomach upset, nausea 
and vomiting, and diarrhea, among other non-intestinal symptoms.
When it comes to monitoring IBS-safe ingredients, if you can’t say it, you 
can’t eat it! Okay, that’s a bit extreme, but honestly, the harder an ingredient 
is to pronounce, the more likely it is to be so chemically souped up that your 
intestines won’t be able to handle it.
Canning Caffeine and Alcohol
Caffeine is a stimulant, as coffee drinkers the world over can attest; unfor-
tunately for folks with IBS, their bowels are what get stimulated. Caffeine 
irritates the intestines, acting as a laxative for some people who just don’t 
need that interference. Watch out for hidden sources of caffeine; you know 
coffee and soda, but don’t forget about energy drinks. One patient we know 
dramatically improved his morning IBS-D symptoms just by cutting out his 
day-starting energy drink.
No science currently indicates that alcohol triggers IBS, but there’s common 
sense. Drinking too much alcohol can have a direct impact on your GIT, caus-
ing nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. So we’re still pretty clear about telling 
people with IBS to avoid it.
Forgetting Fast Food Sauces, 
Condiments, and Gravies
You can be sure that most fast food sauces and gravies are land mines for 
IBS — they have ingredients that aren’t even labeled, including MSG (see 

292
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
“Marooning MSG and Other Unpronounceable Ingredients” earlier in this 
chapter), aspartame, colorings, dyes, emulsifiers, and all kinds of other awful 
stuff. Actually, we’re pretty sure they come in huge vats with skulls and 
crossbones on the sides (or at least they should).
 
This holds true for not-so-fast food restaurants as well. Many popular chain 
and privately owned restaurants use mixes for their gravies and sauces to 
save time in the kitchen. And check to see if your local diner actually mashes 
real cooked potatoes or adds milk to a powdered mixture.
Flipping the Switch on Fatty Foods
Fat in food naturally stimulates intestinal contractions to help move your 
meal along from one end to another. It also stimulates the release of bile 
from the gall bladder to digest the fat in the small intestine. Both actions are 
necessary for food digestion and absorption, but in a sensitive gut that can 
trigger diarrhea and/or cramps. We recommend lean beef, which most people 
can tolerate, but you want to avoid fatty meats and anything deep-fried. The 
skin of poultry can be a problem, but you can remove it and enjoy fat-free 
chicken or turkey. Also be aware of the fat in many dairy products (although 
a reaction to them may be more related to lactose and added sugars).

Chapter 20
Ten Strategies for Avoiding 
Common Eating Traps
In This Chapter
▶ Surviving social situations
▶ Avoiding temptations
▶ Recognizing emotional factors
T
he traps we present in this chapter may seem obvious to you, but the 
nature of traps is that you can’t really see them all the time, and every-
body has at least one blind spot. We’re stripping away the camouflage and 
putting up police tape around these common pitfalls so you can identify them 
from a mile away.
 
We can help keep you from accidentally falling into these traps, but after you 
know about them, you have to make the choice to avoid them. One proven way 
to help you make more positive choices and avoid traps is to use Emotional 
Freedom Techniques (EFT), a self-help tool sometimes referred to as emotional 
acupressure. EFT can provide you with a sense of calm and relaxation so that 
decision-making feels easier when you face challenges and choices that feel 
difficult to make. Christine is an expert EFT Practitioner and provides informa-
tion about EFT for IBS on her Web site (www.christinewheeler.com).
Find Safe Ways to Socialize with Friends
IBS is a lonely condition that many people never tell their friends they have. 
We’re not suggesting that you post it in your online dating or social network-
ing profile, but coming clean may help your friends understand why you 
always have to wash your hair or rearrange your sock drawer on Friday 
nights instead of coming out for pizza and beer.

294
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Being social is more about the people you’re with and less about the food 
you’re eating. Consider telling your friends that you want to hang out with 
them but suspect you have some food sensitivities and are staying away 
from beer and pizza (or whatever the food of choice may be). Then sug-
gest another place whose menu you feel safe with. If they insist on the pizza 
parlor, you can try having a snack before you go (so your starving stomach 
isn’t tempted by the pepperoni special) and ordering a safe salad and mineral 
water when you’re there.
Another option: Invite everyone over to your place and prepare the snacks 
yourself. You get the best of both worlds: quality time with your buddies and 
food you don’t have to worry about. You may even start a new tradition.
Use the Sniff Test to Avoid 
Taking that One Little Bite
Any number of people (including you) may be trying to twist your arm to 
eat one little bite of wheat, dairy, sugar — you name it. Of course, for many 
people that one little bite quickly turns into eating the whole thing. Even if 
you can stop yourself after one bite, that amount can still be enough to set 
off a serious reaction depending on your level of sensitivity and the trigger 
in question; people who have celiac disease can be sidelined by a crumb of 
gluten. But resistance can still be tough when your favorite coworker shows 
up with a pan of her homemade brownies and you have to decide between 
hurting her feelings and risking an IBS episode.
One seemingly silly but surprisingly satisfying solution is to do the sniff test. 
The sense of smell is so powerful that one good whiff of the desired delicacy 
may be all you need to satisfy your craving.
Don’t Assume One Small Indulgence 
Is a Huge Problem
If you do succumb to taking just one teensy bite of something you know you 
shouldn’t have (see the preceding section), don’t throw in the towel just 
yet. You may be tempted to reason, “Well, I’ve already blown it, so why not 
finish the whole cake if I’m already going to have an attack?”, but that makes 
about as much sense as saying, “I already got my feet wet in the rain, so why 
not just jump in the shower fully clothed?” With IBS, the amount you eat can 
play a pivotal role. If you eat a small portion of a food you know your bowels 
shouldn’t have, you haven’t sealed your (or your colon’s) fate.

295
 Chapter 20: Ten Strategies for Avoiding Common Eating Traps
We think that the big problem is that most people eat that first small portion 
with a large helping of guilt. If you savor the small portion — make it last and 
enjoy the heck out of it — you may not even want any more because you’re 
so perfectly satisfied. And, with all those positive neurotransmitters that you 
stimulate by thinking happy thoughts about your food, your body may just 
digest that small portion without it bothering you.
Remind Yourself that IBS Doesn’t 
Recognize Special Occasions
Thanksgiving, New Year’s, Halloween, their sister’s birthday — for many people, 
these special days are just another chance to prove to themselves that they 
can’t eat cheese dip or chocolate cake. Your bowels don’t distinguish special 
occasions, except for the fact that they may be even more tense with the stress 
of the holiday, so you have to train yourself not to either, at least when you’re 
talking about diving into a buffet of triggers. Unless spending a family function 
in the bathroom is preferable to spending it with your family. . . .
Start Taking Care of Your IBS Today
Refusing to eat for your IBS doesn’t mean you don’t have IBS, so don’t put off 
determining and implementing a diet that supports your health. We under-
stand that part of what you’re putting off is the feeling of deprivation and loss 
of freedom to eat what you want, but you’re also putting off feeling better. 
So today, go shopping to fill your cupboards, fridge, and freezer with food 
you’ve tested to be tasty and safe; check out Chapter 4 for our kitchen-stock-
ing suggestions You may even want to do some baking from the desserts in 
Chapter 13 so you have something ready when that decadent urge hits! If you 
haven’t done elimination testing to determine what foods do and don’t work 
for you, head to Chapter 2 to get started.
Create a Healthy Environment 
for Yourself
An unhealthy environment for IBS can come in many forms — maybe you’re 
surrounded by more unhealthy foods than healthy ones, or your friends and 
family treat your IBS like it’s a figment of your imagination. Unfortunately, the 
stress of these situations can make your condition worse, so you really want 
to work to build a positive atmosphere.

296
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
We hear from so many people with IBS who are struggling to maintain a 
healthy diet for themselves while still preparing all the meals for family mem-
bers who don’t have IBS. In Chapter 4, we tell you how to stock your kitchen 
to maximize your success, and Chapter 15 gives you tips on getting the entire 
family on board with one member’s IBS diet.
A harder trap to avoid is feeling like those around you don’t respect your IBS 
symptoms. Many folks feel so weak and guilty because others treat their IBS 
like some sort of silly, inconvenient made-up problem that they feel forced to 
eat unfriendly foods and suffer the effects later just so they don’t draw atten-
tion to their illness. Chapter 4 also shows you how to minimize your IBS guilt 
and anxiety, and in IBS For Dummies (Wiley), we discuss having the IBS Talk 
with friends and family to explain the reality of your condition and let them 
know what you need from them.
Don’t Keep Triggers in the House
It’s as simple as that. If you crave something that worsens your symptoms, 
you have a much better chance of avoiding that stuff if you don’t have it 
around. Otherwise, you know it’s there, every cell in your brain knows it’s 
there, and no part of you gets any peace until you get a piece of it. Then you 
have a war in your gut.
But banning tasty triggers is a bit harder when you share a kitchen with non-
IBS family members, roommates, or houseguests, so you have to have some 
strong strategies in place to decrease your risk of temptation. In Chapter 4, 
we give you some tips on separating your foods from those of your IBS-free 
family. Putting your name on your special food packages, putting those pack-
ages on separate shelves, and keeping tempting but unfriendly foods on 
higher shelves out of reach are great ideas. Neither of us is very tall, but both 
of us have tall husbands who enjoy hiding things out of our physical reaches 
and lines of vision. We have to admit, it works!
Resist the Temptation to Skip Meals
Who knew that not eating at all is one of the biggest eating traps for IBS? 
When you allow yourself to get too hungry, you don’t have the calories pres-
ent to keep your body at its healing peak or to perform at your mental and 
emotional best. For example, as Christine worked on this chapter late one 
afternoon, she noticed that she was starting to get irritable and having trou-
ble coming up with bright ideas and witty comments. She realized she’d been 
so immersed in her work that she’d forgotten to eat. 

297
 Chapter 20: Ten Strategies for Avoiding Common Eating Traps
Folks can get so caught up in work, the Internet, and TV that they live in a 
virtual world without thinking of the very real needs of their physical bodies. 
To get you back into the habit, set a timer to tell you to eat every 3 to 4 hours 
and follow regular meal times. 
If you’re deliberately skipping meals because you really don’t know what you 
can safely eat, stop. Having your gut rumble every time you start thinking 
of food is scary, but you need to eat. In Chapter 5, we list our top soothing 
recipes; these foods can be helpful even when your symptoms are flaring, so 
reassure yourself that not all food is going to set you off and work your way 
back into eating with one of these options.
 
If you’re at the stage of skipping meals because you’re worried about the effects 
of food, start with the smoothie recipes in Chapter 8. You need to have some 
nourishment, and smoothies are a quick, safe, and delicious way to get it.
Don’t Succumb to Emotional Eating
Emotional eating is a catchy term used to describe eating when you’re emo-
tionally upset but not physically hungry. If you regularly turn to food to feed 
your feelings, emotional eating is a food trap that may be feeding your IBS 
symptoms. When you feed your feelings, you aren’t eating consciously and 
conscientiously; maybe you zone out and simply eat without caring or even 
being aware of what you’re putting in your mouth. You aren’t feeding your 
body, but your body still has to process the food.
When you find yourself heading for the kitchen ask yourself, “Am I physically 
hungry or just bored, tired, sad, needy, or irritable and looking for something 
to fill the gap?” Keep your food diary on the counter at the entrance to your 
kitchen and start writing about the snack or meal that you want and what 
you are feeling. If it’s physical hunger, by all means, eat. If it’s not, write down 
what emotion is driving the bus. 
Pay Attention to How 
You Feel As You Eat
A common thread that runs through many eating traps is the feelings eating 
can generate. Why is resisting taking a bite of your brother’s homemade 
triple-chocolate ganache so difficult? Because you have the added stress of 
worrying about hurting his feelings. When you do take a bite out of guilt, the 
panic at undoing your eating rules can be enough to set off an attack that the 

298
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
food itself may not have triggered. We don’t tell you this to make you feel 
even guiltier but rather to give you an awareness of how your thoughts affect 
your whole body when you’re eating.
As soon as you take a bite of some forbidden food and have a negative 
thought, you need to spit that morsel out immediately! You have our permis-
sion to do this unsightly act because after you do it once or twice, you start 
to recognize the importance of how you feel and what you’re thinking when 
you eat. If you check in with your body and find your tummy is tight and you 
can’t take a deep breath, that’s not the time to be eating much of anything. If 
you find yourself in that tense, tight state too much, think about the magne-
sium solutions in Chapter 1 for calming your body and turning off the tension.

Appendix B
Sensible Trigger Food Substitutes
W
hen you’ve figured out which foods trigger your IBS symptoms, your 
first question is probably, “Well, what can I have instead?” (If you 
haven’t determined your trigger foods yet, Chapter 2 helps you do so.) To 
answer your question, this appendix provides some common IBS trigger 
foods and possible replacement ingredients. Experiment with putting some of 
these ingredients into your favorite recipes. Thank you to Lori Alden and her 
Web site www.foodsubs.com for some great substitution suggestions; for 
even more, check out the site.
 
IBS is an individual condition; the ingredients we suggest here are generally 
safer than the original, but you have to do your own testing to figure out what 
you can tolerate.
Substituting Milk
In North America, milk is a staple on cereal, in baking, and as a drink on its 
own. For some people with IBS, though, milk is a troublesome substance 
because they’re sensitive to lactose or the milk protein casein. The following 
alternatives may help you milk the most out of your recipes; you can easily 
substitute them one to one.
 
✓ Lactose-free milk: If your problem with milk is lactose intolerance, most 
dairies offer lactose-free versions of their milks.
 
✓ Goat’s milk: For some people, goat’s milk is easier to digest than cow’s 
milk. But be forewarned that it has a distinct flavor.
 
✓ Oat milk: Oat milk has a slightly sweet taste and may be a good replace-
ment for low-fat milk unless you’re gluten sensitive.
 
✓ Soy milk: Some people find soy hard to digest, but this option may 
be worth trying. It has a nutty taste and is better for baking than for 
cooking.
 
✓ Rice milk: This low-protein sweet milk works well in desserts.

306
Part V: Appendixes 
 
✓ Almond milk: A high-protein sweet milk, almond milk is best used 
in desserts and is also tasty in coffee and on cereal. Check out the 
Essential Nut Milk recipe in Chapter 8 to try it out for yourself.
 
✓ Water: You may not believe it, but water can whip up into something 
miraculous. It makes your scrambled eggs creamier and gives bread a 
thicker texture and a lighter crust.
Changing Up Cheese
Because cheese is from the dairy family, certain types of cheese may trigger 
your IBS. We’re not promising that all these cheese substitutions taste, melt, 
or bake like your typical cheddar or mozzarella, but they may well be better 
than no cheese at all.
 
Depending on your level of cheese tolerance, you may be able to use some of 
the “real” cheeses approved for the Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD). Check 
out the list in Chapter 3. Also, be sure to read labels because some cheese 
substitutes may contain casein or caseinates, which are derived from milk and 
may upset your system if you’re lactose intolerant.
 
✓ Goat or sheep cheese: Try cheeses made from the milk of animals other 
than cows. Some people find that they can digest goat cheese more 
easily than cheese made from cow’s milk. Goat and sheep cheese are 
easy to find in your local supermarket.
 
✓ Vegetarian cheese substitutes: Vegetarian cheese can be made from 
soybeans, rice, almonds, or hemp seeds. These faux cheeses are formu-
lated to taste and act like the real deal, including melting. But experiment 
to find what works for you because some can be bland and rubbery.

Most people can digest egg whites, but the fat in the egg yolk is troublesome 
for some. (As a guideline, a typical egg contains 2 tablespoons of white and 1 
tablespoon of yolk.) Here are some ways you may be able to get around your 
egg dilemma (and we don’t mean the old “Which came first?” question).
 
✓ Egg whites only: In most recipes calling for one egg, you can substitute 
two egg whites instead.
 
✓ Flax meal: Grind flaxseed to the consistency of cornmeal and mix 
about 2 tablespoons of it with 1⁄8 teaspoon of baking powder and 
3 tablespoons of water to replace one egg in a recipe.

307
 Appendix B: Sensible Trigger Food Substitutes
 
✓ Tofu (not genetically modified): For a yummy breakfast scramble, crum-
ble the firm kind and sauté with herbs, onions, mushrooms, vegetarian 
cheese, or a cheese approved for the SCD.
 
✓ Silken tofu (Non-GMO): Substitute 1⁄4 cup of silken tofu for each egg.
 
✓ Egg substitutes: These products are mostly egg whites but may contain 
fillers and flavorings that don’t pass muster on your safe food list. Use 1⁄4 
cup of substitute per egg; for baking, try 3 tablespoons of substitute 
and 1 tablespoon of oil.
 
✓ Gelatin: To replace one egg in a recipe, dissolve 1 tablespoon of unfla-
vored gelatin in 1 tablespoon of cold water and then add 2 tablespoons 
of boiling water and beat vigorously until frothy.
 
✓ Banana: Substitute 1⁄2 of a mashed ripe banana plus 1⁄4 teaspoon of baking 
powder for each egg.
Swapping Out Sugar
The list of problems stemming from the overuse of refined sugars is long, 
but the main IBS issue is that it encourages the overgrowth of yeast and 
abnormal bacteria. In Appendix D, we give you 93 names for sugar; we can’t 
promise nearly as many substitutes for sugar here, but we do have a few up 
our sleeves.
 
✓ Date sugar: Substitute 1 cup of date sugar for each cup of granulated 
sugar.
 
✓ Powdered milk: Replace up to 1⁄4 of the granulated sugar in a recipe with 
the same amount of powdered milk.
 
✓ Maple syrup: You may be able to substitute 3⁄4 cup of maple syrup 
and 1⁄4 teaspoon of baking soda for each cup of granulated sugar in a 
recipe, but reduce another liquid in the recipe by 3 tablespoons.
 
✓ Rice syrup: Try substituting 13⁄4 cups of rice syrup for each cup of granu-
lated sugar called for in a recipe, but reduce another liquid in the recipe 
by 1⁄4 cup.
 
✓ Molasses: Molasses gives your final product a strong molasses flavor. 
Replace each cup of granulated sugar with 11⁄3 cup of molasses and 1 tea-
spoon of baking soda, but reduce another liquid in the recipe by 1⁄3 cup 
and lower the oven temperature by 25 degrees.
 
✓ Stevia: Stevia is the most natural sweetener we know of. Made from 
stevia leaves, it may actually be good for your health. It’s many times 
stronger than sugar, so tread carefully. The strengths of various brands 
differs wildly, so we can’t give a specific exchange.

308
Part V: Appendixes 
 
✓ Just Like Sugar: This sugar substitute has the consistency of sugar but 
is made from chicory and has zero calories. Replace sugar with an equal 
amount of Just Like Sugar.
 
✓ Agave: Agave is another natural sweetener; swap 13⁄4 cups of agave for 
each cup of granulated sugar in a recipe. Be sure to reduce another 
liquid in the recipe by 1⁄4 cup.
Replacing White Flour
White flour is wheat flour with the bran removed. The insoluble fiber in bran 
can be a problem for a sensitive gut, but both flours have gluten that may be 
an underlying cause for your IBS symptoms.
Each bullet includes the conversion for replacing one cup of all-purpose 
white flour with the alternative flour in your recipes.
 
With flours, you can buy a few cups in bulk to try them out before committing 
to a whole container.
 
✓ Brown or white rice flour: One loosely packed cup
 
✓ Chickpea flour: 3⁄4 cup
 
✓ Corn flour: 1 cup
 
✓ Kamut flour: 1 cup
 
✓ Millet flour: 1 cup
 
✓ Potato flour: 1⁄2 cup
 
✓ Quinoa flour: 1 cup

Appendix C
Soluble and Insoluble Fiber Charts
W
e talk about fiber and its solubility throughout this book, and you 
may have some idea how much soluble or insoluble fiber is ideal for 
your individual IBS. Because most food labels don’t break the fiber count into 
soluble or insoluble, we’ve found a chart released by the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture (USDA) that gives an estimate of the soluble and insoluble fiber in 
70 different, common foods.
We suggest using these charts as a guideline rather than the gospel because 
all of the sources we researched had different fiber numbers for similar 
foods. These numbers can give you an idea of whether the foods you’re 
choosing are more soluble than insoluble, and that can help you make deci-
sions about your diet.
 
There’s more to your IBS diet than just fiber. In Chapter 2, we talk about insol-
uble fiber as a trigger for IBS but confess that, much like a wild horse, fiber is a 
very difficult trigger to tie down, with contradictory values in different charts. 
Our advice is to not rely on fiber as the main driving force of your IBS diet. 
Instead, use these fiber charts to guide your fiber intake, but be sure to also find 
out about your body type and food preferences so you’re sure to know your 
individual preferences based on who you are, not on some general guidelines.
Tables C-1 through C-6 provide the soluble and insoluble fiber estimates of 70 
common foods. We say estimates because we want you to use these as guide-
lines in making food choices. Many foods have similar amounts of soluble 
and insoluble fiber, which still makes them IBS-friendly. Also note that a lot of 
the insoluble fiber in many fruits is concentrated largely in the skin.

Appendix D
Surprising Sources 
of Major Triggers
F
ood sensitivities and IBS triggers are hard to avoid when problem ingre-
dients hide out in places you never expect to find them. How can you 
eliminate something from your diet when you don’t even know that it’s in 
your food? Yelling “Come out, come out, wherever you are!” doesn’t work on 
food, so we offer this appendix to help you uncover some of the secret hide-
aways of sugar, gluten, lactose, and casein.
Sussing Out Sugar
If eliminating sugar from your diet is important for your individualized IBS 
treatment, you need to know where all the sugar is lurking. Manufacturers of 
packaged food have been known to use different types of sugar in their sweet 
concoctions to spread the sugary ingredients throughout the ingredient list.
 
The first ingredient on the label list is the most prominent single ingredient 
in the product. But if manufacturers include sugar through many different 
ingredients, they may be able to load the product with sugar without tipping 
off casual label readers who assume that if sugar was the main ingredient, it 
would be first on the list.

Getting to the Gluten
Avoiding gluten is a must for people with celiac disease, but it’s also a great 
guideline to follow if you have IBS symptoms that you’ve associated with any-
thing on the following list.
 
Never fear if you discover your favorite product on this list. You can find 
gluten-free versions of many products at gluten-free stores and online.
 
✓ Beer
 
✓ Bread and breadcrumbs
 
✓ Biscuits
 
✓ Cereal
 
✓ Communion wafers
 
✓ Cookies, cakes, cupcakes, donuts, muffins, pastries, pie crusts, 
brownies, and baked goods
 
✓ Cornbread
 
✓ Crackers

316
Part V: Appendixes 
 
✓ Croutons
 
✓ Gravies, sauces, and roux
 
✓ Imitation seafood (for example, crab)
 
✓ Licorice
 
✓ Marinades (especially teriyaki)
 
✓ Pasta
 
✓ Pizza crust
 
✓ Pretzels
 
✓ Soy sauce
 
✓ Stuffing
Digging for Lactose
You may have an IBS reaction to lactose and dairy products regardless of 
whether you’re officially lactose intolerant. Double check your food labels for 
signs of lactose, including milk, whey, cream, and milk solids, and watch out 
for the following foods:
 
✓ Biscuits
 
✓ Boiled sweets
 
✓ Cake (especially cake containing cream filling)
 
✓ Cheese
 
✓ Chocolate
 
✓ Cream
 
✓ Ice Cream
 
✓ Instant mashed potatoes
 
✓ Mayonnaise
 
✓ Milk
 
✓ Peanut butter
 
✓ Some pharmaceutical pills
 
✓ Salad dressing
 
✓ Yogurt

Catching Up to Casein
Casein is a protein found in all types of milk and used as a binder in many 
foods. It is also used in the production of plastics, nail polish, paint, glue and 
cosmetics. Some casein aliases you may find on your food labels include milk 
solids, sodium caseinate, caseinogen, and caseinate. In addition, you typically 
find casein in the following foods:
 
✓ Bakery glazes
 
✓ Breath mints
 
✓ Chicken sausages
 
✓ Coffee whiteners/creamers
 
✓ Fortified cereals
 
✓ Frankfurters
 
✓ High-protein beverage powders
 
✓ Ice cream
 
✓ Infant formulas
 
✓ Luncheon meats
 
✓ Nutrition bars
 
✓ Pâtés
 
✓ Processed meats
 
✓ Salad dressings
 
✓ Soy products
 
✓ Vienna sausages
 
✓ Whipped toppings
