Jennifer Cognard-Black, Ph.D.
Professor of English
St. Mary’s College of Maryland
 D 
r. Jennifer Cognard-Black is a 
Professor of English at St. Mary’s 
College of Maryland, a public 
liberal arts college, where she has taught 
since 2000. A liberal arts student herself, 
Dr. Cognard-Black graduated summa cum 
laude from Nebraska Wesleyan University 
with a dual degree in Music and English. She 
then studied under Jane Smiley for her M.A. in Fiction and Essay Writing at Iowa 
State University. Dr. Cognard-Black received her Ph.D. in 19th-Century British 
and American Literature from The Ohio State University, where she continued 
to take and teach writing workshops. In 2012, she was named a Fulbright Scholar 
to Slovenia, where she taught the American novel and creative writing, and she is 
the recipient of a Maryland State Arts Council individual artist award.
Dr. Cognard-Black’s publications are extensive and eclectic, reflecting her intellectual 
background as both a writer and a literary critic. Her critical work spans Victorian 
visuality and technologies of communication, theories of the letter and the machine, 
images of women in the media, the literatures of food, women novelists, feminist 
rhetorics, and writing theory and practice. In turn, her short stories and essays 
often grapple with issues of betrayal and the body. She has collaborated with a 
number of visual artists, including photographers and painters, and has had this 
work exhibited at galleries in New York and Philadelphia. Dr. Cognard-Black is also 
working with an art historian on an exhibition of portraits of American women 
writers and is writing her first novel, one inspired by the secret life of the first 
woman ever to win the Pulitzer Prize, Edith Wharton. 
Twice, Dr. Cognard-Black has received the most prestigious teaching award 
at her institution—the Faculty Student Life Award, selected by the students

themselves—and she has been given Mellon Foundation grants on three different 
occasions to support her course development and experiential learning initiatives. 
Nebraska Wesleyan University has named her a Distinguished Alumnus and an 
Outstanding Graduate. Dr. Cognard-Black has also been an artist-in-residence at 
the Kimmel Harding Nelson Center for the Arts, the Sandy Spring Museum, and 
the Iowa Writers’ House. 
Dr. Cognard-Black is the author of Narrative in the Professional Age: Transatlantic 
Readings of Harriet Beecher Stowe, George Eliot, and Elizabeth Stuart Phelps and a 
coeditor of three collections. The first is a volume of previously unpublished letters 
on female authorship, Kindred Hands: Letters on Writing by British and American 
Women Authors, 1865–1935; another is an anthology of poetry, fiction, and essays 
that all include recipes, Books That Cook: The Making of a Literary Meal. The final 
one is a collection of creative nonfiction essays by women writers, From Curlers 
to Chainsaws: Women and Their Machines, winner of a gold medal in the national 
2016 Independent Publisher Book Awards contest. She has published her essays 
and short fiction in a number of journals, ranging from The Magazine of Fantasy 
and Science Fiction to Another Chicago Magazine. She is also a contributor to 
Ms. magazine and a member of its Committee of Scholars, a reviews editor for 
the journal Literary Mama, and part of the advisory board to the University of 
Nevada’s Cultural Ecologies of Food book series. Dr. Cognard-Black has written 
about recipes as a powerful means of storytelling for The Huffington Post and the 
University of Maryland’s Faculty Voice, and she appeared on The Kojo Nnamdi Show 
on NPR in Washington DC to talk about recipes as containers of individual and 
national memory. ■

Becoming a Great Essayist
Scope:
Too often, the essay is thought of as nothing more than a classroom assignment—a 
piece that makes a claim, defines a concept, or compares and contrasts two ideas. 
Yet the essay is a form of writing that far exceeds any schoolroom task. As this 
course demonstrates, essays contain multitudes. They are whole worlds distilled. 
Since the 16th century, European and North American writers have adopted the 
essay to mount arguments, record memories, make observations, spread gossip, 
experiment with language, and see the world anew. Given this range, the essay can 
take on many forms and express many moods. Essays might be poetic or analytic. 
They may be civic-minded or introspective. Essays often draw on historical texts, 
lived experience, or personal reflections. And they have the potential to make 
readers chuckle or weep, gasp or recoil, or nod their heads in recognition. In fact, 
the original etymology of the word “essay” speaks to the elasticity of the genre; 
“essay” comes from the Old French essai, meaning an attempt or a trial. And the 
essay is just that: a thought experiment. 
In this course, you’ll be introduced to some of the greatest essayists of the ages, 
beginning with Michel de Montaigne and his 1580 collection Les Essais, which 
invented and popularized the essay as a literary genre. You’ll also learn about many 
of Montaigne’s successors, such as the 18th-century British wits Joseph Addison 
and Sir Richard Steele, who circulated their essays of manners in highly popular 
and slightly scandalous periodicals, The Tatler and The Spectator. A century later, 
on the other side of the Atlantic, the philosopher-poet Ralph Waldo Emerson 
wrote some of the first essays on nature and the environment, while Rainer Maria 
Rilke, the Austrian poet, used personal letters as a kind of intimate essay form to 
discuss what it means to be an artist. In turn, at the beginning of the 20th century, 
women began to make the essay their own. Virginia Woolf’s episodic pieces have 
a dreamlike quality to them, whereas Mary McCarthy’s are sharply observant and 
self-scrutinizing. 

2|Becoming a Great Essayist
This course also spends a good deal of time examining the work of living 
essayists—modern maestros of the form. These lectures delve into fascinating and 
resonant pieces by eminent essayists hailing from diverse backgrounds, such as 
Naomi Shihab Nye, Annie Dillard, Joan Didion, Barbara Kingsolver, Patricia Hampl, 
David Sedaris, Michael Pollan, Jeanette Winterson, David Owen, M. F. K. Fisher, and 
Maya Angelou. We’ll also explore experimental writers who are currently exploding 
and remaking the essay for their readers, including Joy Castro, Dinty Moore, Ellen 
Meloy, John D’Agata, Maureen Stanton, Debra Marquart, Michael P. Branch, and Ta-
Nehisi Coates. Finally, to see behind the curtain of the writing process, we’ll look at 
examples of works in progress written by student essayists, as well as a number of 
pieces, both published and in draft form, by the professor.
Collectively, these writers and their work serve as models for you to learn effective 
rhetorical principles that cut across all good essays. Starting with Aristotle’s belief 
that writers are most convincing when they forge a strong ethos, or credibility, 
built on the twin appeals of reason and emotion—or logos and pathos—this 
course demonstrates again and again how excellent essayists use similar rhetorical 
strategies to make their points. First and foremost, all essayists tell the truth, and 
they do so through a compelling first-person voice. Put simply, every essay is a 
true story, well-told, written by the person who lived, witnessed, or thought deeply 
about an experience. And these basic qualities explain why, regardless of form or 
tone, readers tend to find essayists credible: What essayists say comes directly 
from their own experience and thoughts, or what Aristotle calls “artistic proofs”—
evidence that arises out of the writers themselves. In turn, essayists further support 
their claims with “inartistic proofs,” or those that come from reading and research. 
The first half of these lectures, then, demonstrates how writers synthesize such 
artistic and inartistic proofs into a sure-fire method for crafting successful essays. 
Through a series of structured writing exercises, this method is one that you will 
learn to adopt and apply to any type of essay.
The second half of this course examines various essay types, from personal to 
public essays to those that are argumentative, lyrical, historic, or humorous. 
Indeed, essays can take nearly any form: travel writing, nature writing, portraits of 
famous people, public intellectual pieces, critical reviews, polemics, and countless 
other types. We’ll learn about themed essays, such as those about food, as well as 
innovations that certain writers have made to the form, such as the microessay 
and the “proem”—a cross between poetry and prose. These lectures also consider

essay forms that, at first, might seem to be another kind of writing altogether, 
such as letters, commencement addresses, or blog posts. All in all, through the 
second half of this course, we’ll see just how flexible and adaptable the essay is. 
And you’ll learn how to harness this flexibility by combining personal experience, 
ideas, research, and memories to shape new forms and adopt new styles that 
are appropriate for each essay you attempt to write. Ultimately, this course will 
provide you with the writing skills to improve your essays, the critical thinking skills 
to critique your drafts, and the creativity to master a strong and persuasive voice, 
regardless of your essay’s subject or purpose.

Lecture 1
Steal, Adopt, Adapt: Where Essays Begin
 H 
ow can we define an essay? Is it an argument, a recollection, a 
blog post, a food review, or a piece of literary criticism? Is it some 
sort of erudite, poetic prose—bound in leather and tucked on 
a bookshelf? It’s possible for an artful essay to be any of these, depending 
on a writer’s purpose. An essay is an attempt at connecting your personal 
experience, ideas, and memories to people outside yourself. It is direct and 
palpable as a handshake, yet to be effective, it’s a form that requires careful 
preparation and delivery. In this lecture, we’ll try to define the essay and 
look at five elements that essays must embody and convey. 
Early Essays


In 1580, Michel de Montaigne published a three-volume collection of writings 
that scholars agree are the world’s first books of essays. He titled them 
Attempts. Although other writers before Montaigne turned to themselves as 
their primary subject matter, no one before him had thought the stuff of a 
person’s everyday life worthy of close literary attention. 


Montaigne’s subjects range from the sublime to the mundane—from 
prayer and the force of imagination to drunkenness and thumbs. And his 
preferred structure is a series of digressions that allow him to follow the 
vagaries of his own thoughts.


Montaigne deliberately wrote vernacular French rather than formal 
Latin. Thus, his voice is immediate and intimate, like two friends bending 
elbows at a neighborhood café.


These unusual attributes for the time have come to define the principles 
of the modern essay: a true story, told in accessible language, by someone 
who has direct experience with the subject matter.

Lecture 1—Steal, Adopt, Adapt: Where Essays Begin|5


We also owe Montaigne a debt for defining the essay’s central purpose. 
He believed that the individual represents the universal, and he 
continually sought to link his own life to wider human experience. As 
Montaigne once wrote, “Every man has within himself the entire human 
condition.” This revelation underscores the idea that essayists must write 
not just for themselves but also for their readers. 


After Montaigne, the popularity of this newfangled genre jumped the 
channel, with Francis Bacon writing his own collection in English—also 
called Attempts or Essays—in 1597. The English essay came fully into its own 
about a century later, with the rise of a middle-class reading public.


At the beginning of the 18th century, Joseph Addison and Richard Steele 
launched literary and society journals with a satiric bent—called The Tatler 
and The Spectator—that both celebrated and critiqued their contemporaries 
and social peers. Theirs was a ready-made, literate audience with disposable 
income, casting about for something clever to read.


In a departure from Montaigne’s self-reflection, Addison and Steele 
turned outward. They created narrative personas, such as Mr. Spectator, 
who “spectated” on human flaws and foibles, then “tattled” about them.


Addison and Steele aimed to delight and to surprise their readers—not 
to preach at them. But their essays did have an instructive purpose. They 
saw themselves as arbiters of their culture, defining what was—and what 
was not—acceptable behavior. 
Defining the Essay


Essays can be personal or public, argumentative, autobiographical, lyrical, 
epistolary, historic, or humorous. Some essays convey themes, while others 
are experimental, including such innovations as the microessay and the 
“proem,” which is a cross between poetry and prose. 


At first blush, some forms, such as letters, speeches, e-mails, and blog 
posts, might not seem to be essays at all. To complicate things even 
further, essays are written in many tones and approaches, from critical 
and playful to expository and exploratory.

6|Becoming a Great Essayist


Yet all these examples use the same basic features: the true story, told in 
smart words, by the person who lived or witnessed it.


In his anthology The Art of the Personal Essay, Phillip Lopate divides essays into 
two categories: formal and informal.


What we think of as a formal essay today is largely the kind students 
start to write in elementary school, when teachers ask them to turn in 
a “theme.” Typical assignments include descriptive, comparison-contrast, 
expository, and persuasive essays. The intent here is to teach young 
minds how to write a thesis statement, use principles of organization, 
and use and cite secondary sources.


In contrast to formal essays, the informal essay is always personal. In 
recent years, the blog post has become a prevalent kind of informal essay. 
This genre can sometimes be worthy of attention, but like other social 
media spaces, the blogosphere is overwhelmingly occupied by trivia. 


Lopate’s division is helpful in some ways, but even he admits, “The 
distinction between the formal and informal essay can be overdone, and 
most great essayists have crossed the line frequently.”


We might also think of essays as containers for human memory. 


Bill Roorbach’s definition of memoir is useful for essayists. He calls 
memoir “a true story, a work of narrative built directly from the memory 
of its writer, with an added element of creative research.”


In turn, Patricia Hampl’s ideas about why people love memoir is also 
helpful: “We do not, after all, simply have experience; we are entrusted 
with it. We must do something—make something—with it.”


These ideas should resonate with essayists. What matters most is how 
we writers witness the world around us and remember what we saw, 
heard, and felt by putting those memories into words.


The definition of “memoir,” however, is too limited to account for 
all essays. An essay is not a synonym for memoir because memoir is 
always about the writer’s past. Although there’s no question that an 
artful essay can be every bit as subjective and intimate as a memoir, 
an essay doesn’t have to be about the writer’s own life—even though 
that’s often a good place to start. Thus, it’s more accurate to say that 
memoir is a type of essay.

Lecture 1—Steal, Adopt, Adapt: Where Essays Begin|7


We essay writers are adventurers and trailblazers. We are able to engage a 
kind of originality that’s harder to find in the conventions of fiction or poetry 
or drama. The essay has no fixed parameters apart from including a first-
person narrator who is intent on telling the truth. An essay’s form and style is 
entirely dependent on your purpose and your audience. You get to create a 
new form and adopt a new style with each essay that you write.


Even more liberating, essay writers can be thieves without any concern for 
consequences. In fact, an essayist is expected to steal—to adopt and adapt—
aspects of all other forms of writing. 
Elements of Essays


Even if we can’t pinpoint an all-encompassing definition of an essay, we can 
recognize specific elements that seem essential for essays to encompass 
and convey. 
Essayists draw on the facts 
of history and science, the 
musings of philosophy and 
theology, and the melodies 
and harmonies of music; 
then, by applying the 
techniques of poets, fiction 
writers, and dramatists, 
they pursue imaginative 
encounters with the real.

8|Becoming a Great Essayist


First, an essay must have ethos, a Greek term meaning “moral character.” For 
Aristotle, in his 4th-century treatise Rhetoric, ethos is the first of three artistic 
proofs, or modes of persuasion, which also include pathos (emotional appeals) 
and logos (proof of a truth through rational arguments). These artistic proofs 
are available to any writer who hopes to convince and compel an audience 
on any topic.


Second, whatever about an individual is presented within an essay must 
represent a larger, more universal truth. Once ethos is established and a 
reader trusts the writer, then an essay will speak beyond the petty concerns 
or obsessions of the essayist.


According to Lopate, the essay has embedded within it a “democratic 
bent, in the value it places on experience rather than status distinctions.”


Successful essays engage the wider world and those who inhabit it—
namely, readers. Remember Montaigne’s maxim: “Every man has within 
himself the entire human condition.”


Third, an essay must address the vital question “So what?” Jotting down notes 
about a fickle lover or how much your sister irritates you is an instance of 
personal storytelling that fails to consider the wider world. An essayist must 
ask: What is the purpose—the point—of my essay? What is my central claim, 
argument, or conception?


As essayists, we must remember that we write for the common reader, 
not academics or even other essayists. Our readers are intelligent, 
curious, and hungry for meaning. 


And if our writing can’t speak to this common reader, then we are not 
speaking to people. We’re just speaking to ourselves.


Fourth, although all essays express a structure of some kind, there is no 
formula to follow. An essay is a mental walkabout. When reading an essay, we 
meander inside someone else’s head, looking out through his or her eyes.


Finally, essays tell the truth. Writers need to convince the audience that they 
are credible, have wisdom, and are reliable.


This brings us back to the first point, which is that an essay writer’s ethos 
is the clout of character that makes his or her claims both credible and 

Lecture 1—Steal, Adopt, Adapt: Where Essays Begin|9
powerful. It’s important to understand that ethos comes from writers 
themselves. 


And because ethos is a proof that comes directly from the writer, 
Aristotle calls it an artistic proof. By this, he means that the integrity 
of the writing stems directly from the author rather than from data, 
interviews, statistics, or other “nonartistic” proofs. Unlike other kinds of 
writing that adopt a distant and supposedly objective third-person point 
of view, essays are subjective, almost always written in the first person. 


Put simply, then, an essay’s ethos is the credibility that comes out of the 
writer’s self-knowledge and self-presentation. As such, an essayist cannot 
just tell a reader about his or her life. Instead, an essayist must allow the 
reader to re-experience something both vital and true about the human 
condition.


Abstract ideas and themes must be grounded in concrete facts, yet these 
facts must then be synthesized with intelligence, emotion, and reflection 
that speak both to the hearts and heads of readers. 
Assignment: Keeping a Commonplace Book


The Harvard Library’s website defines a “commonplace book” as “a collection 
of significant or well-known passages that have been copied and organized 
in some way, often under topical or thematic headings, in order to serve as a 
memory aid or reference to the compiler.”


For the purposes of keeping your own commonplace book, use a ring-bound 
notebook or an artist’s sketchpad. Make sure the pages are large enough to 
weave a tapestry of quotations, excerpts, ideas, and notes on a single page.


Much of our lives is determined by our routines, but the commonplace book 
is where you either deliberately break out of your routines or write them 
down while examining such customary practices through new eyes. Notice 
the people, places, and things around you, and write down details about them 
that are striking, odd, beautiful, or unnerving. The result will be one-of-a-kind 
writing that is your own essay.

Lecture 2
Memory Maps and Your Essay’s Direction
 S 
ome travelers avoid using cameras because they don’t want to look 
at a new place through a viewfinder. Indeed, as the word “viewfinder” 
suggests, a camera is often what creates a traveler’s perspective. 
In a way, travelers who take photographs give up a bit of their autonomy 
because it’s the camera that determines the look of whatever they observe. 
An essay, in contrast, carries both the memory and the understanding of 
a place. In this lecture, we’ll learn how a writer can “map” the memories 
of place through the written account of his or her experiences there, and 
we’ll see that how that map is interpreted shapes the truth of the writer’s 
encounters with the place and its people.
Creating a Memory Map


One way to turn notes into the first draft of an essay is to follow a two-part 
exercise that we might call writing a memory map.


First, draw a rough map of a specific place you have visited and written 
about. After drawing the outline, fill in your map with notes about the 
memories you experienced there, writing in the margins. Jot down the 
smells, tastes, textures, and sounds, looking back at your journal to help 
you remember these details.


The second part of this exercise involves writing a story from your map. 
This story is the rough draft of your essay—your first attempt at creating 
a map of how you experienced your travels in your mind. 


Unlike a photo album, a map is a dynamic combination of words and images. 
It charts a specific geography within a clear set of parameters. Further, a map 
evolves over time. When a cartographer realizes that this or that feature 

12|Becoming a Great Essayist
needs to be expanded or reduced or changed altogether, a new map can 
be created. And because the purpose of a map is navigation, it calls out to its 
user; a map is meant to be explored. In this way, a map is inherently a shared 
form, in which the map reader and the mapmaker make meaning together.


One way to excavate your own memories for the purpose of writing essays 
is to create a map of the mind for each potential piece. As you remember 
and record your memories, certain points are charted along the way. These 
points ultimately form a map that encompasses the whole of recollection and 
interpretation.
Photographs offer only 
a partial window to 
recollection; they aren’t 
faithful to the dynamic 
and liquid quality of 
experience, as opposed 
to the static and fixed.

“Street Haunting: A London Adventure” by Virginia Woolf


To offer a concrete example of mapmaking, let’s turn to an essay by Virginia 
Woolf called “Street Haunting: A London Adventure.” Although many travel 
essays use a narrator who is a stranger in a strange land, London was Woolf’s 
home—a familiar landscape. Yet Woolf manages to turn London into a 
strange land—and herself into a stranger exploring it. She does so by bringing 
together memory with imagination, deliberately shifting her perspective from 
that of a native to a visitor.


Ethos is the narrative voice a writer creates for a reader, a voice that must 
have credibility, conveying the writer’s truth of his or her experience, rather 
than just the facts. Ethos is both how an essayist understands the self and how 
that self is presented to others. In turn, a reader reacts to that writer—and if 
the writer is credible, the reader is willing to listen in order to hear what the 
essayist has to say. The persuasive narrative voice that Woolf creates in her 
essay “Street Haunting” is a strong example of how to build a credible ethos.


Consider how Woolf navigates her literal map of London against the figurative 
or mental map that she draws alongside it. 


On the one hand, Woolf traces an actual map of London, following a 
footpath along its streets from her home in Bloomsbury to an area called 
the Strand by the River Thames, then back again. If a reader were to stick 
to the place names associated with Woolf’s evening stroll, it would be 
easy to draw a map of her journey.


This representation provides a clear sense of where Woolf goes as she 
“haunts” the streets on a winter’s evening. But very little of her essay 
is concerned with the places and people she passes or the real-world 
events she encounters along the way. Instead, her essay is more about 
how she interprets those places, people, and events.


Woolf is interested in how she imagines these places, people, and events 
and how they, in turn, imagine her—both the flesh-and-blood person 
and the narrator. Thus, another way to trace the map of Woolf’s mind 
is to consider how it offers interior directions—a chart that isn’t at all 
faithful to the map a cartographer might draw.

14|Becoming a Great Essayist
The map created in 
Virginia Woolf’s “Street 
Haunting” charts both 
the physical world and 
Woolf’s mind.

Lecture 2—Memory Maps and Your Essay’s Direction|15


In the opening sentences of “Street Haunting,” Woolf says that she wants to 
go out and buy a pencil, although she admits that this is only a pretext to 
indulge in what she sees as the “greatest pleasure of town life in winter—
rambling the streets of London.”


Before she ventures out into the twilight, though, Woolf describes her 
own sitting room, a living space that defines and expresses her life. In 
other words, Woolf begins by showing herself as a native. She establishes 
her ethos—her credibility—by talking about how well she knows the ins 
and outs of her flat in Bloomsbury. 


For Woolf, one object that stamps her memory is a blue-and-white china 
bowl on the mantel above her fireplace. It brings to mind a windy day 
in Mantua, Italy, when an old shopkeeper deliberately manipulated Woolf 
into buying the bowl by thrusting it in her hands and saying, “Take it!” 
while adding that the shopkeeper herself would one day end up starving.


The bowl shows that Woolf’s house is a known quantity. In this space, her 
memories are fixed, always tied to her own narrow life. Woolf calls the 
memories that people associate with the places they go to every day the 
“shell-like covering[s] which our souls have excreted to house themselves.”


Once she steps out into the London night, Woolf adopts the ethos of a visitor, 
and as a result, her metaphor for memory radically changes. Whereas before 
she thought of her memories as a shell, now she imagines herself as a “central 
oyster of perceptiveness, an enormous eye.” Taking a winter walk offers Woolf 
the ability to lose herself in other people and places that are ever-changing 
and unfamiliar. 


Woolf refers to these strangers on the sidewalk as an “army of 
anonymous trampers, whose society is so agreeable after the solitude of 
one’s own room.” 


Then, referring to herself—as well as her reader—Woolf states: “The eye 
… floats us smoothly down a stream; resting, pausing, the brain sleeps 
perhaps as it looks.” And it is in this state of pure looking—of taking in 
your surroundings and losing yourself in the process—that Woolf draws 
a distinctly different kind of memory map.


Once Woolf leaves her flat and shuts her front door, it’s possible for us to stroll 
beside her along the pathway of her actual map, where Woolf first transforms 
a small city park called Russell Square into a field of English countryside. The 

16|Becoming a Great Essayist
park is nearby her home, but for a moment, Woolf thinks she’s in the country 
with no buildings at all. By changing this urban park into a rural landscape, 
Woolf starts to alter her own perspective from that of a native to that of a 
visitor. 


Leaving Russell Square, Woolf then turns south along Oxford Street, which 
even today is known for its rows of shops. Striding along, Woolf looks at clothes, 
furniture, and jewelry for sale along the street. As she peers into the shop 
windows, she builds up the rooms of an imaginary house and, just as quickly, 
dismantles them again, under no obligation to possess this house or that one. 


Woolf then glances into a jewelry shop, admiring a string of antique pearls. As 
she thinks about trying on the pearls, she starts to imagine how her life might 
change. 


“Wearing pearls, wearing silk,” Woolf writes, “one steps out on to a 
balcony which overlooks the gardens of sleeping Mayfair. … [And] the 
aged Prime Minister recounts to Lady So-and-So with the curls and 
the emeralds the true history of some great crisis in the affairs of the 
land.”


This moment has a reality television appeal, especially the slippage 
between fact and fiction that transforms an ordinary life into one that’s 
extraordinary, in this case, a life spent in the company of the prime 
minister. 


Again, Woolf is like a visitor within her own city. She intensifies this idea when 
she reminds herself, “But what could be more absurd? It is, in fact, on the stroke 
of six; it is a winter’s evening; we are walking to the Strand to buy a pencil.”


From here, Woolf makes her way to the River Thames before finally arriving 
at the stationers’ shop in the Strand. After witnessing an argument between 
the shopkeeper and his wife, Woolf buys her pencil—which is, of course, a 
symbol of her writing—and heads back to her flat in Bloomsbury.
Lessons from Woolf


What can a modern-day essayist learn from Woolf’s walk about London? 
First of all, the ability to shed your individual, private self to take on a 

Lecture 2—Memory Maps and Your Essay’s Direction|17
wider perspective is crucial for any essayist. Woolf moves from the shell 
to the enormous eye; from being curled up inside her own memories and 
experiences to taking in the sights of the world around her. 


In addition, all essayists must learn how to transform personal memories 
into public ideas if they hope to make points that are relevant to others. 
Woolf steps out of herself to observe what is both strange and familiar 
within just a few steps of her flat in London.


For example, after spying a “dwarf woman” in the boot shop, Woolf’s 
vision abruptly changes. Up to this point, all she saw was beauty. But 
now her eye fixes on nothing but “the humped, the twisted and the 
deformed.” This profound change of mood allows Woolf to look more 
deeply—into the shadows where London’s destitute population lives.


Woolf traces this deeper map to excite empathy on the part of her 
reader. Her highly impressionistic essay also becomes one with sharp 
political points.


Woolf offers writers a second lesson: She demonstrates that chronological 
time is not the way humans experience memory nor the way essays must 
be structured. She plays with an idea that Toni Morrison has defined as 
“rememory.”


In Morrison’s novel Beloved, a character named Sethe explains 
“rememory” in this way: “If a house burns down, it’s gone, but the 
place—the picture of it—stays, and not just in my rememory, but out 
there, in the world.”


In essence, Woolf and Morrison both show writers how pictures 
within the mind create their own places and spaces. This radical notion 
gives imagination an incredible power, suggesting that the way a writer 
sees—then rememories those sights through an essay—can change the 
concrete world beyond words. 


All writers make choices. Once Woolf makes certain choices to show her 
reader specific memory maps of London, she can’t make contradictory or 
otherwise distracting choices. When essayists create an ethos or narrative 
voice, they do so deliberately to influence or affect their readers in a certain 
way. Different words, a different organization, or a different focus would make 
the ethos of Woolf’s “Street Haunting” something else entirely.

18|Becoming a Great Essayist
Assignment: Writing a Memory Map


As an exercise, write your own memory map, drawing together the concepts 
of ethos, memory, imagination, and the ability to map a sense of place that is 
both literal and of the mind.


Start by drawing a concrete map of a specific, meaningful place from your 
past. This pictorial map might be a geography you remember from your 
childhood, adolescence, or young adulthood. Make sure you can draw the 
place in concrete terms; it shouldn’t be only an imagined place but a brick-
and-mortar one, too.


Once you’re done with your visual map, in the margins, list qualities that you 
remember about the people who live there or about the physical features of 
the space itself. Be highly descriptive and tactile. Move beyond the memories 
of sight to sound, taste, touch, and smell. If you’re writing about a sunset, don’t 
just talk about its vibrant hues of orange and purple or its popcorn clouds. 
Imagine what it would be like to touch the sunset—or to taste it. 
Your memory map might 
be of a neighborhood, 
a schoolyard, a building, 
an imaginary world, or a 
foreign place you once 
visited. 

Lecture 2—Memory Maps and Your Essay’s Direction|19


Once you’ve finished your visual map, write a story out of it, either from a 
small corner of the map or from the whole. Don’t edit yourself too much 
or try for anything perfect or polished. Just get your ideas down; brainstorm, 
make notes, or do whatever else you need to do to turn a white page or a 
blank computer screen into a first-draft essay. 


The story need not be long, but keep going if you’re on a roll. And keep 
in mind this definition of “story,” purportedly from Flannery O’Connor: “If 
nothing happens, it’s not a story.” In a story, something needs to happen. 


In the end, your memory map—and the story that comes out of it—will be a 
first go at taking the stuff of your life—your recollections—and turning them 
into a credible and compelling essay.

Lecture 3
Secrets, Confession, and a Writer’s Voice
 T 
he process of writing a draft of an essay—what Aristotle called 
inventio—is rarely a straightforward one. Invention isn’t a set of 
railroad tracks, inviting a traveler to cross the country along an 
elegant, tidy path. Instead, invention is more like walking through a jungle, 
seeing only a thick tangle of leaves a few feet ahead. Sometimes, you get 
stuck and have to backtrack. Sometimes, you’re surprised, stumbling upon 
a snake or glimpsing a crescent moon through the trees. As we’ll see in 
this lecture, the purpose of invention—that first attempt at getting your 
thoughts down on paper and giving them a shape—is to explore and 
discover what your essay wants to be about.
Essayists and Privacy


The writer Patricia Hampl discusses the ethical ramifications of writing in an 
essay called “Other People’s Secrets.” Here, she explores her desire to write 
honest essays and her relationship with her mother.


When Hampl was in her early 30s, she sold her first book of poems, 
and her mother was exuberant. This excitement was tempered, however, 
by Hampl’s revelation that the opening poem concludes with telling the 
world that her mother had epilepsy, a family secret. 


At first, her mother was horrified that her daughter had exposed this 
secret. Yet when Hampl said she’d be willing to cut the poem from the 
book, her mother relented, and the poem stayed in. 


Years later, Hampl asked her mother if giving permission to publish the 
poem was a kind of relief or whether her mother had agreed merely 
because she loved her. Without hesitation, her mother replied, “Because I 
loved you,” then added, “I always hated it.”

Lecture 3—Secrets, Confession, and a Writer’s Voice|21


Hampl says that publishing this poem signals the beginning of what she now 
calls her career of betrayal—meaning that, in writing personal essays and 
memoir, she inevitably tells other people’s secrets now and then or interprets 
their personalities in ways that they find hurtful, incomplete, or simply wrong. 


On the one hand, Hampl is trying to have an open conversation about an 
ethical dilemma that most essayists must consider at some point: just how 
responsible a writer must be about other people’s privacy. Yet Hampl is also 
talking about the transition between a process of pure invention and the 
complete first draft of an essay. 


When she gets to the point of starting to contour an initial draft into 
something more clearly defined—less about the self and more about 
the world—Hampl says that her next draft must be a “new seeing of the 
materials of the first draft. Nothing merely cosmetic will do.” 


In essence, when she arrives at her second draft, she must consider her 
readers: what will move them, what will convince them, and what might 
anger, irritate, or bore them.
Invention


To quote Aristotle, invention is the faculty or power of “discovering in the 
particular case what are the available means of persuasion.” 


For Aristotle, whether we communicate verbally, through writing, or even 
using body language, we are attempting to persuade someone else to listen 
to us, to believe us, or to react. Even more important is Aristotle’s belief that a 
speaker or a writer discovers the available means of persuasion.


Discovery suggests that writers are consciously aware of how and why 
they want to communicate; any piece of communication is, thus, a carefully 
considered process among the writer, the intended audience, and the subject 
matter. Writers have something important to say—their truth; thus, they must 
discover or choose the best available means by which to convey that truth. It’s 
this attention to discovering the best persuasive elements that takes a writer 
through a process of what Aristotle called invention. 

22|Becoming a Great Essayist


To invent is not to make something up. Instead, “invention” means figuring 
out how to get your ideas before your reader, then persuading that reader to 
take them seriously. In other words, invention is a combination of that magic 
synthesis between a writer’s memory and imagination that then evolves into 
a deliberate selection of words, imagery, information, quotations, a structure, 
and a tone that will create the most compelling effects on a reader. 


In considering these elements, writers are required not only to think about 
what examples, evidence, anecdotes, or images will be credible but must 
also weigh the potential consequences of what they’re arguing or what they 
Although the primary 
mode of communication 
in ancient Greece 
was oral, not written, 
Aristotle saw all 
discourse as persuasive. 

Lecture 3—Secrets, Confession, and a Writer’s Voice|23
might reveal in their essays. Once writers get their raw ideas on the page, 
then they must be mindful that every choice they make in an essay must be 
true to the essay’s purpose.


In the case of Hampl’s story about disclosing her mother’s epilepsy, she makes 
careful rhetorical choices to arrive at her main point, which is, actually, not to 
confess that she wronged her mother in hopes of absolution. Rather, her essay’s 
central purpose is to consider the age-old tension between silence, which is 
dependent on privacy, and expression, which is dependent on revelation. 


Another prominent essayist, Dinty Moore, writes about a similar topic in his 
piece entitled “The Deeper End of the Quarry.” Yet Moore ultimately comes to a 
different conclusion about whether it’s better to choose expression over silence. 


Whereas Hampl makes the case that, in the end, interpreting our own 
pasts through writing is the best means we humans have of creating a 
collective sense of history and witness, in Moore’s essay, he explains why 
sometimes a writer should keep quiet. 


Specifically, Moore couldn’t finish a book he was working on about 
raising a daughter in America’s “girl-poisoning culture,” even after five 
years’ worth of research and writing. 


Although Moore agrees that the duty of the writer is to “view the world 
with no filters over the eyes,” when it came to writing about how he and 
his preteen daughter grappled with sexism and the objectification of girls 
in American popular culture, he felt that he just couldn’t be honest, at 
least not on the page. Such honesty would mean that he would have to 
judge and find fault in his own child. 
Essayists’ Choices


From a rhetorical perspective, it’s interesting to think about how Hampl and 
Moore come at their arguments from both sides of the expression/silence 
coin. In particular, it’s useful to examine the choices they make in their word 
choice and form. The opposite decisions that these two essayists make either 
to reveal or to conceal their families’ dirty laundry illuminate how essayists 
take up distinct modes of invention in seeking to express disparate points and, 
thus, create different approaches to achieving ethos or credibility as writers. 

24|Becoming a Great Essayist


For example, toward the end of Hampl’s essay, as she’s bringing together her 
main ideas, she writes:
[My mother’s] passage through this life, the shape she too has 
made of things, her visions, the things she alone knows … I can see 
now that she was standing up for the truth of her experience, the 
literal fact of it, how it jerked and twisted not only her body but her 
life, how it truly seized her. My poem and I—we merely fingered 
the thing, casually displaying it for the idle passerby. What she 
knows and how she knows it must not be taken from her.


Here, the diction is more literary or formal, and Hampl uses metaphor 
and sense-based imagery. She plays on the double meaning of the word 
“seized,” and she uses the precision of the verbs “jerked” and “twisted” to 
re-create the sensation for a reader of what a physical and an emotional 
seizure might be like. Because the main point of her essay is complex, it 
makes sense that her language level and imagery are also complex. 


Yet Hampl also wishes to speak to a wide audience, to touch universal 
human experience. Thus, she also uses more informal diction, with such 
words as “things,” “knows,” and “life.” The final sentence, made up almost 
entirely of monosyllable words, is accessible but also emphatic. 


In a passage from Moore’s essay in which he is also synthesizing his main 
points, he has a couple of instances of elevated diction, but for the most 
part, his word choice is conversational. Because his essay is about how he 
struggled and failed to write a book about his day-to-day life raising a girl, this 
conversational diction is true to his essay’s purpose.
Returning to Aristotle


Once Hampl and Moore knew what they wanted to write about and made 
distinct choices about their essays’ diction and form, other options were no 
longer available to them. 


Moore couldn’t write a long, meandering essay about silence, chockful of 
digressions and arresting metaphors. To do so would belie his purpose. 

Lecture 3—Secrets, Confession, and a Writer’s Voice|25


In turn, Hampl couldn’t craft a brief, colloquial essay to probe the 
messiness of individual memory in the face of history. That tone and 
approach wouldn’t serve her sweeping yet nuanced points. 


And it’s these self-imposed rhetorical limitations that help explain and 
determine how Hampl and Moore’s respective essays develop in the 
way they do and why their voices just aren’t the same.


And their voices shouldn’t be the same, not if their desire is to further their 
ethos or credibility with their readers. In both cases, these writers are dishing 
up dirt on other people. But an essayist’s ethos shouldn’t be built on gossip or 
telling other people’s tales. For different reasons and with distinct purposes in 
mind, both Hampl and Moore had to think about what it means to be both 
ethical and credible when writing about others.


As you follow your own process of invention, you’ll also need to realize that, 
regardless of what you choose to write about, in seeking stories and writing 
them down, you’re becoming a kind of history keeper. 


Whatever you put into your essays will be but a version of the truth, not 
the whole truth, and you’ll have to acknowledge your limitations. 


Even more, if you choose to reveal family dysfunction or the irritating 
quirks of your friends, you’ll need to ask whether you’re doing so for the 
right reasons. Your goal should be to witness the imperfect and messy 
but also the beautiful and miraculous experience of the human. 


As long as you keep that intention, you’ll inevitably create a strong ethos, 
selecting the right words and putting those words into the right order to 
develop a workable structure.

Lecture 4
The Skeptical Essayist: Conflicting Views
 A 
t times, writers contradict themselves. Sometimes, they change 
their minds about what they once thought was true; at other times, 
they realize that their ideas are inconsistent. And once in a while, 
writers deliberately reverse course. On more than one occasion, Socrates 
argued against himself, switching sides to test all parts of a claim. Socrates 
called his imaginary contrarian the “man who is always refuting me.” Debate 
teams, political strategists, and defense lawyers have long borrowed this 
technique to poke holes in their own lines of reasoning and learn how their 
opponents might try to undermine them. As we’ll see in this lecture, an 
essayist can also benefit from taking on the stance of the refuting man or 
woman. 
Elastic Thinking


A primary reason to avoid being too one-sided as a writer is that keeping a 
number of possibilities in play enables you to think creatively. In a foreword 
to the 2012 edition of The Best American Essays, Robert Atwan argues that 
successful essayists “like to examine—or, to use [a] favorite term, consider—
topics from various perspectives.” 


Even if a writer ultimately comes down on one side or the other of an issue, 
it’s still compelling and potentially surprising to consider multiple perspectives 
along the way. Doing so develops an elasticity of mind, an ability to appreciate 
both nuance and complexity that helps deepen an essay’s range of ideas. 


Elastic thinking also ensures that a writer won’t become a ranting partisan—a 
Joseph McCarthy or a Hunter S. Thompson that a majority of readers would 

Lecture 4—The Skeptical Essayist: Conflicting Views|27
probably dismiss. Writers who are empathetic to both sides of an issue and 
consider several versions of the same story can build their ethos and bring 
readers more firmly into their camp.
Memories of a Catholic Girlhood by Mary McCarthy


In 1957, Mary McCarthy published an astonishing memoir called Memories of 
a Catholic Girlhood, in which she becomes her own refuting woman, dealing 
directly with competing versions of the same events. 


The book is astonishing for two reasons. First, McCarthy didn’t wince when 
she related the abuse she and her siblings endured at the hands of relatives 
who took them in after they were orphaned. Second, McCarthy tells her 
story straight before telling it slant. In other words, after she reveals aspects 
of her terrible childhood, she criticizes her own recollections, offering them 
up to scrutiny. As one reviewer noted, McCarthy’s reversals are particularly 
powerful because of her “remarkable candor.” At one point in her book, she 
simply states, “There are several dubious points in this memoir.”


McCarthy’s memoir is a watershed book for modern-day essayists. Rather 
than allowing herself to invent a truth for the sake of a good story, she 
confesses that she must have made up or misremembered various details and 
events. In cataloging factual mistakes and admitting moments of pure fancy, 
McCarthy reveals her own fallibility, making her writing vulnerable. 


But this method doesn’t qualify her ethos; she doesn’t seem wishy-washy or 
capricious. Instead, she comes across as an elastic thinker. By criticizing her 
own desire to edit and shape her past experiences, McCarthy strengthens her 
credibility as a narrator.


Perhaps the most striking section from Memories of a Catholic Girlhood is a 
chapter called “A Tin Butterfly,” which was published as a standalone essay in 
The New Yorker. It is a disturbing piece in which McCarthy tells of the physical 
and psychological abuse she and her brothers received from their foster 
parents, Aunt Margaret and Uncle Myers. In essays, moments of violence are 
often handled in sensationalistic, clichéd, and one-sided ways, but in “A Tin 

28|Becoming a Great Essayist
In her book Memories of 
a Catholic Girlhood, Mary 
McCarthy is honest and raw 
with her memories, trying 
to tell it like it was, calmly 
and with detail—which was 
quite revolutionary for the 
late 1950s when the book 
appeared.

Lecture 4—The Skeptical Essayist: Conflicting Views|29
Butterfly,” McCarthy provides contrasting views, and this approach makes her 
horrific experiences all the more affecting and believable.


Early on in the piece, McCarthy paints unflattering pictures of her foster 
parents. Uncle Myers is brutish and wears a sweat-stained “wife-beater,” 
while Aunt Margaret has corrugated, prune-like skin. McCarthy links her 
uncle’s rough looks and her aunt’s prim lack of fashion to their respective 
methods of abuse, which are revealed later. 


As her essay unfolds, McCarthy relates multiple examples of how 
Margaret and Myers mistreated her and her brothers. Because Uncle 
Myers was suspicious of education, Mary wasn’t allowed to read. Candy 
was forbidden, as were toys. On winter weekends, Mary and her brothers 
had to play outside for six hours each day; frozen and miserable, they 
stood in the snow, crying. 


Myers and Margaret also beat the children. When Mary won a prize at 
school for an essay she wrote, her uncle took her into the basement 
bathroom and beat her with a razor strop—as McCarthy explains, “to 
teach me a lesson, he said, lest I become stuck-up.” Other beatings often 
came without any clear reason or excuse. 


As the culmination of this appalling treatment, McCarthy tells the story 
of a tin butterfly pin that her youngest brother, Sheridan, got from the 
bottom of a Cracker Jack box. A week later, however, the pin went 
missing, and without any evidence, Myers claimed that Mary had stolen it.


Both her aunt and uncle insisted that Mary admit her guilt, but she 
refused, standing up to them for the first time. Ultimately, she was beaten 
by Margaret and Myers, and although she came close to admitting a 
crime she hadn’t committed, in the end, she swore that she never took 
the butterfly. Eventually, the beating stopped. “I finally limped up to bed,” 
she writes, “with a crazy sense of inner victory, like a saint’s, for I had not 
recanted, despite all they had done or could do to me.” 


At first blush, McCarthy’s essay seems to be about goodness triumphing 
over evil, but that wasn’t her central purpose. She goes on to relate a 
moment many years later, after she and her brothers were rescued by 
their Protestant grandfather, and McCarthy went away to college. Her 
brother Preston told her that he had seen Uncle Myers planting the 
evidence of the tin butterfly to implicate Mary in its theft.


This stunning revelation concludes the first part of the essay, a moment 
that reveals the full extent of Myers’s cruelty. There’s a satisfaction that

comes with such conclusions, one that’s mirrored in myths, fairytales, and 
classic fiction when, say, Little Red Riding Hood outwits the Big Bad Wolf. 
When a bad guy is punished, a mystery is solved, and good people live 
happily ever after, such stories reverberate with the pleasure of resolution, 
one that speaks to our human need to make order out of chaos. 


If “A Tin Butterfly” had stopped there, McCarthy’s ending would have followed 
that of a Victorian novel or a Hollywood blockbuster. Yet real life rarely allows 
for such gratifying outcomes. More often than not, life is middling and messy, 
and the second part of McCarthy’s essay explores such ambiguity. 


In the second part of her essay, McCarthy turns to outside sources 
to try to verify her own memories. But by consulting her siblings and 
other family members, her memories are undermined rather than 
strengthened. 


“About the tin butterfly episode, I must make a … serious correction 
or at least express a doubt,” she admits. “An awful suspicion occurred 
In the essay “A Tin 
Butterfly,” McCarthy’s 
brother finds a trinket 
in a box of Cracker 
Jack and uses it to make 
his siblings jealous.

to me. … I suddenly remembered that in college I had started writing a 
play of this subject. Could the idea that Uncle Myers put the butterfly at 
my place have been suggested to me by my teacher?” 


After this realization, McCarthy checks with her brother Kevin and again 
with Preston, but neither remembers. Although she remains certain that 
she and her siblings talked over the butterfly affair one evening, McCarthy 
confesses, “I do not know, really, whether I took the course in Playwriting 
before or after [that] night. … [And t]he most likely thing, I fear, is that I 
fused two memories. Mea culpa.”


With that phrase “mea culpa,” McCarthy potentially frustrates her 
readers, thwarting any hope of a tidy ending. Interestingly, her readers are 
also implicated in McCarthy’s doubts. They experienced moral outrage 
at Myers’s duplicity at the end of the first part of her essay, but they now 
feel unnerved and unsettled—unsure whether their first conclusion was 
the right one. 


Further, because McCarthy provides her contrasting views through 
interviews with family members, she accrues credibility as a writer 
who is willing to suspend her own desires in favor of seeking the truth. 
Even though her readers are denied the pleasure of a simple, satisfying 
ending with a clear hero and an exposed villain, McCarthy’s readiness 
to throw herself under the proverbial bus makes her essay even more 
convincing and realistic. In weakening her own conclusions, she winds up 
strengthening her overall ethos.


By having her refuting woman write an addendum to “A Tin Butterfly,” 
McCarthy not only re-creates a productive tension between fact and truth, 
but she also takes on a kind of double vision. And this double vision enables 
her and her readers to adopt a dual consciousness: to see Myers as a villain 
and McCarthy as a hero but also both of them as a mess of contradictory 
desires and actions, in which neither one is fully good or bad. 
Assignment: Refuting Your Work


Using a first draft of an essay that you’ve already written, take on the role 
of the refuting man or woman. Imagine that you disagree with your own 
recollections and suppositions. Scrutinize your own statements and assertions. 

32|Becoming a Great Essayist
Do you know for sure that the information you’re providing is accurate, or are 
you merely assuming that it is? Be skeptical about any conclusions that you’ve 
drawn. Are your resolutions convenient for you as the narrator of your own 
piece? Do they cast you in a flattering light and leave the wrinkles and warts 
of others exposed? 


To help strengthen your refuting position, you might interview others who 
experienced the same events you did. Then, just as McCarthy did, write a 
second part to your own essay, one in which you question everything that 
you’ve declared or solved in the first part. Your aim shouldn’t be to overturn 
anything or to flip your reader’s mind the other way. Instead, in the words of 
Robert Atwan, your job is to consider, not to conclude.


Try to keep both sides of your story or both halves of your argument in 
tension with each other. In the end, the point of taking on the role of the 
Socratic refuting man or woman is to show that no matter what story we tell 
or what case we make, we writers are all human. In fact, it’s our humanness—
our limitations and our ignorance as much as our knowledge and insight—
that can make us into astonishing, absorbing essayists.

Lecture 5
The Reasonable Essayist: Artistic Proofs
 W 
hether essayists are humorous or heartrending, conversational 
or bookish, a reader must believe that these writers are 
reasonable if their points are to have resonance or the 
potential to change a reader’s mind. To turn to sources other than 
yourself—what Aristotle called “non-artistic proofs,” such as interviews, 
data, quotations, or photographs—is one way to appear reasonable, 
because this strategy incorporates other people’s voices and lends 
objectivity to your essay. Yet there are also “artistic proofs” that come from 
within yourself, from expertise you’ve gained through direct observation 
and experience—through both feeling and thinking. 
Richard Steele and Joseph Addison


As we’ve said, ethos, or the ethical appeal, is the most important kind of 
artistic proof, but another vital appeal is logos: the development of coherent 
and convincing arguments achieved through both inductive and deductive 
reasoning. To understand logical appeals through inductive and deductive 
means, let’s look at the work of two British essayists who were masters of the 
reasonable essay in the early 1700s, Richard Steele and Joseph Addison. 


In 1709, Steele started a society and literary journal called The Tatler, in 
which he, along with Addison, published essays about their observations 
and judgments of society. Just two years later, the two launched yet another 
periodical named The Spectator, this time, with a fictional narrator who was 
part of an imaginary group called the Spectator Club. 

34|Becoming a Great Essayist
Joseph Addison (shown) and 
Richard Steele started their writing 
careers at the same time that 
middle-class Londoners began to 
visit coffee and chocolate houses, 
gathering to enjoy a drink and 
discuss issues of the day.

Lecture 5—The Reasonable Essayist: Artistic Proofs|35


Although both journals were dismissed by some as nothing more than gossip 
rags, The Tatler and The Spectator became instant hits. In particular, they 
featured essays on what it meant to be civilized: how to dress, eat, think, and 
converse like people of manners. 
Inductive Reasoning


“Inductive reasoning” is thinking that moves from particular information, 
pieces of evidence, or case studies to a more general conclusion. It is the basis 
of the scientific method—an approach that always starts with specific data or 
experiments to arrive at more broad-based theories and explanations. 


Whenever we engage in inductive reasoning—no matter how many examples 
or pieces of data we have—at some point, we must make an inductive leap 
from particular instances to a more broad-based conclusion. 


It’s important to note that although the conclusion of a deductive argument 
is certain, the validity of the conclusion is only probable—based on the 
given evidence. An essayist working through an inductive argument must be 
convincing in how he or she builds the case.
“The Trial of the Petticoat” by Joseph Addison


Addison’s “The Trial of the Petticoat” is a persuasive piece arguing against the 
fashion of enormous hoop petticoats that were all the rage in his time. In the 
essay, Addison starts by creating the fictitious context of a legal proceeding. 
As the mock trial is about to begin, however, the criminal can’t fit through the 
door because of her enormous petticoat. 


Given that hoop petticoats weren’t comfortable, cheap, or convenient, they 
were obviously meant to symbolize the wealth and status of the wearer. 
Addison strikes at the heart of the quixotic nature of such fashions when he 
asks the criminal why she would wear such a crazy thing, and she answers, “that 
she had a mind to look as big and burly as other persons of her quality …; that 
if she laid it aside, people would think she was not made like other women.”

36|Becoming a Great Essayist


With this introduction of the essay’s main purpose—to consider whether it’s 
truly civilized to wear impractical clothing in the name of fashion—Addison 
puts forward the arguments on both sides of the issue. 


The counselors on behalf of the petticoat point out that the owners 
of British woolen mills, rope manufacturers, and whalers all profit from 
the petticoats, which use these materials in prodigious amounts. This 
argument follows a line of inductive reasoning, demonstrating how this 
undergarment supports specific industries and British trade as a whole. 


The petticoat’s counsel then concludes with a zinger, noting that the 
“weight and unwieldiness of the garment … might be of great use to 
preserve the honor of families.”


Addison then takes up the other side of the case, also following an inductive 
argument. He first points out that men have gone more into debt because 
they must purchase expensive petticoats for their wives and daughters. 


He then contends that even though British manufacturers might get 
richer producing materials for petticoats, the poor will get poorer. Old 
dresses will no longer be handed down to the poor but will be cut 
up and made into even more petticoats. Ultimately, Addison finishes by 
saying that while petticoated virgins might not be seduced as easily, such 
sexual frustration might prove too successful, and young women will 
remain unmarried. 


Addison touches on each of these particulars to address the two main 
points of his challengers: that hoop petticoats add to the nation’s wealth 
and that they protect women’s virtue. On the contrary, Addison argues, 
this ridiculous fashion drains wealth from British citizens and undermines 
marriage. His final inductive leap is clear: Such petticoats should not be 
allowed in respectable social circles. 


Throughout the essay, Addison is clever with his logos. Although it’s absurd 
to believe that a hoop petticoat could alter the national economy or make 
a difference in whether people have sex, Addison’s application of inductive 
reasoning isn’t actually meant to convince his reader on either of these points. 
Instead, he’s applying a highly rational approach to expose just how irrational 
this garment is. 

Lecture 5—The Reasonable Essayist: Artistic Proofs|37


Addison makes his rhetorical choices deliberately, playing on society’s staunch 
belief in the validity of rational thinking yet giving his astute middle-class 
readers an idea of just how unreasonable wealthy people can be. By the end 
of his essay, Addison briefly drops the veil of cool, rational logos and calls 
the hoop petticoat a “monstrous invention,” revealing his true purpose: to 
expose the atrocity of the rich who flaunt their peacock feathers in the name 
of status. Addison hopes to teach his audience to be women and men of 
substance, not surface.
“The Gentleman; The Pretty Fellow” by Richard Steele


In another Tatler essay about what makes for a gentleman versus a rogue, 
Steele follows a deductive process of reasoning. This essay starts by defining 
two general types of men: A Gentleman is a man of good judgment, one 
who displays his superior discernment in how he converses with others. In 
contrast, the Pretty Fellow is artificial and consumed by his own vanity. 


After Steele offers these broad definitions, he then gives his readers two 
examples: One is a character named Sophronius, and the other is Jack Dimple. 
According to Steele, Sophronius enters a room looking directly forward, 
while Jack must repeatedly admire himself in the mirror. With this deductive 
reasoning process, Steele defines his terms and applies them to a specific 
case, thus illustrating his point with both elegance and clarity.


Deduction is epitomized by the “syllogism,” a form of reasoning that draws 
a conclusion from two premises—a major premise and a minor one—both 
of which are assumed to be true. Aristotle’s famous example of syllogistic 
reasoning is this: 
All men are mortal [major premise]. 
Socrates in a man [minor premise]. 
Socrates must be mortal. 


With deductive reasoning, then, the conclusion is certain, although that 
doesn’t necessarily mean that the conclusion is either true or ethical. Veracity 
depends on whether the premises are true and ethical.

38|Becoming a Great Essayist


For Steele’s essay on the Gentleman, he builds his deductive arguments 
around two linked syllogisms. The first is this:
A Gentleman is a man of good judgment. 
Sophronius has good judgment. 
Sophronius is a Gentleman. 
The second is this:
A Pretty Fellow mimics how a gentleman looks and speaks.
Jack Dimple mimics the look and speech of Gentlemen.
Jack Dimple is a Pretty Fellow.


If it’s true that Gentlemen have good judgment and Sophronius has this trait, 
then the conclusion that he’s a Gentleman must be accurate. But it’s easy to 
see how this kind of reasoning could be manipulated. For one thing, who’s to 
say what counts as good or bad judgment? And how could we know for sure 
that Sophronius isn’t impersonating a Gentleman? 


The potential dangers of deduction become all the more obvious if we 
consider how syllogistic reasoning has facilitated such horrors as the Holocaust 
or American slavery. Adolf Hitler built his Final Solution around a deductive 
process, believing that Aryan people constituted a superior race, that Jewish 
people weren’t of this race, and therefore, that Jewish people were inferior—
and should be exterminated. 
“Tense Present”


Like Addison and Steele, David Foster Wallace is often touted as an arbiter 
of modern American culture. In his essay “Tense Present: Democracy, English, 
and the Wars over Usage,” he grapples with controversies concerning English 
language usage.


In the essay, Wallace speaks of the advice he gives his student writers who 
speak Standard Black English. In one-on-one conferences with these students, 

Lecture 5—The Reasonable Essayist: Artistic Proofs|39
Wallace claims that he requires them to master Standard Written English 
(SWE) or, in his words, “Standard White English.” According to Wallace, he 
tells his students, “I’m respecting you enough here to give you what I believe is 
the straight truth. In this country, SWE is perceived as the dialect of education 
and intelligence and power and prestige, and anybody of any race, ethnicity, 
religion, or gender who wants to succeed in American culture has got to be 
able to use SWE.”


On a purely logical level, Wallace is being completely reasonable, following 
a line of deductive reasoning. He offers a major premise: that SWE is “the 
dialect of the American elite.” Then, he gives a minor premise: that his black 
students often speak and write in their own dialect. As a result, the black 
students are not and cannot be members of the American elite until they 
learn how to write and speak SWE.


As might be imagined, Wallace’s advice wasn’t always appreciated by his black 
students. And he ultimately learned a point that all essayists must keep in mind: 
Our logos is never applied in a cultural vacuum. As Wallace puts it, “I allowed 
the substance and style of my Logical Appeal to completely torpedo my Ethical 
Appeal.” A writer’s ethos—all that makes up his or her identity—will inevitably 
determine whether his or her logos will be seen as fair and measured.


Wallace’s story also gives essayists yet another lesson about how to be 
reasonable in our writing. In turning the tables on his own story and flipping 
his own logical process, he actually reestablishes his ethos. Wallace makes 
himself more credible in admitting that he was being reasonable to a fault.

Lecture 6
The Unreasonable Essayist: Strategic Irony
 R 
easonable writers gain a built-in ethos as a result of their lucid 
arguments, evenhandedness, and smart yet familiar style, but 
there are times when essayists choose to be unreasonable, telling 
their truths slant rather than straight. Sometimes, an unreasonable writer 
is provocative by design, such as when David Foster Wallace wants his 
readers to question negative political ads. Sometimes, unreasonable writers 
use demagoguery to play on readers’ prejudices, such as 19th-century anti-
abolitionists who catalogued the benefits of slavery in newspaper essays. 
And still other times, a writer’s lack of reason is an effective form of 
irony. This ironic unreasonableness can be most interesting because it’s a 
backward way to build your ethos, arguing the opposite of what you intend.
“Eat Your Pets” by Ellen Meloy


Ellen Meloy was a staunch environmentalist and a nature writer who died 
suddenly in 2004. Her observant and funny essays were chiefly about the 
American West, the place where she lived and worked. 


In a darkly comic piece called “Eat Your Pets,” Meloy uses a tone of sharp irony 
to show the virtual impossibility of living off the land, at least for modern 
urbanites. Meloy’s intent is to demonstrate that virtually all her readers are 
reliant on industrialized agriculture, even those of us who frequent farmers’ 
markets, eat local and seasonal foods, and buy organic products. In order to 
eat off the grid, Meloy claims that a city slicker or even most modern-day 
farmers would have no choice but to prepare and consume taboo foods, 
including roadkill, rodents, and pets. 

Lecture 6—The Unreasonable Essayist: Strategic Irony|41


Although we might be aghast at Meloy’s solution to pulling us back from what 
she calls our society’s “ecocidal brink,” her tone deserves some attention. 
She’s mocking her own subject and, to a certain extent, her readers and even 
herself. As mentioned earlier, a reasonable essayist gets instant credibility for 
being thoughtful, balanced, clear, and open-minded, but because Meloy is being 
deliberately unreasonable, her ethos is more complex. 


Contributing to Meloy’s complex ethos are her thick diction and imagery. She 
chooses unusual nouns and verbs, such as “throttled,” “gnawed,” “stalactites,” 
and “incite,” which take a moment for a reader to process. She also uses 
strange imagery that can pull a reader up short. And because it takes some 
work to read, her sardonic tone is not immediately obvious. 	


Meloy’s unusual diction and imagery also get her reader to reexamine—and, 
thus, rethink—the urban landscape, as well as people’s relationship to what 
they put on their kitchen tables. Yet because her tone is ironic, she also seems 
to implicate her readers and even herself for being complacent participants in 
this broken environment. 
In her essay “Eat Your Pets,” 
Ellen Meloy uses strange 
imagery that can pull a reader 
up short; for example, she 
describes herself in a traffic jam 
as “slumped over the wheel, 
dripping stalactites of drool.” 

42|Becoming a Great Essayist


Meloy’s simply yet sardonic conclusion—“Eat your pets!”—reveals the 
genius of her unreasonable ethos. At first, readers may laugh uncomfortably, 
imagining what it would be like to eat their hamsters, cats, or dogs. Then, a 
reader may realize that what we think is edible or inedible is a fairly arbitrary 
distinction. There are societies that consume dogs, after all, as well as cats, 
hamsters, and songbirds. 


Further, although a reader never really believes that Meloy is going to eat 
a retriever, the irony of foodies calling themselves “local” and “sustainable” 
eaters becomes clear. In fact, much of Meloy’s essay is an indictment of how 
so much about American food and foodways has become class-based and 
inequitable. The unreasonableness of Meloy’s ethos is the very tool that allows 
her readers to see their own unreasonableness and complacency when it 
comes to what we eat and where it comes from.
“A Modest Proposal” by Jonathan Swift


Jonathan Swift’s “A Modest Proposal” is now a legendary essay, although it was 
published as an unassuming pamphlet back in 1729. According to the subtitle, 
the piece was meant to help prevent the “Children of Poor People in Ireland 
from Being a Burden on Their Parents, or the Country, and for Making Them 
Beneficial to the Public.” 


At first blush, the essay seems like a reasonable one, particularly because 
Swift’s tone is replete with what we now call governmentese. This innocuous 
tone, coupled with the fact that the essay itself uses the rigorous logic of 
classical argumentation, makes it all the more surprising when Swift details his 
appalling proposal. 


The proposal is simple: Because Ireland is suffering from overpopulation, 
poverty, and famine and because an Irish baby is, according to Swift, a 
wholesome and tasty food, a readily available means to take care of Ireland’s 
national crisis is for wealthy Englishmen to buy and eat surplus Irish babies. 
Though his suggestion is shocking, Swift’s adoption of a measured tone, 
coupled with rational argumentation, makes it seem as though a reader’s 
assent is inevitable. 

Lecture 6—The Unreasonable Essayist: Strategic Irony|43


At the time, Ireland was an English colony, economically and politically 
dependent on Great Britain, and the English benefitted greatly from this 
inequitable relationship. Keeping Ireland weak enabled England to plunder its 
resources, tax its citizens, and offer little or no assistance for the country’s 
unemployment and food shortages. In a sense, the English were devouring the 
Irish, consuming their land and wealth. 
Jonathan Swift’s “A Modest 
Proposal” is a simultaneous 
indictment of the exploitive 
English and a call to arms 
for the exploited Irish.

44|Becoming a Great Essayist


Swift decided to literalize this metaphor, suggesting that the English might as 
well actually eat the Irish, given that they were doing it anyway. This dreadful 
idea enabled Swift to shame England for its greed and inhumanity and shock 
members of the Irish Parliament into trying to do something about the 
nation’s plight.


Swift crafts his argument as a Ciceronian oration, named for the Roman 
orator Marcus Tullius Cicero. 


In a Ciceronian oration, speakers or writers establish their ethos through 
the first four parts: an exordium, presenting the topic as worthy of 
consideration; a narratio, necessary background information on the issue; 
a propositio, in which a position is taken; and a partitio, in which major 
arguments are outlined. 


From here, logos is displayed in the confirmatio, confirmation of the 
authors’ positions through persuasion and outside evidence, and the 
refutatio, in which narrators preempt disagreements by addressing 
potential objections. Pathos is engaged in the digressio, which includes 
a story, anecdote, extended metaphor, or allegory that brings the main 
point home. Finally, authors reestablish their ethos in the peroratio, which 
attempts to address why readers or listeners should care about the issue. 


Swift’s obvious choice to mimic a Ciceronian oration would not have 
been lost on an audience of educated politicians in Ireland and England. 
Yet Swift’s purpose is radically opposed to his essay’s structure; although 
the structure is rational, his purpose is unreasonable. The inevitable result 
of such a disconnect between form and function is satire.


The sharpest stings of Swift’s satire and the climax of his argument come at 
the end of his essay. In his refutatio, at first, he declines to let any man talk to 
him of “other expedients,” then proceeds to list those very ideas, including the 
numerous proposals Swift himself had already made to members of the Irish 
Parliament to help alleviate starvation and poverty. 


Even more importantly, in Swift’s peroratio, he turns almost serious, asking 
what other way might be found to provide food and clothing for the Irish 
poor. He then goes on to say that even the parents of poor children would 
prefer his solution to their current hardships. 

Lecture 6—The Unreasonable Essayist: Strategic Irony|45


In the final move of his essay, Swift piles on the suffering in order to pull back 
the curtain and show his reader the stark truth: that the Irish poor would 
be better off dead. Yet the cycle of poverty that Swift has just enumerated is 
clearly an endless one—a cycle that doesn’t actually cease with death. 


Swift’s concluding paragraph returns to the dry, distanced narrator he 
established early on, and he claims that he himself has no children by which he 
can “propose to get a single penny.” In other words, Swift cannot be attacked 
as self-serving, and a reader must believe him when he says that he has “no 
other motive than the public good of my country.” 


Of course, this claim to an ethos of altruism twists the knife of irony 
because Swift really is interested in the public good of his country. Yet he 
has other motives, too. By channeling his unreasonable argumentation 
through this reasonable rhetorical form, he makes it plain just how 
monstrous it is that nothing has been done to help these people. 


And as readers move through his Ciceronian oration, they realize—with 
horror—how cold and inhumane it is that, in fact, the Irish poor are 
being consumed, left to a fate worse than death. 


Swift has another motive, as well: He gets to castigate the government 
officials who have allowed such cannibalism to occur. At one level, then, 
his scathing satire is a way of conveying his own anger and frustration 
through a highly controlled means. At another level, it’s a way for Swift 
to show his primary audience—members of the Irish and British 
parliaments—that it is within their power to do something. 
Assignment: Practicing Unreasonableness


To try your own hand and unreasonableness in writing, choose a controversial 
issue that you’d like to address, such as whether teachers should be allowed 
to have guns in their classrooms or whether super-PACs should be allowed to 
bankroll political campaigns. Whatever issue you choose, make sure that your 
central point is to try and expose hypocrisy, greed, or bias at a national level. 
And don’t choose an amorphous, generalized problem, such as hate crimes 
or teenage suicide. Your issue must be specific enough that you can mount an 
argument for or against it.

46|Becoming a Great Essayist


Then draft an essay in which 
you take a clear stance on your 
issue and offer up a corrupt or 
outrageous solution to this national 
problem, although you should make 
sure that your solution is technically 
feasible. No solution should involve 
magic, supernatural events, or space 
aliens. Remember: hypothetically 
speaking, we could eat our pets or 
children. And even though these 
aren’t reasonable ways to solve our 
environmental problems or poverty, 
it’s certainly possible to do them.


While writing your draft, think 
carefully about either your tone or 
your form. 


If you want primarily to work 
on 
developing 
an 
ironic 
tone, craft a narrator who 
talks about the problem in a 
seemingly rational way, even 
though the solution is clearly 
absurd. 


If, in contrast, you’d like to try manipulating a practical format into 
something it’s not meant to do, choose a structure for your draft that 
already exists in the world—ideally, one that’s organized through logos. 
Select a type of document that has a recognizable and straightforward 
structure and copy that structure, but make sure that the structure 
doesn’t at all fit what you’re arguing. And remember that when form 
doesn’t fit function, satire is almost effortless. 
From “Eat Your Pets” by 
Ellen Meloy
Standing in a million acres of 
remote, roadless, rock-throttled, 
moisture-sucked, lizard-gnawed 
Utah desert, I think back to a 
recent time in California, stuck on 
a freeway out of Santa Barbara, 
three lanes of halted cars spewing 
several millennia of fossilized plant 
beds from their exhausts, the 
fumes popping my few remaining 
chromosomes like bubble wrap, 
nearly knocking me unconscious 
so that if the traffic ever did move 
again, I, slumped over the steering 
wheel, dripping stalactites of drool 
onto the rental car’s tasteful silver 
shag carpet, would incite gridlock 
anew, and [other drivers, their 
bloodstreams raging with espresso,] 
would hate me and start shooting.

Lecture 7
The Empathetic Essayist: Evoking Emotion
 P 
athos, Aristotle’s final artistic proof, is the appeal to an audience’s 
emotions—the empathy the writer has for his or her subject. 
Sometimes, pathos is tied to logos to make the logic of an argument 
more attractive. Other times, pathos is key to strengthening a writer’s 
ethos. It’s a powerful thing to feel a strong emotional connection with a 
writer, and such a connection can build trust between author and reader. 
Even though pathos is a potent and effective rhetorical appeal, as we’ll see 
in this lecture, it may also be the hardest for an essayist to use.
False Pathos


In the late 20th century, the Swiss chocolate corporation Nestlé introduced a 
new product called Nescafé Ice Java. One ad for this product, featured in Jane 
magazine, showed photographs of two men and two women watching an 
old film on an urban rooftop and enjoying coffee drinks. Everything about the 
ad—from its colors and fonts to its copy—reinforced the idea that Ice Java 
was cool, sophisticated, and exotic.


Readers of Jane magazine were women between the ages of 18 and 35 
who might well have identified with a group of diverse, adventurous friends 
watching movies on a rooftop. Such readers may also have wanted to see 
themselves as both sexy (hot) and self-possessed (cool). The advertising 
executives at Nestlé understood that they had to remake their image if the 
old instant coffee Nescafé was going to appeal to this audience. 


An article on the company’s rebranding reported that at the turn of 
the new millennium, the Nestlé execs deliberately sought out younger 
consumers, “looking for new coffee experiences, new textures and flavors.” 

Lecture 7—The Empathetic Essayist: Evoking Emotion|49


The rebranding worked. In the past 15 years, Nescafé has moved into 
the market of 20- to 30-year-olds with a range of new products, all of 
which use emotional appeals that target a younger and more diverse 
demographic.


Despite this success, the ad’s emotional appeals are sophistic rather than 
respectable. For example, the ad plays on a consumer’s desire to be cool in 
a figurative way. The catchphrase, the imagery, and ad copy all suggest that 
those who drink Ice Java will be as young, good-looking, exciting, and carefree 
as the two couples in the ad. As with most advertisements, this one exploits 
the audience’s potential insecurities—in this case, that they aren’t all that cool.


The advertiser’s motives are also selfish. The owners of Nestlé want to 
grow their demographic to make money. They’re not interested in whether 
drinking Ice Java will literally make someone more stylish or sexy. They only 
hope that the brand will make consumers feel that way. And such emotional 
manipulation is a clear example of false pathos.


Instances of false pathos can be found in arenas beyond advertising, as well. 
Political speech writers and campaign managers are notorious for misusing 
pathos. 


When politicians claim that more money should be allocated for 
education because, otherwise, suburban children will have an advantage 
over urban children, they are engaging in false pathos. It matters little 
whether the claim is factual or not. The point is to get a sound bite about 
children that will play well with the voters. 


We don’t recall famous political sound bites because they resonate with 
emotional complexity. We remember these slogans, such as “Yes, We 
Can,” because they’re zingers. They pack an emotional punch—but that 
punch is short-lived.
Genuine Pathos


If essayists hope to move their audience—to get readers to see something 
in a new way or to change or expand their minds—then appeals to emotion 
must be genuine and complex. Where bad pathos leads to bad writing—

50|Becoming a Great Essayist
clichés, stereotypes, sensationalism, and saccharine imagery—the point of 
true pathos is to build up emotion slowly, through a careful re-creation of 
experience, to help readers feel as if they, too, are living through what the 
writer sees, does, and thinks. 


The essayist’s job is to get readers to re-feel, re-see, and re-think emotion in 
a meaningful way to arrive at a new understanding about the world or about 
themselves. The purpose of pathos shouldn’t be to persuade others to want 
something; that’s the false pathos of advertising and many political campaigns. 
The purpose should be to influence readers to feel something significant. 
Thus, essayists must be ethical in their motives for engaging pathos.


In his Rhetoric, Aristotle discusses the proof of pathos in three distinct ways. 
First, he wants speakers and writers to understand the nature of the emotion 
they hope to inspire; second, he wants them to consider how this feeling is 
aroused in an audience; and third, he wants them to decide on the reasons, 
motivations, or causes that elicit this kind of emotion. 


In other words, true pathos isn’t reactionary or transitory. It isn’t meant to 
rev up readers’ pulses or get them to open their wallets. Instead, by teaching 
readers how to empathize with someone or something beyond themselves, 
true pathos is an artistic appeal that has the profound power to change 
people’s sense of themselves and their sense of others. Essayists must think 
carefully about how to evoke emotional responses in their readers and 
consider how readers might then put these emotions to use.
“No Name Woman” by Maxine Hong Kingston 


In Maxine Hong Kingston’s essay “No Name Woman,” she retells a story she 
once heard from her mother about a nameless aunt—nameless because the 
aunt had killed both herself and her baby after she had gotten got pregnant 
out of wedlock. Although she was the only sister of Kingston’s father, the 
memory of this woman had been erased in the family. 


At the climax of her essay, Kingston reiterates the story of the baby’s birth 
as if she herself were there to witness it. Here, she synthesizes facts with 

Lecture 7—The Empathetic Essayist: Evoking Emotion|51
imagination to get at a larger sense of truth; she is also precise and vivid in her 
details and imagery.


At first, Kingston likens the baby to a disease: a “foreign growth” that 
“sickens” the mother. It’s also a thing—a “hot, wet, moving mass.” Yet as 
soon as the baby is born and brought up to the mother’s stomach, it 
becomes recognizable as human. Now, the baby is a child rather than 
just a growth, and as the mother nurses it, she “clench[es] her teeth at 
its preciousness.”


Kingston’s precise description of the baby laying on its mother and 
making “snuffling noises” allows the reader to re-see and re-hear this 
baby—not as a generic baby but as a particular baby at a particular 
moment. In a way, this anonymous dead child is brought back to life in 
Kingston’s tactile descriptions of its body and sounds. 


This climactic passage elicits complex emotions and uses a complex approach 
to writing. Kingston’s refusal to be generic in her writing—to call the baby 
“beautiful” or “miraculous”—as well as her insistence that an untold story 
about an unnamed woman can still be vivid and valid is what enables her to 
engage authentic pathos. This tender moment is simultaneously a hard, horrific 
one, and the way in which Kingston humanizes her lost aunt and cousin 
simultaneously erases both of them. Such is the intricacy of true pathos, which 
is neither easy nor simplistic. 


One way for essayists to use pathos effectively is to resist generalizations. The 
more detailed, descriptive, and specific you are in your writing—and the more 
you engage your reader’s full senses—the richer and more resonant will be 
your pathos. Another important way for essayists to eschew false pathos is to 
avoid clichés at both the sentence level and at the level of idea. 
Barack Obama’s First Inaugural Address


A political speech is one of the most notorious places to find clichés, although 
often these clichés are at the level of ideas, such as the “challenges we face” or 
“peace and prosperity.” 


A political speech may be obligated to invoke at least some of these 
clichés, which have become platitudes precisely because they are a 

52|Becoming a Great Essayist
common language. Yet a speech—or an essay—doesn’t have to string 
together one chestnut after another. In fact, the best speeches alter the 
common language of clichés, extending and amending it. In doing so, a 
cliché may be renovated into an idea that is fresh and new.


Although an inaugural address isn’t often thought of as an essay, of 
course, such a speech is yet another kind of true story, well-told by a 
first-person narrator, with the intention of persuading an audience. And 
if the president builds on the common language of a citizenry’s clichés in 
a meaningful way, then that speaker is using true pathos to reinforce his 
or her own credibility and the nation’s credibility. In Barack Obama’s first 
inaugural address from 2009, he does just that. 


One of the rhetorical elements that is immediately apparent in this speech 
is its rhythm. Obama is particularly adept at using “parallel constructions,” 
which create a kind of refrain in his writing, similar to the returning chorus 
in a pop song. For example, he repeats the same phrase in a sequence of 
Such clichés as “crying her 
eyes out” try to convey 
powerful emotions, but 
ironically, readers have 
encountered them so many 
times that they feel nothing 
when they read them.

Lecture 7—The Empathetic Essayist: Evoking Emotion|53
sentences, such as “the time has come.” This musicality, especially when read 
out loud, fosters a sense that the ideas spoken are both right and apt—they 
go together.


Even more importantly in terms of how he uses pathos, Obama turns clichés 
into something that engages real feeling. He uses such hackneyed expressions 
as “riches and fame” or “prosperity and freedom,” yet his speech doesn’t begin 
and end with clichés. Instead, like Kingston, he invokes specific images and 
excites a listener’s senses. 


After talking more generally about the “men and women” who are 
“obscure in their labor” and who “carried us up the long, rugged path 
towards prosperity and freedom,” Obama then provides mini-stories to 
give more explicit examples of these kinds of people. We see those who 
“packed up their few worldly possessions and traveled across oceans,” 
“toiled in sweatshops 
and settled the West,” 
and “endured the lash 
of the whip.”

From Barack Obama’s 2009 Inaugural Address 
In reaffirming the greatness of our nation, we understand that greatness is never 
a given. It must be earned. Our journey has never been one of short-cuts or 
settling for less. It has not been the path for the faint-hearted—for those who 
prefer leisure over work, or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame. Rather, it 
has been the risk-takers, the doers, the makers of things—some celebrated but 
more often men and women obscure in their labor, who have carried us up the 
long, rugged path toward prosperity and freedom.
For us, they packed up their few worldly possessions and traveled across oceans 
in search of a new life.
For us, they toiled in sweatshops and settled the West; endured the lash of the 
whip and plowed the hard earth.
For us, they fought and died, in places like Concord and Gettysburg; Normandy 
and Khe Sanh.
Time and again these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till 
their hands were raw so that we might live a better life. They saw America as 
bigger than the sum of our individual ambitions; greater than all the differences of 
birth or wealth or faction.

Lecture 8
When an Essayist’s Feelings Face Facts
 W 
riters run into problems any time that pathos—an emotional 
response to a topic—trumps logos—rational understanding. 
One way to try to bring these two together is to write an 
essay about a subject that’s hard for you to view with a clear, objective eye, 
such as the theme of home. Writing about this theme is one way to learn 
how to combine your feelings with your thoughts. At the end of this lecture, 
we’ll explore a more developed exercise for writing about home, but first, 
we’ll think about how writing on impassioned or underdeveloped topics 
can sometimes lead to bad logic—which inevitably equals bad writing.
Logical Fallacies


Essays that rely too heavily on the heart over the head tend to fall prey 
to three logical fallacies in particular: “faulty generalizations,” “ad hominem 
arguments,” and “bandwagonism.” These fallacies are worth avoiding because 
they are examples of bad thinking—thinking that occurs when essayists are 
either deliberately trying to hoodwink their readers or, more often, when 
writers are pulled around emotionally while drafting a piece, not knowing 
exactly what they want to say or why they want to say it. 


One fallacy that often appears in melodramatic or opinionated essays is 
the faulty or hasty generalization. This fallacy occurs when a writer makes a 
sweeping comment or reaches a decision based on too little evidence. These 
essayists make claims that are impossible to verify, such as chocolate is the 
best candy or modern women are too frank about their sex lives. 

56|Becoming a Great Essayist


When it comes to faulty generalizations, it’s one thing if the faulty claim 
affects only the writer, such as the idea that smoking can’t be that bad 
because the writer’s own mother smoked and lived to be almost 90. 


However, hasty generalizations can become more problematic when 
they inform public debates rather than private desires. Particularly in 
political or philosophical essays, making faulty generalizations can be a 
forceful, if irrational, way to try to undermine the opposition. 


Another prevalent fallacy in overly emotional essays is the ad hominem (“to 
the man”) argument. This fallacy occurs when someone attacks a person with 
an idea rather than the idea itself. 


Interestingly, the broken reasoning of ad hominem arguments even 
appears in our Declaration of Independence. There, Thomas Jefferson 
spends more time listing the grievances against King George III than 
he does making claims of humans’ inherent rights to life, liberty, or the 
pursuit of happiness. At the end of his long list, Jefferson calls the king 
a barbarian, which may have felt good at the time but is an example of 
how passion can overtake a writer’s reason. 


For the essayist, it can be all too easy to condemn a person rather than 
that person’s ideas. This is especially true when the writer feels wounded 
or irritated by someone else’s actions or beliefs. And a long list of 
grievances against a target inevitably rings hollow. It becomes nothing 
more than a “gripe-fest,” an expression of the writer’s selfish need to 
complain. As a result, essays built around ad hominem fallacies often 
become tedious. 


A third logical fallacy is bandwagonism, which occurs when an essayist makes 
an assertion and assumes that all readers will agree. Anyone who’s ever 
encountered a teenager knows all about bandwagonism, which often boils 
down to: “But, Mom, everyone’s doing it!” 


Although this fallacy is a favorite among teens and pop culture addicts 
who follow whatever fad is trending, bandwagonism is also frequently 
used by politicians. A powerful example comes from a speech written 
in 1837 by John C. Calhoun, a man who held numerous political offices, 
including vice president for both John Quincy Adams and Andrew 
Jackson. Calhoun gave this speech on the floor of the Senate. 

Lecture 8—When an Essayist’s Feelings Face Facts|57


First, Calhoun starts with a central claim, which is both simple and 
direct: “Abolition and the Union cannot coexist.” He then maneuvers 
his bandwagon appeals rather brilliantly to make it seem as though this 
claim is universally accepted by everyone. First, he asserts that he himself 
believes this statement: “As a friend of the Union I openly proclaim it.” By 
calling himself a friend of the nation as a whole, he appeals to patriotism, 
which is a kind of bandwagonism we see all the time in our own political 
campaigns and punditry. 


Quickly, though, Calhoun moves from the first-person singular “I” to the 
first-person collective “we.” “We of the South,” he says, “will not, cannot, 
surrender our institutions.” As Calhoun takes on the collective ethos of 
The term bandwagonism comes from 
the stage used for circus performers; 
it became popular when a former 
clown ran for president and invited 
other candidates to “jump on the 
bandwagon” during his campaign.

58|Becoming a Great Essayist
everyone living in the South, he uses bandwagonism to make it seem 
as though he has the credibility to do so. For any Southerners listening 
to or reading his speech who might have abolitionist leanings, Calhoun’s 
fallacious appeal could potentially get them to change their minds. 


Calhoun goes a step further to threaten violence should his listeners 
not accept that abolition is anathema to the survival of the Union. Here, 
Calhoun’s bandwagonism becomes coercion—a threat that binds those 
who agree with him to violence but also puts Northern abolitionists 
on the defensive. Finally, he uses bandwagonism once again to suggest 
that not just Southerners but the Union as a whole will be destroyed if 
slavery is either questioned or resisted. 


Bandwagonism is perhaps the most common and potentially the most 
volatile logical fallacy that polemical, impassioned, and unethical essayists 
employ. The fact that Calhoun was partially responsible for the onset of 
the Civil War reveals the dangers of such appeals—appeals that play 
on an audience’s need to belong, regardless of whether the writer’s 
arguments are honorable or just. 
Assignment: Writing about Home


In an essay entitled “One Village,” Naomi Shihab Nye blends rational 
argumentation with compassionate anecdotes to persuade readers that 
the Israeli occupation of the West Bank is both flawed and problematic. This 
stance is a tricky one, yet Nye doesn’t try to convince her readers through 
either careful arguments or logical fallacies. Instead, she approaches her 
subject through the private and personal lens of home. The village of the title 
is a small community of Palestinians, and her essay describes a visit there after 
15 years of being away; through this visit, Nye comes to have a complex 
understanding of the political struggles of the region.


For your essay, think about a tension that’s embedded in your idea of home. 
This tension might be political, such as a concern over how poor and minority 
populations are sometimes mistreated in your home state. Or the tension 
might be historic—a look through the dual lenses of the past and the present 
to show how an area has changed over time. Or it might be about your own 
sense of self in relation to your home. Maybe you once identified strongly with 

Lecture 8—When an Essayist’s Feelings Face Facts|59
this community, but now you’re more ambivalent about your origins. Of course, 
your home may also combine all these strains—political, historic, and personal.


The opening of Nye’s essay immediately draws on pathos-based appeals to 
the senses, especially smell. “The village smells familiar,” she writes, “a potent 
soup of smoke, sheep wool, water on stone.” In this way, Nye tries to make this 
village intimate to her readers. By labeling the combination a “potent soup,” 
Nye also domesticates the smells, evoking the ideas of a kitchen and cooking.
In writing about your idea of 
home, you may struggle against 
the tendency to romanticize; 
you must separate yourself 
from your emotions to take 
cold, hard facts into account.

60|Becoming a Great Essayist


For the first paragraph of your essay, try to follow Nye and make your home 
as specific and realistic for your readers as you can. Describe what your home 
looks like, but also allow yourself to engage senses other than sight, such as 
sound, smell, and taste. As Nye did, try to be precise in what you describe so 
that your readers can experience what you do when you’re in this place. 


Another way in which Nye arouses emotions in her readers is to tell anecdotes 
about her family members. These anecdotes are mostly journalistic in tone, 
rather than sensational. In your essay, try to write at least three anecdotes 
about your home that speak to the central tension you’re considering. But be 
as honest as you can about what you remember or what you witness when 
you’re there. Work hard not to infuse your memories or descriptions with 
your multicolored feelings about them. 


At this point, you’ll have drawn on your readers’ senses and told a few 
anecdotes in the hopes of arousing certain emotions from your audience. 
These are both pathos-based strategies for creating empathy. To integrate 
feeling with thinking, your essay also needs to discuss the theoretical or 
philosophic ideas that these sense-based descriptions and anecdotes bring 
to the fore. You could reflect on what these images and stories tell about the 
place you think of as home; you might even develop a more specific definition 
of what you mean by the idea of “home.”


In Nye’s essay, she makes a logos-based argument about the fraught 
politics of the Middle East. She refers to Israel as a “racist state,” yet she 
isn’t just name-calling. She doesn’t apply this label to Israel without context.


Because she has tried to take on the perspective of Jewish people and 
think about why they would want a national “home,” her claim has 
credibility. She even tries to discuss both sides at the same moment that 
she says the Israelis are wrong. Thus, even if readers don’t agree with her, 
Nye has attempted to be rational and balanced in her argument, which 
strengthens rather than undermines what she’s trying to say. 


Nye also combines this rational or logos-based discussion of home with one 
that’s more emotional, bringing readers inside her own feelings about visiting 
this small Palestinian village. Here, Nye thinks about the fact that she is calling 
a place home that countless others—people she will never know—have also 
called home. This musing extends Nye’s essay. 

Lecture 8—When an Essayist’s Feelings Face Facts|61


For the closing of your own 
essay, try to sharpen your 
definition of “home” by writing 
about what kind of home 
you’re reconstructing. Is it, like 
Nye’s, a genetic home? Or is it 
an adopted home, a reclaimed 
home, a self-fashioned home? 
Is it a home that no one 
else would want or one that 
many other people know and 
cherish? Is it a spiritual home 
or a ruggedly physical one? 
Whatever the case, be precise 
in how you define home 
within your piece. Finally, for 
your conclusion, try to link this 
more precise definition to an 
argument you wish to make 
about what home means to 
you. Like Nye, take a stand, 
although your stand need not 
be one-sided.

Lecture 9
Unabashedly Me: The First-Person Essay
 T 
he writer Phillip Lopate claims that anyone who writes essays 
must embrace “unashamed subjectivity.” Unlike a story that’s told 
by an invisible, third-person narrator, the essay traditionally claims 
the first-person singular as its perspective. This person is the essay’s truth 
speaker—one who claims the authority of experience, witness, knowledge, 
and intimacy. In addition, unlike a story’s or a poem’s speaker, an essay’s 
narrator is a flesh-and-blood person, one who lives in a certain time and 
place. Thus, this speaker inherently has a distinct viewpoint, a specific 
attitude, and a one-of-a-kind voice. And it’s this unique voice that is a large 
part of what entertains, persuades, and motivates readers. 
First Person versus Third Person


Despite the fact that essays inherently embody a unique voice, many teachers 
still insist that students’ work should seem as if it materialized from thin air. 
These teachers tell their students that the first-person should be avoided at 
all costs, that a writer should work hard to come across as objective. Teachers 
also teach the passive voice, as if an essay’s ideas and claims arise from no 
one and out of nowhere. This same approach to writing is advocated by 
those who hold business-writing workshops or seminars for employees of 
large organizations. 


However, every essay invites and perhaps even demands the idiosyncratic 
charms of the first-person “I.” Because essayists are tethered to their own 
bodies, as well as limited by their own historical moments, the voice in all 
essays, on any topic, is inherently subjective—even if a writer is trying to 
sound neutral or unbiased. 

Lecture 9—Unabashedly Me: The First-Person Essay|63


And that’s as it should be. As Lopate said, subjectivity within essays 
should be unashamed. Because essayists are not impartial, they shouldn’t 
strive to sound robotic. The essayists’ job is to reflect and interpret, to 
hypothesize and muse, to comment and to judge. 


Whether essayists are successful in their attempts at persuasion is 
another matter altogether. And the essayists’ ethos will be either broken 
or made on whether they can discover new ways of thinking about old 
subjects and are able to see beyond themselves to the wider world.


If you don’t quite believe in the power of the first-person “I,” try transforming 
any piece of writing that’s written in the third person into the first-person 
singular point of view. 


Whether you alter a website or a children’s story, you’ll find that 
switching out the pronouns changes the writing profoundly. The text will 
seem more confessional, and the speaker, more vulnerable.


And as Lopate has said, part of the reason readers trust a good essayist 
is that such a writer is willing to expose his own “betrayals, uncertainties, 
and self-mistrust. [His] sincerity issues from an awareness of [his] 
potential for insincerity,” which grants the writer a “doubled authority.” In 
other words, adopting the “I” point of view automatically gives an essayist 
a stronger ethos.


Vivian Gornick is another well-known writer who agrees with Lopate that 
it’s the betrayals, uncertainties, and self-mistrust in an “I” narrator that make 
essays compelling. In her book The Situation and the Story, Gornate writes that 
the essayist must be both strong and willing to show weakness—to be open, 
self-conscious, honest, and unsure. The more essayists uncover themselves, 
paradoxically, the more cosmic they become. 


To create understanding among your readers for what you have to 
say—to get them to believe that you can touch the universal through 
your individuality—you must show your willingness to expose your own 
weaknesses, deficits, and insecurities. 


You don’t need to be willing to confess your darkest secrets, but you 
must be as self-scrutinizing as possible as you muse, argue, project, and 
reflect within your essays. To be reliable, your truth speaker must admit 
how and when you’re unreliable. Otherwise, the voice in your essays will 
potentially come across as insular, self-consumed, and a know-it-all.

One promise of the first-person 
perspective is intimacy; it’s like 
having the writer whisper in 
your ear about events that he 
or she has witnessed.

Lecture 9—Unabashedly Me: The First-Person Essay|65
Intimacy


The first promise of the first-person perspective is one of intimacy. As we’ve 
mentioned, the first-person point of view gives essayists an inherent ethos 
or credibility; with this point of view, writers are witnesses to whatever 
they are writing about, speaking what they see as truth to readers with a 
confidential voice. 


Because a narrator is both faceless and fleshless, intimacy is easier to establish 
in real life than in words. In an essay, the language itself must do all of the work 
of making readers feel as though the writer values them enough to be sincere 
and unguarded in what he or she has to say. 


Natalia Ginzburg, an Italian writer who survived the Holocaust, establishes 
an easy, seemingly effortless intimacy at the outset of her essay “He and I.” 
Here’s how the essay begins: “He always feels hot; I always feel cold. … He 
speaks several languages well; I do not speak any well. He manages—in his 
own way—to speak even the languages that he doesn’t know.”


The persona that Ginzburg creates here is interesting in and of itself. Her 
speaker’s diction is commonplace; her syntax is a series of contrasting parallel 
constructions; and her images are consistently domestic. Ginzburg doesn’t 
even name the “he” (her husband), yet this lack of identification suggests 
intimacy rather than impartial objectivity. Ginzburg doesn’t need to name this 
“he” because the man is known so thoroughly by the narrator.


The effect of this persona’s unabashed honesty about the daily, private, and 
intimate interactions between herself and her scholarly husband makes us 
feel as if we already know him. Thus, Ginzburg is able to create and sustain 
a wonderful tension between the generic “he” (the everyman husband) and 
the specific one (her own husband). This strategy creates intimacy between 
Ginzburg and her readers. Potentially, readers nod their heads in recognition, 
particularly if they’re married themselves.

Witness


Another promise met by the first-person perspective is that of witness. In 
essays based on this promise, whatever the narrator tells readers, he or she 
has truly experienced in the real world. For example, early on in his essay “On 
Dumpster Diving,” Lars Eighner admits, “I began Dumpster diving about a year 
before I became homeless.”


Eighner then gets into the details of dumpster diving with a precise list of 
what he pulled from dumpsters and used in his house. This specificity attests 
to Eighner’s eyewitness experience with this topic, and because he tells his 
story through the first-person perspective, readers believe what he has to say. 
Eighner really was homeless for three years. 
Empathy


The final promise of an essay’s first-person persona is the promise of 
empathy, which is an integral part of the pronoun “I” itself. When you are in 
the presence of the “I,” you’re in the presence of a kind of magic. When you 
speak of yourself, you say, “I did this” or “I thought that.” And when others talk 
about themselves, they also say, “I.” This means that the moment you evoke 
the “I” in your essay, the reader, who’s reading alongside you, projects himself 
or herself into what you’re writing about. The reader, too, becomes the “I.”


This empathetic magic is largely invisible to readers because we read 
the pronoun “I” all the time. Note how Lucy Grealy, in her haunting essay 
“Mirrorings,” brings her “I” into the very first sentence: “There was a long 
period of time, almost a year, during which I never looked in a mirror.”


Grealy’s overall topic—her disease with mirrors, with seeing herself outside 
of herself—is the perfect metaphor for how the “I” is an innately empathetic 
point of view. With the “I,” writers see themselves reflected. The “I” itself is a 
kind of language mirror. 


Note, though, that Grealy is also creating empathy by writing on a topic that 
almost everyone has experienced: seeing yourself in a shiny surface, sometimes 

Lecture 9—Unabashedly Me: The First-Person Essay|67
distorted. Readers immediately commiserate with Grealy’s persona because 
what she’s writing about and how she’s writing about it are simultaneously 
intimate, believable, and empathetic.
The Perils of First-Person Point of View


There’s a well-known adage in the world of fiction that says, “Show, don’t 
tell.” In a nutshell, this phrase means that a fiction writer should strive 
to demonstrate a character’s interior feelings and thoughts through that 
character’s actions. When a fiction writer puts a character into a scene, and 
we readers get a chance to see him or her in motion, the character becomes 
both more realistic and more interesting. 


In essay writing, the truth speaker’s main job is, of course, to tell truths as 
he or she sees them. Thus, essays are a genre that necessitate telling over 
showing. Yet there’s still a problem when an essayist just tells anything 
and everything. 


Essays that don’t engage in enough showing run the risk of reading 
more like journal entries. The writer may use a “poor-me” first-
person perspective rather than a truth-speaking perspective. In fact, 
such essays are often packed with what teenagers call TMI: too much 
information.


One way to avoid this mistake is to sketch in momentary scenes that 
give the essay the texture of showing. These are not the full-blown 
scenes you might write in a short story, but even mini-scenes allow for 
imagery and sense-based details that mere telling rarely provides.


Another peril of the “I” is egotism. In his memoir Walden, Henry David 
Thoreau explains that when essayists write from the “I,” they can get lost in 
this perspective because they know themselves better than anyone else.


The poet Mary Oliver says this about writing for someone other than 
yourself: “I write poems for a stranger who will be born in some distant 
country hundreds of years from now. … I must make a complete poem. 
… Not my poem, if it’s well done, but a deeply breathing, bounding, 
self-sufficient poem.” To make self-sufficient writing is the job of essayists, 
too—to write a piece that lives beyond us. 

68|Becoming a Great Essayist


Thus, in working on an essay, a writer must think about a stranger in 
a distant country hundreds of years from now. Why would your essay 
matter to this stranger? To answer that question, you must work to create 
a persona—the truth-speaking narrator of your essay—to tell your tale. 
You must investigate and implicate yourself, working to translate your 
own low-level self-interest into something of value for a disinterested, 
unknown, future reader.


The final peril of the “I” is small-mindedness, which is closely linked to the peril 
of egotism. One solution here is “ice-boxing” the essay, that is, putting it aside 
for a period of time to allow you to gain some distance from it. From this 
distance, you may come to new realizations about yourself or the topic you’re 
discussing—in other words, you’ll become a speaker of truth.
From “Lip Service” by Jennifer Cognard-Black
When I’m at dinner or out for drinks with colleagues, I sometimes joke that my 
daughter has been orphaned by my profession. It’s a line I picked up from one of 
my students, a young man named Toby—a student who has the odd distinction 
of having taken me for seven separate courses …, who is the youngest son of my 
department chair, and who, like me, is the product of two academic parents—that 
rare and aw(e)ful upbringing. 
Once, when Toby and I met to discuss his senior project, we got distracted and 
started talking about what it was like to grow up in a houseful of PhD’s—about 
playing “grading” with our siblings (I gave my younger sister A’s or F’s on her 
doodles, depending on if I liked them), about learning to drink coffee with lots 
of sugar and fake cream (all that was available in our parents’ offices), and about 
whooping or skulking through the halls of various college buildings, waiting for Mom 
or Dad to finish up with a student. 
At some point, Toby said, “Yeah. I was orphaned by the profession, man. I raised 
myself.” And though he continued to tease about how he’d carefully learned to 
avoid using “lay,” “lie,” “laid,” or “lain” in any sentence (another thing we have in

common: both sets of parents are English professors), I was too struck with what 
he’d just said to hear much else. Without meaning to, Toby had just [put] his finger 
on my own heart’s bruising: this tender belief that my own commitment to the 
profession has forsaken my daughter.
Yet to say that my daughter Katharine has been orphaned by my profession is, 
frankly, a line out of a … Hollywood tragedy—a line that takes the responsibility off 
my own shoulders and blames, instead, my line of work. If I am honest in the telling, 
I must write that my daughter has been orphaned by me[,] by my own choices.
Ask me what the most important thing in my life is, and I’ll tell you that it’s 
Katharine. Every night when I kiss her—even if she’s already asleep when I get 
home—I rub my nose in her hair, smell her weedy, warm, little-girl smell and 
whisper that I love her more than anything. It is my ritual. 
But take an inventory of my days, my weeks; get inside my head and see how I’m 
consumed with what needs to happen next—with the papers I need to grade; the 
novel I need to read; the manuscript I need to edit; the colleague I need to have 
lunch with—and it’s clear that the most important thing in my life is an on-going 
mental tally. My work, my work work work. It’s clear that putting my family before 
my work is just lip service—lip service I pay to a version of myself that I project to 
others. And this version of myself is one I cherish as any reader and writer of fiction 
cherishes one of her favorite characters. (There’s a website where a reader can 
take a quiz and be told which nineteenth-century heroine she most resembles. I’m 
Anna Karenina: passionate, articulate, taciturn, tragic.)

Lecture 10
Essayists as Poets: Tapping into Imagery
 T 
o begin our discussion of how best to apply figurative language 
and the senses in essays, let’s start with a photograph by Alfred 
Stieglitz entitled “The Terminal.” Taken in 1893 on a blustery day in 
New York City, the photo shows the southern end of the Harlem streetcar 
line in front of an old post office. In the foreground, a driver is watering 
down his sweaty horses after a long day of pulling the streetcar up and 
down Fifth Avenue. As we begin this lecture, try “walking” straight into the 
photograph, imagining yourself inside the scene in three dimensions. 
Assignment, Part I: Entering “The Terminal”


Alfred Stieglitz took “The Terminal” using a new handheld camera. Unlike 
his older, unwieldy camera that required a tripod, this handheld one gave 
Stieglitz the freedom to knock about New York, taking pictures of the dynamic 
street life around him. Once you “enter” this image, allow the street scene to 
become three-dimensional.


Inside the photograph, look to your left, right, and upward. Pay attention to 
what you’re standing on, what you’re wearing, and who’s nearby. Even though 
it may be 95 degrees where you actually are, try to experience the bitter 
wind as if you’re inside 1893 in the chilly heart of Manhattan in winter. 


The next step is to make some notes on the scene, paying close attention to 
all your body’s senses other than sight (to which we’ll return). 


Begin with what you feel in this place, keeping in mind that your entire 
body is covered with skin—not just your hands and face. Take a moment 
to reflect on what you’re touching, on the textures that surround you. 

Lecture 10—Essayists as Poets: Tapping into Imagery|71
What do your earlobes feel like? How about your elbows? What about 
your ankles and lips? Wake up your entire body, and pay attention to 
what it’s telling you.


Next, think about what you might hear when on Fifth Avenue in 1893. 
Are the noises loud or soft, repeated or random, pleasing hums and 
melodies or jarring thuds and clatters? Are the sounds unusual or 
unknown to you, or have you heard these noises many times before? 


As a next step, think about smells and tastes together. Sniff the air and 
ask yourself: Are the scents harsh or sweet, strong or subtle, enjoyable 
or nasty? Do you recognize these smells? Are they coming from you—
your own body and possessions—or are they from the people, animals, 
streets, and buildings beyond? At the same time, ask yourself what you 
taste. Even if you’re not eating anything—although you could be—your 
mouth always has some kind of a taste to it. Try to taste this scene’s 
atmosphere and record its flavors.
“The Terminal”
by Alfred Stieglitz

72|Becoming a Great Essayist


After you’ve made some notes on the other sensations you experience inside 
“The Terminal,” turn your attention back to what you’re seeing. But instead 
of describing this particular environment, draw analogies between what 
you’re looking at and something else that it reminds you of. For example, the 
shape of the driver’s hat may remind you of a mushroom. Look for shapes, 
shadows, angles, and items that, for you, are reminiscent of some other thing. 
Compare elements within this photograph to other objects or ideas that are 
not actually there.


Finally, once you’ve come up with a few analogies, write a short paragraph in 
which you describe being inside this photograph, using your notes as a guide. 
Make sure to pull from at least one example of each of your senses and to 
use at least two of your analogies. Use the first-person point of view, and 
write in the present tense to give your imaginative experience immediacy. 
When you’re done with your paragraph, choose a phrase or a single word 
out of the writing and use that as your title—as a theme or focus for this 
experience.


Photographs, by their very nature, bring the dead back to life. Although 
whatever is represented in a photograph has already happened and cannot 
happen again, each time we look at that image, that moment returns. 
Photographs skim the real, and they are always in the present tense. 


Writing essays that engage a reader’s senses also creates the experience 
of a present-tense reality within the photographic chamber of the mind. 
In engaging the body’s senses within Stieglitz’s scene, the image becomes 
solid. The scene is no longer a thin coat of chemicals on paper or pixels on 
a screen. Instead, the hot horses and the streetcar driver, the ice and snow, 
and the drab city buildings become embodied. They seem both palpable 
and real. 


Here is the main gift of sense-based writing for any essayist: It brings essays 
to life. Even though words are only black marks on a page, by evoking taste, 
touch, smell, and sound through those words, a reader’s body is affected. The 
flesh-and-blood reality beyond the writer’s page is changed through the use 
of the senses.

Lecture 10—Essayists as Poets: Tapping into Imagery|73
Imagery


Over the centuries, the term “imagery” has evolved to mean the creation 
of any visual images, as well as mental pictures and, of course, written 
representations. It’s often assumed that imagery is the purview of poets. Yet 
rhetorical imagery is used by all kinds of writers. What matters is this: When 
writers turn to imagery, they’re interested in getting readers to re-feel and 
re-see experience. Imagery is a powerful tool of pathos, and essayists must 
learn to wield it well, even if they don’t identify as poets or poetic writers. 
For essayists, two particularly effective kinds of imagery are sense-based 
descriptions and metaphors.


We’ve already touched on how engaging the senses can wake up your essays, 
but let’s talk further about metaphor—which, generally speaking, means the 
representation of one thing by another thing. Why should essayists employ 
A metaphor claims that one thing 
is another thing, whereas a simile 
compares two things using “like” 
or “as,” as is Robert Burns’s “O, my 
Luve is like a red, red rose / That’s 
newly sprung in June.”

74|Becoming a Great Essayist
metaphor rather than leaving it to the poets? The answer is that comparing 
two objects, actions, or ideas inevitably creates beauty, surprise, and humor 
in any kind of writing. Metaphor makes essays fresh and evocative, and such 
figurative language is also a decisive factor in constructing an original voice.


Annie Dillard’s Pilgrim at Tinker Creek is a Pulitzer Prize–winning memoir. The 
book is about how Dillard—a writer and an amateur naturalist—visited the 
same terrain around Roanoke, Virginia, across all four seasons, then wrote 
about what she discovered while there. In a chapter entitled “Seeing,” Dillard 
decides to stay late at a creek to watch as twilight descends and she can no 
longer see much of anything.


Dillard is a master of creating marvelous metaphors within her essays. 
For instance, she describes water turtles as “smooth as beans” and says 
that they glide “down with the current in a series of easy, weightless 
push-offs, as men bound on the moon.” 


In one way, these two similes are obviously distinct. It’s unlikely that 
most people put turtles and beans or turtles and astronauts together 
on a regular basis. Yet these two similes actually work together to 
create harmonious and vivid images in the mind’s eye—images that are 
decidedly concrete in portraying how water turtles look as they swim 
downstream.


These comparisons adhere to the three main qualities that make for 
good metaphors: They are fresh; they are concrete; and they are apt. 
Freshness comes from the surprise of the analogies—turtles as beans or 
astronauts. These images get readers to see something in a way they’ve 
never thought to see it before.


Yet the comparisons are also detailed and concrete. Dillard didn’t write 
that the water turtles were “beanlike” or that they moved “like they 
were in outer space.” She said they were as “smooth as beans”—thereby 
evoking tactility—and she claimed that they travel in the same way that 
“men bound on the moon”—once again, offering precision about how 
men move in space.


Finally, Dillard’s metaphorical comparisons are always apt. Even though 
they’re fresh or unusual, they fit the tone and context of what she’s 
writing about. For readers, there’s a delight in metaphors and similes 
when they are ideal for the mood the essayist is trying to create—in this 
case, a mood of wonder, as well as a desire to see and to know more.

Lecture 10—Essayists as Poets: Tapping into Imagery|75


It’s easier to understand the power of Dillard’s metaphors if we try 
to rewrite them as clunkers. For example, if we alter “the last of the 
swallows … caught at my heart and trailed it after them like streamers” 
to “the swallows caught at my heart like something really pretty,” we 
eliminate Dillard’s precision and concreteness. 


In addition, bad metaphors often come from clichés. To avoid a clichéd 
comparison, ask yourself whether you’ve heard the analogy before. If the 
phrase “as ____ as ____” is easy for you to fill in (“as happy as a clam”), 
then your metaphor or simile won’t be original.


Two additional aspects of Dillard’s writing make her essay deeply and powerfully 
imagistic. First, Dillard brings in precise descriptive details and information from 
science. She tells her readers exactly how fast we’re spinning around the earth’s 
axis, orbiting the sun, and moving within the solar system. In quoting these 
enormous numbers, she actually creates a kind of mental dizziness. 


Further, Dillard’s diction is similarly precise. If we were offered just lists of 
Dillard’s verbs, nouns, and adjectives, we would still have a vivid sense of what 
her essay is about. 


Instead of using bland verbs, such as “sit,” “walk,” or “look,” Dillard brings 
in “stalk,” “straddle,” “hunch,” and more. She doesn’t talk only of bugs, 
birds, and mammals, but she names water turtles, carp, and swallows. 


And her descriptors paint pictures in the mind all by themselves: “tear-
shaped,” “weightless,” “uneasy,” “unfathomable.” Like a poet, Dillard 
understands that the language of an essay is the language of particulars. 
Assignment, Part II: Writing a Photo Essay


To conclude this lecture, let’s return to the idea of the photo essay, this time, 
using a photograph of your own choosing. Look for a deliberate image—
something more than a snapshot—that was taken with an eye to creating art.


Then, write a photo essay using your chosen picture, limiting yourself to no 
more than 750 words. Pay close attention to the precision of your diction, the 
descriptiveness of your details, the freshness of your metaphors and similes 
(and their concreteness and appropriateness), and the vividness of how you 

76|Becoming a Great Essayist
engage the senses. Be as specific and particular as you can be; don’t allow 
yourself to use the words “thing,” “something,” or “anything.” 


And no matter what your subject matter—be it the Vietnam War or a 
Thanksgiving dinner—take care to engage your readers’ bodies and 
imaginations. Allow them to re-feel and “re-memory” your experience right 
alongside you.

The Visual Essay: Words + Pictures
 P 
ictures tell stories. Or, more accurately, when viewers look at 
pictures—whether they are paintings, sketches, photographs, digital 
images, or street art—those viewers find stories within them. And 
if you hope to produce a visual essay—meaning an essay that incorporates 
pictures—it’s important to consider the imaginative and the private or 
confessional possibilities contained within pictures. A picture may open up 
ways to extend, comment upon, or even contradict ideas within an essay. 
Pictures can also start interesting dialogues between words and images. And 
pictures can provide readers with surprising interpretations or emotional 
reactions that deepen and expand your essay’s significance. 
Pictures and Viewers


As mentioned, when viewers look at pictures, they find their own stories with 
them. Sometimes, these stories are fanciful, such as when viewers see Vincent 
van Gogh’s painting The Starry Night and imagine his expressionistic swirls of 
stars as an astral map of a foreign land. At other times, the stories that images 
tell come out of viewers’ own life experiences, as with Andreas Gursky’s 
enormous photographs of supermarket aisles.


But just as it’s vital to ignite readers’ imaginations and draw on their 
experiences when bringing images into your writing, it’s also crucial for you 
to realize that to see only one’s own fantasies or history within a picture is to 
limit its potential. Just as we viewers think about pictures as we gaze at them, 
in a sense, the pictures think about us as they gaze back. All images already 
contain within them the notions and opinions of the artists who made them. 

78|Becoming a Great Essayist
And even more importantly, pictures also contain the notions and opinions 
embedded within the artistry of the images themselves.


The award-winning British novelist Jeanette Winterson wrote a series of 
essays called Art Objects, in which she grapples with the complex dynamics 
between a picture and its viewer. She especially speaks to the dangers of 
viewing images in a limited or limiting way. Winterson wrote:
Looking at paintings is equivalent to being dropped into a foreign 
city, where gradually, out of desire and despair, a few key words, then 
a little syntax makes a clearing in the silence. Art, all art, not just 
paintings, is a foreign city, and we deceive ourselves when we think it 
familiar. No-one is surprised to find that a foreign city follows its own 
customs and speaks its own language. … We have to recognize that 
the language of art, all art, is not our mother-tongue.


In essence, the rest of this essay is an attempt to explain how we viewers 
might try to learn the language of pictures—not the written or spoken 
language we ourselves use to describe or to interpret images but, instead, the 
visual language that the pictures themselves speak. 
A Visual Essay


By starting with a specific image and generalizing more broadly, Winterson is 
attempting to revise and rethink the relationship between an art object and its 
audience. Thus, one approach to writing a visual essay is to take a picture that 
arrests or captivates you in some way and to build a piece of writing around it. 
Here, your essay draws on the picture itself as a stimulus for probing your own 
thoughts and feelings about what this picture might be saying to you, as well as 
why the picture’s language might mean something to your readers. 


Winterson offers a challenging exercise for how writers might pay better 
attention to pictures. First, she says, we must detach ourselves from the 
ingrained and clichéd ways of viewing that we’ve been taught as consumers 
of popular culture—ways that trivialize pictures, reducing them to surface 
instead of substance. 

Lecture 11—The Visual Essay: Words + Pictures|79


We must then agree to spend at least an hour with whatever picture we 
hope to understand. In doing so, she believes we would find out a great deal 
about ourselves, including the fact that “we are not very good at looking.”


From here, though, Winterson believes that if we continue to look—if we 
truly focus our whole attention on the picture—then we’ll start to move 
away from distraction and will discover increasing invention. We’ll start to ask 
ourselves detailed questions about the picture. Is it a portrait or a landscape? 
Is it abstract or realistic? What colors define it? Where are its shadows, its 
highlights? What story does the picture tell, and what emotions does this 
story potentially evoke within us, the viewers? 


For Winterson, these questions are a good start; they demand that we meet 
the picture’s intensity of representation with our own intensity of looking. And 
yet, even while we start to move from distraction to invention, Winterson 
admits that we will also become increasingly irritated. We want the picture 
to do something. After all, Winterson writes, “Why should I admire it? Quite 
clearly it doesn’t admire me.” 
Writers of visual essays must 
go beyond the simplistic ways 
we have all been taught to 
react to the images around us.

80|Becoming a Great Essayist


And that, confesses Winterson, is the great difficulty of trying to grasp the 
foreign language of pictures. We viewers demand that art should reflect the 
reality of our own lives—our own obsessions, needs, and vanities. “The true 
[picture],” claims Winterson, “… cannot do this, except coincidentally. Its 
reality is imaginative not mundane.” What Winterson means here is that the 
truth of the picture is its own universal truth—not the mundane facts of our 
own lives that we want to see reflected in it. 


Thus, Winterson asks writers to push beyond their selfish, small desires to see 
their own pursuits and passions, their own needs and wants, their own fears 
and fantasies within paintings, photographs, and drawings. 


Essayists can accomplish this by spending more time with the picture on 
different days. Eventually, with repeated viewings, you’ll start to learn your 
picture’s alphabet and dialect. Finally, what you’ll start to see in the picture 
will be the result of a collaboration, a connection, between that picture and 
you—and not just a representation that you’ve remade in your own image.
Alternative Visual Approaches


Although essayists across many centuries have long used techniques of 
imagery to paint pictures in the mind, there is also a strong tradition among 
writers of bringing together words and pictures to produce visual essays and 
memoirs. The most obvious examples are pieces in which pictures serve the 
story the writer is attempting to tell. These are illustrated essays, in which the 
two mediums work together to produce a common meaning. 


Examples of this approach to visuality include essay collections or 
memoirs with chapter heading illustrations that signal to a reader what 
each section of the book is about. A recent example is a book of essays 
by Barbara Kingsolver called Small Wonder. One piece in it is called “Lily’s 
Chickens,” which begins with a description of Kingsolver’s daughter, who 
loves chickens and enjoys gathering eggs. 


At the start of this essay—as is true for all of the essays in her 
collection—Kingsolver includes a drawing by an artist named Paul 
Mirocha. In this case, the picture is of a hand cradling an egg in its palm. 

Lecture 11—The Visual Essay: Words + Pictures|81


Obviously, Mirocha’s picture reinforces Kingsolver’s words. Further, because 
the drawings in the book are highly detailed black-and-white sketches, 
this style of illustration echoes 19th-century woodcuts or old-fashioned 
children’s book pictures. In other words, the style of Mirocha’s sketches 
brings to mind a one-to-one correlation between word and image that 
typifies essays and memoirs that are illustrated in a traditional way.


To reinforce words through images is a straightforward yet highly engaging 
way to enhance your writing and to bring even more meaning into your visual 
essays. But if your aim is either to call into question the assumed power of 
images or to create a kind of tension—perhaps a conversation or an actual 
argument—across words and pictures, then you might also wish to try 
another kind of visual approach called “second-sight essays.”


In these essays, writers want readers not just to look more closely at 
pictures but to look at them again, to re-see them, to view them anew. 
More often than not, these essayists are writing about what they believe 
pictures can and cannot contain: whether pictures have the ability to 
capture human memory or history fully, whether they have an inherent 
morality or should be held to an ethical standard, or whether their 
artistry is more important than their subject matter. 


The writers who craft second-sight essays are often amateur 
philosophers, cultural critics, or self-proclaimed intellectuals. They are 
intrigued by the doubleness of all imagery: how it represents a person, 
a place, a thing, or an idea but how, too, it can never actually be that 
person, place, thing, or idea. As we know, all pictures—regardless of 
medium—are just substitutes for the real, the actual, and the now. 


Thus, second-sight essays initiate dialogues across language and image to 
create an interdependent reading experience, one in which the pictures 
convey the writers’ ideas as much as their carefully chosen words, their 
metaphors, or their attention to pathos- and logos-based appeals. 


A compelling example is Roland Barthes’ well-known reflections on 
photography, Camera Lucida, a series of short, interlinked essays that 
contemplate the elusive power of a photograph to create and shape 
reality. In some of his essays, Barthes embeds certain photographs, 
allowing a reader to see them. In others, however, he doesn’t, and his 
photographic absences are as important as the pictures he provides.

82|Becoming a Great Essayist


In writing your own visual essays, you might try this second-sight 
approach. If you’re interested in this method, you’ll want to make 
whatever pictures you include a vital part of your essay’s purpose. These 
pictures should “talk” or “speak” every bit as much as the words, and 
in fact, the words and the pictures should have a kind of conversation 
within your piece. 


You might also want to consider whether you wish to refrain from giving 
a reader all the images you’re discussing—whether you want to create 
deliberate absences that “talk” or “speak” through strategic silences. 


Whether you decide that you’d like to try writing an essay based around 
your relationship with a single picture—as Winterson does—or attempt an 
essay that’s illustrated with images that exemplify the story you’re trying to 
tell—as Kingsolver does—or perhaps try a second-sight essay in which you 
put pictures and words in dialogue with each other—as Barthes does—it’s 
important for you to try to create a visual essay. Whether we realize it or not, 
all of us are visual thinkers. The images that are a part of our daily lives—from 
snapshots of family members on the fridge to a painting that hangs in the 
living room—speak to us, telling us stories of who we are as well as whom 
we hope to be.

Writing Inch by Inch: From Draft to Polish
 I 
t’s no secret that most writers feel blocked on occasion in their 
careers. But the idea that writers must wait around for an “invisible 
influence”—in the words of Percy Bysshe Shelley—is a fiction that can 
be damaging to the writer’s psychological and physical health. It’s true that 
some writers continue to live with the idea that a muse will inspire them, 
but overwhelmingly, writing isn’t about finding inspiration from a fickle 
source outside yourself. As hackneyed as it might sound, it’s about nothing 
more than hard work and finding inspiration from within. 
Starting the First Draft


As you begin to write, what may help to keep you from worrying too much 
about what you’re drafting is a liberating idea from the funny, cranky, and 
generous Anne Lamott, an essayist who believes that everyone—from novice 
writers to bestselling authors—writes “shitty” first drafts. If nothing else, 
Lamott boosts the confidence of beginning writers, who are almost all in the 
grip of nasty imposter syndrome. Thinking of every first draft of every essay 
you’ll write as a shitty first draft helps to free you from the sense that you’re 
a fraud.


How does an essayist even begin a bad first draft? At the risk of citing a 
platitude, whatever your topic may be and whatever your hoped-for purpose, 
it’s best to start at the very beginning. You might even try just writing a first 
sentence. Although this first sentence isn’t necessarily the most significant part 
of an essay, it’s your invitation into the writing. 

84|Becoming a Great Essayist


One intriguing first sentence comes from Gloria Anzaldúa’s essay “How 
to Tame a Wild Tongue.” Her book Borderlands/La Frontera begins this way: 
“‘We’re going to have to control your tongue,’ the dentist says, pulling out 
all the metal from my mouth.” This first sentence is good for a number of 
reasons.


First, it’s active. The sentence starts with a line of dialogue and an implied 
scene. Readers can easily imagine themselves sitting in the dental chair, at 
the mercy of the dentist. 


This sentence also provides an idea of character—both the dentist’s 
and the narrator’s. With his use of the royal “we,” the dentist seems to 
have a bit of a superiority complex, while Anzaldúa herself is in a more 
vulnerable position. Yet she is also the one who is creating the essay. 
The mere juxtaposition between the essay’s title, “How to Tame a Wild 
Tongue,” and this opening sentence makes it clear that Anzaldúa isn’t 
happy with this situation. She doesn’t like having someone tame her wild 
tongue, either literally or figuratively.


In addition to giving us a sense of place, Anzaldúa’s first sentence 
also suggests a bit about the people involved and the essay’s ultimate 
purpose. Further, we get the perspective of the essay because Anzaldúa 
uses the pronoun “my.” We’re inside a first-person story, which means 
we’re in the dental chair right alongside her.


Across any essay, the best opening sentences touch on these four elements: 
place, people, perspective, and purpose. Doing so offers a clear invitation to 
the reader—a clear sense of what the essay is going to be about and what 
the writer hopes to convey.


In contrast, let’s look at a bad first sentence, this one from William Hazlitt, 
now often remembered as the father of the modern personal essay. For all 
of Hazlitt’s renown as an essayist, he begins a piece entitled “The First” in 
this way: “Where there’s a will, there’s a way.” This first sentence suffers from 
clichéd prose and overly general diction, and it has none of the necessary 
elements that make for precision or enticement. By quoting a well-worn and 
tedious phrase, Hazlitt has sparked no interest in the reader and has made his 
invitation into the essay both drab and unappealing.

Lecture 12—Writing Inch by Inch: From Draft to Polish|85


As an exercise, write the first sentence of a draft essay. As you work, try to 
make sure your sentence provides a distinct perspective, an idea of place, 
some understanding of the relevant people involved, and a gesture toward 
what you think your purpose might be. If you jot something down, play with it, 
and if you still don’t like your sentence, then try again. 
Continuing the Essay


Once you have a sentence that you’re willing to work with, you’ve taken the 
first step toward to producing a first draft. But think of this sentence as a 
threshold; now it’s time to walk through the door, to see what the interior 
of your essay might look like. Wherever your door may lead, there are 
numerous exercises that can assist you in constructing the middle of your 
essay from that initial threshold sentence. A particular favorite is one from 
Anne Lamott that she calls “short assignments.” As you work through this 
exercise, keep your primary aim in mind: You’re not trying to write a perfect 
essay on the first go. 
If you feel paralyzed at the 
idea of writing a 4,000- to 
10,000-word essay, use the 
one-inch frame exercise; try to 
see the pieces of your essay in 
successive one-inch frames.

86|Becoming a Great Essayist


Lamott likens short assignments to a one-inch picture frame. To step across 
the first-sentence threshold and enter the first room of your essay, write only 
as much as you can see through a one-inch frame. That one-inch might be a 
single paragraph on the first thing you did after the taxi dropped you off in 
the middle of Beijing, and you didn’t speak a word of Chinese. Or that one 
paragraph might be what your father looked like and smelled like as he took 
you into the woods for your first hunting trip. 


When your first one-inch picture is done, then move on to the next one. In 
the essay set in Beijing, the next inch might describe how to use a bathroom 
with no Western toilets. Or in the essay on hunting, the next inch might 
capture that strange little yelp the family dog made before your father told 
it to get up a covey. Of course, when you’re done focusing on that next 
inch, you move to the following one. As Lamott explains, “You don’t have 
to see where you’re going[;] you don’t have to see your destination or 
everything you will pass along the way. You just have to see two or three 
feet ahead of you.” 
Ending and Iceboxing 


Eventually, if you move inch by inch, you will have a terrible first draft of an 
essay. And that’s exactly what you want. But then comes the moment when 
it’s time to stop. Your process of invention isn’t quite over; you need an 
ending. Because essays really must find their own forms, maybe a standard or 
supposedly ideal ending can never be reached. Or it may seem as though any 
ending is arbitrary: You simply stop with a certain line of dialogue, a quotation 
from a favorite writer, a question, a symbol, or an image. 


Just as an essay discovers its own form along the way, it’s also true that, in 
many ways, an essay invents its own ending. Thus, when you’re ready to 
conclude your draft, write a single, one-inch paragraph about something that 
is related to what you’re writing about but that’s also completely distinct. 


If your essay is about the fact that college football is a national narrative 
that rewrites the story of the American dream, then write a paragraph 
about the glorious end of a sandlot softball game you played when you 
were eight years old. 

Lecture 12—Writing Inch by Inch: From Draft to Polish|87


If your essay delves into why Americans seem to have a rapacious need 
to hear ghost stories, then write a one-inch paragraph about a similar 
desire for the legends of Big Foot or Area 51. Make what Lopate calls a 
“wacky diagonal run.” Don’t feel as though you have to tie it all up with a 
big, shiny bow. Really, all you need is a final one-inch frame.


After you’ve completed your terrible first draft, the next step is to icebox it. 
Maybe read through it once the next morning to clean it up a bit, but after 
that, put it in the deep freeze. Remember, even if you put it away for a while, 
your first draft won’t change. What will change during that time, however, is 
you. And as you change, your ability to see—and to re-see—your essay will 
become stronger.


Most beginning writers don’t like to hear it, but the real work of writing isn’t 
invention (the fun at the beginning) or copyediting (the drudgery at the end). 
No, writing is the hard part in between that leads you to something close to 
Once you’re done working 
through your terrible first 
draft, take a moment to 
celebrate both the risk you 
took by attempting to put 
words on paper and your 
accomplishment in doing so.

88|Becoming a Great Essayist
a finished work. As the American poet Mary Oliver says about first drafts and 
writing, “What matters is that you consider what you have on the page as an 
unfinished piece of work that now requires your best conscious and patient 
appraisal.”


After iceboxing, you must return to your essay with that conscious and patient 
appraisal, which cannot happen if you don’t separate yourself from the origins 
of the essay, from the heat of its creation. It’s not your personal connections 
that matter in revision; it’s whether you’ve said what you must say in order to 
captivate, inspire, and move a stranger who will pick up your essay many years 
from now.
Transitioning to Later Drafts


One strategy for transitioning your terrible first draft into a respectable 
second draft and an effective third draft involves a process of re-seeing, of 
coming to your work with fresh eyes.


After you defrost your essay, read it all the way through in one sitting, without 
doing any revising. Imagine that this essay was written by someone else and 
ask yourself what parts interest you the most. Then, take out a red pen and 
cut your essay in half, leaving in only the best parts. 


Put the text you’ve cut somewhere that you can get to it later (although 
you may never look at it again), then take a few days, weeks, or months and 
rebuild your essay. If you want, use the strategy of writing one-inch frames as 
you rebuild; you may tinker with your revised opening sentence; and you may 
write a new ending that once again takes your piece in a diagonal direction. 
This new version is your respectable second draft. 


With your respectable second draft in hand, you must then find a reader. 
Join a writing group, take a workshop, or ask a trusted friend or a colleague. 
Make sure you find someone who will tell you the truth. You need an honest 
critique—not a saccharine or a safe one. 

Lecture 12—Writing Inch by Inch: From Draft to Polish|89


In the end, your best re-vision—your best chance at seeing your work with 
truly new eyes—is when you read the comments about your essay offered by 
your reader. Once you revise your piece based on those comments, you end 
up with your pretty darn good third draft!

Short Forms: Microessays and Prose Poems
 T 
he structure of essays is highly flexible—and the best ones find 
their own forms. Unified by the storytelling perspective of a first-
person “I” speaking from experience, essays spin themselves along, 
seeking the next turn of idea as they go. Essays explore, imagine, and digress. 
They don’t have fixed rules for their structures. They may move lockstep 
through a careful progression, circle back on themselves, or branch out 
in all directions. The form depends on the needs of the writing. Ideally, an 
essay’s form should fit the function of the essayist’s main point as perfectly 
as a glove warms a hand. 
Structure in Writing


Most literary genres have relatively strict rules about structure. For instance, 
as we all learned in high school English class, a traditional short story begins 
with an initiating circumstance, followed by a rising action and a climax, and 
ending with a denouement. 


Essays assigned in school also often come with organizational conventions. 
Students are taught the five-paragraph persuasive essay, the comparison-
contrast essay, the descriptive essay, and so on. 


The construction of such essays helps to demonstrate certain 
approaches to critical thinking, releasing students from developing their 
own forms and allowing them to focus on elements of argumentation, 
description, and narration. 


In essence, then, these educational essays—or “modes of discourse”—
are a first step in developing and honing analytical skills that can enable 

Lecture 13—Short Forms: Microessays and Prose Poems|91
more practiced writers to discover the most appropriate framework for 
whatever essays they attempt. 


Once you’ve discovered what you want to write about and have had a chance 
to practice some of the more mature strategies that help in constructing well-
designed and powerful pieces, your task is to shape your burgeoning ideas 
into a cohesive whole. You must transform your intangible thoughts into an 
apt and elegant structure—one that fits the intention of your primary points.


Of course, with such freedom comes potential doubt. You may find yourself 
perplexed about how to develop the right arrangement for your essay. It’s 
also true that there are numerous essay forms from which to choose, such 
as memoirs, public intellectual essays, travel pieces, and so on. Further, certain 
purposes necessitate certain structures. For now, however, let’s look more 
closely at two intriguing short forms: the “microessay” and the “proem.”
Like a house designed by an 
architect, an essay serves the 
needs of its creator—meaning 
that the essay’s design will 
match your own needs, given 
what you hope to say.

92|Becoming a Great Essayist
The Microessay


In the late 1990s, an award-winning essayist, Dinty Moore, started an online 
journal called Brevity. Moore saw this journal as an experiment in developing 
excellent essays that were 750 words or less—now called “flash nonfiction” 
or “microessays.” For Dinty Moore, microessays are in keeping with other 
distilled art forms, such as two-minute dance solos or brief experimental films. 
He believes that “there’s a through line of emotion, beauty, and discomfort 
that can fit into the tiniest of frames.”


When asked in an interview what writerly qualities define the best 
microessays, Moore’s answer was simple yet direct: “Tight, crisp language. An 
immediate and consistent voice. [And a] [c]arefully shaped structure.” An essay 
called “Split” by student Jess Edwards-Smith encompasses all these qualities.


One thing that’s fascinating about this brief essay is that although the 
author had to sustain a compelling first-person voice, at the same time, 
she also had to figure out how to split her voice in two. She’s successful, 
in part, because her two voices are indeed consistent, even though one 
is optimistic and one morose. 


Both voices speak in straightforward sentences, often starting with 
a simple subject-verb construction (“She sings,” “She turns,” “She 
believes,”), a structure that underscores the candid and direct nature of 
this narrator. 


Also, both voices have instances of precise and vivid imagery, such as 
when the optimistic girl of the past describes her current self as sitting 
in a “blue bubble of laptop light,” whereas the morose girl of the present 
watches her ceiling self “pour steaming tea into a luminescent cup.” Even 
as the author’s two selves are clearly opposed, they also speak as one in 
terms of syntax and style. 


Edwards-Smith chooses the form of a triptych to convey how the same 
person may be split between a dynamic girl of memory and a depressed 
girl of the present. She begins and ends with the remembered girl, the 
ghost girl, while keeping her present-tense self inside the essay’s center. 
As a result, the form directly follows the microessay’s function: The girl’s 
core self—the one that’s actually alive—is sandwiched between two 
sections representing the girl as she used to be. 

Lecture 13—Short Forms: Microessays and Prose Poems|93


In terms of the essay’s structure, then, the center—the place where this 
girl’s actual self resides—is paradoxically drained of motivation, emotion, 
movement, and life. It’s a starved place, both literally and figuratively. 


By bookending the microessay with observations from the ghost girl, 
the girl of the past actually merges with a potential girl—one who’s still 
coming into focus. The ghost girl holds onto the talent, wit, beauty, and 
ambition of the real girl’s previous life, and in the final section, the ghost 
girl suggests that there will be a better future. As these two figures drive 
back home, they merge into one, into “music and smiles.” 
The Proem


As you might expect, a proem is a piece combining aspects of both poetry 
and prose. In the 15th century, a proem actually meant a preface or a preamble. 
The term has evolved from its denotation as a prologue to a connotation 
that involves an elision of prose-like qualities within a poetic structure—or a 
prose-poem. 


Proems adopt the extended rhythms, syntax, punctuation, characters, and 
lines of dialogue that characterize short stories, novels, memoirs, and essays. 
A proem may also be recognized for its scene-like or situational qualities, 
its focus on sound without the intrinsic musicality of a poetic line, its sharp 
imagery, and its block-like form on the page.


One proem that is often reproduced in anthologies is Carolyn Forché’s 
“The Colonel”—a piece about Forché’s experience in the late 1970s with a 
Salvadorian colonel who emptied a sack of human ears in front of her after a 
dinner. While the colonel shook the ears onto a table and swept them to the 
floor, he told both Forché and her friend that their people should not expect 
legal or human rights. 


“The Colonel” is poetic in its sense-based, descriptive detail about this 
monstrous dinner. Forché describes the colonel’s house-turned-fortress, 
with glass shards embedded in his external walls to thwart anyone trying 
to climb over them. She also employs precise, heart-wrenching imagery, 
comparing the ears scattered on the floor to “dried peach halves.” 

94|Becoming a Great Essayist


What keeps this piece simultaneously essayistic, not just poetic, is the 
way in which Forché adopts the confessionality of a creative nonfiction 
narrator who tells a story. From the moment she declares at the outset 
of her proem that she was present, Forché signals her desire both to 
witness and to reveal this horrific event to her readers. 


Furthermore, in terms of form, Forché presents this proem as a single 
block of text made up of simple, short, and severe sentences that 
combine exposition, her own interior monologue, and direct dialogue 
from the colonel. In this way, Forché presents a carefully reconstructed 
scene that tells a brief narrative with a clear beginning, middle, and end.


Another example of a proem comes from a writing student named Matthew 
Alexander who came to college after serving as a U.S. Marine in Afghanistan. 
As with Forché’s proem, Alexander’s piece also brings together the narrative 
qualities of prose with the rhythms, sounds, descriptions, and imagery of 
poetry. The piece is called “Same Drab Walls.”


Once again, although this structure is distinctly different than that of 
a microessay, the author’s chosen form fits the function of his intent. 
With this proem, Alexander creates a kind of stream-of-consciousness 
in which everything he remembers and everything he experiences are 
held within a single block of text. The compactness of this form brings 
to the fore the crowded, claustrophobic emotions both expressed and 
withheld in the proem. 


Although there’s a story here—one that’s suspended between two 
similar yet different bedrooms in two distinct times and places—the 
essay is shaped by a poet’s ear more than a storyteller’s sense of plot 
or sequence. With his repetition of the phrase “Strange how,” Alexander 
creates a kind of refrain, an effect that likens this recurring phrase to the 
strange vacillation he feels between the life he is living in college and the 
one he has left in Afghanistan. 


To further stress this constantly fluctuating perspective, Alexander also 
uses parallel syntactic constructions throughout the piece. For instance, 
he says, “He didn’t belong,” then adds “I didn’t belong”; he tells his readers 
that his memories are both “ones to remember and ones to forget”; and 
he notes that for him, “time passes but also stops.” As a result, Alexander 
is able to draw on the poet’s powers of linking sound to sense. 

Lecture 13—Short Forms: Microessays and Prose Poems|95


Further, the proem fully engages the reader’s senses. Readers see the 
rifle versus the novel, hear the echoes of combat against the foghorn 
announcing a party, and smell the sweat and heat emanating from both 
barracks and dorm rooms. By placing the reader’s own body within the 
proem, when Alexander turns to address Benny, the reader feels the loss 
of Benny’s body all the more. 


This turn also signals a change in the proem’s perspective, especially 
when Alexander takes on the first-person “I” at the end to talk directly 
to Benny. In classical rhetoric, to speak to someone who isn’t present 
is to engage an “apostrophe,” a figure of speech in which a narrator 
communicates with a third party who is absent or cannot be seen. Thus, 
when Alexander says, “In the shadows of my new room within these 
new drab walls, I can still see you, Benny,” he’s apostrophizing his lost 
friend and fellow soldier. 


This address to Benny creates a deep sense of intimacy. When Alexander 
writes, “And it’s worth every bit, Benny. Your life and Conger’s legs. It’s 
well worth it all for what we have now: an education and a future,” we 
readers feel as if we’re overhearing a conversation. The moment is raw, 
wretched, and hopeful. And it’s how Alexander makes the stream-of-
consciousness of his essay less about his own struggles and more about 
the inevitable losses of war.


Did these student authors know that they needed the structure of a 
microessay or a proem to write the essays they intended to write? No, they 
did not. Instead, both of them had a burgeoning sense of what they hoped 
to convey, then began writing. Their drafts changed as they went along, but 
eventually, after revision, their essays found the forms that were best suited 
for their subjects.

“Split” by Jess Edwards-Smith
She thinks through worst-case scenarios with her best fake smile, and I watch 
her converse with a lover like the lover is mine. I know she’s not being honest 
when she tells him, “Oh yeah, babe, everything’s great,” because even though I 
don’t really know her anymore, I know the lie in the second-and-a-half space 
between expression and reaction. I am her consciousness; I float between this 
moment and the next. She sees me up here on the ceiling. I smile back. She 
doesn’t.
She doesn’t know what time it is anymore. Hunger pains are second-hands she 
ignores. The only numbers she seems to remember are statistics. Late at night, and 
I watch her Google “How many college girls have depression?” It’s 45%. She must 
think that knowing statistics will keep her from becoming one. I hold the hurt she 
no longer feels. I tell her to eat or to go outside or to write something pretty or 
at least to write something, but she never listens to me. She just lies on the floor 
in a blue bubble of laptop light.
She believes I took her soul, but then again, she doesn’t like that word “empty.” 
She blames me for being smart, hopeful, organized, full, and well-rested. She thinks 
that because I am all of those things, she can’t be. But when she had a soul, she 
was talent, wit, beauty, and ambition. I remind her that I’m keeping safe these 
things that once filled her, but when I say that they’re up here with me, she gets 
angry or quiet. She says she can’t reach.
I do not remember forgetting myself. I never used to look up and see a girl floating 
above me, out of reach, holding everything I once was and wanted. She looks like me 
and she smiles like I used to, and sometimes I can even trick myself into smiling like 
that, watching my mouth open and close in the fluorescent bathroom mirror, repeating, 
“It’s all good; it’s all good; it’s all good.”
I can’t tell you when the split happened. It’s like rain—you never see the first drop, but 
after a while, you’re caught in a downpour, and you don’t remember when you started 
missing the sun.
But at least in storms, you can’t see the light you’re missing. She’s quick to give me 
memories, bursts of light. “Here, see this day when you brought home your puppy? 
(continued on next page)

Lecture 13—Short Forms: Microessays and Prose Poems|97
Look at that front-page article you published. Why aren’t you proud?” She’s annoying, 
giving me advice and telling me things I already know. The more I ignore her, the 
louder she gets. She wants me to do well. She believes I can. As if finding the rhythm 
of normalcy is as easy as brushing my teeth. “Hey, it’s warm out today. Let’s go on 
a hike,” she says. “Hey, it’s lunchtime. There’s a sandwich in the fridge,” she says. 
“Hey, you really can’t afford not to get a job this summer. Do you want to get stuck 
waitressing at that seafood place again?”
The girl on the ceiling is happy and attractive and good at all the things I was 
once good at. I watch her drift around up there, stringing sparkling beads into 
necklaces, reciting Romantic poetry. I watch her giggle and pour steaming tea into 
a luminescent cup, asking me if I want one spoonful of sugar or two. She knows I 
won’t answer. I never do. But she asks anyway because courtesy is something else I 
lost in the split.
I follow her into her car, and the ceiling is much closer. I’m just above her head. 
These are moments when we feel almost connected. She is still warm with life; 
she listens when I tell her I wish I could give her back what she thinks I stole. 
But as much as I want to be let back in, I can’t be without her permission. And 
I don’t think she knows how to give it to me. She starts the engine, drives over 
the big bridge, heading back home from school. Her stereo is turned all the 
way up, and I float into the speakers, into the music, into her ears. She sings 
every word of the songs she finds me in, and that’s invitation enough. She 
turns up the music and smiles. And so for a song or two—for a drive—we are 
again one.

“Same Drab Walls” by Matt Alexander
Twelve years after public school, memories fade and new ones emerge. Ones to 
remember and ones to forget. Ones violent and past and ones still in the present 
tense. My first taste of freedom—away from my family, away from my friends—was 
a drab white room, no pictures allowed. The sounds all around me were of drunken 
men walking the hallways. Yelling, laughing, crying. Funny how a single weekend can 
show the whole range of human emotions in a four-story brick building made from 
the blankness of warfare. Sometimes we would talk about our friends back home; 
sometimes we would talk about our families, but there was one constant that never 
changed: we talked about our Brothers. The way we lost them in country, the way 
we lose them at home. Strange how the most dangerous place for a Marine can be 
in his own backyard. When those same drab walls began to close in, and the hum in 
my ears got louder and louder, all I could hear was the echoing sounds of combat. 
My new roommate heard nothing but silence or the videogame he was playing. 
He wasn’t in “the ghan” with us, so I shunned him; we all shunned him. He didn’t 
belong. Weird how, after coming home, I started to feel that I didn’t belong. Now, 
though, in the room I live in, pictures are allowed and no sergeant is telling me what 
to do. No field day every night, no 4:00 AM wake-up, no drunken men crying in the 
corridors. Crazy how, in the blink of an eye, it was a rifle, and now it’s a novel. Now 
there’s a door that locks and my own bed. A place to think, read, write, where the 
shadows from the past can’t always reach me and where peace has started to set 
in. That quiet sound of peace, no hum at all, just the occasional fog horn. Cool how 
that fog horn is an announcement for a nearby party and not something else. The 
room still smells like the barracks, looks like the barracks, and it still has the sound 
of men, but only sometimes drunk and never crying. Now there is laughter and 
students cheering for the home team. Strange how the differences are easy; it’s the 
similarities that are hard. So Benny didn’t make it here with me like we’d planned, 
and that’s a bummer. His life remains back there, in a world I’ve almost forgotten. 
In the shadows of my new room within these new drab walls, I can still see you, 
Benny. So I guess I’m not all alone here like I thought I would be. And there’s a 
picture on the wall, the one we took on our first deployment with Conger. That 
picture is my motivation. I wake up with it and fall asleep to it, flashing a small light 
towards it when I roll over from a dream in the dark. And it’s worth every bit, 
Benny. Your life and Conger’s legs. It’s well worth it all for what we have now: an 
education and a future. Strange how you’re both here and there with me in those 
memories. Strange how time passes and also stops.

Lecture 14
The Memoir Essay
 A 
memoir essay is a piece of writing that draws on a writer’s past, 
then uses that past as a means of self-reflection. Such an essay 
often returns to a painful or difficult moment, such as a bout with 
breast cancer or the time the writer was unfairly fired from a much-loved 
job. Unlike a personal essay that may be pulled from a writer’s past, present, 
or even an imagined future and may be focused on any topic, a memoir 
essay must evolve from the intimate recollections a writer excavates from 
his or her own life, coupled with thoughtful reflections on those memories. 
Reminiscence


The word “memoir” is derived from the French definition of mémoire, meaning 
“reminiscence.” This word is an evocative one, for reminiscence is more than 
mere memory. To reminisce also means to recover innate knowledge held by 
the soul or the subconscious—knowledge that comes out of a collective and 
ancient sense of the human. Thus, the very idea of writing a memoir essay has 
embedded within it simultaneous acts of retrieval and revelation.


David Owen, a staff writer for The New Yorker, wrote an essay called “Scars,” 
in which he used the marks on his own body as a map of his childhood and 
teenage memories. 


In one sense, Owen’s scars are a handy means for accessing certain 
recollections: the gouge on his toe from cherry-bomb shrapnel; a mark 
on his arm from a “molten G.I. Joe”; and so on. 


Yet as his wounds accumulate in the essay, Owen’s scars come to 
represent more than pain followed by healing. They don’t represent 
just resilience; they also represent loss. In particular, they represent the 

100|Becoming a Great Essayist
loss of his childhood friend Duncan, who died relatively young and who 
was present at many of the everyday disasters that resulted in Owen’s 
injuries. 


Although scars tell the tale of a body’s resistance, they also foretell the 
body’s death. Thus, Owen’s revelation is this profound and melancholy 
truth: Our scars determine our losses as much as they attest to our will 
to survive.


In this way, a memoir essayist looks backward in order to teach forward. Any 
private recollection stemming from a writer’s narrow, individual life should 
ultimately shed light on the lives of countless others he or she may never 
meet. There’s a whole world of people with their own scar-tissue memorials, 
and Owen’s essay invites those people in. 
Opening a Memoir Essay 


“Opening My Eyes” by Matt Flyr is about a study tour the author took to 
South Africa with a group of students; it was the first time he’d ever traveled 
out of the country.


The opening of the essay offers sharp, precise, and vivid details from an 
expedition to swim with sharks. 


Flyr doesn’t write in vague generalizations or with a bunch of boring 
minutiae. For instance, in the moment of greatest tension, just before he 
slides into the cage, he writes, “I swing my legs over the boat’s side. I see 
the outlines of the sharks, breaking from their methodical movements 
to snap their jaws over slivers of innocent chum.” The writing gives us 
arresting and evocative detail. 


The author uses exact verbs to re-create particular actions. He “swings” 
his legs, while the sharks “break” their swimming to “snap” their jaws. Also, 
Flyr uses just the right imagery to show his uneasy mood. The sharks are 
mere “outlines” under the water, and the pieces of chum are “innocent 
slivers,” which symbolically stand in for the author himself. Note, too, 
that Flyr describes the sharks’ movements as “methodical.” This adjective 
evokes a sense of their viciousness as both calculated and cold. 

Lecture 14—The Memoir Essay|101


In any memoir essay, it’s crucial to plumb the depths of your recollections for 
precise details about the time and place you’re trying to recall. If you can’t 
quite remember the texture of certain particulars, do your homework. Sift 
through old photographs or return to the place where your memories first 
occurred. Ask family members and friends what they recall about the people, 
places, and events you’re attempting to re-create. 


Then, wake up your details by using some of the same techniques that Flyr 
uses. Choose exact verbs. Create vibrant and relevant imagery. Use just the 
right adjective to describe the best noun you can find for the job. Without this 
level of precision, any writer’s memories become flabby and generic. Be just 
as careful, though, not to cram copious amounts of detail into every margin 
of your memoir. Without an emotional interpretation to connect these details 
to the greater purpose of your essay, your detail-studded style will quickly 
become tedious.


Flyr also keeps himself and the memory he’s sharing inside a place of struggle. 
He doesn’t save himself as the focal figure and narrator of his tale. In fact, 
he’s not the hero here. Instead, Flyr is consistently insecure and consistently 
In a memoir essay, you need to 
show your memories, not just 
tell them; in Matt Flyr’s essay, the 
author seeks to show the sharks 
as cold-blooded killers, not 
merely say that they are scary. 

102|Becoming a Great Essayist
attentive to what’s happening around him. In trying to muster the courage to 
swim with sharks, he also shows us that he’s terrified to do it. 


A memoir essay shouldn’t be a memory dressed up as a heroic tale, nor should 
it be a long lament about how hard you had it in the past or how unlucky you 
are now. Your motivation for the writing should be to grapple with the struggle 
of it all—with the mess. Flyr’s piece is about his struggle in trying to get himself 
into the shark-infested waters, and it’s in relating such struggle that any memoir 
essay gets at some part of what it means to be human. 
Reflecting on Memories


Despite its strengths, the opening of Flyr’s essay is not yet fully memoir. It’s 
written from memory, and it does a good job of re-creating memory, but the 
author isn’t yet reflecting on what he remembers. In order for this piece to 
rise to the level of true memoir, the author is required to reminisce.


Just as there’s a risk in swimming with sharks, there’s also a risk in revealing 
one’s own insecurities. Thus, Flyr must shift from thinking chiefly about his 
bodily risk to considering his psychological, moral, spiritual, and emotional risks. 
To write memoir, authors must be vulnerable to their readers. They must link 
external observations to a kind of internal honesty. 


In the next section, Flyr’s memoir essay starts to move in this direction, toward 
vulnerability and self-knowledge. After he admits to the reader that he closed 
his eyes while slipping into the shark cage, there’s a white-space break, and he 
goes on to talk about other experiences he had in South Africa in the weeks 
leading up to the shark adventure. 


Without overtly stating it, Flyr’s essay evolves from grappling with his 
fear of sharks into grappling with the much more convoluted fears of 
race, class, and ethnic difference. Here, he comes to recognize his own 
privilege as an American tourist and his biases about this place and these 
people—biases based on his textbook and mass-media understandings 
of South Africans and the history of apartheid. 


To offer such revelations means that Flyr is taking a risk. He’s exposing 
himself as someone with both privilege and prejudice. Although there 

Lecture 14—The Memoir Essay|103
are other kinds of essays that draw on real-life experience, memoir 
essays are particularly revealing about a writer’s own life. They’re often 
confessional, touching on taboo or potentially scandalous topics. 


The memoir essay demands that you take chances. To write one, you must 
talk openly about what most people want to hide. You must take a long, 
hard look at your own foibles and at embarrassing or unflattering moments 
from your past. A memoir essay is all about the raw and brutal truth of the 
essayist’s own life.


Flyr approaches his difficult topic—memories that lay bare his own racism—
in a literary way. In particular, he employs the twinned metaphors of blindness 
and sight to reveal his racist preconceptions about South Africans.


First, Flyr draws on the metaphor of blindness—about what it means 
not to see or not to understand what one sees. He talks about his first 
few days in Cape Town, which of course are days of culture shock. He 
can’t navigate the roads—which is a kind of directional blindness. He 
doesn’t understand the Xhosa language—a linguistic blindness. And he’s 
confused by the broken glass and barbed wire surrounding the houses 
owned by the wealthy white population, a population that remains 
invisible to him—which amounts to a cultural blindness.


Then, as Flyr and his fellow students climb on a bus to head to the 
Langa township, his blindness intensifies. He wants to keep his gaze 
blinkered, focused on his fellow classmates, on all that is “recognizable” 
and “comforting.” When he finally peeks out a window, he sees what 
he expects to see through the taint of preconceived notions. He writes, 
“Through the dirty glass, I see the outskirts of the township—houses 
made of shipping containers, underfed stray dogs running to smell the 
severed goat heads being prepared over an open fire by women with 
faces smeared in a strange white paste.” 


Note how Flyr takes on the perspective of a white, Western outsider 
visiting what in the 19th century was called “darkest Africa.” He plugs 
into racist and ethnic stereotypes that have circulated for centuries when 
describing how Africans live: the extreme poverty, seemingly backward 
customs, and even the dirtiness of the window itself. And Flyr heightens 
his fear of difference by making a bold reference back to the first part of 

104|Becoming a Great Essayist
his essay. He claims, “I am a human among sharks, and soon I’ll have no 
boat to protect me.”


It’s here, though, when he likens South Africans to sharks, that Flyr 
demonstrates his willingness to look hard at his own failings in order 
to understand them better—to recollect them and to reflect on them. 
Looking back at this moment after much time has passed, Flyr knows 
that thinking of these people as “sharks” is a racist fear. 


His search for self-knowledge is revealed when he shows us how he 
stepped off the bus and closed his eyes—literally engaging in self-
blinding—and calls this gesture a “childlike escape.” Here, Flyr admits his 
immaturity; he establishes credibility by admitting his own blindness but 
also opens himself and his readers up to a new kind of sight: one of 
kindness, self-possession, openness, joy, and hope. 


Flyr is confessional without being narcissistic. And although there is personal 
peril in his confessionality, the potential reward in writing an honest and 
thoughtful memoir essay is, in the words of Socrates, to know thyself. It is by 
trying to understand the self in all its chaos and confusion that we can come 
to know the world better.

Lecture 15
Lyric Essays: Writing That Sings
 A 
lyric poem is a short poem that was originally meant to be sung. 
It expresses the poet’s thoughts through the intimacy of the first-
person “I,” and unlike a ballad or an epic, it does not tell a story. 
Lyric essays are those that link the wholeness of prose to the grace and 
eloquence of poetry. In this aspect, they are similar to the proem, although 
unlike many proems, a lyric essay is often storyless. It’s a form that moves by 
association, not progression, accumulating its meaning through fragments. 
As a result, there is no real resolution at the end of a lyric essay. Even after 
the last word, the writer is still probing, seeking, and wondering. 
Qualities of Lyric Essays


Because the voice of a lyric essayist is one that probes and seeks, it is almost 
always a private, ruminating voice. To read a lyric essay is to eavesdrop on the 
desires and doubts of a secret mind. 


Consider this sentence from Joan Didion’s piece on her recurring 
migraines, from an essay she entitled “In Bed”: “When I am in a migraine 
aura, I will drive through red lights, lose the house keys, spill whatever I am 
holding, lose the ability to focus my eyes or frame coherent sentences, 
and generally give the appearance of being on drugs, or drunk.”


On the one hand, this short excerpt demonstrates that Didion’s writing 
is lyrical. It has a cadence. Didion draws on alliteration (with “drugs” and 
“drunk”) and assonance (with phrases such as “I am in a migraine aura”), 
as well as on the staccato rhythms of monosyllabic words (“drive,” “red,” 
“lose,” “house,” and so on). 


On the other hand, Didion’s readers aren’t just listening to the musical 
qualities of her writing; they’re also swallowed inside the throbbing head 

106|Becoming a Great Essayist
of a migraine sufferer. We follow the ferocity of Didion’s private pain by 
following the meanderings of her migrained mind. 


Although Didion’s voice rambles, it is also reticent, restrained, and reserved. 
Unlike a memoir essayist who hinges meaning on full confessionality, the lyric 
essayist is almost always coy or shy. Lyric essayists are hesitant to fill in all the 
blanks of their experience because they, too, are unsure about what exactly 
those blanks should hold. 


A final quality that tends to define a lyric essayist is the ability to create a 
strong mood. Another well-known writer of the lyric form is John D’Agata. 
In one of his essays, D’Agata offers the following paragraph to sum up an 
amateur bus driver’s attempt at being a tour guide. D’Agata’s essay is about 
going with family members to visit the Hoover Dam, trapped on a six-hour 
bus ride without air conditioning.
[The driver’s] words emit circles, whip bubbles around our heads. His 
sentences wrap around the bus and greet themselves in midair. All 
the way to the dam the bus rumbles inside this cloud, … the tour 
transforms into a silent scratchy film that is slowly flitting backward 
through frames of older dreams.


Although D’Agata is paying allegiance to the facts of his experience, he 
also withholds basic information from the reader, such as where they 
were and the sites they saw. Instead, D’Agata silences this information 
by turning it into metaphoric circles and bubbles that form a cloud 
wrapping itself around the bus. 


Keep in mind that it’s not just the details that matter in a lyric essay; it’s 
also the mood of the writing, its sensibility. D’Agata’s mood here is both 
a bit humorous and poignant, suggesting that the history that’s presented 
to tourists in the forms of monuments, gift shops, and tours is fleeting. 


Just as a lyric poem cannot unearth every detail or spy into every corner, a 
lyric essay, too, depends on silence as much as speech. Any leap from one 
paragraph or sentence to the next should be understood as the same kind of 
leap found between poetic stanzas or lines. As such, a lyric essay depends on 
its breaks and fissures as much as its sounds.

Lecture 15—Lyric Essays: Writing That Sings|107
Lyric Essays and Memory


This dependence on gaps and suggestion aligns the lyric essay with the 
workings of human memory, and that makes it a type of essay well-suited to 
exploring recollection. 


To understand this idea, try this exercise. Start by going back to the 
recollection that is your earliest memory. Such memories are usually a series 
of two or three visual flashes with a bit of sound, taste, or tactility thrown 
in. You probably hold onto them because they were moments of emotional 
intensity; their passion or agony or joy was seared into your brain. 


The trick of forming a lyric essay out of such memories is to take the shimmering 
shards and write each discrete image into its own rare shape and sound. The 
point isn’t to string them together like beads on a necklace. Rather, the idea is 
to think of your words as individual notes that when played in a sequence, allow 
your readers to hear and feel the full, whole melody of your piece. 
The powerful feelings we 
associate with memory shards 
are not about storytelling 
but about brute emotion—
frustration, agony, or fear.

108|Becoming a Great Essayist
“Alone” by Benedict O’Connor


The student essay “Alone” by Benedict O’Connor is lyrical precisely because 
the piece is poetic rather than narrative or persuasive, polemical or reflective. 
The author crafts a mosaic, with each of his sections forming a separate “tile” 
of thought and sound that, when seen and heard as a whole, snaps into focus 
as a single, striking picture.


In the seven sections of this lyric essay, O’Connor tries to capture the 
somatic and psychic feeling of solitude. He wants his readers to re-feel and, 
thus, re-experience his aloneness through their own bodies. We are asked to 
walk in the woods, sift sand, spoon a lover, and drive through the night with 
him. Each section of his lyrical essay is active and palpable, and O’Connor 
focuses on heightening the readers’ senses through his poetic and precise 
diction and imagery.


One thing that makes O’Connor’s essay lyrical is that his speaker’s voice is 
both meandering and reticent. Initially, his meandering is made literal as we 
walk alongside him through the woods. But such meandering quickly becomes 
metaphoric as he transitions from striding down a dark path to striding in and 
out of life’s experiences, driving or sleeping or sifting sand. 


O’Connor also creates an interesting thematic tension between 
walking—which gives him movement and activity—and his essay’s 
focus on aloneness, which has a static quality of helplessness. This is an 
unwanted solitude that O’Connor cannot seem to shake, no matter 
what he does or whom he’s with. 


The author also meanders in and out of images by threading certain 
phrases and pictures across the totality of his essay: the spinning wheel 
of the moon, the white truck, the invisible string, and so on. In this way, 
his meandering mind is woven together into a kind of whole: a complex 
image of what it means for him to be alone.


Yet O’Connor’s meandering voice is also a reticent one. He doesn’t tell us 
whether he appreciates being alone or whether he believes it’s a loss of 
human connection. There are times when his imagery suggests that there’s 
a beauty in solitude; at other times, it’s clear that his aloneness is fearful or 

Lecture 15—Lyric Essays: Writing That Sings|109
melancholy. O’Connor’s essay refuses to be clear about his desire for or 
rejection of being alone; thus, the totality of his piece is in its contradiction: 
that his solitude is both productive and damaging.


Finally, note that O’Connor’s essay is consistent in creating a certain mood 
through a quietly rhythmic tone. The music of his essay is slow and soft, 
sometimes somber and sometimes aching in its loveliness. 
Lyric Essays and Storytelling


As we’ve said, lyric essays are often plotless, yet there are lyrical pieces that 
manage to retain a rough sketch of a plot. This is the case in an essay entitled 
“Grip” by Joy Castro—an essayist and novelist who writes about the violence 
that typified her childhood in an abusive home and how that childhood still 
shadows her adult life, particularly as a mother. 


Castro’s attention to lyricism in this essay is obvious, with her metaphors and 
her use of alliteration and assonance. Like O’Connor, Castro also provides a 
rhythm to her musicality through parallelisms.


But perhaps what’s most intriguing is how, in “Grip,” Castro has threaded 
together three sets of memory shards from three distinct moments in her 
life to produce a plot—one from a shooting range, one from her infant 
son’s bedroom, and one from a story about her stepfather breaking into her 
mother’s house. 


Yet true to the distinctive qualities that make lyrical essays what they are, Castro 
withholds as much information as she offers through these three scenes. She 
tells us that her mother “wouldn’t say what happened in the house” the night 
that her stepfather broke in. And Castro herself doesn’t expound on the abuse 
that she experienced as a child. In this way, even though Castro’s essay has a 
narrative arc, it remains more imaginative and shapely than either confessional 
or exhaustive.

110|Becoming a Great Essayist
Assignment: Writing a Lyric Essay


To bring together all the elements of lyric essay writing that we’ve discussed, 
return to your own memory shards and try weaving them together with 
additional shards from two other points in your life history—ideally, points 
that aren’t too close together. Try to form a connection among these three 
spots of time through a common idea or image. 


Don’t worry about being chronological; your aim is to make vivid 
impressions on your reader from each moment, impressions that will 
eventually circle around the core of your primary image or idea. 


And with each memory shard that you render in words, set a brief 
scene, have yourself or another character engage a specific action or say 
a line of dialogue, and work hard to provide descriptive detail and a well-
defined metaphor or two. 


After you’ve written your draft of this lyric essay, print it out, take a pair of 
scissors, and cut your essay into its discrete points in time. Try rearranging 
the parts as you would a puzzle, looking for new patterns as you go. As you 
rearrange, read each version of your lyric essay out loud, listening closely to 
the cadence of your piece with each new composition.

Lecture 16
The Epistolary Essay: Letters to the World
 L 
etters seem to have a magical ability to resurrect their authors in 
ways that other kinds of writing do not. The epistolary form seems 
almost like holy writ—documents that contain death and life, the 
self and the reader, as well as the past and the eternal present tense. 
Unlike other forms of communication, letters live; they have their own tiny 
heartbeats, even long after the letter writer is gone. 
Assignment, Part I: Writing a Letter 


As a first assignment for this lecture, write a letter to someone with whom 
you have an ongoing and rich relationship. In this letter, write about a pivot 
point from your own life, then explain to your recipient something about how 
this life-changing event has changed you. 


Perhaps you’ve always wanted to tell this person about this particular 
moment—to thank him or her in some way for having had a role in 
the event. Maybe you want to convey to your receiver the struggle you 
went through at this particular time in your life. Or maybe you’ve never 
written about this moment but now want to reflect on it many years 
after it took place. 


Whatever your motivation for choosing this subject and this recipient, 
take your letter seriously and make sure that it’s handwritten. Then, mail 
the letter.


After you’ve posted the letter, in the two or three days that it will take to 
arrive at your recipient’s door, contact this person through two additional 
mediums, such as e-mail or text message. Note that you don’t have to refer to 

112|Becoming a Great Essayist
the life-changing event in this contact; you just have to reach out in other ways 
before your snail-mail letter arrives.


After your recipient gets your letter and has had a chance to digest it, get 
back in touch in whatever way you wish and ask the person what difference it 
makes to receive a handwritten letter as opposed to a text or an e-mail. What 
is it about the hard-copy letter that makes it distinct from these other forms 
of written communication? 


It’s likely that your recipient will note that it felt special to receive a letter 
from you and that this piece of writing may be saved in a way that e-mail and 
text messages cannot. You may hear that your letter feels particularly intimate, 
largely because you took the time to write it. The slowness of the exchange 
encourages a deeper, more extended, and more sustained conversation. 


This exercise underscores the idea that a letter is unlike any other form of 
writing. And it’s this singularity that draws essayists to the form. Writers look 
to capitalize on the unique elements that define the genre of the letter—its 
intimacy, immediacy, materiality, and privacy—in writing epistolary essays.
Unique Qualities of Letters


With origins in politics, philosophy, and theology, epistolary essays obviously 
push letters from the private sphere into the public one. Indeed, sometimes 
epistolary essays start out as private letters and later become published 
pieces. Other times, epistolary essays are deliberately offered as “open letters” 
to a wide readership. Either way, what distinguishes an epistolary essay from 
other kinds of essays is that the author expects to adopt the innate ethos of 
intimacy that’s embedded in a handwritten letter.


With this innate combination of immediacy and intimacy, an epistolary 
essayist can also tap into a collective psychology that’s captured and circulated 
through letters—because letters are assumed to contain human desire and 
reveal human truth. 


Consider, for example, Frank Warren’s PostSecret project, which includes 
a series of books, a website, a TED talk, and a touring show, all of which

Part of the mystique of a 
letter is the script itself; the

feature the same, simple act: millions of anonymous people mailing 
postcards to Warren that reveal their greatest secrets.


Recall, too, that many people hold onto boxes of old letters from past 
lovers or dead family members. Further, we Americans maintain archives 
that house our “national letters” because we see them as a repository of 
our country and our culture. Letters articulate both nations and selves. 
The epistolary essayist may take for granted that his or her piece will 
carry with it a strong sense of reality and veracity. 


An epistolary essayist may also take for granted that readers will recognize 
themselves in the piece. Although we believe that letters convey the 
unvarnished truth of a relationship between two people, we also enjoy the 
“thrill of voyeurism mingled with the wonder of recognition” that letters 
provide. Even across centuries, there is an undisguised nakedness to epistolary 
communications. From letters, we hear ordinary people speaking of their 
dreams, their loves and heartbreaks, their jealousy and avarice, their struggles 
and their aspirations. 


As historians Lisa Grunwald and Stephen J. Adler explain in their anthology 
Letters of the Century, letters provide “what history sounds like when it 
is still part of everyday life.” Although we readers may feel a bit voyeuristic 
overhearing the private confidences or confessions contained within letters, we 
also nod our heads, recalling our own struggles with loss, love, frustration, and 
anger. Letters ring true, and what people write in them tends to be believed. 
Letters versus Epistolary Essays


The common denominator that makes epistolary essays letter-like is that, 
even though they are public documents, they speak to a certain recipient and, 
thus, retain their credibility as trustworthy, confidential communications. 


Epistolary essayists play up the genre’s privacy by addressing the essay 
to a particular person, revealing aspects of a relationship between two 
people that serves as a representation of more universal themes and 
ideas. 

Lecture 16—The Epistolary Essay: Letters to the World|115


In this way, the epistolary essayist is able to adopt a kind of “private 
publicity”—a simultaneity of secrecy and openness—that is particularly 
powerful when writing about controversial or complex topics. 


The writer of an epistolary essay hopes to teach something profound to the 
reader—something that moves the letter beyond just a private expression of 
emotion. A grandmother’s letter to a grandchild is not an epistolary essay. It’s 
not didactic but informational and sentimental. Although such letters may be 
heartfelt, they don’t attempt to change the reader’s mind. A writer chooses 
the form of an epistolary essay to be both private and public at once—to 
grapple with difficult subjects and teach readers how to think differently on 
those subjects.


Consider, for example, the series of 10 letters that Rainer Maria Rilke wrote 
to Franz Xaver Kappus between 1903 and 1908 in response to Kappus’s 
solicitation for critical commentary on his poems. After Rilke’s death, Kappus 
published these responses as Letters to a Young Poet; the letters constitute a 
series of epistolary essays on such subjects as how to listen more closely to 
one’s own heart and how to be more confident in one’s own artistic abilities. 


In one letter, Rilke attempts to discuss the nature of melancholy and 
how writers might come to understand the workings of such sadness 
and its potential usefulness. Rilke’s interest is philosophic. He’s not talking 
about explicit, time-bound problems in Kappus’s life. Instead, Rilke’s letter 
is thoughtful and probing, attempting to discern a greater reason for why 
humans experience sadness—and to think about the “new experience” 
that melancholy can potentially offer to allow for “important changes” in 
a person’s self-knowledge. 


Although Rilke’s letter is clearly intimate, the use of the second-person 
“you” quickly feels universal rather than directed solely to the young 
Kappus. Part of this universality is a result of Rilke’s lack of specificity 
about Kappus’s own life. Instead of making a list of Kappus’ trials and 
tribulations, Rilke creates a texture of detail through metaphor. This 
strategy of locating details in metaphor and simile enables Rilke’s advice 
to Kappus to become advice for any would-be poet. 


A much more recent epistolary essay, Between the World and Me by Ta-Nehisi 
Coates, is about the impossibility of living in a black body and being treated 

116|Becoming a Great Essayist
with equity in the United States. This short book is presented as an extended 
letter by Coates to his adolescent son. 


Coates employs a rhetorical strategy in which he sometimes speaks to 
all Americans and sometimes speaks only to white Americans. When 
Coates contends that “race is the child of racism, not the father,” his 
metaphor is universal; thus, what Coates is trying to teach here is meant 
for everyone. Yet when he qualifies his phrase “America’s progress” with 
“or rather the progress of those Americans who believe that they are 
white,” Coates is talking to those very same people: people who claim 
whiteness as their race. 


As Coates’s epistolary essay evolves, this shift between speaking directly 
to his son and speaking to a multitude of citizens becomes ever more 
strategic and pointed. Sometimes, Coates creates moments when his 
readers are excluded from the intense privacy of his parental relationship 
with his child, while at other times, he creates moments in which some 
or all of his audience is invited in. 


Thus, Coates’s choice to write an epistolary essay actually links form to 
function in a powerful way. In his intent to reveal the intrinsic racism 
embedded in American history and culture, he makes white readers 
aware of their race as he either includes or excludes them from the 
content of his letter. 
Assignment, Part II: Writing an Epistolary Essay


To write your own epistolary essay, you need to choose both a recipient 
and a topic. The topic should be neither purely informative nor frivolous. Your 
subject matter should be a philosophic, political, or personal issue that matters 
to people beyond just you and your addressee.


The first assignment in this lecture was to write about a life-changing event 
in a letter to a trusted recipient; for this exercise, you could start with that 
experience. But your piece could also be about a personal struggle or issue 
that you’ve been working through, such as how to communicate better 
with your teenage daughter. Or you could write about a topic with national 
significance: immigration policies, the current state of the economy, and so on. 

Lecture 16—The Epistolary Essay: Letters to the World|117


Whatever you choose to write about, your aim should be twofold: to define 
and develop your topic and to teach the recipient of your letter—both the 
specific recipient and anyone else who will read it—something vital and true 
about your subject. Your ethos should be purposefully didactic. 


Finally, you should try using the second-person pronoun “you” instead of 
repeating your recipient’s name. Although you’ll be counting on the intimacy 
that’s created by addressing your epistolary essay to a single individual, by 
referring to your reader as “you,” you’ll also get that double audience that all 
epistolary essayists seek. In other words, you’ll simultaneously address both 
the family member or friend you hope to convince and any other reader who 
might be searching for the honest connections that letters imply.

Lecture 17
Portrait Essays: People in Words
 A 
portrait is a distinctive kind of visual biography. Whether a painting, 
a drawing, or a photograph, a portrait reveals more than just what 
someone looks like. It also conveys something of the essence of a 
person’s character. Clothing, body language, and backdrop all become their 
own language—idioms that speak to the viewer about people’s interests, 
talents, and class, as well as their obsessions and longings. It’s also true 
that the portrait maker’s view is a powerful one in shaping how a viewer 
will interpret the person being portrayed. In writing a portrait essay, a 
writer must understand that any depiction of another person—whether a 
celebrity or a family member—is also a reflection of the writer.
Enlightenment Portraits


Enlightenment portraits were pictures of men (and, occasionally, women) 
who epitomized 18th-century ideals about humans as creatures of reason 
and sensibility. Such portraits tried to display people’s capacities for reason 
and empathy by including symbols of education, the arts, and the sciences. 
The subjects wore clothes or appeared amid scenes that demonstrated 
their civility and good taste. One example is the famous painting of Benjamin 
Franklin by Charles Willson Peale, completed in 1789, the year before Franklin 
died. 


Another Enlightenment portrait is the frontispiece of the autobiography 
of Olaudah Equiano. This was a slave narrative that eventually gained an 
international audience. Perhaps the most revolutionary feature of this 
portrait is the fact that Equiano stares directly out at the viewer. This breaks 
conventions of 18th-century portraiture that insisted that women, children, 

Lecture 17—Portrait Essays: People in Words|119
Just as the sitter tries to choose 
clothing and an expression that will 
capture the core of who he or she 
is, the artist’s gaze is also at work in 
the making of the image.

120|Becoming a Great Essayist
slaves, and servants be passive instead of active in their facial expressions. 
Equiano’s gaze is steady and confident. This man isn’t just a survivor of 
slavery; he has used the horrific experience of being enslaved as the basis for 
mounting an abolitionist argument. 


The takeaway for writers from this discussion of the Franklin and Equiano 
portraits is threefold: 


First, any writer who hopes to create a likeness in words rather than 
paint or pixels should be aware that there must be a strong visual 
element to any portrait essay. The subject’s looks and actions should be 
re-created through precise imagery in the mind of the reader. 


Second, whether a likeness is offered through an image or in language, 
there are conventions of portraiture that writers should adopt, but these 
may also sometimes be broken, depending on the writer’s needs or 
intentions. 


Third, there is an intriguing power dynamic among the person being 
portrayed, the writer who is attempting to portray him or her, and the 
reader who is potentially privy to the foibles and desires of both. 
Portraits and Observations by Truman Capote


Truman Capote was a notorious novelist, screenwriter, and literary journalist 
who wrote Breakfast at Tiffany’s and In Cold Blood and who offered up 
written portraits of many famous people. Some of these portrait essays were 
collected and published after his death in the book Portraits and Observations. 


In a portrait of the film actress Elizabeth Taylor, Capote first discusses her 
looks—an expected element of the portrait genre and one that’s even more 
important when discussing a famed beauty. But rather than simply extol 
her beauty, Capote notes that Taylor is a “runt” with legs “too short for the 
torso” and a “head too bulky for the figure” but with a face that constitutes a 
“prisoner’s dream, a secretary’s self-fantasy.” 


Capote’s aim here is to affirm and complicate Taylor’s fabled loveliness. 


Capote affirms her beauty in describing her eyes as “lilacs” and her face 
as one that prisoners dream of and secretaries fantasize about having. 

Lecture 17—Portrait Essays: People in Words|121
But he also challenges this beauty by calling Taylor a “runt” with a big 
head. Further, he tells us that her beauty doesn’t give Taylor confidence. 
Instead, she comes across to him as “shy” and “vulnerable,” as well as 
suspicious of those around her. 
Truman Capote created written 
portraits of many famous people, 
including Coco Chanel, Willa Cather, 
Pablo Picasso, and Richard Avedon.

122|Becoming a Great Essayist


Thus, Capote casts Taylor in a new light, one that people wouldn’t 
necessarily see through her movies or in the newspapers. This kind of 
complication of one’s subject is exactly what any portrait essayist should 
seek: to make the subject as fully human as possible, revealing both 
strengths and weaknesses. 


Capote then develops and extends Taylor’s image by moving beyond her 
appearance. He claims: 
It was not until I encountered her that Elizabeth Taylor made an 
impression on me, at least as a person … [I was surprised by] how 
well-read Taylor seemed to be—not that she made anything of it, 
or posed as an intellectual, but clearly she cared about books and, 
in haphazard style, had absorbed a large number of them. And 
she discussed them with considerable understanding of the literary 
process; all in all, it made one wonder about the men in her life. … 
[W]hat on earth did this very alert and swift-minded young woman 
find to talk to them about? 


This passage is where Capote’s own obsessions, prejudices, and vanities 
are in greatest evidence. What convinces him that Taylor is an actual 
person—not just a dressed-up doll—is that she’s a reader who knows 
something of writing. 


His tone here reveals his sense of superiority to Taylor and her entourage 
of adoring, dumb males. Thus, we clearly see a portrait of Capote 
alongside his representation of Taylor.
“Under the Influence” by Scott Russell Sanders


Often, portrait essays about personal friends or family members are 
meditations on the difficulties of the relationship between the author and the 
subject. Writing about those difficulties brings into sharp relief the limitations 
that both parties have in bridging the gaps of their differences. One such piece 
is “Under the Influence” by Scott Russell Sanders. 

Lecture 17—Portrait Essays: People in Words|123


In this essay, Sanders represents and responds to his father’s alcoholism. His 
opening sentence is “My father drank”—simple and stark. The details Sanders 
offers for how his father’s alcoholism affected his family are equally direct and 
harsh. 


Sanders provides a series of brief, hard examples of what his drunk father 
couldn’t do—“fix a bicycle tire, balance a grocery sack, or walk across a 
room”—as well as what his dad did do, which was lie and bully his children. 
These details are all the more poignant because Sanders knew quite well 
what his father could achieve as an athlete or a businessman from the few 
years that his dad stayed sober. 


This portrait breaks the convention of most portraiture that shows a sitter 
in an idealized light. Saunders’s father dies, never admitting or confronting his 
illness. Sanders says, “[My father] would not speak about his feelings, would 
not or could not give a name to the beast that was devouring him.” 


Sanders’s essay also implicates himself as the portrait’s artist. Although he 
vows “never to put in my mouth or veins any chemical that would banish 
my everyday self,” he nevertheless admits, “Work has become an addiction 
for me, as drink was an addiction for my father.” The self-implication here is 
obvious. Sanders claims that he wrote this essay to spare his children from 
feeling responsible for their own father’s mania—in this case, the mania of a 
workaholic. Sanders takes his essay to a conclusion, although it’s not a place 
of resolution. 


There’s a crude honesty to this essay that makes it hard to look at the father 
or at Sanders too closely or carefully because the portraits of both are as 
gritty and sharp as photographs of a murder victim. This double portrait of a 
helpless father and his equally helpless son brings to the fore the readers’ own 
helplessness over whatever they may feel compelled to drink, eat, take, or do. 


The portrait demands a combination of precise visual descriptions of a 
subject’s body, expressions, and actions with an interpretation of these visual 
elements that reveals the writer’s own motivations in turning to this particular 
person for this particular portrait.

124|Becoming a Great Essayist
Assignment: Writing a Portrait Essay


For this assignment, draft a short piece about a specific person, someone 
you’d like to capture in a portrait essay. The essay should be no more than 
750 words. Make sure you describe what the person looks like and sounds 
like, as well as how he or she talks, gestures, and moves. Also consider 
why you’re drawn to this individual and what it is about this person that is 
distinctive.


Next, take on the identity of the person you’re writing about. Revise the essay 
so that it’s in the first person, as if you’re actually Whoopi Goldberg, William 
Shakespeare, or your Aunt Mildred. Relate a story about something that’s 
happened to this person and what that experience means to him or her now. 
Given how brief this essay is, it’s probably best to focus on a single moment 
or aspect of your subject’s life. Choose a moment that shows the complicated 
nature of your subject.


Then, translate your written essay into a series of hand-drawn pictures. 
(Stick figures work well.) Put each picture you draw onto a sticky note 
without any words. In this step, you are picturing your essay—turning words 
into images.


Once you’re done drawing your frames, you have an easy way to consider 
how sequencing changes meaning. Start moving the frames around to find 
new arrangements. You might try putting the sticky notes in a circle rather 
than a line. You might have your last sticky note become the first one. The 
point here is to experiment with sequencing until you find a progression that 
you feel best tells a story from your chosen person’s life.


Finally, add the words back in. Sketch in dialogue and thought bubbles. Write 
captions. Label objects or actions within each frame. Does the portrait of this 
person become clearer? What’s still missing? What might you add or subtract? 
Would readers feel that they understand the essence of your subject’s 
personality?


If you wish, at this point, you may abandon the graphic format and rewrite 
your portrait essay in the third person, keeping in mind, however, that part 

Lecture 17—Portrait Essays: People in Words|125
of the punch of a portrait essay is how vividly you re-create the image 
of the person you’re writing about. As you step back from your subject, 
start to ask yourself what it is about this individual that moves or angers or 
compels you. Remember that you’re writing about your own thorny and 
intriguing feelings about people as much as you’re attempting to portray 
them for who they are. In turn, those thorny, intriguing feelings will open up 
the reader’s feelings, as well.

Lecture 18
The Essayist as Public Intellectual
 P 
ublic intellectual essays about current political topics are among 
the most difficult kinds of writing. Unlike creative nonfiction essays, 
public intellectual essays must speak to a wide audience and grapple 
with controversial topics. Those who write such essays participate in the 
larger conversations of society by thinking about, responding to, and often 
upending assumptions about social issues and ills. As a result, the style of 
such essays must be clear, simple, and direct, and the ethos adopted must 
be opinionated but not polarizing. That’s a narrow rhetorical line to walk.
Defining an Intellectual


The idea of the intellectual came into being in Europe and North America 
during the 18th century with the Enlightenment and a new appreciation for 
the power of the mental and emotional faculties of human beings. Intellectuals 
were men (and sometimes women) of letters—the clergy, academics, and 
gentlemen scholars. Their job was to stand outside the workings of the 
government and the greed of industrialists to comment on and potentially 
overturn social practices that debased or oppressed the masses.


Today, a public intellectual is a generalist, not a specialist. A Renaissance 
man or woman, the public intellectual is able to draw on knowledge from 
multiple disciplines and, increasingly, from the discourses of popular culture. 
Intellectuals’ interests are eclectic, and their impulse is to synthesize, not to 
separate. They seek to discern hidden social patterns and work to upend 
traditional assumptions. 

Lecture 18—The Essayist as Public Intellectual|127


In the words of cultural critic Edward Said, “This role has an edge to it, and 
cannot be played without a sense of being someone whose place it is publicly 
to raise embarrassing questions, to confront orthodoxy and dogma … to be 
someone who cannot easily be co-opted by government or corporations, 
and whose raison d’être is to represent all those people and issues that are 
routinely forgotten or swept under the rug.”


By necessity, then, public intellectuals are readers, thinkers, and experimenters. 
They are shameless in their belief that education matters—meaning the kind 
of education that’s found in books, laboratories, classrooms, and art galleries 
more than any “instruction” that may come from websites or TV shows. 
Although public intellectuals may draw from mass media to make claims 
about the social, the political, or the spiritual, they also understand that the 
intention behind those who produce popular culture is—in the words of 
media theorist Neil Postman—to amuse their audience to death. 


For public intellectuals, comedy and entertainment are not and cannot be the 
epitome of human experience. Instead, public intellectuals must see through 
the scrim of mass amusement to get at what our society sells, buys, silences, or 
erases altogether. In this way, the intellectual is a bit like a cultural sleuth, trying 
to expose the workings of ideology by asking those embarrassing questions 
and giving a voice to the voiceless.


There is clearly an activist element in writing a public intellectual essay. This 
form doesn’t lend itself to meanderings of the mind, as a lyric essay does, or 
to the intimate revelations found in memoir. Intellectuals are not supposed to 
confuse their private interests with public ones, even though they themselves 
are members of the public. 


This insistence on using one’s mind for the common good is directly related 
to the history of intellectualism, which comes out of the Enlightenment belief 
that the application of human reason is the key for transforming a repressive 
or apathetic society. Thus, early public intellectuals were those who launched 
revolutionary arguments about how to make human beings the best they 
could be in relation to the broken world around them; they included such 
progressive thinkers as John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Thomas Jefferson, 
and Mary Wollstonecraft.

128|Becoming a Great Essayist
Ralph Waldo Emerson


Although intellectualism grew out of the Enlightenment, it was actually a 19th-
century writer and lecturer, Ralph Waldo Emerson, who pioneered the form 
of the public intellectual essay in the United States. In fact, it’s fair to say that 
Emerson was America’s first public intellectual. 


As most know, Emerson was a philosopher who broke with traditional 
religious beliefs to formulate a theory of universal interconnectedness 
between an individual’s soul and the surrounding unity of the world, or 
“common heart.” 


Emerson also championed self-reliance and educational freedom. These 
ideas about what he once called “the infinitude of the private man” were 
eventually housed under the umbrella philosophy of “transcendentalism,” 
which became an intellectual movement.


Over the course of his career, Emerson primarily wrote and gave lectures 
that he then turned into essays, which perhaps explains why his writings have 
such a strong public ethos. In the early 1840s, these lectures-turned-essays, 
including such well-known ones as “Nature,” “The Over-Soul,” “Experience,” 
and “Self-Reliance,” were gathered together and published in two series. 
These two essay collections launched Emerson’s national reputation as a great 
American philosopher.


Perhaps Emerson’s most celebrated essay is his address to the entering first-
year class of the Phi Beta Kappa society at Harvard University on August 31, 
1837—a talk that he entitled “The American Scholar.” 


This lecture represents a formative example of the public intellectual 
essay in the United States. It’s a piece with a civic purpose. Emerson 
meant to shake up people’s ideas about the best forms of education and 
to persuade people that our nation was on the wrong cultural track. 


In addition, “The American Scholar” is a piece in which Emerson’s form 
fits his function. Just as he is writing and delivering a public intellectual 
essay, Emerson is also talking about the importance of intellectuals to the 
development of American thought and to the nation’s future. 


To try to achieve a new nation of men and women—of people who will no 
longer mimic the “courtly muses of Europe” but who will, instead, forge their 

Lecture 18—The Essayist as Public Intellectual|129
own ideas and produce their own literature and art—Emerson calls on the 
young Harvard men to become a figure he names “Man Thinking.” By this 
term, Emerson means a kind of scholarly collective consciousness of the best 
and the brightest, using their shared brain power to lead the country out from 
under the cultural thumb of Europe.


Emerson believed that the masses were in desperate need of such intellectual 
leadership. In 1837, he viewed the citizens of our relatively new nation as a 
people in need of direction—a people who had given up on their combined 
creativity in favor of individual success and monetary gain. He saw selfishness 
at work in America, greed for things and status over a desire to work together 
and to help one another. To make his concern clear, Emerson draws on an old 
fable for inspiration.


For Emerson, this old fable or common cultural story is the idea that there 
was once a mythic figure, or “One Man,” who represented the whole of a 
community. As Emerson says, this One Man “is not a farmer, a professor, or an 
engineer, but he is all. [The One] Man is priest, and scholar, and statesman, and 
producer, and soldier”—a “fountain of power.” In Emerson’s time, however, 
he argues that this original ideal of a cooperative man “has been so minutely 
subdivided and peddled out, that it is spilled into drops, and cannot be 
gathered” back together. 


To reclaim this mythic communal idea, Emerson believed that young scholars 
must reclaim their role as Man Thinking for the whole of the American nation. 
Emerson insists that an American scholar cannot be a “mere thinker” or, 
worse, “the parrot of other men’s thinking.” Instead, the fabled Man Thinking 
must be “free and brave” in his intellect and in his actions. To transform oneself 
into this figure, Emerson outlines three crucial influences and activities that 
every intellectual should engage.


According to Emerson, the most important influence on the scholar is the 
natural world. His key point here is that public intellectuals, if they are to speak 
on behalf of their nation, must appreciate the miracle of human empathy. They 
must understand that they are bound to everything else in the universe and 
recognize themselves in nature. An individual is never just an individual. He 

130|Becoming a Great Essayist
or she is connected to everyone and everything else and must write as if 
thinking and speaking for all of humanity.


Beyond gaining inspiration and a sense of humility from the natural world, 
Emerson also insists that the American scholar must honor the collective 
According to Emerson, an 
intellectual’s mission must be 
to advance human knowledge, 
even if that means exposing 
other people’s hypocrisy, greed, 
blindness, or abuses of power.

Lecture 18—The Essayist as Public Intellectual|131
“mind of the Past” through books, while also realizing that books themselves 
are a limited resource. 


Emerson cautions against regurgitating the ideas of others. Instead, he 
wants each generation of scholars to write their own books, for their 
own moments, to know the history of ideas that come from their own 
civilization, but then to let that history remain in the past, where it belongs. 


According to Emerson, only then can a public intellectual potentially stand 
outside society and its institutions and comment on its workings. In this 
way, Emerson reveals the inherent politics in any public intellectual essay. 


Emerson’s third and final piece of training for the American scholar is action. 
He says that public intellectuals must absorb the world around them—must 
do as well as think. In a sense, he is making a claim for what we now call 
“applied” or “experiential learning.” Emerson believes that scholars who pay 
attention only to the shadows of the world they find in writing can only be 
partial scholars. They must put down their books and get out in the streets 
to talk and work with real people. Otherwise, their ideas remain nothing but 
ideas and can easily become solipsistic. In essence, then, Emerson calls on 
public intellectuals to be activists.


There’s a reason that “The American Scholar” has been called our nation’s 
“intellectual Declaration of Independence.” Emerson is talking of nothing less 
than the freedom of the human mind—meaning a freedom from the tyranny 
of consumer culture, spoon-fed politics, big-brother surveillance, and cookie-
cutter principles. Emerson’s teachings are radical, like those of the best public 
intellectuals. Public intellectuals must think outside the box, and sometimes, 
they must break down the box altogether.


Emerson’s advice on how to cultivate a worldview based on empathy, 
inclusive research, and activism is advice that you should take yourself as you 
consider what range of issues you might address when crafting your own 
public intellectual essays.

Lecture 19
Polemical Essays: One-Sided Arguments
 A 
polemical essay is an argumentative essay, but it’s a one-sided 
argument. It’s similar to the persuasive essay that most of us were 
taught to write in school—the kind that carefully lays out two 
sides of a debate and attempts to give equal weight to both before landing 
on one side or the other. However, a polemicist supports a single position 
and doesn’t entertain anyone who holds a contrary opinion. Among many 
literary scholars and writers of all stripes, polemics are seen as simplistic, 
dogmatic, histrionic, and partisan. But in this lecture, we’ll see that polemics 
have their place as a vital part of smart social discourse.
The Value of Polemics 


Being opinionated when taking on certain social issues can actually be a 
clever rhetorical strategy, especially when the issue you’re discussing is a highly 
politicized or polarizing one, such as abortion, pornography, or the death 
penalty. A smart polemicist doesn’t shy away from writing about volatile social 
topics, but at the same time, the smart polemicist also knows that there’s a 
significant difference between ranting on these topics and making persuasive 
arguments about them.


Consider the intelligent polemicists from the past who have changed people’s 
minds and hearts through their passionate entreaties. Thomas Paine’s Rights 
of Man convincingly argued that people should throw off the yoke of 
tyranny if a government doesn’t protect the rights of its citizens, and Mary 
Wollstonecraft’s Vindication of the Rights of Woman was pivotal in convincing 
people that women should have access to formal education. If you can be 
reasonable as well as impassioned, and if your aim is to make a case for an 

134|Becoming a Great Essayist
unpopular stance that could potentially benefit others, then the polemical 
essay may be the best form.


Even some literary historians have started to come around to the polemic as 
a valuable essay form. In his book Inventing Polemic, scholar Jesse Lander makes 
a compelling case for seeing the polemic as a foundational genre in creating 
modern civilization. Lander points out that writers during the Renaissance, the 
18th century, the Romantic and Victorian ages, and the modern period helped 
to reform all aspects of society. 


Lander also notes that because polemical essayists incited a cultural backlash 
against their diatribes, they cleared the way for a rise in “polite learning” and 
writing, meaning the poetry and prose that we now think of as literary. In 
other words, people became more interested in the kinds of writing that tried 
to elevate readers through exciting their empathy rather than hitting readers 
over the head with vitriolic arguments. 
“Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God” by Jonathan Edwards


In thinking about writing your own polemical essays, the key to convincing 
your audience is to truly believe that you are right but also to refrain from 
berating readers. An early American polemicist who was at first quite 
successful but ultimately failed when he became too strident was Jonathan 
Edwards, a Congregationalist minister and theologian. 


The sermon for which Edwards is best known is the 1741 “Sinners in 
the Hands of an Angry God,” which was later published as a pamphlet. 
Undoubtedly, what Edwards has to say in this sermon about sinners and 
salvation is combative and inflammatory; it’s polemical in every way. Edwards 
takes it upon himself to be God’s mediator and contends that there is only 
one true path to salvation.


As a Calvinist, Edwards believed in predestination; only the elect, or those 
whom God had already chosen, would go to heaven. Edwards further believed 
that the only way to prove one’s election was to take a test of faith and 
become a full member of the church. Unlike other Protestant ministers of the 

Lecture 19—Polemical Essays: One-Sided Arguments|135
time, Edwards insisted that only those church members who had undergone 
this test should be allowed to participate in communion.


“Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God” is Edwards’s attempt to speak to 
those members of his congregation who hadn’t yet taken this test of faith, as 
well as those who were complacent in their faith. In this way, Edwards was 
able to cast all of his audience—church members and nonmembers alike—as 
sinners and claim that each of them was in danger of being cast into hell by an 
unforgiving, wrathful God.


Edwards’s view of hell is one that even a nonbeliever would want to avoid; he 
calls it a place where the eternal “Flames do now rage and glow” and where 
“The Devil stands ready to fall upon [sinners] and seize them as his own.” 
Edwards’s view is that God, too, is eager to cast souls into the fiery furnace. 
God thinks of the members of Edwards’s congregation as nothing more than 
spiders that he is dangling over a hot flame. 
Many sermons are polemical 
essays because the form tends 
to attract those who want to 
make moral arguments.

136|Becoming a Great Essayist


Edwards goes on to say that the only thing keeping his listeners from tumbling 
into hell is God’s whim and that—sooner or later—God will let them fall 
into that flaming pit just as a rock tears through a spider’s web. The “God that 
holds you over the Pit of Hell,” claims Edwards, is the same one who “abhors 
you, and is dreadfully provoked; … you are ten thousand Times so abominable 
in his Eyes as the most hate-ful venomous Serpent is in ours.”


On the one hand, it’s easy to understand why those who attended this 
sermon were, according to witnesses, “deeply impressed.” Even though he 
never shouted when giving his sermon, Edwards’s message was persuasive 
because he personalized his argument. He made the threat of hell intimate 
and close.


Edwards doesn’t talk in sweeping generalizations about God or damnation. 
Instead, he demonstrates God’s rage by providing his listeners with vivid 
and grotesque images of how this God will kill them as he would worms 
or spiders or snakes, splattering his robe with their blood. Such choices are 
deliberate. Edwards didn’t want his congregation just to hear the words “fire” 
or “anger.” He wanted them to be seared by these words. 


Edwards also speaks in the second person, saying that God abhors “you”—
not some vague sinner. In fact, his sermon starts in the third person, with 
Edwards talking about “people,” “Israelites,” “sinners,” and “they.” But as 
he moves into the second half of his polemic, he relentlessly points at his 
listeners and says “you.” This turn to the second person is particularly effective 
as he brings his argument into the current moment. Edwards switches his 
verb tense from past to present, and he repeats the word “now.” He even 
insinuates that someone sitting in the pews at this moment will be in hell by 
tomorrow morning.


It shouldn’t be terribly surprising that eventually, Edwards’s congregation ran 
him out on a rail. His criticisms were just too personal, and his arguments 
must have seemed hypocritical. He himself was clearly on one side, headed 
for heaven, and his congregation was on the other, bound for eternal suffering. 
When he began humiliating local families as “backsliders” and when he 
insisted that only those who had publicly declared themselves saved could 
take communion, Edwards was dismissed from his congregation. 

Lecture 19—Polemical Essays: One-Sided Arguments|137
Laura Kipnis


Laura Kipnis is a professor at Northwestern University who is known for 
taking unpopular stances on contentious social issues and has built her career 
writing polemical essays. The opening of her book Against Love: A Polemic 
notes that the form is ideal for promoting opinions that are universally 
disliked. We might think of the polemicist as a kind of cultural provocateur, 
which means that any polemical essay is inherently political, even if it’s not 
overtly about politics.


Two years before publishing her book, Kipnis wrote a New York Times essay 
called “Love in the 21st Century,” in which she distilled the main ideas of what 
became her longer project. This polemical essay is not about politics if we 
define politics as disagreements between people or parties who hope to gain 
civic power. Yet Kipnis’s claims are definitely political insofar as they grapple with 
a moral standard of public life—namely, how romantic love has become a kind 
of political morality in its socially sanctioned form of monogamous marriage.


Kipnis’s polemic is against marriage as much as it’s against love, and she turns 
to adulterers as the real truth-tellers on the subject of romance. These are the 
people, Kipnis believes, who understand that monogamy is soul-killing—that 
it’s the optimistic fantasy of a populace desperate to find happiness in marital 
relationships. 


In the same article, Kipnis claims, “the expectation that … sexual attraction can 
last a lifetime of coupled togetherness” is a romantic fantasy, particularly given all 
the “hard evidence to the contrary.” Kipnis flat-out disagrees with the pervasive 
belief that long-term relationships sustain long-term sexual desire. Instead, she 
asserts that “the parties involved must ‘work’ at keeping passion alive.”


Obviously, Kipnis wants to provoke her readers, many of whom are married 
or hope to get married. To compare marital sex with endless, mindless 
drudgery—like working an assembly line—is Kipnis’s attempt to get her 
readers to rethink the need to be married. And in championing adulterers 
for acting on their sexual desires, she also tries to get her readers to rethink 
the scandal of adultery as an act of erotic integrity. Kipnis turns the tables on 
marital monogamy and offends many readers in the process.

138|Becoming a Great Essayist
The Polemical Speaker


Although it’s true that we live among the “me” generation of millennials, that 
doesn’t mean that your readers are primarily interested in hearing about 
you or your life. Edwards doesn’t tell his congregation how he came to Jesus. 
Kipnis doesn’t offer up a compendium of the men she’s married or the joyless 
sex she’s endured. Both writers understand that the power of their polemics 
comes from their incisive, surprising, and often combative arguments and 
images, not from a laundry list of their private wounds and complaints. 


If you hope to be persuasive and credible in writing polemical essays, 
understand that your motivations in writing them must be ethical. Your ethos 
will be compromised if all you want to do is take someone down or complain 
without caring whether anyone hears your complaints. Although Edwards’s 
sermon was all fire and brimstone, his motivation remained ethical: He 
genuinely wanted to save souls. And Kipnis wants to save readers from being 
imprisoned in romantic relationships that aren’t actually romantic at all.


There’s no doubt that your opinions should be strong ones—a polemic requires 
that. But your goals in sharing these opinions must come out of a desire to 
connect with other people, to try to persuade them or teach them, even if you 
risk making them angry by telling them what they don’t want to hear.

Lecture 20
Historical Essays: Past as Present
 T 
o develop a writer’s reflections on the past and its meaning for the 
present, a historical essay draws from the work of those who study 
past events and from texts and images that contain facts about the 
events themselves. Yet historical essays also place the writer’s own ideas 
within the moment of their creation, which means that such essays look 
both backward and forward. There’s a double vision here: The people and 
places that are long gone lie cheek-by-jowl against the writer, who is very 
much alive, experiencing, thinking, reflecting, synthesizing. The past is static 
and fixed; the writer is dynamic and liquid. Such double vision turns all 
historical essays into a conversation between the living and the dead.
Personal Objects


A simple but powerful way to start thinking about how to write your own 
historical essays is to initiate a conversation between the living and the dead 
in the context of your own life. One significant source of personal history is 
the objects we live with every day. 


Like history, objects are static and fixed. And your interaction with them is a 
kind of dialogue between yourself in the present and these things that contain 
and express the past. We could further argue that all objects—the antique 
and the new alike—tell stories: the story of how you first came to own them 
and the story of how they were originally made.


In writing a historical essay, you might start by looking through the rooms 
where you live as if they belong to someone else. As you look at your 

140|Becoming a Great Essayist
possessions, ask yourself which objects intrigue you and why. Where did they 
come from? Why do you keep these things? What do they mean to you? 


An object can initiate a historical essay because it has the capacity to bring 
together what it means to you and what it meant to others from the past. 
And the object you choose to study doesn’t have to be an “antique.” It really 
can be anything at all.


How do you select which sources to include in writing about your object? 
Cast your net wide. Read everything you can about your object—from 
historians, advertisers, and average folk who write about these objects in their 
letters, journals, and blog posts. 
“Laundry” by Maureen Stanton


The creative nonfiction writer Maureen Stanton is particularly adept at writing 
historical essays and always brings an eclectic mix of sources into her pieces. 
An antique book or painting 
conjures the past, linking 
those of us who are alive 
to those who are dead and 
who once held, used, and 
owned these same things. 

Lecture 20—Historical Essays: Past as Present|141
One of her essays is called “Laundry,” and it starts with a simple action—a 
human being, usually a woman, washing clothes. 


The essay includes references to numerous objects that people have used to 
do laundry over many centuries. Stanton mentions the ancient Egyptians who 
washed their clothes on rocks, British colonists in Massachusetts who boiled 
water in kettles and used bluing to brighten their garments, and the first 
patented washing machine. She provides details about the first hand-cranked 
clothes dryer and even describes how Roman women first discovered soap 
in 200 A.D. 


In addition to examining the objects associated with washing clothes, 
Stanton also considers the places where women do laundry. She writes 
about how generations of women have used natural water sources, such 
as rivers and ponds, but she also talks about her own grandmother’s tiny 
kitchen, where she put in a “fancy new electric washing machine” after 
Stanton’s grandfather died.


The essay is an excellent example of how Stanton makes the past resonant 
within her own lived experience. The essay isn’t just about the history of doing 
laundry in the Western world. It’s also about a kind of mysticism that’s bound 
up in washing clothes, as well as an act of love, especially when someone does 
laundry for someone else. 


In fact, a significant portion of Stanton’s essay grapples with telling the story 
of her fiancé’s terminal illness by describing what it was like to do his laundry 
while he was dying. 


Stanton and her lover, Steve, were together for only a couple of years 
before he was diagnosed with a virulent cancer that started in his liver 
before spreading along his spinal column. All the domestic chores fell to 
Stanton, including the laundry. 


At first, going to the laundromat was a way for Stanton to take a break 
from watching Steve waste away. But after Steve died and Stanton finally 
mustered the energy to wash clothes again, she came across a pair of 
her fiancé’s boxer shorts in the pile of dirty laundry. These were garish, 
with yellow, red, and blue polka-dots, a “joke gift from Steve’s cousin after 
he’d first entered the hospital.” 

142|Becoming a Great Essayist


Holding them in her hands, the boxer shorts looked tiny—reminding her 
how Steve himself had shrunk down to only 100 pounds, even though 
he was over 6 feet tall. What did Stanton do? “I washed the boxer shorts, 
and a handkerchief,” she says, “the last two pieces of Steve’s laundry, 
which I still have.”


In this way, Stanton’s historical essay is also an elegy to Steve. Stanton’s final 
paragraph drives this idea home: “In the laundromat,” she explains, “as I conduct 
the most ignoble chore, I find myself pondering the cycles of life, the structure 
of time, the nature of humanity: how we all need clean garments, clean sheets 
to sleep on, how we are all alike ultimately, walking around in our clothes, 
covering our bodies with fabric, as if that could protect us from anything.” 


In this synthesis of the world’s laundry—Egyptian to colonial to Stanton’s 
own—we readers learn how personal and intimate objects and actions 
become part and parcel of the whole of human history. In this way, then, 
laundry comes to represent the loss of a loved one, but at the same time, it 
also symbolizes a reclamation of that death.
The Five-Paragraph Format


A key piece of advice in writing a historical essay is not to stuff your piece into 
the standard five-paragraph or five-section format that so many historians 
use. Whether you realize it or not, you’ve been indoctrinated into the five-
paragraph cult and may write one without even trying.


For instance, the Rutgers School of Arts and Sciences website explains that 
the basic elements of any historical essay include “a thesis and evidence, 
divided into three parts: an introduction, the systematic development of an 
argument, and a conclusion.” Those “three parts” are actually five because in 
systematically developing the argument, Rutgers’ recommendation is to touch 
on three main points. 


The five-paragraph format is the one that’s taught relentlessly in high schools 
and colleges as the single container in which you can shove any kind of 
essay, regardless of your subject matter or purpose. The format consists of 

Lecture 20—Historical Essays: Past as Present|143
an attention-grabber and thesis in the first paragraph; extended examples to 
prove the thesis in the second, third, and fourth paragraphs; and a concluding 
paragraph.


The five-paragraph format is easy to remember and is effective in certain 
rhetorical contexts. At the same time, however, it is an assault on the writer’s 
creativity and represents the death of critical thought. 


Those who worship the five-paragraph structure believe that any topic and 
any approach to that topic may be contained within the exact same form, 
which is like using a ketchup bottle for all your condiments. 


The classic rhetorical elements of all historical essays—including persuasion, 
organization, evidence, and the adoption of a captivating and convincing 
style—should not be contained within a five-paragraph format. Instead, form 
should follow function. And the best practitioners of historical essays do just 
that, building one-of-a-kind scaffolds as they write. 


Just because she’s making a historical argument about the nature and 
purpose of laundry connected to her personal experiences, Stanton 
doesn’t go for the default structure. 


Instead, she toggles between sections that offer insights into the diverse 
history of how humans in the Western world have done their laundry 
for more than 36 centuries and other sections that tell laundry’s story 
through her grandmother’s, her mother’s, and her own moments of 
washing various clothes and linens. 
“My Father’s Hats” by Jeffrey Hammond


Another example of how a historical essay can create its own form is “My 
Father’s Hats” by Jeffrey Hammond. In this essay, Hammond gives readers 
a rundown on the history of hats, from Paleolithic caps and Greco-Roman 
helmets to Renaissance crowns, Enlightenment tricornes, Victorian top hats, 
and the more modern fedoras and ball caps. 


Hammond’s point in providing a mini-history lesson on the development of 
the hat is to make clear that these pieces of clothing aren’t arbitrary; they 

144|Becoming a Great Essayist
In his essay “My Father’s 
Hats,” Jeffrey Hammond 
laments that, in our own 
day and age, the hatless man 
is now the norm, unless he 
decides to wear a ball cap 
or an old-timey golfer’s cap. 

Lecture 20—Historical Essays: Past as Present|145
“make the man” by designating his class status, religion, and place of origin. 
“Once a hat becomes personally iconic,” explains Hammond, “it’s yours for 
good.” To offer evidence, Hammond notes historical examples: Napoleon’s 
bicorne, Sherlock Holmes’s deerstalker, and Roy Rogers’s Stetson.


Yet Hammond’s essay isn’t just a list of men’s hats through the ages. It’s 
primarily about his own ideas about what they symbolize, especially when 
he was a child hoping to put on manhood by donning certain kinds of hats 
and now as a grown man in a world that’s mostly hatless. At the moment, in 
middle age, Hammond has acquiesced to the ubiquitous American ball cap, 
but he also knows that, eventually, he will put on the golf cap that he inherited 
when his father died. 


To tell this story about inheritance through a historical essay, Hammond 
crafts a careful structure. He offers personal stories about his father’s and his 
own hats as bookends on either side of the middle of his essay. Both Stanton 
and Hammond fashion forms for their historical essays that fit the sum and 
substance of their thoughts and arguments. 


How can you deprogram yourself from the five-paragraph essay cult?


Return to that object you discovered anew from your own living space, 
read whatever you can about the object, and type up notes on what you 
discover. Also jot down the memories you have connected to this object. 


Once you’ve drafted notes from research and your memories, read 
through all of it at once and think about how these separate writings 
might merge. Perhaps they would be best if they were laid out as a 
linear chronology, as history is traditionally written. Or perhaps it’s best 
to bookend the middle of your essay, making those bookends either the 
places where you develop your outside research or where you tell the 
intimate stories of your own experiences with this object. 


Whatever form your historical essay takes, remember that history is always 
subjective, and the way in which we tell stories from the past influences how 
we come to understand their significance.

Lecture 21
Humor Essays
 C 
omedy is really all about tragedy. Think about it for a moment: 
What do humorists tend to joke about? David Sedaris continually 
writes about his humiliations, such as being forced in elementary 
school to see a speech therapist for his lisp and how his teacher reminded 
the class of it every day. Taken at face value, the subject of grade school 
mortification isn’t all that funny. Why, then, do humorists transform tragedy 
into comedy? Because just as Aristotle claimed that the effects of tragedy 
on a spectator can be purifying emotionally, laughing is also cathartic. 
Laughter is a means of purging one’s fears to find a kind of restoration or 
renewal of emotional equanimity.
Advice for Humor Essayists


Given that comedy is so closely related to tragedy, one valuable piece of 
advice for humor essayists is to make fun of your own suffering—to joke 
about the pains and struggles that come out of your own life. Although you 
might find yourself delving into the shortcomings of others now and then, 
it’s better to be self-deprecating when you can. Otherwise, you might come 
across as patronizing or conceited, which would undermine your chances of 
making people laugh. 


A second piece of advice is to pay close attention to those who are masters 
of the humor essay.


You might start by reading some of the earliest examples of modern 
humor essays, such as the ones written by British satirists Sir Richard 
Steele and Joseph Addison. These two exposed the foibles of their fellow 
Englishmen and women in the pages of The Tatler and The Spectator—

148|Becoming a Great Essayist
Washington Irving displayed

essays in his Sketch-Book,

Lecture 21—Humor Essays|149
two 
periodicals 
that 
they 
founded and edited. 


Of course, there also is 
Mark Twain, who was a 
prolific 
columnist, 
lecturer, 
and travel writer. Particularly 
recommended are his books 
What Is Man? And Other Essays 
and The Innocents Abroad. 


Finally, 
there 
are 
many 
contemporary humor essayists 
worth 
studying, 
including 
David Sedaris, Aasif Mandvi, 
Sarah Vowell, James Thurber, 
Erma Bombeck, Woody Allen, 
Steve Martin, Nora Ephron, 
Anne Lamott, Garrison Keillor, 
and David Rakoff.


Perhaps the best lesson worth learning from reading these comic essayists 
is how and why self-deprecating humor is so vital to their collective ethos. 
Consider Woody Allen, whose films and essays alike are a relentless parade 
of his own neuroses, or Garrison Keillor, who jokes continually about his 
height, his age, his Midwesternness, his lack of technological know-how, and 
his growly singing voice. As such authors find hilarity in their pain and suffering, 
readers wind up recognizing their own flaws, insecurities, and social failings—
and laughing at those, too. 
David Sedaris


By way of example, let’s look more closely at the work of American author 
and radio personality David Sedaris, whose primary genre is the humor 
essay. In fact, he’s published eight collections of such essays, and he won the 
prestigious Thurber Prize for American humor with one of these books, Me 
Talk Pretty One Day, about the months he lived in France with his romantic 
partner, Hugh Hamrick. 
Mark Twain once said that humanity 
“has unquestionably one really effective 
weapon—laughter. … Against the 
assault of laughter nothing can stand.”

150|Becoming a Great Essayist


If you’re not familiar with Sedaris’s writing, then you may not know that he got 
his break in the early 1990s. He was invited to read one of his comic pieces, the 
“SantaLand Diaries,” on National Public Radio. This humor essay is indicative of 
his signature style: one in which Sedaris makes relentless fun of himself.


An excellent example of this style comes from the “SantaLand Diaries,” when 
Sedaris explains:
I am a 33-year-old man applying for a job as an elf. I often see 
people in the streets dressed as objects and handing out leaflets. 
I usually avoid leaflets, but it breaks my heart to see a grown man 
dressed as a taco. So if there is a costume involved, I tend not only 
[to] accept the leaflet, but to accept it graciously, saying, “Thank 
you so much,” and thinking, “You poor son of a bitch.” 


What becomes immediately clear in Sedaris’s humor is that he never condemns 
someone else without also condemning himself. Although the human taco is the 
butt of a joke, the taco-man story actually functions as a way to reveal Sedaris’s 
own prejudices against being an adult and making a living dressed as an object 
or a character. In turn, this confession comes back to bite him when Sedaris 
himself becomes a short-statured 33-year-old man wearing green knickers who 
must prance around a department store as one of Santa’s helpers. 


Now it becomes the reader who thinks, “Your poor son of a bitch,” as Sedaris 
goes on to explain about the silly shoes Macy’s elves must wear; the elf dress 
rehearsal they are required to attend; and the children’s tantrums, vomiting, 
and verbal abuse they must endure. Brilliantly, Sedaris turns the tables so 
that the reader gets to feel relieved about not having to work as an elf or 
a walking taco, while Sedaris himself gets to come off as pitiful. And Sedaris’s 
willingness to make fun of himself gives him a stronger ethos as someone who 
is confident enough and secure enough to admit his weaknesses and silliness.


Yet Sedaris doesn’t just engage in this kind of self-criticism as the basis of 
his wit. He also goes to the next level and engages his readers’ empathy by 
turning the comedic into the cathartic. “Understanding Owls: What Does 
the Gift Say about the Giver?” is an excellent example of how Sedaris’s self-
deprecating humor fosters true empathy in his reader.

Lecture 21—Humor Essays|151


The premise of this piece is simple and familiar. Sedaris wants to find 
the perfect Valentine’s Day gift for his partner, Hugh. But as so often 
happens in long-term relationships, over the years, the gift-giving stakes 
have gotten higher. Where they used to exchange chocolates, now their 
gifts are more idiosyncratic and expensive. “Like everything else,” Sedaris 
explains, “holiday gifts escalate.” 


Sedaris decides to buy Hugh a taxidermied owl. He goes to a London 
taxidermy shop, but what he discovers there is not at all what he expected. 
There are two owls for sale, but what throws Sedaris off track is that 
the taxidermist immediately shows him a series of oddities that would 
be more appropriate for a Ripley’s Believe It or Not museum: a Pygmy 
skeleton, an amputated forearm, and the 400-year-old head of a young girl. 
Sedaris is horrified and fascinated, but he pays for his owl and leaves.


On the subway ride home, holding Hugh’s owl in a cardboard box, 
Sedaris is disturbed. He wonders what was so unnerving about 
meeting the taxidermist—whether it was the stuffed human body parts 
or something else. What he finally comes to is this: that although it’s 
common for people to misunderstand or to misread others around 
them, it’s much less common for them to size another person up 
accurately and immediately. 


Sedaris explains, “The taxidermist knew me for less time than it took to 
wipe my feet on his mat, and, with no effort whatsoever, he looked into 
my soul and recognized me for the person I really am: the type who’d 
actually love a Pygmy [skeleton], and could easily get over the fact that 
[the Pygmy had] been murdered for sport. … Worse still, I would flaunt 
it, hoping … that this would become a part of my identity.” 


If we strip away the humor, this essay contains some truly nasty 
information. Yet because Sedaris couches this entire scene in humor and 
makes sure to question his base desires in front of the reader, we actually 
come to trust him more rather than less as a narrator. His humor makes 
him more credible; it isn’t founded on attacking other people or things, 
which is cheap pathos. Instead, if he attacks anyone, it’s himself. 


Note, too, that Sedaris draws on elements of good essay writing to make his 
humorous scenes both vivid and realistic. His descriptive details are exact, 
and he shapes funny scenes with elaborate settings, characters, and lines of 
dialogue, which make his essays active and distinct.

Assignment: Writing a Humor Essay


Here’s an exercise in writing cathartic rather than cheap humor: First, choose 
something from your life that you’ve experienced that really wasn’t funny at 
all, such as a debilitating illness or a humiliating job. 


Then, write down every excruciating detail you can think of about this very 
unfunny thing. Get down all the disagreeable bits about undergoing dialysis or 
slipping around in the grease at the fast-food job where you made french fries 
for people who were too lazy to even get out of their cars to pick up their food. 


Next, go back and reread the record of your own bile. As you read, think about 
how you are implicated in all this nastiness. If you’ve written about your competitive 
nature with your coworkers, then ask yourself, why are you competitive? Are you 
insecure because you think they’re smarter than you? Are you angry because 
you actually think you’re the smarter one, and they don’t deserve the credit they 
receive? Be willing to admit your own faults and limitations.


Finally, try to write the draft of a humor essay in which you tell your story, but 
as you tell it, make sure to show both sides. Be highly detailed about what you 
didn’t like about this experience or that person, but be just as detailed about 
how this situation reveals your own weaknesses, insecurities, spite, and small-
mindedness. Make fun of yourself at least as much as you make fun of your 
topic—if not more. And remember that, even though you’re joking about 
both your subject and yourself, your goal is to wield humor with a purpose: 
to get your readers to empathize with the absurdities of your plight and, in so 
doing, potentially have the ability to laugh at the tragedies in their own lives.

Lecture 22
Nature Essays
 M 
ary Oliver, one of America’s best-known nature poets, says that 
the natural world is a kind of “warehouse of symbolic imagery” 
for writers. “Poetry is one of the ancient arts,” Oliver explains, 
“and it began, as did all the fine arts, within the original wilderness of the 
earth. Also, it began through the process of seeing, and feeling, and hearing, 
and smelling, and touching, and then remembering—remembering in words—
what these perceptual experiences were like, while trying to describe the 
endless invisible fears and desires of our inner lives.” Embedded in Oliver’s 
explanation for how poetry came into being is a potent writing exercise 
that we will take on in this lecture.
Assignment, Part I: Taking Notes on Nature


If you are interested in tapping into nature’s primeval warehouse of symbolism, 
take a notebook and a pen and go to the nearest field, forest, hill, or shoreline, 
leaving your cell phone, iPod, and tablet behind.


Walk until you find a comfortable spot with no one else around. Lean against 
a tree or on sit a rock and spend at least a full hour, without any distractions, 
taking notes on what you see, feel, hear, smell, touch, and even taste. 


The point of this exercise is to let go of the social world as much as possible. 
Keep in mind that you are out in the wilderness to remember that you’re 
not just in nature, but you are nature. Your very body is made of dirt. Your 
breath is air. 

154|Becoming a Great Essayist


Once you find a secluded and comfortable place, allow yourself to slow 
down. Find stillness as you listen, look, smell, and taste. Feel your body in this 
moment—every hair, every nerve. Then, jot down what your body is telling 
you about this place. If you like, you may try to sketch what you see, but don’t 
take photographs. If you can manage to do this exercise more than once—
maybe two or three times in a week across more than one landscape and in 
more than one kind of weather—your notes will be all the richer as a result.


When you’ve finished gathering your notes and have a chance to return to 
your desk at home, read through everything at once with a critical eye. You’ve 
successfully transformed the experience of your body into language, which is 
the first step. The next task is to draft a nature essay from these notes that 
isn’t overly simplistic or sappy. 
William Wordsworth


We have the celebrated poet William Wordsworth to thank for the idea of 
nature as an eternal source of beauty, inspiration, renewal, and refuge. 


At the turn of the 19th century, Wordsworth and his collaborator, Samuel 
Taylor Coleridge, witnessed the plight of disadvantaged people around 
them and cast about for an alternative social paradigm. They wanted to 
find relief for those living among the cold realities of industrialization and 
the rise of an insatiable consumer culture. 


What Wordsworth and Coleridge settled on was the restorative power 
of the natural world as a kind of salve against the harshness of modernity.


The 1798 publication of Wordsworth and Coleridge’s collaborative book 
of poems, Lyrical Ballads, has been called nothing short of a revolution in 
poetic form, as well as the book that instigated the Romantic era of literature. 
But even though these two writers revolutionized the language, subjects, 
narrators, and forms of poetry, what’s perhaps more interesting is how this 
slim, unassuming volume also revolutionized people’s ideas about the natural 
world. 


Before Lyrical Ballads, much of the writing about the great outdoors 
characterized global landscapes as places to be explored, tamed, or owned. 

Lecture 22—Nature Essays|155
Land was a valuable resource, one that Europeans and North Americans 
sought to seize, map, and control. And while it’s true that there were also 
some pre-Romantic writers who turned to the beauties of the pastoral, it was 
Wordsworth and Coleridge who popularized the ideas that the rural is the 
polar opposite of the urban and that nature offers people solace from the 
corruptions of city life.


In a poem called “Tintern Abbey,” we see Wordsworth’s philosophy on display: 
that humans aren’t separated in any way from nature. The stuff of the human 
is the stuff of the stars. Yet Wordsworth idealizes the natural world to such an 
It’s often difficult to write about 
nature without being sappy 
because we’ve all been taught 
that nature is a source of beauty 
and inspiration, and it has the 
capacity to renew the soul.

156|Becoming a Great Essayist
exaggerated extent that he also winds up making it seem as though human 
beings should do nothing but feel awe and wonder when rambling about in 
nature. For Wordsworth, all ugliness and artificiality are located in cities; all 
beauty and solace are inside his view of nature.


Even though we can give Wordsworth credit for showing us the splendors 
of nature, there’s a problem with making him the primary mentor for nature 
essayists. Modern-day writers who follow in Wordsworth’s footsteps tend 
to produce limited, histrionic, and clichéd pieces. And as they extol nature, 
they actually keep themselves apart from it. Even though Wordsworth 
himself believed that humans are nature and nature is humans, what we’ve 
inherited from him is a kind of schmaltzy writing that sees the outdoors as 
distinct from people—as completely separate from the lives we live in our 
concrete jungle. 
Henry David Thoreau


As you think about writing your 
own nature essays, push beyond 
Wordsworth 
toward 
another 
mentor: Henry David Thoreau. 
Thoreau might be called the first 
environmentalist writer—a nature 
writer who wrestles with people’s 
moral responsibility to protect the 
earth. Thus, Thoreau is influential 
to the work of contemporary 
nature essayists whose writing 
is neither schmaltzy nor clichéd. 
These are the writers who 
tend to be keenly interested in 
maintaining and preserving nature 
as a vanishing resource and who 
understand 
completely 
that 
people’s lives are interdependent 
with the natural world.
In his memoir about the two years he 
spent at Walden, Thoreau wrote, “I went 
to the woods because I wished to live 
deliberately … and see if I could not learn 
what [life] had to teach, and not, when I 
came to die, discover that I had not lived.”

Lecture 22—Nature Essays|157


Thoreau didn’t draw on memories of the natural world, as Wordsworth did, 
to find inner strength to combat the ills of society. Instead, Thoreau separated 
himself from society altogether and went out to live in nature. As everyone 
knows, he built a small cabin next to a place called Walden Pond and lived 
there for two years. 


As an early environmentalist, Thoreau was one of the first Americans to 
speak in favor of keeping parts of our landscape as a national resource and 
for creating protected parks and forests. Thoreau witnessed the beginnings 
of urban sprawl in and around his hometown of Concord, Massachusetts. In 
response, he wrote, “Let us keep the New World new, [and] preserve all the 
advantages of living in the country[!]” 


Thoreau is the primary model for contemporary essayists who write about 
nature, particularly those who hope to help improve the health of the 
planet by taking on issues of pollution, biodiversity, and sustainability. These 
are essayists who adopt an environmentalist perspective and who speak 
to the symbiotic connections between humans and the natural world. This 
self-consciously political approach is more in keeping with the ethos of our 
modern moment than Wordsworth’s spiritual musings or those who focus 
exclusively on the miracle and grandeur of the earth. 
Assignment, Part II: Writing Your Nature Essay


With Thoreau in mind, return to the notes you took while spending quiet time 
outside. You don’t have to write like Thoreau, whose observations were often 
bleak, but you should approach your nature essay by being both evenhanded 
and self-conscious.


To be evenhanded in writing about nature, it’s important not to romanticize 
it but to show that although the natural world can be awe-inspiring and 
gorgeous, it’s also, in the words of Tennyson, “red in tooth and claw”—meaning 
that it’s violent, containing as much death as it does life. 


You shouldn’t shy away from describing the harsher elements of nature. 
Debra Marquart—a successful environmental essayist—has written a good 

158|Becoming a Great Essayist
deal about growing up on a farm in the barrens of rural North Dakota. In a 
piece for Orion Magazine, Marquart writes with honesty of the endless chores 
that must be done on any farm. With regard to manure, for instance, she has 
“sprayed it with a hose, swept it into gutters, scraped it, buried it, burned it, 
and shoveled it.”


In addition to being evenhanded, you must also be self-conscious about the 
fact that there is nothing between you and the universe and that whatever 
other people do to the world around you is something that’s also being done 
to you. In other words, you have to take nature personally. Whether you want 
to write about global climate change or the small dramas of life and death 
played out in your kitchen garden, you need to recognize the fact that all 
these topics are also, inevitably, about you—because you are organic. 


An example of a self-conscious writer is the essayist Michael P. Branch. By 
using humor and irreverence, Branch’s blog, Rants from the Hill, pushes the 
envelope of the traditional nature essay. 


Branch has written about both the sublime and the mundane. His 
monthly rants cover an eclectic range of topics about nature and the 
natural world, such as keeping expensive chickens with beady eyes; 
raising a feral daughter who is equal parts “cute little girl, simian beast, 
and Hollywood stunt double”; hiking with a group of buddies; and more. 


Apart from Branch’s mix of the serious with the silly—all delivered 
through a razor-sharp wit—what makes his essays unique is how self-
conscious they are about his intimate relationship with nature. Branch 
never holds nature at arm’s length, thinking that he’s superior to it or 
separate from it. Instead, he understands completely that every decision 
he makes is one that affects the natural world in some profound way—
and vice versa.


For instance, in a rollicking essay called “Lawn Guilt,” Branch’s self-
consciousness is particularly evident. He offers a bevy of reasons that 
Americans shouldn’t keep lawns, as other nature writers—notably, 
Michael Pollan—have done before him. 


But then, as Branch steps down from his “eco-soapbox,” he offers a 
“surprising confession”: “I have a lawn.” “Of course,” he goes on, “my 
dual status as arid lands environmentalist and lawn-watering dolt has 
provoked in me a serious identity crisis. … Am I proud of my lawn? Hell 

Lecture 22—Nature Essays|159
no! I’m completely ashamed of it.” Branch admits, “I have a terminal case 
of lawn guilt.” 


Here’s the self-consciousness at work. This nature writer isn’t just 
condemning what others do to plants, animals, the oceans, the sky, the 
land, or the planet. Instead, he admits that he himself also does dastardly 
things to the natural world.


It’s this willingness to be self-conscious—to admit one’s own hypocrisies 
and weaknesses—coupled with an evenhandedness about the beauty 
and the horror that is nature that will make all the difference when 
transforming your nature notes into your own environmental essay.

Lecture 23
Food Essays: My Grandmother’s Recipe Box
 A 
s we begin this lecture, write down a recipe you know by heart. 
As we move through the lecture, we’ll see that this recipe tells 
about yourself, your family, and the country and time period in 
which you live. We’ll then think about the story your recipe tells. What 
kind of setting do readers encounter when they cook your dish? Maybe 
your recipe invokes the idea of a traditional Italian meal, or maybe it’s for a 
seasonal dish that brings to mind the chilly landscape of northern California. 
Whatever the setting or situation your recipe calls to mind, there’s sure to 
be a story that’s waiting to be played out the moment a reader starts to 
assemble your dish.
Reading a Recipe


When reading a recipe, it’s best to begin with the title. Consider, for example, 
a recipe for “Date Puffed Rice Balls.” The title of this recipe does more than 
just name the foodstuff. It also says something about this food’s ethnicity, class 
origin, historical period, authorship, and connection to a specific community of 
recipe writers. 


In this case, the recipe is attributed to Florence Anderson, whose name 
alone gives us information about her gender, ethnicity, and locale. With 
the surname Anderson (meaning “son of Andrew”), Florence is almost 
certainly an Anglo-American woman from a family who immigrated 
at some point from England to the United States. She’s also probably 
someone who grew up during a time in which Florence was a relatively 
common female name—which means between about 1880 and 1940. 


Just from the title itself, we also know a few things about this culinary 
community. To make Date Puffed Rice Balls, a cook would have to be a 

Lecture 23—Food Essays: My Grandmother’s Recipe Box|161
middle-class consumer familiar with American convenience foods. This 
same cook would also have to believe that ball-shaped desserts—which 
were fashionable in the 1940s and 1950s—are worth making. 


After we get a title, an author, and sometimes a rating of the recipe, we 
then get a list of ingredients. Such lists actually signal certain things about 
the historical and cultural context of any recipe. For instance, an ingredient 
list might indicate that the recipe uses foods produced by industrialized 
agriculture (such as corn oil), that it’s reliant on consumer culture (if it calls 
for Hershey’s chocolate or Lay’s potato chips), that it comes from a certain 
region (if there’s Andouille sausage or blue crabmeat in the dish), or that it 
participates in the culinary traditions of a certain ethnic group (think here of 
okra or tortillas). 


A list of ingredients also alternates between chef-speak (with such 
words as “soufflé,” “fricassee,” or “reamer”) and cook-speak (such as 
“fry,” “casserole,” and “juice”), which create either a more intellectual 
or a more conversational tone—one that sometimes makes it seem as 
though a recipe is more masculinized or feminized. 


Also, many ingredient lists are rife with sense-based imagery. In a 
recipe for a roasted leg of lamb given by Ellen Meloy at the end of her 
humorous food essay “Eat Your Pets,” she says, “Remove the excess fat 
from a leg of lamb. … Rub the outside of the meat with olive oil, the 
inside with salt and pepper, then stuff it with garlic cloves and a thatch 
of cilantro.” Such phrases as “excess fat from a leg of lamb” and “garlic 
cloves and a thatch of cilantro” are as vivid and sharp as the imagery 
found in a poem.


Finally, an ingredients list provides the necessary amounts a cook needs 
for each item. In the United States, this focus on measurement originally 
came from Fannie Farmer’s 1896 Boston Cooking School Cook Book—
which published standard measurements for the first time. After that, 
measuring spoons and cups became regular kitchen appliances.


The ingredients list from the recipe for Date Puffed Rice Balls also reveals 
the historical period of this piece of writing. It makes consumer-culture 
reference to Rice Krispies, it uses measurement terms, and it includes 
the word “oleo,” an abbreviation of “oleomargarine” that was used as a 
synonym for margarine through about 1949. 

162|Becoming a Great Essayist
Recipes as Stories


It’s important to note that an ingredients list also suggests something more 
than history, gender, culture, or poetry. A recipe is more than just a set of 
instructions; it’s also a story. It sets a scene, forms a plot, arrives at a climax, and 
ends with a denouement. Readers themselves become the main characters 
in these stories, because they’re the ones who have to perform the actions 
of the recipe. Recipes, then, are both collaborative and embodied—a unique 
form of writing.


It may be a bit odd to think of recipes as stories. If there’s any “story” in a 
recipe, surely it’s nothing more than a how-to. Yet once you think about how 
an ingredients list imagines a setting; how the instructions form a narrative 
arc; how the finished product might be seen as a happy, tragic, or at least, an 
adequate ending; and finally, how the plating, the serving suggestions, or even 
the calorie count becomes a finale to the whole—all of a sudden, a recipe 
becomes something more than the sum of its parts.


To enter the story of Date Puffed Rice Balls, a reader-cook will need, first, to 
set out 1 stick of oleo, a 1/2 cup of sugar, and 1 cup of finely chopped dates 
on the kitchen counter. In a way, this list is a bit like “once upon a time,” but 
instead of introducing a cottage in the woods or a castle on a hill, we’re asked 
to recall a 1950s American kitchen. 


Then, of course, the recipe becomes a set of directions. As with all recipes, 
the directions are given through a series of imperative phrases that begin with 
verbs in the present tense: heat, add, mix, roll. All recipes sound a bit bossy, yet 
recipes aren’t just domineering. 


They also invite readers to co-create meaning by participating directly 
in the unfolding of this story through these precise verbs. If these Date 
Puffed Rice Balls are not just read about but actually made, then the 
world beyond the writing is transformed. 


It’s this three-dimensional reading experience that makes recipes so 
fascinating, particularly as the foundation of food essays. Reading recipes 
is both a literal and a figurative act. To “consume” a recipe is to eat it 
with your eyes, your mouth, and your mind all at once.

Lecture 23—Food Essays: My Grandmother’s Recipe Box|163
You can learn a great deal about 
yourself and your cooking community 
in the recipes you make repeatedly; 
read such recipes for their gastronomic 
language, culinary imagery, and 
connections to your culture.

164|Becoming a Great Essayist
Assignment: Recipe Recollection


For this exercise, begin by choosing a family recipe, ideally one that connects 
you to your past. It doesn’t have to be a cherished recipe; it can be one 
for watery, tasteless soup that you were compelled to eat as a child. The 
important thing is this: The food should evoke your childhood or teenage 
years. It should help you recollect your family, friends, and acquaintances. And 
the recipe should be linked to a specific geography. Think of this recipe as the 
basis of what James Beard calls a “taste memory”: “the ability to recall a taste 
sensation” through re-imagining a food from the past.


Now, get your hands on the main ingredient of your recipe and engage all 
your senses in examining it. Draw it, smell it, hold it in your hands. Then, build 
on what you’re experiencing to re-create your own recollections connected 
to this food and this recipe. 


If you have the time and inclination, cook the dish. When it’s made, once again, 
study it closely. Peer at it, smell it, and touch it before you put a bite in your 
mouth. Consider what other flavors come to mind, linked to this dish. Recall 
the food in both good and bad ways. When was it best? When was it worst? Is 
this dish an early love or an early hate?
Recipe stories are carried into 
the very bodies of the readers 
who cook them, eat them, and 
take those words with them 
into the future; the words are 
literally made flesh.

Lecture 23—Food Essays: My Grandmother’s Recipe Box|165


Next, make wider associations with your food—metaphoric, symbolic, or 
connected to literary allusions or common sayings. For instance, if your main 
ingredient is an apple and your recipe is for apple pie, what does your dish 
mean in terms of literature or religion? The Bible suggests that an apple 
represents both knowledge and evil; Greek mythology gives us the Apple of 
Discord, as well as the Golden Apple; and writers from Shakespeare to Thoreau 
to Bradbury have written essays, stories, and poems about apples and apple pie. 


Think, too, about what your food means in terms of popular culture. What 
are some familiar sayings that people have about this food? We all know 
the maxim “An apple a day keeps the doctor away” or the phrase that a 
beloved is the “apple of one’s eye.” What is your food a symbol of? Does your 
dish represent a certain group or nation? Apples, of course, are symbols of 
education, but they’re also symbols of America itself. Finally, does your food 
sell anything? Is it a commercial of itself? 


Then, go back to the recipe. It should be incorporated directly into your edible 
essay, but how you incorporate it should be something you think about carefully. 
You don’t have to list title, ingredients, and instructions all in a row. In “H Is for 
Happy,” M. F. K. Fisher gives her reader two ingredient lists—one physical and 
one spiritual. The spiritual are “equal parts of hunger and happiness.” 
Below is a list of recommended food essays from Books That Cook: Teaching Food 
and Food Literature in the English Classroom (Jennifer Cognard-Black and Melissa 
Goldthwaite, eds.) and We Are What We Ate (Mark Winegardner, ed.).

•	 “The Assurance of Caramel Cake,” Maya Angelou

166|Becoming a Great Essayist


Now that you have set out on your desk the ingredients for an edible essay, 
it’s time to assemble it. You might ask yourself such questions as: What did this 
dish mean to me in the past, and why? Has that meaning changed, and why? 
What does it mean to family members, friends, enemies, neighbors, fellow 
citizens of my country, or citizens of another country? Where does the dish 
come from originally? Do others believe that this dish is inedible? Is this food 
“girly” or “manly”; is it for “old-timers” or “youngins”; or is it for a specific 
ethnic or cultural group? Is this food sexy, or is it a turnoff, and why? 


Ultimately, your task is to take these ingredients and “cook” them in such 
a way that you tell a story that remembers this food from your past at 
the same time that you reflect on it, considering its larger meaning. That 
“meaning” might be thematic, symbolic, or cultural. The most important 
thing is this: Your edible essay must have three layers. It needs to re-create 
the recipe itself in sensual, descriptive detail. It needs to represent the past 
through recollection. And it needs to look backward, reflecting from the 
perspective of the present moment on what this taste memory means to 
you now and to your readers.

Lecture 24
Sharing Your Essays: From Blog to Book
 I 
n an era of online blogs based on writers’ individual thoughts and 
opinions, it’s not a stretch to say that millions of people think of 
themselves as essayists. And for the essayist who hopes to send his 
or her work out into the world, it’s true that blogs are the new frontier. 
Without having to find an agent or get a degree in creative writing, the 
blogger can cultivate an audience of like-minded readers. Some bloggers 
reach a wide audience, but many do not, and many posts are not true essays. 
In this lecture, we’ll distinguish between posts and fully formed blog essays.
Posts versus Essays


Andrew McDowell is a librarian and an “aspiring author of Young Adult 
Fiction.” Recently, McDowell started a blog in the hopes of connecting with 
other young adult writers and spurring his own creativity. At the moment, he 
has only one entry, a piece called “Why Do I Write?” 


In this post, McDowell considers the question of whether he’s chosen to 
write the best genre; he dives into his childhood and adolescent writings; and 
gives credit to his parents, friends, and fellow young adult enthusiasts. Despite 
all this, the piece doesn’t yet rise to the level of the literary because it’s a blog 
post, not a blog essay. 


McDowell’s desire to become a good writer is both real and heartfelt. He’s 
reaching for something beyond the quiet life of tedium that can arise from 
schoolwork or a job, and he understands that to become a true artist, 
you can’t hope to make a bunch of money and get famous. Perhaps most 
important, McDowell is willing to practice. He’s been writing since he was

a boy; he took creative writing workshops in college; and now he’s seeking 
support and feedback on his work, in part by starting a blog about his writing.

However, McDowell’s piece is like a cross between an author bio and a journal 
entry. He is not yet writing about anyone other than himself or anything other 
than his own struggles, and his purpose isn’t to reflect on the bigger picture of 
what art and artistry might mean to his readers or to his culture. 


In contrast, in her book Bird by Bird: Some Instructions on Writing and Life, Anne 
Lamott explains why writing matters. Specifically, she claims:
Because … books are as important as almost anything else on earth. 
What a miracle it is that out of these small, flat, rigid squares of paper 
unfolds world after world after world, worlds that sing to you, comfort 
and quiet [you] or excite you. Books help us to understand who we 
are and how we are to behave. They show us what community and 
friendship mean; they show us how to live and die. They are full of all 
the things that you don’t get in real life—wonderful, lyrical language, 
for instance, right off the bat. And quality of attention: we may notice 
amazing details during the course of a day[,] but we rarely let 
ourselves stop and really pay attention. An author makes you notice, 
makes you pay attention, and this is a great gift.


This paragraph comes from a chapter in Bird by Bird that’s about how to get 
started as a writer, and the reason it rises to the level of an essay is that it’s 
not exclusively about Lamott’s own authorial fears and limitations. It’s also not 
a laundry list of her advice to young writers. 


Obviously, Lamott is thinking about that greater purpose behind making a 
bunch of black marks on a white background for others to see and try to 
understand. For one, she says that writing is miraculous—or what Stephen 
King calls “telepathy.” As King puts it in On Writing, “All the arts depend upon 
telepathy to some degree, but I believe that writing offers the purest distillation. 
… We’re not even in the same year together, let alone the same room … 
except we are together. We’re close. We’re having a meeting of the minds.” 

Lecture 24—Sharing Your Essays: From Blog to Book|169


In addition to writing’s magic, in this paragraph, Lamott also talks about 
empathy—about sympathizing with those worlds and people who unfold out 
of all of those “small, flat, rigid squares of paper.” If we readers can stand inside 
someone else’s shoes, then we have a real chance at finding meaning in this 
life, in coming to appreciate, as Lamott says, “what community and friendship 
mean” or “how to live and die.” 


After magic and empathy, Lamott also touches on the wonder of a writer’s 
style: how he or she reproduces people and places, objects and ideas in a 
way that no one else ever has or ever will. Books are all about that “lyrical 
language” and “quality of attention” that Lamott mentions, meaning an author’s 
voice and attitude. Thus, writers’ quirky imagery and diction, their luscious 
details and descriptions make us notice those everyday things that, otherwise, 
we would surely ignore or miss.


In other words, in contrast to McDowell, Lamott cracks her essays wide open. 
Her focus is on idea—which is the sum and substance of all good essays. Her 
focus is not on personal issues, top-ten lists, or the unfiltered and unreflective 
opinions that dominate so many blog posts masquerading as essays.
True Blog Essays


An example of a blogger who writes true essays is Robin Bates. He writes a 
political and literary blog called Better Living through Beowulf: How Great Literature 
Can Change Your Life. The premise is simple: Bates examines philosophic theories 
and true-to-life lessons in classic literature that have the power to help ordinary 
people work through psychological and existential dilemmas. 


On his blog, Bates explains how certain pieces of literature have assisted him 
over the years as he grew up, found his life’s path, and went through periods 
of grief. He says, in particular, “Works of literature have … come to the rescue 
at moments of unimaginable pain. … When our oldest son died in a freak 
drowning accident, I turned to Beowulf and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. … 
[T]hey provided me some relief in [seeing] the grieving process as a journey, 
not as a mindless thrashing around.”

170|Becoming a Great Essayist


The reason that almost all of Bates’s pieces are actual essays and not just posts 
isn’t only that he’s a well-trained writer and a long-term teacher of writing. It’s 
also that he pays attention to the purpose of, and the audience for, his blog. 
Although he draws on his own life experience, his pieces spur thought. They 
take into account what matters to readers, not just what matters to Bates. 
And his central point is to move, rouse, educate, inform, and generally launch 
conversations with his audience.


In his post “Lear’s Lesson,” Bates links Shakespeare’s King Lear to the dynamics 
of politics over whether the United States should make an arms deal with 
Iran. Here, Bates draws from the personal, but he attempts to make it into 
something political and universal.


Bates has pulled together some of the politico-literary essays on Better Living 
through Beowulf into a book entitled How Beowulf Can Save America: An Epic 
Hero’s Guide to Defeating the Politics of Rage. In essence, then, Bates’s blog 
Blogs are a viable way to 
get your essays out the 
door, but you must work 
to distinguish your essay 
from a mere blog post.

Lecture 24—Sharing Your Essays: From Blog to Book|171
became his primary means for writing the draft of a book. He has used this 
online forum as a means of practicing his craft and creative thinking. 


If you decide to try your hand at keeping a blog to hone your writing skills, 
you might do so with an eye toward using it as if it were a collection of essays. 
With a blog, however, your essay drafts won’t be in a drawer or buried on a 
computer, with no one to read them. Instead, the comments you’ll receive 
from your blog followers will help you to know which pieces work, which 
don’t, and why. In turn, this feedback will potentially allow you to revise and 
polish certain essays into pieces that achieve artistic and even monetary 
success, including books, screenplays, and podcasts.
Assignment: Review of the Market


One valuable assignment for potential essayists is a review of the market. Visit 
10 websites of journals that publish creative nonfiction essays; these journals 
need to be small-press ones, with at least half of them publishing issues in 
hard copy. You can find such journals at the back of any Best American Essays 
collection. If you tend to write a certain genre of essay—such as nature essays 
or food essays—then you can also skim through collections specific to that 
genre to see where the selected essays come from. 


Once you’ve decided on your top 10 journals, go to each website and read 
at least two essays or parts of essays to get a feel for the kind of creative 
nonfiction these journals publish. Also look up specifics about how to submit 
your work. Find out when the journal comes out, the number of essays 
accepted every year, whether the journal pays for publication, and so on. 


After you’ve taken notes on each journal, write up a review of the market 
that explains why you chose these particular journals for your essays and how 
you see your work operating in this market. As boring as it may sound, you 
should probably do this kind of review at least once a year. 


Beyond doing a review of the market for small-press journals, if you’re hoping 
at some point to shop a collection of essays, then it’s probably also worth 
your while to invest in a copy of the current Writer’s Market and to look at 

172|Becoming a Great Essayist
the websites for university presses. Once you have some experience under 
your belt, you might also look into the question of getting an agent.


Finally, keep in mind this piece of advice from Harper Lee to anyone aspiring 
to a writing career: “Before developing his talent, he would be wise to develop 
a thick hide.” If writing is revision, it is also rejection. But every time you get 
a rejection, send your essay out again. There’s another reader out there who 
might appreciate what you have to say.
