Introduction
STOP! Read This Introduction!
	
I know the introduction in other books is usually 
trivial, and most of the time, it’s okay to skip over the in-
troduction, because it’s really an optional part of the book, 
with info relatively irrelevant to the rest of the book, and 
offers more fluff than substance to reader.
	
This is not one of those. Please do not skip ahead to 
the first section, without reading this introduction. It will 
give you an overall understanding of the concepts and ex-
ercises you’ll be working with throughout the course of the 
book. 
	
Let’s get started by learning about the two forms of 
reading that you’ll be working on!

Practice Reading
	
When you “practice read”, do not concern yourself 
with comprehension. The goal of practice reading is to do 
just that practice reading. Think of it like a baseball play-
er taking practice swings before he’s up to bat. Your goal 
is to get used to the feeling of reading in a new way, it 
will be awkward at first, but after practice it become more 
nautral. 
	
In each section there are five sets of exercises for 
practice reading. The exercises increase in difficulty from 
exercise #1, being easy, to exercise #5, being the most dif-
ficult. After working through all of the exercises, you’ll 
move on to “Performance Reading”.
Performance Reading
	
“Performance Reading” is when your goal is com-
prehension. It is active reading, not passive reading. You 
are constantly involved with the text, asking questions, 
visualizing information, hearing characters speak in your 
mind. 
	
A writers write to communicate their thoughts and 
ideas to readers. Regardless of the writer’s skill, commu-
nication with the reader is the goal of all writers. When 
you “performance read”, you’ll be working on visualizing 
and replicating the author’s mental picture in your mind.

Breaking Old Habits
	
The first section deals with breaking old habits of 
reading that readers have accumulated over years of vo-
calized reading. Vocalized reading is not necessarily a bad 
way to read, but as a habit it limits the reader’s ability 
to interpret text into meaning through other senses that 
readers have available to them.
	
These exercises help the reader become more aware 
of their subvocalization and assist in the lessening of this 
habit through physcally internal and external activities.
Building New Habits
	
After breaking down your old habits, you can then 
begin building new reading habits. In each of these chap-
ters, the reader will be presented with a new way to look 
at text and begin building positive reading habits.
	
These lessons aid the reader in developing a strong 
visual interpretation of the text, culminating with the 
final chapter exercise that combines all of the previous 
chapter exercises into one. 
	
This does not mean that you can practice this ex-
ercise alone and gain the value of all others. The exercise 
will most likely prove most difficult to near impossible 
until you’ve worked through the exercises in the previous 
chapters.

Displacement
	
This chapter focuses on replacing your subvocalized 
reading of the text with a common sound, phrase, number 
count, etc. This displaces the voiced word with another 
sound, forcing the reader to translate text into meaning 
through visual perception.
Disruption
	
This chapter works to help disrupt your natural 	
internal tendency to subvocalize by practicing methods 
that make it difficult to speak. In these exercises the text 
is reproduced as-is, with the exclusion of chapter head-
ings, for a more streamlined practice reading session. The 
performance reading section has the text reproduced ver-
batim with Chapter headings and original formatting.
Dishabituation
	
Dishabitiuation refers to the process in which a 
person experiences a full-strength response to a common 
stimulus that has become weakened over time. Readers 
have developed a series of habits when they are presented 
with text, and one of the best ways to break these habits, 
is by presenting the text in a new way to the reader.
	
The exercises contain the text with characters that 
are upside down, backwards, or alternating in their orien-
tation. The reader must decipher full words and phrases, 
rather than letters alone, because of the way that the text 
is presented.

5
Habituation
	
Habituation is the process of reducing response to 
a specific stimulus by means of repetition. These exercises 
work to eliminate the top five most-common words in the 
English language: “the”, “of”, “to”, “and”, and “a”. This is 
accomplished by splicing these common words in between 
the spaces of the text. At first the reader will, most likely, 
read these words, but after practice will begin mentally 
skipping these letters to extract meaning from the pas-
sage. In doing so, the reader will skip over words that 
were in the original text without loss in comprehension.
Visualization
	
These exercises are the only exercises that require 
writing in this book. Each exercise helps the reader in 
developing concrete visual vocabulary. This lesson is espe-
cially important to visual learners and will increase 	
readers’ ability to sense when to interpret words into 
sound and others into images, motion, context, etc.
“Imigization”
	
Ask yourself, if I can interpret meaning from sen-
tences at a glance, then couldn’t I extract meaning from 
whole pages? These exercises help develop a reader’s abil-
ity to take in larger chunks of information at one time. 
“Imigization” is a made-up word I use to describe the pro-
cess for these exercises, and refers to the process of taking 
in the entire text on the page as a picture, or symbol.

Closing
	
Words of encouragement on continuing your jour-
ney to becoming a speedy and efficient reader, as well as 
advice on where to go after completing the work in this 
book.
Bibliography
	
I’ve found many “speed reading” books have short 
or superficial bibliographies, which is why I have included 
all the books I have read on and around the subject mat-
ter. This is not to say that all of these books present posi-
tive speed reading habits, in fact, some of the books have 
been helpful showing me what NOT to write and what 
doesn’t work.
	
My goal was to be as comprehensive as possible in 
writing this book, taking into account all the theories be-
hind speed reading, both the realistic and unrealistic, and 
then building a course around that information to produce 
positive reading habits in myself and my various volun-
teer student readers.
One Final Word...
	
In deciding the text that this book would utilize to 
practice in each lesson, I took many things into consider-
ation. I wanted a text that was relatively short, something 
that people were familiar with, something that was easy 
to visualize, and something that everyone would enjoy. 
krismadden.com

My choice: Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland. 
	
It fits all of these categories and then some. 
	
The book was designed as a course workbook to be 
completed over a period of six weeks, with each section 
consisting of five exercises, one for each week day, and 
the performance reading section to be completed over the 
weekend. 
	
If you decide to go faster, that is fine as well, but 
I stress not skipping over chapters, because each one is 
foundational and built upon previous lessons. 
	
With that said, I should also let you know that 
some of the exercises will be extremely difficult, but don’t 
give up when you hit a rough patch of difficult practice 
readings. Keep up the persistence and maintain your 
reading schedule and you’ll continue to see the rewards in 
your personal reading life.
	
Enjoy.

Breaking 
Old 
Habits


	
Displacement refers to the method of replacing your 
habit of vocalizing the words that are printed on the page 
with a repetitious sound, word, or phrase. This distracts 
you from physically voicing the word and forces the use 
of another form of sensory perception to derive meaning 
from the text. 
	
To my knowledge, this method was first document-
ed in W. B. Secor’s 1899 study: “Visual Reading: A Study 
in Mental Imagery”. In it, Secor writes:
“The subject was asked either to say the         
alphabet aloud or to whistle a tune while   
reading. The results of this method were     
somewhat startling. It completely removed     
all traces of articulatory movement”

Practice Reading
In the exercise that follows, there will be a line of text and 
above each word will be a number. Instead of saying the 
word, say the number. If you catch yourself voicing the 
words, take a break and then resume practice reading.
Exercise #1
Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her 	
sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or 
twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, 
but it had no pictures or conversations in it, ‘and what is 
the use of a book,’ thought Alice ‘without pictures or 	
conversation?’ 
So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she 
could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and 	
stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain 
would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the 
daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran 
close by her.

There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did 
Alice think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the 
Rabbit say to itself, ‘Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!’ 
(when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her 
that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time 
it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually 
TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, 
and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her 
feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never 
before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a 
watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she 
ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in 
time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the 
hedge.
	
In another moment down went Alice after it, never 
once considering how in the world she was to get out

The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for 
some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly 
that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping her-
self before she found herself falling down a very deep well.
	
Either the well was very deep, or she fell very 	
slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to 
look about her and to wonder what was going to happen 
next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she 
was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then 
she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they 
were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and 
there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She 
took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it 
was labelled ‘ORANGE MARMALADE’, but to her great 
disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the

jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it into 
one of the cupboards as she fell past it.
	
‘Well!’ thought Alice to herself, ‘after such a fall as 
this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How 
brave they’ll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn’t say 
anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!’ 
(Which was very likely true.)
	
Down, down, down. Would the fall NEVER come 
to an end! ‘I wonder how many miles I’ve fallen by this 
time?’ she said aloud. ‘I must be getting somewhere near 
the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four 
thousand miles down, I think—’ (for, you see, Alice had 
learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the 
schoolroom, and though this was not a VERY good 	 	
opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was 
no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it

wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?’ (Alice 
had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but 
thought they were nice grand words to say.)
	
Presently she began again. ‘I wonder if I shall fall 
right THROUGH the earth! How funny it’ll seem to come 
out among the people that walk with their heads 	
	
downward! The Antipathies, I think—’ (she was rather 
glad there WAS no one listening, this time, as it didn’t 
sound at all the right word) ‘—but I shall have to ask 
them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, 
Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?’ (and she tried 
to curtsey as she spoke—fancy CURTSEYING as you’re 
falling through the air! Do you think you could manage 
it?) ‘And what an ignorant little girl she’ll think me for

Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, 
so Alice soon began talking again. ‘Dinah’ll miss me very 
much to-night, I should think!’ (Dinah was the cat.) ‘I 
hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. 	
Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! 
There are no mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might 
catch a bat, and that’s very like a mouse, you know. But 
do cats eat bats, I wonder?’ And here Alice began to get 
rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy 
sort of way, ‘Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?’ and some-
times, ‘Do bats eat cats?’ for, you see, as she couldn’t 	
answer either question, it didn’t much matter which way 
she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just 
begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with 
Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, ‘Now, Dinah, tell

    to get 	
     	
   out again.
	
	
	
Suddenly she 	
came upon a		
 
little three-legged 	   table, all 	
	
made of solid 	
glass; there was 	
nothing on 	 	
it except a tiny 	
golden key, 	 	
and Alice’s 	 	
first thought 	
was that it 	 	
might belong 	
to one of the		
 
doors of the 		
hall; but, alas! 	
either the locks 	
were too large, 	
or the key was 	
too small, but	
 
at any rate it	
 would not open 	
any of them.
However, on		
 the second time	
 round, she came 
upon a low 	 	
curtain she had 	
not noticed before, 
and behind 	 	
it was a little 	
door about fifteen 
inches high:		
she tried the 	
little golden key in 
the lock, and 	
to her great 		
delight it fitted!
Alice opened 	
the door and 	
found that it

led into a 	
	
small passage, 	
not much larger 
than a 	
	
rat-hole: she 	
knelt down and 
looked along 	
the passage

she longed to get

dark hall, and

beds of 	
	
bright flowers

fountains, but

my head would 	
go through,’ 
thought poor 	
Alice, ‘it would 	
be of very little 
use without 		
my shoulders.	
Oh, how I wish I

think I could, if I

that very few

were really 	 	
impossible.
	
	
	
There seemed to 	
be no use in 
waiting by the 	
little door, so 	
she went back
to the table, 		
half hoping she 	
might find another 
key on it,

said Alice,) and 
round the neck 	
of the bottle 		
was a paper label, 
with the words 	
‘DRINK ME’ 	
beautifully printed 
on it in large 	
letters. It was 	
all very well to say 
‘Drink me,’	 	
but the wise 		
little Alice was not

THAT in a hurry.	 ‘No, I’ll look first,’

Performance Reading
CHAPTER I. Down the Rabbit-Hole
Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sis-
ter on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice 
she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but 
it had no pictures or conversations in it, ‘and what is the 
use of a book,’ thought Alice ‘without pictures or conversa-
tion?’
	
So she was considering in her own mind (as well as 
she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and 
stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain 
would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the 
daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran 
close by her.
	
There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; 
nor did Alice think it so VERY much out of the way to 
hear the Rabbit say to itself, ‘Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be 
late!’ (When she thought it over afterwards, it occurred 
to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the 
time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit 
actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-
POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice 
started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she 
had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-
pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curi-
osity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was 
krismadden.com

43
just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under 
the hedge.
	
In another moment down went Alice after it, never 
once considering how in the world she was to get out 
again.
	
The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for 
some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly 
that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping her-
self before she found herself falling down a very deep well.
	
Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slow-
ly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look 
about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. 
First, she tried to look down and make out what she was 
coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she 
looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were 
filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there 
she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took 
down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was 
labelled ‘ORANGE MARMALADE’, but to her great disap-
pointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar 
for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one 
of the cupboards as she fell past it.
	
‘Well!’ thought Alice to herself, ‘after such a fall as 
this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How 
brave they’ll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn’t say 
anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!’ 
(Which was very likely true.)

Down, down, down. Would the fall NEVER come 
to an end! ‘I wonder how many miles I’ve fallen by this 
time?’ she said aloud. ‘I must be getting somewhere near 
the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four 
thousand miles down, I think—’ (for, you see, Alice had 
learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the 
schoolroom, and though this was not a VERY good op-
portunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no 
one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) 
‘—yes, that’s about the right distance—but then I wonder 
what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?’ (Alice had no idea 
what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they 
were nice grand words to say.)
	
Presently she began again. ‘I wonder if I shall fall 
right THROUGH the earth! How funny it’ll seem to come 
out among the people that walk with their heads down-
ward! The Antipathies, I think—’ (she was rather glad 
there WAS no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound 
at all the right word) ‘—but I shall have to ask them what 
the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is 
this New Zealand or Australia?’ (and she tried to curt-
sey as she spoke—fancy CURTSEYING as you’re falling 
through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) ‘And 
what an ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! 
No, it’ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up 
somewhere.’
	
Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, 
so Alice soon began talking again. ‘Dinah’ll miss me very 
krismadden.com

45
much to-night, I should think!’ (Dinah was the cat.) ‘I 
hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Di-
nah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There 
are no mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a 
bat, and that’s very like a mouse, you know. But do cats 
eat bats, I wonder?’ And here Alice began to get rather 
sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of 
way, ‘Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?’ and sometimes, 
‘Do bats eat cats?’ for, you see, as she couldn’t answer ei-
ther question, it didn’t much matter which way she put 
it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to 
dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, 
and saying to her very earnestly, ‘Now, Dinah, tell me 
the truth: did you ever eat a bat?’ when suddenly, thump! 
thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry 
leaves, and the fall was over.
	
Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to 
her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark 
overhead; before her was another long passage, and the 
White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There 
was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the 
wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a 
corner, ‘Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it’s getting!’ 
She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but 
the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a 
long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging 
from the roof.
	
There were doors all round the hall, but they were

46
all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one 
side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly 
down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out 
again.
	
Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, 
all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a 
tiny golden key, and Alice’s first thought was that it might 
belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the 
locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any 
rate it would not open any of them. However, on the sec-
ond time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not 
noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen 
inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and 
to her great delight it fitted!
	
Alice opened the door and found that it led into a 
small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt 
down and looked along the passage into the loveliest gar-
den you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark 
hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers 
and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her 
head through the doorway; ‘and even if my head would go 
through,’ thought poor Alice, ‘it would be of very little use 
without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like 
a telescope! I think I could, if I only know how to begin.’ 
For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened 
lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things 
indeed were really impossible.
	
There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little 
krismadden.com

47
door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might 
find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for 
shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a 
little bottle on it, (‘which certainly was not here before,’ 
said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper 
label, with the words ‘DRINK ME’ beautifully printed on 
it in large letters.
	
It was all very well to say ‘Drink me,’ but the wise 
little Alice was not going to do THAT in a hurry. ‘No, I’ll 
look first,’ she said, ‘and see whether it’s marked “poison” 
or not’; for she had read several nice little histories about 
children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts 
and other unpleasant things, all because they WOULD 
not remember the simple rules their friends had taught 
them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you 
hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger VERY 
deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never 
forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked 
‘poison,’ it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner 
or later.
	
However, this bottle was NOT marked ‘poison,’ so 
Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, 
in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, 
pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) 
she very soon finished it off.
  *    *    *
‘What a curious feeling!’ said Alice; ‘I must be shutting up 
like a telescope.’

And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches 
high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she 
was now the right size for going through the little door 
into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a 
few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: 
she felt a little nervous about this; ‘for it might end, you 
know,’ said Alice to herself, ‘in my going out altogether, 
like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?’ And 
she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after 
the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever 
having seen such a thing.
	
After a while, finding that nothing more happened, 
she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for 
poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had 
forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to 
the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: 
she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she 
tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but 
it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out 
with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.
	
‘Come, there’s no use in crying like that!’ said Al-
ice to herself, rather sharply; ‘I advise you to leave off 
this minute!’ She generally gave herself very good advice, 
(though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she 
scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; 
and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for 
having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was play-
ing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of 
krismadden.com

49
pretending to be two people. ‘But it’s no use now,’ thought 
poor Alice, ‘to pretend to be two people! Why, there’s hard-
ly enough of me left to make ONE respectable person!’
	
Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was ly-
ing under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very 
small cake, on which the words ‘EAT ME’ were beauti-
fully marked in currants. ‘Well, I’ll eat it,’ said Alice, ‘and 
if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it 
makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so 
either way I’ll get into the garden, and I don’t care which 
happens!’
	
She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, 
‘Which way? Which way?’, holding her hand on the top of 
her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was 
quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: 
to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but 
Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing 
but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite 
dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.
	
So she set to work, and very soon finished off the 
cake.

CHAPTER II. The Pool of Tears
‘Curiouser and curiouser!’ cried Alice (she was so much 
surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to 
speak good English); ‘now I’m opening out like the larg-
est telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!’ (for when she 
looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of 
sight, they were getting so far off). ‘Oh, my poor little feet, 
I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you 
now, dears? I’m sure I shan’t be able! I shall be a great 
deal too far off to trouble myself about you: you must 
manage the best way you can;—but I must be kind to 
them,’ thought Alice, ‘or perhaps they won’t walk the way 
I want to go! Let me see: I’ll give them a new pair of boots 
every Christmas.’
	
And she went on planning to herself how she would 
manage it. ‘They must go by the carrier,’ she thought; ‘and 
how funny it’ll seem, sending presents to one’s own feet! 
And how odd the directions will look!

Just then her head struck against the roof of the 
hall: in fact she was now more than nine feet high, and

she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to 
the garden door.
	
Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying 
down on one side, to look through into the garden with 
one eye; but to get through was more hopeless than ever: 
she sat down and began to cry again.
	
‘You ought to be ashamed of yourself,’ said Alice, 
‘a great girl like you,’ (she might well say this), ‘to go on 
crying in this way! Stop this moment, I tell you!’ But she 
went on all the same, shedding gallons of tears, until 
there was a large pool all round her, about four inches 
deep and reaching half down the hall.
	
After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in 
the distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what 
was coming. It was the White Rabbit returning, splendid-
ly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and 
a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great

if I’ve kept her waiting!’ Alice felt so desperate that she 
was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit 
came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, ‘If you 
please, sir—’ The Rabbit started violently, dropped the 
white kid gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the 
darkness as hard as he could go.
	
Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall 
was very hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she 
went on talking: ‘Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-
day! And yesterday things went on just as usual. I wonder 
if I’ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the 
same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can re-

the next question is, Who in the world am I? Ah, THAT’S

children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to

‘I’m sure I’m not Ada,’ she said, ‘for her hair goes 
in such long ringlets, and mine doesn’t go in ringlets at 
all; and I’m sure I can’t be Mabel, for I know all sorts of 
things, and she, oh! she knows such a very little! Besides, 
SHE’S she, and I’m I, and—oh dear, how puzzling it all 
is! I’ll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let me 
see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thir-
teen, and four times seven is—oh dear! I shall never get 
to twenty at that rate! However, the Multiplication Table 
doesn’t signify: let’s try Geography. London is the capital 
of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and Rome—no, 
THAT’S all wrong, I’m certain! I must have been changed 
for Mabel! I’ll try and say “How doth the little—”’ and she 
crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying les-
sons, and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse 
and strange, and the words did not come the same as they 
used to do:— 
‘How doth the little crocodile
      Improve his shining tail,
     And pour the waters of the Nile
      On every golden scale!
     ‘How cheerfully he seems to grin,
      How neatly spread his claws,
     And welcome little fishes in
      With gently smiling jaws!’

‘I’m sure those are not the right words,’ said poor 
Alice, and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, 
‘I must be Mabel after all, and I shall have to go and live 
in that poky little house, and have next to no toys to play 
with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I’ve made 
up my mind about it; if I’m Mabel, I’ll stay down here! 
It’ll be no use their putting their heads down and saying 
“Come up again, dear!” I shall only look up and say “Who 
am I then? Tell me that first, and then, if I like being 
that person, I’ll come up: if not, I’ll stay down here till I’m 
somebody else”—but, oh dear!’ cried Alice, with a sudden 
burst of tears, ‘I do wish they WOULD put their heads 
down! I am so VERY tired of being all alone here!’
	
As she said this she looked down at her hands, and 
was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rab-
bit’s little white kid gloves while she was talking. ‘How 
CAN I have done that?’ she thought. ‘I must be growing 
small again.’ She got up and went to the table to mea-
sure herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could 
guess, she was now about two feet high, and was going 
on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the cause of 
this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hast-
ily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.
	
‘That WAS a narrow escape!’ said Alice, a good deal 
frightened at the sudden change, but very glad to find 
herself still in existence; ‘and now for the garden!’ and she 
ran with all speed back to the little door: but, alas! the 
little door was shut again, and the little golden key was

57
lying on the glass table as before, ‘and things are worse 
than ever,’ thought the poor child, ‘for I never was so 
small as this before, never! And I declare it’s too bad, that 
it is!’
	
As she said these words her foot slipped, and in an-
other moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt wa-
ter. Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into 
the sea, ‘and in that case I can go back by railway,’ she 
said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in her 
life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wher-
ever you go to on the English coast you find a number of 
bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in the 
sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, 
and behind them a railway station.) However, she soon 
made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had 
wept when she was nine feet high.
	
‘I wish I hadn’t cried so much!’ said Alice, as she 
swam about, trying to find her way out. ‘I shall be pun-
ished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in my own 
tears! That WILL be a queer thing, to be sure! However, 
everything is queer to-day.’
	
Just then she heard something splashing about in 
the pool a little way off, and she swam nearer to make out 
what it was: at first she thought it must be a walrus or 
hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she 
was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse 
that had slipped in like herself.

‘Would it be of any use, now,’ thought Alice, ‘to speak to 
this mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, 
that I should think very likely it can talk: at any rate, 
there’s no harm in trying.’ So she began: ‘O Mouse, do you 
know the way out of this pool? I am very tired of swim-
ming about here, O Mouse!’ (Alice thought this must be 
the right way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done 
such a thing before, but she remembered having seen in 
her brother’s Latin Grammar, ‘A mouse—of a mouse—to 
a mouse—a mouse—O mouse!’) The Mouse looked at her 
rather inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one 
of its little eyes, but it said nothing.
	
‘Perhaps it doesn’t understand English,’ thought 
Alice; ‘I daresay it’s a French mouse, come over with Wil-
liam the Conqueror.’ (For, with all her knowledge of his-
tory, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything 
had happened.) So she began again: ‘Ou est ma chatte?’ 
which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. 
The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water, and 
seemed to quiver all over with fright. ‘Oh, I beg your par-
don!’ cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor 
animal’s feelings. ‘I quite forgot you didn’t like cats.’
	
‘Not like cats!’ cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passion-
ate voice. ‘Would YOU like cats if you were me?’
	
‘Well, perhaps not,’ said Alice in a soothing tone: 
‘don’t be angry about it. And yet I wish I could show you 
our cat Dinah: I think you’d take a fancy to cats if you 
could only see her. She is such a dear quiet thing,’ Alice

went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the 
pool, ‘and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her 
paws and washing her face—and she is such a nice soft 
thing to nurse—and she’s such a capital one for catching 
mice—oh, I beg your pardon!’ cried Alice again, for this 
time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt certain 
it must be really offended. ‘We won’t talk about her any 
more if you’d rather not.’
	
‘We indeed!’ cried the Mouse, who was trembling 
down to the end of his tail. ‘As if I would talk on such a 
subject! Our family always HATED cats: nasty, low, vul-
gar things! Don’t let me hear the name again!’
	
‘I won’t indeed!’ said Alice, in a great hurry to 
change the subject of conversation. ‘Are you—are you 
fond—of—of dogs?’ The Mouse did not answer, so Alice 
went on eagerly: ‘There is such a nice little dog near our 
house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed ter-
rier, you know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And 
it’ll fetch things when you throw them, and it’ll sit up and 
beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things—I can’t remem-
ber half of them—and it belongs to a farmer, you know, 
and he says it’s so useful, it’s worth a hundred pounds! 
He says it kills all the rats and—oh dear!’ cried Alice in a 
sorrowful tone, ‘I’m afraid I’ve offended it again!’ For the 
Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could 
go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.

Exercise #2
	
So she called softly after it, ‘Mouse dear! Do come 
back again, and we won’t talk about cats or dogs either, 
if you don’t like them!’ When the Mouse heard this, it 
turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face was 
quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a 
low trembling voice, ‘Let us get to the shore, and then I’ll 
tell you my history, and you’ll understand why it is I hate 
cats and dogs.’
	
It was high time to go, for the pool was getting 
quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen 
into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Ea-
glet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the 
way, and the whole party swam to the shore. see if she 
could have been changed for any of them.
	
They were indeed a queer-looking party that as-
sembled on the bank—the birds with draggled feathers,

61
the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all 
dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.
	
The first question of course was, how to get dry 
again: they had a consultation about this, and after a few 
minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself 
talking familiarly with them, as if she had known them 
all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with 
the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, ‘I 
am older than you, and must know better’; and this Alice 
would not allow without knowing how old it was, and, as 
the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no 
more to be said.
	
At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of 
authority among them, called out, ‘Sit down, all of you, 
and listen to me! I’LL soon make you dry enough!’ They 
all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse in the 
middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she 
felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry 
very soon.
	
‘Ahem!’ said the Mouse with an important air, ‘are 
you all ready? This is the driest thing I know. Silence all 
round, if you please! “William the Conqueror, whose cause 
was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted to by the 
English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much 
accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Mor-
car, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria—”’
	
‘Ugh!’ said the Lory, with a shiver.

‘I beg your pardon!’ said the Mouse, frowning, but 
very politely: ‘Did you speak?’
	
‘Not I!’ said the Lory hastily.
	
‘I thought you did,’ said the Mouse. ‘—I proceed. 
“Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, 
declared for him: and even Stigand, the patriotic arch-
bishop of Canterbury, found it advisable—”’
	
‘Found WHAT?’ said the Duck.
	
‘Found IT,’ the Mouse replied rather crossly: ‘of 
course you know what “it” means.’
	
‘I know what “it” means well enough, when I find a 
thing,’ said the Duck: ‘it’s generally a frog or a worm. The 
question is, what did the archbishop find?’
	
The Mouse did not notice this question, but hur-
riedly went on, ‘”—found it advisable to go with Edgar 
Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown. Wil-
liam’s conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence of 
his Normans—” How are you getting on now, my dear?’ it 
continued, turning to Alice as it spoke.
	
‘As wet as ever,’ said Alice in a melancholy tone: ‘it 
doesn’t seem to dry me at all.’
	
‘In that case,’ said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its 
feet, ‘I move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate 
adoption of more energetic remedies—’
	
‘Speak English!’ said the Eaglet. ‘I don’t know the 
meaning of half those long words, and, what’s more, I 
krismadden.com

63
don’t believe you do either!’ And the Eaglet bent down its 
head to hide a smile: some of the other birds tittered audi-
bly.
	
‘What I was going to say,’ said the Dodo in an of-
fended tone, ‘was, that the best thing to get us dry would 
be a Caucus-race.’
	
‘What IS a Caucus-race?’ said Alice; not that she 
wanted much to know, but the Dodo had paused as if it 
thought that SOMEBODY ought to speak, and no one else 
seemed inclined to say anything.
	
‘Why,’ said the Dodo, ‘the best way to explain it is 
to do it.’ (And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, 
some winter day, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.)
	
First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, 
(‘the exact shape doesn’t matter,’ it said,) and then all the 
party were placed along the course, here and there. There 
was no ‘One, two, three, and away,’ but they began run-
ning when they liked, and left off when they liked, so that 
it was not easy to know when the race was over. However, 
when they had been running half an hour or so, and were 
quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called out ‘The race is 
over!’ and they all crowded round it, panting, and asking, 
‘But who has won?’
	
This question the Dodo could not answer without a 
great deal of thought, and it sat for a long time with one 
finger pressed upon its forehead (the position in which 
you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures of him),

64
while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo said, 
‘EVERYBODY has won, and all must have prizes.’
	
‘But who is to give the prizes?’ quite a chorus of 
voices asked.
	
‘Why, SHE, of course,’ said the Dodo, pointing to 
Alice with one finger; and the whole party at once crowded 
round her, calling out in a confused way, ‘Prizes! Prizes!’
	
Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put 
her hand in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, 
(luckily the salt water had not got into it), and handed 
them round as prizes. There was exactly one a-piece all 
round.
	
‘But she must have a prize herself, you know,’ said 
the Mouse.
	
‘Of course,’ the Dodo replied very gravely. ‘What 
else have you got in your pocket?’ he went on, turning to 
Alice.
	
‘Only a thimble,’ said Alice sadly.
	
‘Hand it over here,’ said the Dodo.
	
Then they all crowded round her once more, while 
the Dodo solemnly presented the thimble, saying ‘We beg 
your acceptance of this elegant thimble’; and, when it had 
finished this short speech, they all cheered.
	
Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they 
all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as 
she could not think of anything to say, she simply bowed, 
krismadden.com

65
and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she could.
	
The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused 
some noise and confusion, as the large birds complained 
that they could not taste theirs, and the small ones 
choked and had to be patted on the back. However, it 
was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and 
begged the Mouse to tell them something more.
	
‘You promised to tell me your history, you know,’ 
said Alice, ‘and why it is you hate—C and D,’ she added in 
a whisper, half afraid that it would be offended again.
	
‘Mine is a long and a sad tale!’ said the Mouse, 
turning to Alice, and sighing.
‘It IS a long tail, certainly,’ said Alice, looking down with 
wonder at the Mouse’s tail; ‘but why do you call it sad?’ 
And she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was 
speaking, so that her idea of the tale was something like 
this:—

‘You are not attending!’ said the Mouse to Alice se-
verely. ‘What are you thinking of?’
	
‘I beg your pardon,’ said Alice very humbly: ‘you 
had got to the fifth bend, I think?’
	
‘I had NOT!’ cried the Mouse, sharply and very an-
grily.
	
‘A knot!’ said Alice, always ready to make herself 
useful, and looking anxiously about her. ‘Oh, do let me 
help to undo it!’
	
‘I shall do nothing of the sort,’ said the Mouse, get-
ting up and walking away. ‘You insult me by talking such 
nonsense!’
	
‘I didn’t mean it!’ pleaded poor Alice. ‘But you’re so 
easily offended, you know!’
	
The Mouse only growled in reply.
	
‘Please come back and finish your story!’ Alice 
called after it; and the others all joined in chorus, ‘Yes, 
please do!’ but the Mouse only shook its head impatiently, 
and walked a little quicker.

‘What a pity it wouldn’t stay!’ sighed the Lory, as 
soon as it was quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the 
opportunity of saying to her daughter ‘Ah, my dear! Let 
this be a lesson to you never to lose YOUR temper!’ ‘Hold 
your tongue, Ma!’ said the young Crab, a little snappishly. 
‘You’re enough to try the patience of an oyster!’
	
‘I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!’ said 
Alice aloud, addressing nobody in particular. ‘She’d soon 
fetch it back!’
	
‘And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the 
question?’ said the Lory.
	
Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to 
talk about her pet: ‘Dinah’s our cat. And she’s such a capi-
tal one for catching mice you can’t think! And oh, I wish 
you could see her after the birds! Why, she’ll eat a little 
bird as soon as look at it!’
	
This speech caused a remarkable sensation among 
the party. Some of the birds hurried off at once: one old 
Magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully, remark-
ing, ‘I really must be getting home; the night-air doesn’t 
suit my throat!’ and a Canary called out in a trembling 
voice to its children, ‘Come away, my dears! It’s high time 
you were all in bed!’ On various pretexts they all moved 
off, and Alice was soon left alone.
	
‘I wish I hadn’t mentioned Dinah!’ she said to her-
self in a melancholy tone. ‘Nobody seems to like her, down 
here, and I’m sure she’s the best cat in the world! Oh, my 
krismadden.com

dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you any more!’ 
And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very 
lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she 
again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance, 
and she looked up eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse 
had changed his mind, and was coming back to finish his 
story.
	
It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back 
again, and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had 
lost something; and she heard it muttering to itself ‘The 
Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur and 
whiskers! She’ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are 
ferrets! Where CAN I have dropped them, I wonder?’ Alice 
guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and 
the pair of white kid gloves, and she very good-naturedly 
began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere to 
be seen—everything seemed to have changed since her 
swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table 
and the little door, had vanished completely.
	
Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went 
hunting about, and called out to her in an angry tone, 
‘Why, Mary Ann, what ARE you doing out here? Run 
home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a 
fan! Quick, now!’ And Alice was so much frightened that 
she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without 
trying to explain the mistake it had made.
	
‘He took me for his housemaid,’ she said to herself 
as she ran. ‘How surprised he’ll be when he finds out who 
krismadden.com

71
I am! But I’d better take him his fan and gloves—that is, 
if I can find them.’ As she said this, she came upon a neat 
little house, on the door of which was a bright brass plate 
with the name ‘W. RABBIT’ engraved upon it. She went 
in without knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear 
lest she should meet the real Mary Ann, and be turned 
out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves.
	
‘How queer it seems,’ Alice said to herself, ‘to be 
going messages for a rabbit! I suppose Dinah’ll be sending 
me on messages next!’ And she began fancying the sort of 
thing that would happen: ‘”Miss Alice! Come here directly, 
and get ready for your walk!” “Coming in a minute, nurse! 
But I’ve got to see that the mouse doesn’t get out.” Only I 
don’t think,’ Alice went on, ‘that they’d let Dinah stop in 
the house if it began ordering people about like that!’
	
By this time she had found her way into a tidy 
little room with a table in the window, and on it (as she 
had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid 
gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves, and 
was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a 
little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was 
no label this time with the words ‘DRINK ME,’ but nev-
ertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips. ‘I know 
SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,’ she said to 
herself, ‘whenever I eat or drink anything; so I’ll just see 
what this bottle does. I do hope it’ll make me grow large 
again, for really I’m quite tired of being such a tiny little 
thing!’

It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had ex-
pected: before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her 
head pressing against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save 
her neck from being broken. She hastily put down the bot-
tle, saying to herself ‘That’s quite enough—I hope I shan’t 
grow any more—As it is, I can’t get out at the door—I do 
wish I hadn’t drunk quite so much!’
	
Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on 
growing, and growing, and very soon had to kneel down 
on the floor: in another minute there was not even room 
for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with one el-
bow against the door, and the other arm curled round her 
head. Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, 
she put one arm out of the window, and one foot up the 
chimney, and said to herself ‘Now I can do no more, what-
ever happens. What WILL become of me?’
krismadden.com

73
	
Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now 
had its full effect, and she grew no larger: still it was 
very uncomfortable, and, as there seemed to be no sort of 
chance of her ever getting out of the room again, no won-
der she felt unhappy.
	
‘It was much pleasanter at home,’ thought poor Al-
ice, ‘when one wasn’t always growing larger and smaller, 
and being ordered about by mice and rabbits. I almost 
wish I hadn’t gone down that rabbit-hole—and yet—and 
yet—it’s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do 
wonder what CAN have happened to me! When I used to 
read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing never hap-
pened, and now here I am in the middle of one! There 
ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! 
And when I grow up, I’ll write one—but I’m grown up 
now,’ she added in a sorrowful tone; ‘at least there’s no 
room to grow up any more HERE.’
	
‘But then,’ thought Alice, ‘shall I NEVER get any 
older than I am now? That’ll be a comfort, one way—never 
to be an old woman—but then—always to have lessons to 
learn! Oh, I shouldn’t like THAT!’
	
‘Oh, you foolish Alice!’ she answered herself. ‘How 
can you learn lessons in here? Why, there’s hardly room 
for YOU, and no room at all for any lesson-books!’
	
And so she went on, taking first one side and then 
the other, and making quite a conversation of it altogeth-
er; but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside, and 
stopped to listen.

‘Mary Ann! Mary Ann!’ said the voice. ‘Fetch me my 
gloves this moment!’ Then came a little pattering of feet 
on the stairs. Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look 
for her, and she trembled till she shook the house, quite 
forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as 
large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.
	
Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried 
to open it; but, as the door opened inwards, and Alice’s 
elbow was pressed hard against it, that attempt proved a 
failure. Alice heard it say to itself ‘Then I’ll go round and 
get in at the window.’
	
‘THAT you won’t’ thought Alice, and, after wait-
ing till she fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the 
window, she suddenly spread out her hand, and made a 
snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything, but 
she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken 
glass, from which she concluded that it was just possible 
it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something of the 
sort.
	
Next came an angry voice—the Rabbit’s—’Pat! Pat! 
Where are you?’ And then a voice she had never heard be-
fore, ‘Sure then I’m here! Digging for apples, yer honour!’
	
‘Digging for apples, indeed!’ said the Rabbit angrily. 
‘Here! Come and help me out of THIS!’ (Sounds of more 
broken glass.)
	
‘Now tell me, Pat, what’s that in the window?’

‘Sure, it’s an arm, yer honour!’ (He pronounced it ‘arrum.’)
	
‘An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? 
Why, it fills the whole window!’
	
‘Sure, it does, yer honour: but it’s an arm for all 
that.’
	
‘Well, it’s got no business there, at any rate: go and 
take it away!’
	
There was a long silence after this, and Alice could 
only hear whispers now and then; such as, ‘Sure, I don’t 
like it, yer honour, at all, at all!’ ‘Do as I tell you, you cow-
ard!’ and at last she spread out her hand again, and made 
another snatch in the air. This time there were TWO little 
shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. ‘What a num-
ber of cucumber-frames there must be!’ thought Alice. ‘I 
wonder what they’ll do next! As for pulling me out of the 
window, I only wish they COULD! I’m sure I don’t want to 
stay in here any longer!’
	
She waited for some time without hearing anything 
more: at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and 
the sound of a good many voices all talking together: she 
made out the words: ‘Where’s the other ladder?—Why, I 
hadn’t to bring but one; Bill’s got the other—Bill! fetch it 
here, lad!—Here, put ‘em up at this corner—No, tie ‘em 
together first—they don’t reach half high enough yet—
Oh! they’ll do well enough; don’t be particular—Here, 
Bill! catch hold of this rope—Will the roof bear?—Mind 
that loose slate—Oh, it’s coming down! Heads below!’ (a

loud crash)—’Now, who did that?—It was Bill, I fancy—
Who’s to go down the chimney?—Nay, I shan’t! YOU do 
it!—That I won’t, then!—Bill’s to go down—Here, Bill! the 
master says you’re to go down the chimney!’
	
‘Oh! So Bill’s got to come down the chimney, has 
he?’ said Alice to herself. ‘Shy, they seem to put every-
thing upon Bill! I wouldn’t be in Bill’s place for a good 
deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but I THINK I 
can kick a little!’
	
She drew her foot as far down the chimney as 
she could, and waited till she heard a little animal (she 
couldn’t guess of what sort it was) scratching and scram-
bling about in the chimney close above her: then, saying 
to herself ‘This is Bill,’ she gave one sharp kick, and wait-
ed to see what would happen next.
	
The first thing she heard was a general chorus of 
‘There goes Bill!’ then the Rabbit’s voice along—’Catch 
him, you by the hedge!’ then silence, and then another 
confusion of voices—’Hold up his head—Brandy now—
Don’t choke him—How was it, old fellow? What happened 
to you? Tell us all about it!’
	
Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (‘That’s 
Bill,’ thought Alice,) ‘Well, I hardly know—No more, 
thank ye; I’m better now—but I’m a deal too flustered 
to tell you—all I know is, something comes at me like a 
Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!’
	
‘So you did, old fellow!’ said the others.

‘We must burn the house down!’ said the Rabbit’s 
voice; and Alice called out as loud as she could, ‘If you do. 
I’ll set Dinah at you!’
	
There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice 
thought to herself, ‘I wonder what they WILL do next! 
If they had any sense, they’d take the roof off.’ After a 
minute or two, they began moving about again, and Alice 
heard the Rabbit say, ‘A barrowful will do, to begin with.’
	
‘A barrowful of WHAT?’ thought Alice; but she had 
not long to doubt, for the next moment a shower of little 
pebbles came rattling in at the window, and some of them 
hit her in the face. ‘I’ll put a stop to this,’ she said to her-
self, and shouted out, ‘You’d better not do that again!’ 
which produced another dead silence.
	
Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles 
were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, 
and a bright idea came into her head. ‘If I eat one of these 
cakes,’ she thought, ‘it’s sure to make SOME change in 
my size; and as it can’t possibly make me larger, it must 
make me smaller, I suppose.’
	
So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was de-
lighted to find that she began shrinking directly. As soon 
as she was small enough to get through the door, she ran 
out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little animals 
and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, was 
in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were 
giving it something out of a bottle. They all made a rush 
at Alice the moment she appeared; but she ran off as hard

as she could, and soon found herself safe in a thick wood.
	
‘The first thing I’ve got to do,’ said Alice to herself, 
as she wandered about in the wood, ‘is to grow to my right 
size again; and the second thing is to find my way into 
that lovely garden. I think that will be the best plan.’
	
It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very 
neatly and simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that 
she had not the smallest idea how to set about it; and 
while she was peering about anxiously among the trees, a 
little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a 
great hurry.
	
An enormous puppy was looking down at her with 
large round eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, try-
ing to touch her. ‘Poor little thing!’ said Alice, in a coaxing 
tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but she was ter-
ribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might 
be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her 
up in spite of all her coaxing. as she could, and soon found

Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little 
bit of stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the 
puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once, with a 
yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick, and made believe 
to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle, to 
keep herself from being run over; and the moment she 
appeared on the other side, the puppy made another rush 
at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to 
get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very like having 
a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every mo-
ment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle

again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at 
the stick, running a very little way forwards each time 
and a long way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, 
till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with its 
tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half 
shut.
	
This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for mak-
ing her escape; so she set off at once, and ran till she was 
quite tired and out of breath, and till the puppy’s bark 
sounded quite faint in the distance.
	
‘And yet what a dear little puppy it was!’ said Al-
ice, as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and 
fanned herself with one of the leaves: ‘I should have liked 
teaching it tricks very much, if—if I’d only been the right 
size to do it! Oh dear! I’d nearly forgotten that I’ve got to 
grow up again! Let me see—how IS it to be managed? I 
suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but 
the great question is, what?’
	
The great question certainly was, what? Alice 
looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of 
grass, but she did not see anything that looked like the 
right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances. There 
was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same 
height as herself; and when she had looked under it, and 
on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her that 
she might as well look and see what was on the top of it.
	
She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over 
the edge of the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met

those of a large caterpillar, that was sitting on the top 
with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah, and 
taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else.
The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some 
time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out 
of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.
	
‘Who are YOU?’ said the Caterpillar.
	
This was not an encouraging opening for a conver-
sation. Alice replied, rather shyly, ‘I—I hardly know, sir, 
just at present—at least I know who I WAS when I got up 
this morning, but I think I must have been changed sev-
eral times since then.’
	
‘What do you mean by that?’ said the Caterpillar 
sternly. ‘Explain yourself!’
	
‘I can’t explain MYSELF, I’m afraid, sir’ said Alice, 
‘because I’m not myself, you see.’
	
‘I don’t see,’ said the Caterpillar.
	
‘I’m afraid I can’t put it more clearly,’ Alice replied 
very politely, ‘for I can’t understand it myself to begin 
with; and being so many different sizes in a day is very 
confusing.’
	
‘It isn’t,’ said the Caterpillar.
	
‘Well, perhaps you haven’t found it so yet,’ said Al-
ice; ‘but when you have to turn into a chrysalis—you will 
some day, you know—and then after that into a butterfly,

I should think you’ll feel it a little queer, won’t you?’
	
‘Not a bit,’ said the Caterpillar.
	
‘Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,’ said 
Alice; ‘all I know is, it would feel very queer to ME.’
	
‘You!’ said the Caterpillar contemptuously. ‘Who 
are YOU?’
	
Which brought them back again to the beginning of 
the conversation. Alice felt a little irritated at the Cater-
pillar’s making such VERY short remarks, and she drew 
herself up and said, very gravely, ‘I think, you ought to 
tell me who YOU are, first.’
	
‘Why?’ said the Caterpillar.
	
Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice 
could not think of any good reason, and as the Caterpil-
lar seemed to be in a VERY unpleasant state of mind, she 
turned away.
	
‘Come back!’ the Caterpillar called after her. ‘I’ve 
something important to say!’
	
This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned 
and came back again.
	
‘Keep your temper,’ said the Caterpillar.
	
‘Is that all?’ said Alice, swallowing down her anger 
as well as she could.
‘No,’ said the Caterpillar.
	
Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had

nothing else to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her 
something worth hearing. For some minutes it puffed 
away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its arms, 
took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, ‘So you 
think you’re changed, do you?’
	
‘I’m afraid I am, sir,’ said Alice; ‘I can’t remember 
things as I used—and I don’t keep the same size for ten 
minutes together!’
	
‘Can’t remember WHAT things?’ said the Caterpil-
lar.
	
‘Well, I’ve tried to say “HOW DOTH THE LITTLE 
BUSY BEE,” but it all came different!’ Alice replied in a 
very melancholy voice.
	
‘Repeat, “YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,”’ 
said the Caterpillar.

if I’ve kept her waiting!’ Alice felt so desperate that she 
was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit 
came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, ‘If you 
please, sir—’ The Rabbit started violently, dropped the 
white kid gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the 
darkness as hard as he could go.
	
Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall 
was very hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she 
went on talking: ‘Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-
day! And yesterday things went on just as usual. I wonder 
if I’ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the 
same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can re-
member feeling a little different. But if I’m not the same, 
the next question is, Who in the world am I? Ah, THAT’S 
the great puzzle!’ And she began thinking over all the 
children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to 
see if she could have been changed for any of them.
	
‘I’m sure I’m not Ada,’ she said, ‘for her hair goes 
in such long ringlets, and mine doesn’t go in ringlets at 
all; and I’m sure I can’t be Mabel, for I know all sorts of 
things, and she, oh! she knows such a very little! Besides, 
SHE’S she, and I’m I, and—oh dear, how puzzling it all 
is! I’ll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let me 
see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thir-
teen, and four times seven is—oh dear! I shall never get 
to twenty at that rate! However, the Multiplication Table

doesn’t signify: let’s try Geography. London is the capital 
of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and Rome—no, 
THAT’S all wrong, I’m certain! I must have been changed 
for Mabel! I’ll try and say “How doth the little—”’ and she 
crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying les-
sons, and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse 
and strange, and the words did not come the same as they 
used to do:—
     ‘How doth the little crocodile
      Improve his shining tail,
     And pour the waters of the Nile
      On every golden scale!
     ‘How cheerfully he seems to grin,
      How neatly spread his claws,
     And welcome little fishes in
      With gently smiling jaws!’
‘I’m sure those are not the right words,’ said poor Alice, 
and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, ‘I 
must be Mabel after all, and I shall have to go and live 
in that poky little house, and have next to no toys to play 
with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I’ve made 
up my mind about it; if I’m Mabel, I’ll stay down here!

It’ll be no use their putting their heads down and 
saying “Come up again, dear!” I shall only look up and 
say “Who am I then? Tell me that first, and then, if I like 
being that person, I’ll come up: if not, I’ll stay down here 
till I’m somebody else”—but, oh dear!’ cried Alice, with a 
sudden burst of tears, ‘I do wish they WOULD put their 
heads down! I am so VERY tired of being all alone here!’
	
As she said this she looked down at her hands, and 
was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rab-
bit’s little white kid gloves while she was talking. ‘How 
CAN I have done that?’ she thought. ‘I must be growing 
small again.’ She got up and went to the table to mea-
sure herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could 
guess, she was now about two feet high, and was going 
on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the cause of 
this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hast-
ily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.
	
‘That WAS a narrow escape!’ said Alice, a good deal 
frightened at the sudden change, but very glad to find 
herself still in existence; ‘and now for the garden!’ and she 
ran with all speed back to the little door: but, alas! the 
little door was shut again, and the little golden key was 
lying on the glass table as before, ‘and things are worse 
than ever,’ thought the poor child, ‘for I never was so 
small as this before, never! And I declare it’s too bad, that 
it is!’
	
As she said these words her foot slipped, and in an-
other moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt wa-

ter. Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into 
the sea, ‘and in that case I can go back by railway,’ she 
said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in her 
life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wher-
ever you go to on the English coast you find a number of 
bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in the 
sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, 
and behind them a railway station.) However, she soon 
made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had 
wept when she was nine feet high.
	
‘I wish I hadn’t cried so much!’ said Alice, as she 
swam about, trying to find her way out. ‘I shall be pun-
ished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in my own 
tears! That WILL be a queer thing, to be sure! However, 
everything is queer to-day.’
	
Just then she heard something splashing about in 
the pool a little way off, and she swam nearer to make out 
what it was: at first she thought it must be a walrus or 
hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she 
was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse 
that had slipped in like herself.
	
‘Would it be of any use, now,’ thought Alice, ‘to 
speak to this mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way 
down here, that I should think very likely it can talk: 
at any rate, there’s no harm in trying.’ So she began: ‘O 
Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very 
tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!’ (Alice thought 
this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse: she

had never done such a thing before, but she remembered 
having seen in her brother’s Latin Grammar, ‘A mouse—
of a mouse—to a mouse—a mouse—O mouse!’) The Mouse 
looked at her rather inquisitively, and seemed to her to 
wink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing.
	
‘Perhaps it doesn’t understand English,’ thought 
Alice; ‘I daresay it’s a French mouse, come over with Wil-
liam the Conqueror.’ (For, with all her knowledge of his-
tory, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything 
had happened.) So she began again: ‘Ou est ma chatte?’ 
which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. 
The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water, and 
seemed to quiver all over with fright. ‘Oh, I beg your par-
don!’ cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor 
animal’s feelings. ‘I quite forgot you didn’t like cats.’
	
‘Not like cats!’ cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passion-
ate voice. ‘Would YOU like cats if you were me?’
	
‘Well, perhaps not,’ said Alice in a soothing tone: 
‘don’t be angry about it. And yet I wish I could show you 
our cat Dinah: I think you’d take a fancy to cats if you 
could only see her. She is such a dear quiet thing,’ Alice 
went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the 
pool, ‘and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her 
paws and washing her face—and she is such a nice soft 
thing to nurse—and she’s such a capital one for catching 
mice—oh, I beg your pardon!’ cried Alice again, for this

89
time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt certain 
it must be really offended. ‘We won’t talk about her any 
more if you’d rather not.’
	
‘We indeed!’ cried the Mouse, who was trembling 
down to the end of his tail. ‘As if I would talk on such a 
subject! Our family always HATED cats: nasty, low, vul-
gar things! Don’t let me hear the name again!’
	
‘I won’t indeed!’ said Alice, in a great hurry to 
change the subject of conversation. ‘Are you—are you 
fond—of—of dogs?’ The Mouse did not answer, so Alice 
went on eagerly: ‘There is such a nice little dog near our 
house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed ter-
rier, you know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And 
it’ll fetch things when you throw them, and it’ll sit up and 
beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things—I can’t remem-
ber half of them—and it belongs to a farmer, you know, 
and he says it’s so useful, it’s worth a hundred pounds! 
He says it kills all the rats and—oh dear!’ cried Alice in a 
sorrowful tone, ‘I’m afraid I’ve offended it again!’ For the 
Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could 
go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.
	
So she called softly after it, ‘Mouse dear! Do come 
back again, and we won’t talk about cats or dogs either, 
if you don’t like them!’ When the Mouse heard this, it 
turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face was 
quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a 
low trembling voice, ‘Let us get to the shore, and then I’ll 
tell you my history, and you’ll understand why it is I hate

cats and dogs.’
It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite 
crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into 
it: there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, 
and several other curious creatures. Alice led the way, 
and the whole party swam to the shore.

CHAPTER III. A Caucus-Race and 
a Long Tale
	
They were indeed a queer-looking party that as-
sembled on the bank—the birds with draggled feathers, 
the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all 
dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.
	
The first question of course was, how to get dry 
again: they had a consultation about this, and after a few 
minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself 
talking familiarly with them, as if she had known them 
all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with 
the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, ‘I 
am older than you, and must know better’; and this Alice 
would not allow without knowing how old it was, and, as 
the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no 
more to be said.
	
At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of 
authority among them, called out, ‘Sit down, all of you, 
and listen to me! I’LL soon make you dry enough!’ They 
all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse in the 
middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she 
felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry 
very soon.
	
‘Ahem!’ said the Mouse with an important air, ‘are 
you all ready? This is the driest thing I know. Silence all

round, if you please! “William the Conqueror, whose cause 
was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted to by the 
English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much 
accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Mor-
car, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria—”’
	
‘Ugh!’ said the Lory, with a shiver.
	
‘I beg your pardon!’ said the Mouse, frowning, but 
very politely: ‘Did you speak?’
	
‘Not I!’ said the Lory hastily.
	
‘I thought you did,’ said the Mouse. ‘—I proceed. 
“Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, 
declared for him: and even Stigand, the patriotic arch-
bishop of Canterbury, found it advisable—”’
	
‘Found WHAT?’ said the Duck.
	
‘Found IT,’ the Mouse replied rather crossly: ‘of 
course you know what “it” means.’
	
‘I know what “it” means well enough, when I find a 
thing,’ said the Duck: ‘it’s generally a frog or a worm. The 
question is, what did the archbishop find?’
	
The Mouse did not notice this question, but hur-
riedly went on, ‘”—found it advisable to go with Edgar 
Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown. Wil-
liam’s conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence of 
his Normans—” How are you getting on now, my dear?’ it 
continued, turning to Alice as it spoke.
	
‘As wet as ever,’ said Alice in a melancholy tone: ‘it

doesn’t seem to dry me at all.’
	
‘In that case,’ said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its 
feet, ‘I move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate 
adoption of more energetic remedies—’
	
‘Speak English!’ said the Eaglet. ‘I don’t know the 
meaning of half those long words, and, what’s more, I 
don’t believe you do either!’ And the Eaglet bent down its 
head to hide a smile: some of the other birds tittered audi-
bly.
	
‘What I was going to say,’ said the Dodo in an of-
fended tone, ‘was, that the best thing to get us dry would 
be a Caucus-race.’
	
‘What IS a Caucus-race?’ said Alice; not that she 
wanted much to know, but the Dodo had paused as if it 
thought that SOMEBODY ought to speak, and no one else 
seemed inclined to say anything.
	
‘Why,’ said the Dodo, ‘the best way to explain it is 
to do it.’ (And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, 
some winter day, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.)
	
First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, 
(‘the exact shape doesn’t matter,’ it said,) and then all the 
party were placed along the course, here and there. There 
was no ‘One, two, three, and away,’ but they began run-
ning when they liked, and left off when they liked, so that 
it was not easy to know when the race was over. However, 
when they had been running half an hour or so, and were 
quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called out ‘The race is

over!’ and they all crowded round it, panting, and asking, 
‘But who has won?’
	
This question the Dodo could not answer without a 
great deal of thought, and it sat for a long time with one 
finger pressed upon its forehead (the position in which 
you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures of him), 
while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo said, 
‘EVERYBODY has won, and all must have prizes.’
	
‘But who is to give the prizes?’ quite a chorus of 
voices asked.
	
‘Why, SHE, of course,’ said the Dodo, pointing to 
Alice with one finger; and the whole party at once crowded 
round her, calling out in a confused way, ‘Prizes! Prizes!’
	
Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put 
her hand in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, 
(luckily the salt water had not got into it), and handed 
them round as prizes. There was exactly one a-piece all 
round.
	
‘But she must have a prize herself, you know,’ said 
the Mouse.
	
‘Of course,’ the Dodo replied very gravely. ‘What 
else have you got in your pocket?’ he went on, turning to 
Alice.
	
‘Only a thimble,’ said Alice sadly.
	
‘Hand it over here,’ said the Dodo.
	
Then they all crowded round her once more, while 
krismadden.com

95
the Dodo solemnly presented the thimble, saying ‘We beg 
your acceptance of this elegant thimble’; and, when it had 
finished this short speech, they all cheered.
	
Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they 
all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as 
she could not think of anything to say, she simply bowed, 
and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she could.
	
The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused 
some noise and confusion, as the large birds complained 
that they could not taste theirs, and the small ones 
choked and had to be patted on the back. However, it 
was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and 
begged the Mouse to tell them something more.
	
‘You promised to tell me your history, you know,’ 
said Alice, ‘and why it is you hate—C and D,’ she added in 
a whisper, half afraid that it would be offended again.
	
‘Mine is a long and a sad tale!’ said the Mouse, 
turning to Alice, and sighing.
	
‘It IS a long tail, certainly,’ said Alice, looking down 
with wonder at the Mouse’s tail; ‘but why do you call it 
sad?’ And she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse 
was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was something 
like this:—
         ‘Fury said to a
         mouse, That he

       cur, “Such

       “I’ll be

            Said
         cunning
          old Fury:

           condemn
           you
          to
           death.”’
	
‘You are not attending!’ said the Mouse to Alice se-
verely. ‘What are you thinking of?’
	
‘I beg your pardon,’ said Alice very humbly: ‘you 
had got to the fifth bend, I think?’

‘I had NOT!’ cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.
	
‘A knot!’ said Alice, always ready to make herself 
useful, and looking anxiously about her. ‘Oh, do let me 
help to undo it!’
	
‘I shall do nothing of the sort,’ said the Mouse, get-
ting up and walking away. ‘You insult me by talking such 
nonsense!’
	
‘I didn’t mean it!’ pleaded poor Alice. ‘But you’re so 
easily offended, you know!’
	
The Mouse only growled in reply.
	
‘Please come back and finish your story!’ Alice 
called after it; and the others all joined in chorus, ‘Yes, 
please do!’ but the Mouse only shook its head impatiently, 
and walked a little quicker.
	
‘What a pity it wouldn’t stay!’ sighed the Lory, as 
soon as it was quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the 
opportunity of saying to her daughter ‘Ah, my dear! Let 
this be a lesson to you never to lose YOUR temper!’ ‘Hold 
your tongue, Ma!’ said the young Crab, a little snappishly. 
‘You’re enough to try the patience of an oyster!’
	
‘I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!’ said 
Alice aloud, addressing nobody in particular. ‘She’d soon 
fetch it back!’
	
‘And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the 
question?’ said the Lory.
	
Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to

talk about her pet: ‘Dinah’s our cat. And she’s such a capi-
tal one for catching mice you can’t think! And oh, I wish 
you could see her after the birds! Why, she’ll eat a little 
bird as soon as look at it!’
	
This speech caused a remarkable sensation among 
the party. Some of the birds hurried off at once: one old 
Magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully, remark-
ing, ‘I really must be getting home; the night-air doesn’t 
suit my throat!’ and a Canary called out in a trembling 
voice to its children, ‘Come away, my dears! It’s high time 
you were all in bed!’ On various pretexts they all moved 
off, and Alice was soon left alone.
	
‘I wish I hadn’t mentioned Dinah!’ she said to her-
self in a melancholy tone. ‘Nobody seems to like her, down 
here, and I’m sure she’s the best cat in the world! Oh, my 
dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you any more!’ 
And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very 
lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she 
again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance, 
and she looked up eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse 
had changed his mind, and was coming back to finish his 
story.

CHAPTER IV. The Rabbit Sends 
in a Little Bill
	
It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back 
again, and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had 
lost something; and she heard it muttering to itself ‘The 
Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur and 
whiskers! She’ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are 
ferrets! Where CAN I have dropped them, I wonder?’ Alice 
guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and 
the pair of white kid gloves, and she very good-naturedly 
began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere to 
be seen—everything seemed to have changed since her 
swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table 
and the little door, had vanished completely.
	
Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went 
hunting about, and called out to her in an angry tone, 
‘Why, Mary Ann, what ARE you doing out here? Run 
home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a 
fan! Quick, now!’ And Alice was so much frightened that 
she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without 
trying to explain the mistake it had made.
	
‘He took me for his housemaid,’ she said to herself 
as she ran. ‘How surprised he’ll be when he finds out who 
I am! But I’d better take him his fan and gloves—that is, 
if I can find them.’ As she said this, she came upon a neat 
little house, on the door of which was a bright brass plate 
with the name ‘W. RABBIT’ engraved upon it. She went 
krismadden.com

101
in without knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear 
lest she should meet the real Mary Ann, and be turned 
out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves.
	
‘How queer it seems,’ Alice said to herself, ‘to be 
going messages for a rabbit! I suppose Dinah’ll be sending 
me on messages next!’ And she began fancying the sort of 
thing that would happen: ‘”Miss Alice! Come here directly, 
and get ready for your walk!” “Coming in a minute, nurse! 
But I’ve got to see that the mouse doesn’t get out.” Only I 
don’t think,’ Alice went on, ‘that they’d let Dinah stop in 
the house if it began ordering people about like that!’
	
By this time she had found her way into a tidy 
little room with a table in the window, and on it (as she 
had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid 
gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves, and 
was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a 
little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was 
no label this time with the words ‘DRINK ME,’ but nev-
ertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips. ‘I know 
SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,’ she said to 
herself, ‘whenever I eat or drink anything; so I’ll just see 
what this bottle does. I do hope it’ll make me grow large 
again, for really I’m quite tired of being such a tiny little 
thing!’
	
It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had ex-
pected: before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her 
head pressing against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save 
her neck from being broken. She hastily put down the bot-

102
tle, saying to herself ‘That’s quite enough—I hope I shan’t 
grow any more—As it is, I can’t get out at the door—I do 
wish I hadn’t drunk quite so much!’
	
Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on 
growing, and growing, and very soon had to kneel down 
on the floor: in another minute there was not even room 
for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with one el-
bow against the door, and the other arm curled round her 
head. Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, 
she put one arm out of the window, and one foot up the 
chimney, and said to herself ‘Now I can do no more, what-
ever happens. What WILL become of me?’
	
Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now 
had its full effect, and she grew no larger: still it was 
very uncomfortable, and, as there seemed to be no sort of 
chance of her ever getting out of the room again, no won-
der she felt unhappy.
	
‘It was much pleasanter at home,’ thought poor Al-
ice, ‘when one wasn’t always growing larger and smaller, 
and being ordered about by mice and rabbits. I almost 
wish I hadn’t gone down that rabbit-hole—and yet—and 
yet—it’s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do 
wonder what CAN have happened to me! When I used to 
read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing never hap-
pened, and now here I am in the middle of one! There 
ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! 
And when I grow up, I’ll write one—but I’m grown up 
now,’ she added in a sorrowful tone; ‘at least there’s no 
krismadden.com

103
room to grow up any more HERE.’
	
‘But then,’ thought Alice, ‘shall I NEVER get any 
older than I am now? That’ll be a comfort, one way—never 
to be an old woman—but then—always to have lessons to 
learn! Oh, I shouldn’t like THAT!’
	
‘Oh, you foolish Alice!’ she answered herself. ‘How 
can you learn lessons in here? Why, there’s hardly room 
for YOU, and no room at all for any lesson-books!’
	
And so she went on, taking first one side and then 
the other, and making quite a conversation of it altogeth-
er; but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside, and 
stopped to listen.
	
‘Mary Ann! Mary Ann!’ said the voice. ‘Fetch me my 
gloves this moment!’ Then came a little pattering of feet 
on the stairs. Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look 
for her, and she trembled till she shook the house, quite 
forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as 
large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.
	
Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried 
to open it; but, as the door opened inwards, and Alice’s 
elbow was pressed hard against it, that attempt proved a 
failure. Alice heard it say to itself ‘Then I’ll go round and 
get in at the window.’
	
‘THAT you won’t’ thought Alice, and, after wait-
ing till she fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the 
window, she suddenly spread out her hand, and made a 
snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything, but

104
she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken 
glass, from which she concluded that it was just possible 
it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something of the 
sort.
	
Next came an angry voice—the Rabbit’s—’Pat! Pat! 
Where are you?’ And then a voice she had never heard be-
fore, ‘Sure then I’m here! Digging for apples, yer honour!’
	
‘Digging for apples, indeed!’ said the Rabbit angrily. 
‘Here! Come and help me out of THIS!’ (Sounds of more 
broken glass.)
	
‘Now tell me, Pat, what’s that in the window?’
	
‘Sure, it’s an arm, yer honour!’ (He pronounced it 
‘arrum.’)
	
‘An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? 
Why, it fills the whole window!’
	
‘Sure, it does, yer honour: but it’s an arm for all 
that.’
	
‘Well, it’s got no business there, at any rate: go and 
take it away!’
	
There was a long silence after this, and Alice could 
only hear whispers now and then; such as, ‘Sure, I don’t 
like it, yer honour, at all, at all!’ ‘Do as I tell you, you cow-
ard!’ and at last she spread out her hand again, and made 
another snatch in the air. This time there were TWO little 
shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. ‘What a num-
ber of cucumber-frames there must be!’ thought Alice. ‘I

105
wonder what they’ll do next! As for pulling me out of the 
window, I only wish they COULD! I’m sure I don’t want to 
stay in here any longer!’
	
She waited for some time without hearing anything 
more: at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and 
the sound of a good many voices all talking together: she 
made out the words: ‘Where’s the other ladder?—Why, I 
hadn’t to bring but one; Bill’s got the other—Bill! fetch it 
here, lad!—Here, put ‘em up at this corner—No, tie ‘em 
together first—they don’t reach half high enough yet—
Oh! they’ll do well enough; don’t be particular—Here, 
Bill! catch hold of this rope—Will the roof bear?—Mind 
that loose slate—Oh, it’s coming down! Heads below!’ (a 
loud crash)—’Now, who did that?—It was Bill, I fancy—
Who’s to go down the chimney?—Nay, I shan’t! YOU do 
it!—That I won’t, then!—Bill’s to go down—Here, Bill! the 
master says you’re to go down the chimney!’
	
‘Oh! So Bill’s got to come down the chimney, has 
he?’ said Alice to herself. ‘Shy, they seem to put every-
thing upon Bill! I wouldn’t be in Bill’s place for a good 
deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but I THINK I 
can kick a little!’
	
She drew her foot as far down the chimney as 
she could, and waited till she heard a little animal (she 
couldn’t guess of what sort it was) scratching and scram-
bling about in the chimney close above her: then, saying 
to herself ‘This is Bill,’ she gave one sharp kick, and wait-
ed to see what would happen next.

106
	
The first thing she heard was a general chorus of 
‘There goes Bill!’ then the Rabbit’s voice along—’Catch 
him, you by the hedge!’ then silence, and then another 
confusion of voices—’Hold up his head—Brandy now—
Don’t choke him—How was it, old fellow? What happened 
to you? Tell us all about it!’
	
Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (‘That’s 
Bill,’ thought Alice,) ‘Well, I hardly know—No more, 
thank ye; I’m better now—but I’m a deal too flustered 
to tell you—all I know is, something comes at me like a 
Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!’
	
‘So you did, old fellow!’ said the others.
	
‘We must burn the house down!’ said the Rabbit’s 
voice; and Alice called out as loud as she could, ‘If you do. 
I’ll set Dinah at you!’
	
There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice 
thought to herself, ‘I wonder what they WILL do next! 
If they had any sense, they’d take the roof off.’ After a 
minute or two, they began moving about again, and Alice 
heard the Rabbit say, ‘A barrowful will do, to begin with.’
	
‘A barrowful of WHAT?’ thought Alice; but she had 
not long to doubt, for the next moment a shower of little 
pebbles came rattling in at the window, and some of them 
hit her in the face. ‘I’ll put a stop to this,’ she said to her-
self, and shouted out, ‘You’d better not do that again!’ 
which produced another dead silence.
krismadden.com

107
	
Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles 
were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, 
and a bright idea came into her head. ‘If I eat one of these 
cakes,’ she thought, ‘it’s sure to make SOME change in 
my size; and as it can’t possibly make me larger, it must 
make me smaller, I suppose.’
	
So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was de-
lighted to find that she began shrinking directly. As soon 
as she was small enough to get through the door, she ran 
out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little animals 
and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, was 
in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were 
giving it something out of a bottle. They all made a rush 
at Alice the moment she appeared; but she ran off as hard 
as she could, and soon found herself safe in a thick wood.
	
‘The first thing I’ve got to do,’ said Alice to herself, 
as she wandered about in the wood, ‘is to grow to my right 
size again; and the second thing is to find my way into 
that lovely garden. I think that will be the best plan.’
	
It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very 
neatly and simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that 
she had not the smallest idea how to set about it; and 
while she was peering about anxiously among the trees, a 
little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a 
great hurry.
	
An enormous puppy was looking down at her with 
large round eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, try-
ing to touch her. ‘Poor little thing!’ said Alice, in a coaxing

108
tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but she was terri-
bly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be 
hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up 
in spite of all her coaxing.
	
Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little 
bit of stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the 
puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once, with a 
yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick, and made believe 
to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle, to 
keep herself from being run over; and the moment she 
appeared on the other side, the puppy made another rush 
at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to 
get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very like having 
a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every mo-
ment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle 
again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at 
the stick, running a very little way forwards each time 
and a long way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, 
till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with its 
tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half 
shut.
	
This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for mak-
ing her escape; so she set off at once, and ran till she was 
quite tired and out of breath, and till the puppy’s bark 
sounded quite faint in the distance.
	
‘And yet what a dear little puppy it was!’ said Al-
ice, as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and 
fanned herself with one of the leaves: ‘I should have liked

teaching it tricks very much, if—if I’d only been the right 
size to do it! Oh dear! I’d nearly forgotten that I’ve got to 
grow up again! Let me see—how IS it to be managed? I 
suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but 
the great question is, what?’
	
The great question certainly was, what? Alice 
looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of 
grass, but she did not see anything that looked like the 
right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances. There 
was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same 
height as herself; and when she had looked under it, and 
on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her that 
she might as well look and see what was on the top of it.
	
She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over 
the edge of the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met 
those of a large caterpillar, that was sitting on the top 
with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah, and 
taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else.

CHAPTER V. Advice from a 	
Caterpillar
	
The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other 
for some time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the 
hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, 
sleepy voice.
	
‘Who are YOU?’ said the Caterpillar.
	
This was not an encouraging opening for a conver-
sation. Alice replied, rather shyly, ‘I—I hardly know, sir, 
just at present—at least I know who I WAS when I got up 
this morning, but I think I must have been changed sev-
eral times since then.’
	
‘What do you mean by that?’ said the Caterpillar 
sternly. ‘Explain yourself!’
	
‘I can’t explain MYSELF, I’m afraid, sir’ said Alice, 
‘because I’m not myself, you see.’
	
‘I don’t see,’ said the Caterpillar.
	
‘I’m afraid I can’t put it more clearly,’ Alice replied 
very politely, ‘for I can’t understand it myself to begin 
with; and being so many different sizes in a day is very 
confusing.’
	
‘It isn’t,’ said the Caterpillar.
	
‘Well, perhaps you haven’t found it so yet,’ said Al-
ice; ‘but when you have to turn into a chrysalis—you will

111
some day, you know—and then after that into a butterfly, 
I should think you’ll feel it a little queer, won’t you?’
	
‘Not a bit,’ said the Caterpillar.
	
‘Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,’ said 
Alice; ‘all I know is, it would feel very queer to ME.’
	
‘You!’ said the Caterpillar contemptuously. ‘Who 
are YOU?’
	
Which brought them back again to the beginning of 
the conversation. Alice felt a little irritated at the Cater-
pillar’s making such VERY short remarks, and she drew 
herself up and said, very gravely, ‘I think, you ought to 
tell me who YOU are, first.’
	
‘Why?’ said the Caterpillar.
	
Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice 
could not think of any good reason, and as the Caterpil-
lar seemed to be in a VERY unpleasant state of mind, she 
turned away.
	
‘Come back!’ the Caterpillar called after her. ‘I’ve 
something important to say!’
	
This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned 
and came back again.
	
‘Keep your temper,’ said the Caterpillar.
	
‘Is that all?’ said Alice, swallowing down her anger 
as well as she could.
	
‘No,’ said the Caterpillar.

Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had 
nothing else to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her 
something worth hearing. For some minutes it puffed 
away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its arms, 
took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, ‘So you 
think you’re changed, do you?’
	
‘I’m afraid I am, sir,’ said Alice; ‘I can’t remember 
things as I used—and I don’t keep the same size for ten 
minutes together!’
	
‘Can’t remember WHAT things?’ said the Caterpil-
lar.
	
‘Well, I’ve tried to say “HOW DOTH THE LITTLE 
BUSY BEE,” but it all came different!’ Alice replied in a 
very melancholy voice.
	
‘Repeat, “YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,”’ 
said the Caterpillar.

    What made you so awfully clever?’
   ‘I have answered three questions, and that is 
enough,’
    Said his father; ‘don’t give yourself airs!
   Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?
    Be off, or I’ll kick you down stairs!’
	
‘That is not said right,’ said the Caterpillar.
	
‘Not QUITE right, I’m afraid,’ said Alice, tim-
idly; ‘some of the words have got altered.’
	
‘It is wrong from beginning to end,’ said the 
Caterpillar decidedly, and there was silence for 
some minutes.
	
The Caterpillar was the first to speak.
	
‘What size do you want to be?’ it asked.
	
‘Oh, I’m not particular as to size,’ Alice hast-
ily replied; ‘only one doesn’t like changing so often, 
you know.’
	
‘I DON’T know,’ said the Caterpillar.
	
Alice said nothing: she had never been so 
much contradicted in her life before, and she felt 
that she was losing her temper.
	
‘Are you content now?’ said the Caterpillar.
	
‘Well, I should like to be a LITTLE larger, sir, 
if you wouldn’t mind,’ said Alice: ‘three inches is 
krismadden.com

119
such a wretched height to be.’
	
‘It is a very good height indeed!’ said the Cat-
erpillar angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke 
(it was exactly three inches high).
	
‘But I’m not used to it!’ pleaded poor Alice in a 
piteous tone. And she thought of herself, ‘I wish the 
creatures wouldn’t be so easily offended!’
	
‘You’ll get used to it in time,’ said the Cater-
pillar; and it put the hookah into its mouth and be-
gan smoking again.
	
This time Alice waited patiently until it chose 
to speak again. In a minute or two the Caterpillar 
took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once 
or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the 
mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely 
remarking as it went, ‘One side will make you grow 
taller, and the other side will make you grow short-
er.’
	
‘One side of WHAT? The other side of 
WHAT?’ thought Alice to herself.
	
‘Of the mushroom,’ said the Caterpillar, just 
as if she had asked it aloud; and in another moment 
it was out of sight.
	
Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the 
mushroom for a minute, trying to make out which 
were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly 
round, she found this a very difficult question.

However, at last she stretched her arms round it as 
far as they would go, and broke off a bit of the edge 
with each hand.
	
‘And now which is which?’ she said to herself, 
and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to try the 
effect: the next moment she felt a violent blow un-
derneath her chin: it had struck her foot!
	
She was a good deal frightened by this very 
sudden change, but she felt that there was no time 
to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she set 
to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her 
chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that 
there was hardly room to open her mouth; but she 
did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of 
the lefthand bit.
	
‘Come, my head’s free at last!’ said Alice in a 
tone of delight, which changed into alarm in anoth-
er moment, when she found that her shoulders were 
nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she 
looked down, was an immense length of neck, which 
seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green 
leaves that lay far below her.
	
‘What CAN all that green stuff be?’ said Al-
ice. ‘And where HAVE my shoulders got to? And 
oh, my poor hands, how is it I can’t see you?’ She 
was moving them about as she spoke, but no result 
seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the 
distant green leaves.

As there seemed to be no chance of getting 
her hands up to her head, she tried to get her head 
down to them, and was delighted to find that her 
neck would bend about easily in any direction, 
like a serpent. She had just succeeded in curving it 
down into a graceful zigzag, and was going to dive 
in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing 
but the tops of the trees under which she had been 
wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back 
in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, 
and was beating her violently with its wings.
	
‘Serpent!’ screamed the Pigeon.
	
‘I’m NOT a serpent!’ said Alice indignantly. 
‘Let me alone!’
	
‘Serpent, I say again!’ repeated the Pigeon, but 
in a more subdued tone, and added with a kind of 
sob, ‘I’ve tried every way, and nothing seems to suit 
them!’
	
‘I haven’t the least idea what you’re talking 
about,’ said Alice.
	
‘I’ve tried the roots of trees, and I’ve tried 
banks, and I’ve tried hedges,’ the Pigeon went 
on, without attending to her; ‘but those serpents! 
There’s no pleasing them!’
	
Alice was more and more puzzled, but she 
thought there was no use in saying anything more 
till the Pigeon had finished.

‘As if it wasn’t trouble enough hatching the 
eggs,’ said the Pigeon; ‘but I must be on the look-out 
for serpents night and day! Why, I haven’t had a 
wink of sleep these three weeks!’
 
‘I’m very sorry you’ve been annoyed,’ said Al-
ice, who was beginning to see its meaning.
 
‘And just as I’d taken the highest tree in the 
wood,’ continued the Pigeon, raising its voice to a 
shriek, ‘and just as I was thinking I should be free 
of them at last, they must needs come wriggling 
down from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!’
 
‘But I’m NOT a serpent, I tell you!’ said Alice. 
‘I’m a—I’m a—
 
‘Well! WHAT are you?’ said the Pigeon. ‘I can 
see you’re trying to invent something!’
 
‘I—I’m a little girl,’ said Alice, rather doubt-
fully, as she remembered the number of changes 
she had gone through that day.

‘A likely story indeed!’ said the Pigeon in a 
tone of the deepest contempt. ‘I’ve seen a good many 
little girls in my time, but never ONE with such a 
neck as that! No, no! You’re a serpent; and there’s 
no use denying it. I suppose you’ll be telling me 
next that you never tasted an egg!’
 
‘I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,’ said Alice, 
who was a very truthful child; ‘but little girls eat 
eggs quite as much as serpents do, you know.’
 
‘I don’t believe it,’ said the Pigeon; ‘but if they 
do, why then they’re a kind of serpent, that’s all I 
can say.’
 
This was such a new idea to Alice, that she 
was quite silent for a minute or two, which gave 
the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, ‘You’re look-
ing for eggs, I know THAT well enough; and what 
does it matter to me whether you’re a little girl or a 
serpent?’
 
‘It matters a good deal to ME,’ said Alice hast-
ily; ‘but I’m not looking for eggs, as it happens; and 
if I was, I shouldn’t want YOURS: I don’t like them 
raw.’
 
‘Well, be off, then!’ said the Pigeon in a sulky 
tone, as it settled down again into its nest. Alice 
crouched down among the trees as well as she could, 
for her neck kept getting entangled among the 
branches, and every now and then she had to stop

and untwist it. After a while she remembered that 
she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, 
and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at 
one and then at the other, and growing sometimes 
taller and sometimes shorter, until she had succeed-
ed in bringing herself down to her usual height.
 
It was so long since she had been anything 
near the right size, that it felt quite strange at 
first; but she got used to it in a few minutes, and 
began talking to herself, as usual. ‘Come, there’s 
half my plan done now! How puzzling all these 
changes are! I’m never sure what I’m going to be, 
from one minute to another! However, I’ve got back 
to my right size: the next thing is, to get into that 
beautiful garden—how IS that to be done, I won-
der?’ As she said this, she came suddenly upon an 
open place, with a little house in it about four feet 
high. ‘Whoever lives there,’ thought Alice, ‘it’ll nev-
er do to come upon them THIS size: why, I should 
frighten them out of their wits!’ So she began nib-
bling at the righthand bit again, and did not ven-
ture to go near the house till she had brought her-
self down to nine inches high.
 
For a minute or two she stood looking at the 
house, and wondering what to do next, when sud-
denly a footman in livery came running out of the 
wood—(she considered him to be a footman because 
he was in livery: otherwise, judging by his face 
krismadden.com

125
only, she would have called him a fish)—and rapped 
loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened 
by another footman in livery, with a round face, 
and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen, Al-
ice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over 
their heads. She felt very curious to know what it 
was all about, and crept a little way out of the wood 
to listen.
 
The Fish-Footman began by producing from 
under his arm a great letter, nearly as large as him-
self, and this he handed over to the other, saying, 
in a solemn tone, ‘For the Duchess. An invitation 
from the Queen to play croquet.’ The Frog-Footman 
repeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing 
the order of the words a little, ‘From the Queen. An 
invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.’
 
Then they both bowed low, and their curls got 
entangled together.
 
Alice laughed so much at this, that she had 
to run back into the wood for fear of their hear-
ing her; and when she next peeped out the Fish-
Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the 
ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the 
sky.
 
Alice went timidly up to the door, and 
knocked.
 
‘There’s no sort of use in knocking,’ said the 
krismadden.com
Learn To Speed Read

Learn To Speed Read
126
Footman, ‘and that for two reasons. First, because 
I’m on the same side of the door as you are; sec-
ondly, because they’re making such a noise inside, 
no one could possibly hear you.’ And certainly there 
was a most extraordinary noise going on within—a 
constant howling and sneezing, and every now and 
then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been 
broken to pieces.
 
‘Please, then,’ said Alice, ‘how am I to get in?’
 
‘There might be some sense in your knocking,’ 
the Footman went on without attending to her, ‘if 
we had the door between us. For instance, if you 
were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let you 
out, you know.’ He was looking up into the sky all 
the time he was speaking, and this Alice thought 
decidedly uncivil. ‘But perhaps he can’t help it,’ she 
said to herself; ‘his eyes are so VERY nearly at the 
top of his head. But at any rate he might answer 
questions.—How am I to get in?’ she repeated, aloud.
 
‘I shall sit here,’ the Footman remarked, ‘till 
tomorrow—’
 
At this moment the door of the house opened, 
and a large plate came skimming out, straight at 
the Footman’s head: it just grazed his nose, and 
broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.
 
‘—or next day, maybe,’ the Footman contin-
ued in the same tone, exactly as if nothing had hap-
krismadden.com

127
pened.
 
‘How am I to get in?’ asked Alice again, in a 
louder tone.
 
‘ARE you to get in at all?’ said the Footman. 
‘That’s the first question, you know.’
 
It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be 
told so. ‘It’s really dreadful,’ she muttered to her-
self, ‘the way all the creatures argue. It’s enough to 
drive one crazy!’
 
The Footman seemed to think this a good op-
portunity for repeating his remark, with variations. 
‘I shall sit here,’ he said, ‘on and off, for days and 
days.’
 
‘But what am I to do?’ said Alice.
 
‘Anything you like,’ said the Footman, and be-
gan whistling.
 
‘Oh, there’s no use in talking to him,’ said 
Alice desperately: ‘he’s perfectly idiotic!’ And she 
opened the door and went in.
 
The door led right into a large kitchen, which 
was full of smoke from one end to the other: the 
Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in the 
middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over 
the fire, stirring a large cauldron which seemed to 
be full of soup.

‘There’s certainly too much pepper in that 
soup!’ Alice said to herself, as well as she could for 
sneezing.
 
There was certainly too much of it in the air. 
Even the Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for 
the baby, it was sneezing and howling alternately 
without a moment’s pause. The only things in the 
kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a 
large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grin-
ning from ear to ear.
 
‘Please would you tell me,’ said Alice, a little 
timidly, for she was not quite sure whether it was 
good manners for her to speak first, ‘why your cat 
grins like that?’
 
‘It’s a Cheshire cat,’ said the Duchess, ‘and 
that’s why. Pig!’
 
She said the last word with such sudden vio-
lence that Alice quite jumped; but she saw in an-

other moment that it was addressed to the baby, 
and not to her, so she took courage, and went on 
again:—
 
‘I didn’t know that Cheshire cats always 
grinned; in fact, I didn’t know that cats COULD 
grin.’
 
‘They all can,’ said the Duchess; ‘and most of 
‘em do.’
 
‘I don’t know of any that do,’ Alice said very 
politely, feeling quite pleased to have got into a 
conversation.
 
‘You don’t know much,’ said the Duchess; ‘and 
that’s a fact.’
 
Alice did not at all like the tone of this re-
mark, and thought it would be as well to introduce 
some other subject of conversation. While she was 
trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of 
soup off the fire, and at once set to work throwing 
everything within her reach at the Duchess and 
the baby—the fire-irons came first; then followed a 
shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duch-
ess took no notice of them even when they hit her; 
and the baby was howling so much already, that it 
was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt 
it or not.
 
‘Oh, PLEASE mind what you’re doing!’ cried 
Alice, jumping up and down in an agony of terror.

‘Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS nose’; as an unusu-
ally large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly 
carried it off.
 
‘If everybody minded their own business,’ the 
Duchess said in a hoarse growl, ‘the world would go 
round a deal faster than it does.’
 
‘Which would NOT be an advantage,’ said 
Alice, who felt very glad to get an opportunity of 
showing off a little of her knowledge. ‘Just think of 
what work it would make with the day and night! 
You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn 
round on its axis—’
 
‘Talking of axes,’ said the Duchess, ‘chop off 
her head!’
 
Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to 
see if she meant to take the hint; but the cook was 
busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to be lis-
tening, so she went on again: ‘Twenty-four hours, I 
THINK; or is it twelve? I—’
 
‘Oh, don’t bother ME,’ said the Duchess; ‘I 
never could abide figures!’ And with that she began 
nursing her child again, singing a sort of lullaby to 
it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at the 
end of every line:
   ‘Speak roughly to your little boy,
    And beat him when he sneezes:
krismadden.com

131
   He only does it to annoy,
    Because he knows it teases.’
CHORUS.
 (In which the cook and the baby joined):—
‘Wow! wow! wow!’
 
While the Duchess sang the second verse of 
the song, she kept tossing the baby violently up and 
down, and the poor little thing howled so, that Alice 
could hardly hear the words:—
   ‘I speak severely to my boy,
    I beat him when he sneezes;
   For he can thoroughly enjoy
    The pepper when he pleases!’
CHORUS.
‘Wow! wow! wow!’
 
‘Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!’ the 
Duchess said to Alice, flinging the baby at her as 
she spoke. ‘I must go and get ready to play croquet 
with the Queen,’ and she hurried out of the room. 
The cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went 
out, but it just missed her.
 
Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, 
as it was a queer-shaped little creature, and held

out its arms and legs in all directions, ‘just like a 
star-fish,’ thought Alice. The poor little thing was 
snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, 
and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself 
out again, so that altogether, for the first minute or 
two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.
 
As soon as she had made out the proper way 
of nursing it, (which was to twist it up into a sort 
of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right ear 
and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) 
she carried it out into the open air. ‘IF I don’t take 
this child away with me,’ thought Alice, ‘they’re 
sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn’t it be murder 
to leave it behind?’ She said the last words out loud, 
and the little thing grunted in reply (it had left 
off sneezing by this time). ‘Don’t grunt,’ said Alice; 
‘that’s not at all a proper way of expressing your-
self.’
 
The baby grunted again, and Alice looked 
very anxiously into its face to see what was the 
matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had 
a VERY turn-up nose, much more like a snout than 
a real nose; also its eyes were getting extremely 
small for a baby: altogether Alice did not like the 
look of the thing at all. ‘But perhaps it was only 
sobbing,’ she thought, and looked into its eyes 
again, to see if there were any tears.
 
No, there were no tears. ‘If you’re going to

turn into a pig, my dear,’ said Alice, seriously, ‘I’ll 
have nothing more to do with you. Mind now!’ The 
poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was 
impossible to say which), and they went on for some 
while in silence.
 
Alice was just beginning to think to herself, 
‘Now, what am I to do with this creature when I get 
it home?’ when it grunted again, so violently, that 
she looked down into its face in some alarm. This 
time there could be NO mistake about it: it was nei-
ther more nor less than a pig, and she felt that it 
would be quite absurd for her to carry it further.
 
So she set the little creature down, and felt 
quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the 
wood. ‘If it had grown up,’ she said to herself, ‘it 
would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it 
makes rather a handsome pig, I think.’ And she 
began thinking over other children she knew, who 
might do very well as pigs, and was just saying to 
herself, ‘if one only knew the right way to change 
them—’ when she was a little startled by seeing 
the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few 
yards off. 
 
The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It 
looked good-natured, she thought: still it had VERY

long claws and a great many teeth, so 
she felt that it ought to be treated with respect.
 
‘Cheshire Puss,’ she began, rather 
timidly, as she did not at all know whether it would 
like the name: however, it only grinned 
a little wider. ‘Come, it’s pleased so far,’ thought 
Alice, and she went on. ‘Would you tell 
me, please, which way I ought to go from here?’
 
‘That depends a good deal on where 
you want to get to,’ said the Cat.
 
‘I don’t much care where—’ said Al-

‘Then it doesn’t matter which way 
you go,’ said the Cat.

added as an explanation.
 
‘Oh, you’re sure to do that,’ said the 
Cat, ‘if you only walk long enough.’

135
 
Alice felt that this could not be 
denied, so she tried another question. ‘What sort of 
people live about here?’
 
‘In THAT direction,’ the Cat said, waving its 
right paw round, ‘lives a Hatter: and 
in THAT direction,’ waving the other paw, ‘lives a 
March Hare. Visit either you like: they’re 
both mad.’
 
‘But I don’t want to go among mad 
people,’ Alice remarked.
 
‘Oh, you can’t help that,’ said the 
Cat: ‘we’re all mad here. I’m mad. You’re mad.’
 
‘How do you know I’m mad?’ said  
 
Alice.
 
‘You must be,’ said the Cat, ‘or you 
wouldn’t have come here.’
 
Alice didn’t think that proved it 
at all; however, she went on ‘And how do you know 
that you’re mad?’
 
‘To begin with,’ said the Cat, ‘a dog’s not mad. 
You grant that?’
 
‘I suppose so,’ said Alice.
 
‘Well, then,’ the Cat went on, ‘you 
see, a dog growls when it’s angry, and wags its tail 
when it’s pleased. Now I growl when I’m 
pleased, and wag my tail when I’m angry. Therefore

I’m mad.’
 
‘I call it purring, not growling,’ said Alice.
 
‘Call it what you like,’ said the Cat. 
‘Do you play croquet with the Queen to-day?’
 
‘I should like it very much,’ said  
Alice, ‘but I haven’t been invited yet.’
 
‘You’ll see me there,’ said the Cat, 
and vanished.
 
Alice was not much surprised at 
this, she was getting so used to queer things hap-
pening. While she was looking at the 
place where it had been, it suddenly appeared 
again.
 
‘By-the-bye, what became of the baby?’ said 
the Cat. ‘I’d nearly forgotten to ask.’
 
‘It turned into a pig,’ Alice quietly said, just 
as if it had come back in a natural  
way.
 
‘I thought it would,’ said the Cat, 
and vanished again.
 
Alice waited a little, half expect-
ing to see it again, but it did not appear, and after 
a minute or two she walked on in the 
direction in which the March Hare was said to live. 
‘I’ve seen hatters before,’ she said to  
herself; ‘the March Hare will be much the most in-

teresting, and perhaps as this is May it 
won’t be raving mad—at least not so mad as it was 
in March.’ As she said this, she looked  
up, and there was the Cat again, sitting on a branch 
of a tree.
 
‘Did you say pig, or fig?’ said the Cat.
 
‘I said pig,’ replied Alice; ‘and I wish 
you wouldn’t keep appearing and vanishing so sud-
denly: you make one quite giddy.’
 
‘All right,’ said the Cat; and this time it van-
ished quite slowly, beginning with the 
end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which 
remained some time after the rest of  
it had gone.
 
‘Well! I’ve often seen a cat without 
a grin,’ thought Alice; ‘but a grin without a cat! It’s 
the most curious thing I ever saw in my 
life!’
 
She had not gone much farther  
before she came in sight of the house of the March 
Hare: she thought it must be the right 
house, because the chimneys were shaped like ears 
and the roof was thatched with fur. 
It was so large a house, that she did not like to go 
nearer till she had nibbled some more 
of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself 
to about two feet high: even then she

walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to her-
self ‘Suppose it should be raving mad 
after all! I almost wish I’d gone to see the Hatter 
instead!’
 
There was a table set out under a tree in 
front of the house, and the March Hare 
and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse 
was sitting between them, fast asleep, 
and the other two were using it as a cushion, rest-
ing their elbows on it, and talking  
over its head. ‘Very uncomfortable for the Dor-
mouse,’ thought Alice; ‘only, as it’s  
asleep, I suppose it doesn’t mind.’
 
The table was a large one, but the 
three were all crowded together at one corner of it: 
‘No room! No room!’ they cried out when 
they saw Alice coming. ‘There’s PLENTY of room!’ 
said Alice indignantly, and she sat  
down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.
 
‘Have some wine,’ the March Hare 
said in an encouraging tone.
 
Alice looked all round the table, 
but there was nothing on it but tea. ‘I don’t see any 
wine,’ she remarked.
 
‘There isn’t any,’ said the March Hare.
 
‘Then it wasn’t very civil of you to 
offer it,’ said Alice angrily.

‘It wasn’t very civil of you to sit 
down without being invited,’ said the March Hare.
 
‘I didn’t know it was YOUR table,’ 
said Alice; ‘it’s laid for a great many more than 
three.’
 
‘Your hair wants cutting,’ said the Hatter. He 
had been looking at Alice for some time 
with great curiosity, and this was his first speech.
 
‘You should learn not to make  
personal remarks,’ Alice said with some severity; 
‘it’s very rude.’
 
The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hear-
ing this; but all he SAID was, ‘Why is a 
raven like a writing-desk?’
 
‘Come, we shall have some fun now!’ 
thought Alice. ‘I’m glad they’ve begun asking 
riddles.—I believe I can guess that,’ she 
added aloud.
 
‘Do you mean that you think you 
can find out the answer to it?’ said the March Hare.
 
‘Exactly so,’ said Alice.
 
‘Then you should say what you mean,’ the 
March Hare went on.
 
‘I do,’ Alice hastily replied; ‘at least—at least I 
mean what I say—that’s the same thing, 
you know.’

‘Not the same thing a bit!’ said the Hatter. 
‘You might just as well say that “I see what I eat” 
is the same thing as “I eat what I see”!’
 
‘You might just as well say,’ added the March 
Hare, ‘that “I like what I get” is the same thing as 
“I get what I like”!’
 
‘You might just as well say,’ added the Dor-
mouse, who seemed to be talking in his sleep, ‘that 
“I breathe when I sleep” is the same thing as “I 
sleep when I breathe”!’
 
‘It IS the same thing with you,’ said the Hat-
ter, and here the conversation dropped, and the par-
ty sat silent for a minute, while Alice thought over 
all she could remember about ravens and writing-
desks, which wasn’t much.
 
The Hatter was the first to break the silence. 
‘What day of the month is it?’ he said, turning to 
Alice: he had taken his watch out of his pocket, and 
was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now 
and then, and holding it to his ear.

Alice considered a little, and then said ‘The 
fourth.’
 
‘Two days wrong!’ sighed the Hatter. ‘I told 
you butter wouldn’t suit the works!’ he added look-
ing angrily at the March Hare.
 
‘It was the BEST butter,’ the March Hare 
meekly replied.
 
‘Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as 
well,’ the Hatter grumbled: ‘you shouldn’t have put 
it in with the bread-knife.’
 
The March Hare took the watch and looked 
at it gloomily: then he dipped it into his cup of tea, 
and looked at it again: but he could think of noth-
ing better to say than his first remark, ‘It was the 
BEST butter, you know.’
 
Alice had been looking over his shoulder 
with some curiosity. ‘What a funny watch!’ she re-
marked. ‘It tells the day of the month, and doesn’t 
tell what o’clock it is!’
 
‘Why should it?’ muttered the Hatter. ‘Does 
YOUR watch tell you what year it is?’
 
‘Of course not,’ Alice replied very readily: ‘but 
that’s because it stays the same year for such a 
long time together.’
 
‘Which is just the case with MINE,’ said the 
Hatter.

Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter’s re-
mark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it, and 
yet it was certainly English. ‘I don’t quite under-
stand you,’ she said, as politely as she could.
 
‘The Dormouse is asleep again,’ said the Hat-
ter, and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose.
 
The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, 
and said, without opening its eyes, ‘Of course, of 
course; just what I was going to remark myself.’
 
‘Have you guessed the riddle yet?’ the Hatter 
said, turning to Alice again.
 
‘No, I give it up,’ Alice replied: ‘what’s the an-
swer?’
 
‘I haven’t the slightest idea,’ said the Hatter.
 
‘Nor I,’ said the March Hare.
 
Alice sighed wearily. ‘I think you might do 
something better with the time,’ she said, ‘than 
waste it in asking riddles that have no answers.’
 
‘If you knew Time as well as I do,’ said the 
Hatter, ‘you wouldn’t talk about wasting IT. It’s 
HIM.’
 
‘I don’t know what you mean,’ said Alice.
 
‘Of course you don’t!’ the Hatter said, tossing 
his head contemptuously. ‘I dare say you never even 
spoke to Time!’

‘Perhaps not,’ Alice cautiously replied: ‘but I 
know I have to beat time when I learn music.’
 
‘Ah! that accounts for it,’ said the Hatter. 
‘He won’t stand beating. Now, if you only kept on 
good terms with him, he’d do almost anything you 
liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were 
nine o’clock in the morning, just time to begin les-
sons: you’d only have to whisper a hint to Time, and 
round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one, 
time for dinner!’
 
(‘I only wish it was,’ the March Hare said to 
itself in a whisper.)
 
‘That would be grand, certainly,’ said Alice 
thoughtfully: ‘but then—I shouldn’t be hungry for 
it, you know.’
 
‘Not at first, perhaps,’ said the Hatter: ‘but 
you could keep it to half-past one as long as you 
liked.’
 
‘Is that the way YOU manage?’ Alice asked.
 
The Hatter shook his head mournfully. ‘Not I!’ 
he replied. ‘We quarrelled last March—just before 
HE went mad, you know—’ (pointing with his tea 
spoon at the March Hare,) ‘it was at the great con-
cert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing

“Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!
How I wonder what you’re at!”
You know the song, perhaps?’
‘I’ve heard something like it,’ said Alice.
‘It goes on, you know,’ the Hatter continued, ‘in this 
way:—
“Up above the world you fly,
Like a tea-tray in the sky.
Twinkle, twinkle—”’
 
Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began 
singing in its sleep ‘Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twin-
kle—’ and went on so long that they had to pinch it 
to make it stop.
 
‘Well, I’d hardly finished the first verse,’ said 
the Hatter, ‘when the Queen jumped up and bawled 
out, “He’s murdering the time! Off with his head!”’
 
‘How dreadfully savage!’ exclaimed Alice.
 
‘And ever since that,’ the Hatter went on in 
a mournful tone, ‘he won’t do a thing I ask! It’s al-
ways six o’clock now.’
 
A bright idea came into Alice’s head. ‘Is that 
the reason so many tea-things are put out here?’ 
she asked.
krismadden.com

145
 
‘Yes, that’s it,’ said the Hatter with a sigh: 
‘it’s always tea-time, and we’ve no time to wash the 
things between whiles.’
 
‘Then you keep moving round, I suppose?’ said 
Alice.
 
‘Exactly so,’ said the Hatter: ‘as the things get 
used up.’
 
‘But what happens when you come to the be-
ginning again?’ Alice ventured to ask.
 
‘Suppose we change the subject,’ the March 
Hare interrupted, yawning. ‘I’m getting tired of 
this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.’
 
‘I’m afraid I don’t know one,’ said Alice, rath-
er alarmed at the proposal.
 
‘Then the Dormouse shall!’ they both cried. 
‘Wake up, Dormouse!’ And they pinched it on both 
sides at once.
 
The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. ‘I 
wasn’t asleep,’ he said in a hoarse, feeble voice: ‘I 
heard every word you fellows were saying.’
 
‘Tell us a story!’ said the March Hare.
 
‘Yes, please do!’ pleaded Alice.
 
‘And be quick about it,’ added the Hatter, ‘or 
you’ll be asleep again before it’s done.’

Alice folded her hands, and began:—
‘You are old, Father William,’ the young man said,
‘And your hair has become very white;
And yet you incessantly stand on your head—
Do you think, at your age, it is right?’
‘In my youth,’ Father William replied to his son,
‘I feared it might injure the brain;
But, now that I’m perfectly sure I have none,
Why, I do it again and again.’
‘You are old,’ said the youth, ‘as I mentioned before,
And have grown most uncommonly fat;
Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door—
Pray, what is the reason of that?’
‘In my youth,’ said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,
‘I kept all my limbs very supple
By the use of this ointment—one shilling the box—
Allow me to sell you a couple?’

‘You are old,’ said the youth, ‘and your jaws are too weak
For anything tougher than suet;
Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak—
Pray how did you manage to do it?’
‘In my youth,’ said his father, ‘I took to the law,
And argued each case with my wife;
And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,
Has lasted the rest of my life.’
‘You are old,’ said the youth, ‘one would hardly suppose
That your eye was as steady as ever;
Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose—
What made you so awfully clever?’
‘I have answered three questions, and that is enough,’
Said his father; ‘don’t give yourself airs!
Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?
Be off, or I’ll kick you down stairs!’
	
‘That is not said right,’ said the Caterpillar.
	
‘Not QUITE right, I’m afraid,’ said Alice, timidly; 
‘some of the words have got altered.’

‘It is wrong from beginning to end,’ said the Cater-
pillar decidedly, and there was silence for some minutes.
	
The Caterpillar was the first to speak.
	
‘What size do you want to be?’ it asked.
	
‘Oh, I’m not particular as to size,’ Alice hastily re-
plied; ‘only one doesn’t like changing so often, you know.’
	
‘I DON’T know,’ said the Caterpillar.
	
Alice said nothing: she had never been so much 
contradicted in her life before, and she felt that she was 
losing her temper.
	
‘Are you content now?’ said the Caterpillar.
	
‘Well, I should like to be a LITTLE larger, sir, if 
you wouldn’t mind,’ said Alice: ‘three inches is such a 
wretched height to be.’
	
‘It is a very good height indeed!’ said the Caterpil-
lar angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was ex-
actly three inches high).
	
‘But I’m not used to it!’ pleaded poor Alice in a pite-
ous tone. And she thought of herself, ‘I wish the creatures 
wouldn’t be so easily offended!’
	
‘You’ll get used to it in time,’ said the Caterpillar; 
and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking 
again.
	
This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to 
speak again. In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the 
hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice, and

shook itself. Then it got down off the mushroom, and 
crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went, 
‘One side will make you grow taller, and the other side 
will make you grow shorter.’
	
‘One side of WHAT? The other side of WHAT?’ 
thought Alice to herself.
	
‘Of the mushroom,’ said the Caterpillar, just as if 
she had asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out 
of sight.
	
Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mush-
room for a minute, trying to make out which were the two 
sides of it; and as it was perfectly round, she found this a 
very difficult question. However, at last she stretched her 
arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit 
of the edge with each hand.
	
‘And now which is which?’ she said to herself, and 
nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to try the effect: the 
next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin: 
it had struck her foot!
	
She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden 
change, but she felt that there was no time to be lost, as 
she was shrinking rapidly; so she set to work at once to 
eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed so closely 
against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her 
mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a 
morsel of the lefthand bit.

‘Come, my head’s free at last!’ said Alice in a tone 
of delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, 
when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be 
found: all she could see, when she looked down, was an 
immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk 
out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her.
	
‘What CAN all that green stuff be?’ said Alice. 
‘And where HAVE my shoulders got to? And oh, my poor 
hands, how is it I can’t see you?’ She was moving them 
about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow, except 
a little shaking among the distant green leaves.
	
As there seemed to be no chance of getting her 
hands up to her head, she tried to get her head down to 
them, and was delighted to find that her neck would bend 
about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She had just 
succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and 
was going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to 
be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had 
been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back 
in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was 
beating her violently with its wings.
	
‘Serpent!’ screamed the Pigeon.
	
‘I’m NOT a serpent!’ said Alice indignantly. ‘Let me 
alone!’
krismadden.com

151
	
‘Serpent, I say again!’ repeated the Pigeon, but in 
a more subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, ‘I’ve 
tried every way, and nothing seems to suit them!’
	
‘I haven’t the least idea what you’re talking about,’ 
said Alice.
	
‘I’ve tried the roots of trees, and I’ve tried banks, 
and I’ve tried hedges,’ the Pigeon went on, without attend-
ing to her; ‘but those serpents! There’s no pleasing them!’
	
Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought 
there was no use in saying anything more till the Pigeon 
had finished.
	
‘As if it wasn’t trouble enough hatching the eggs,’ 
said the Pigeon; ‘but I must be on the look-out for serpents 
night and day! Why, I haven’t had a wink of sleep these 
three weeks!’
	
‘I’m very sorry you’ve been annoyed,’ said Alice, 
who was beginning to see its meaning.
	
‘And just as I’d taken the highest tree in the wood,’ 
continued the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, ‘and 
just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last, 
they must needs come wriggling down from the sky! Ugh, 
Serpent!’
	
‘But I’m NOT a serpent, I tell you!’ said Alice. ‘I’m 
a—I’m a—’
	
‘Well! WHAT are you?’ said the Pigeon. ‘I can see 
you’re trying to invent something!’

‘I—I’m a little girl,’ said Alice, rather doubtfully, 
as she remembered the number of changes she had gone 
through that day.
	
‘A likely story indeed!’ said the Pigeon in a tone of 
the deepest contempt. ‘I’ve seen a good many little girls in 
my time, but never ONE with such a neck as that! No, no! 
You’re a serpent; and there’s no use denying it. I suppose 
you’ll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg!’
	
‘I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,’ said Alice, who 
was a very truthful child; ‘but little girls eat eggs quite as 
much as serpents do, you know.’
	
‘I don’t believe it,’ said the Pigeon; ‘but if they do, 
why then they’re a kind of serpent, that’s all I can say.’
	
This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was 
quite silent for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon 
the opportunity of adding, ‘You’re looking for eggs, I know 
THAT well enough; and what does it matter to me wheth-
er you’re a little girl or a serpent?’
	
‘It matters a good deal to ME,’ said Alice hastily; 
‘but I’m not looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I 
shouldn’t want YOURS: I don’t like them raw.’
	
‘Well, be off, then!’ said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, 
as it settled down again into its nest. Alice crouched down 
among the trees as well as she could, for her neck kept 
getting entangled among the branches, and every now 
and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while she 
remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom

in her hands, and she set to work very carefully, nibbling 
first at one and then at the other, and growing sometimes 
taller and sometimes shorter, until she had succeeded in 
bringing herself down to her usual height.
	
It was so long since she had been anything near the 
right size, that it felt quite strange at first; but she got 
used to it in a few minutes, and began talking to herself, 
as usual. ‘Come, there’s half my plan done now! How puz-
zling all these changes are! I’m never sure what I’m going 
to be, from one minute to another! However, I’ve got back 
to my right size: the next thing is, to get into that beauti-
ful garden—how IS that to be done, I wonder?’ As she said 
this, she came suddenly upon an open place, with a little 
house in it about four feet high. ‘Whoever lives there,’ 
thought Alice, ‘it’ll never do to come upon them THIS 
size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!’ So she 
began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not 
venture to go near the house till she had brought herself 
down to nine inches high.

CHAPTER VI. Pig and Pepper
	
For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, 
and wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman 
in livery came running out of the wood—(she considered 
him to be a footman because he was in livery: otherwise, 
judging by his face only, she would have called him a 
fish)—and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. 
It was opened by another footman in livery, with a round 
face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen, Al-
ice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their 
heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all about, 
and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.
	
The Fish-Footman began by producing from under 
his arm a great letter, nearly as large as himself, and this 
he handed over to the other, saying, in a solemn tone, 
‘For the Duchess. An invitation from the Queen to play 
croquet.’ The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn 
tone, only changing the order of the words a little, ‘From 
the Queen. An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.’
	
Then they both bowed low, and their curls got en-
tangled together.
	
Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run 
back into the wood for fear of their hearing her; and when 
she next peeped out the Fish-Footman was gone, and the 
other was sitting on the ground near the door, staring stu-
pidly up into the sky.
	
Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.
krismadden.com

155
	
‘There’s no sort of use in knocking,’ said the Foot-
man, ‘and that for two reasons. First, because I’m on the 
same side of the door as you are; secondly, because they’re 
making such a noise inside, no one could possibly hear 
you.’ And certainly there was a most extraordinary noise 
going on within—a constant howling and sneezing, and 
every now and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle 
had been broken to pieces.
	
‘Please, then,’ said Alice, ‘how am I to get in?’
	
‘There might be some sense in your knocking,’ the 
Footman went on without attending to her, ‘if we had the 
door between us. For instance, if you were INSIDE, you 
might knock, and I could let you out, you know.’ He was 
looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and 
this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. ‘But perhaps he can’t 
help it,’ she said to herself; ‘his eyes are so VERY nearly 
at the top of his head. But at any rate he might answer 
questions.—How am I to get in?’ she repeated, aloud.
	
‘I shall sit here,’ the Footman remarked, ‘till tomor-
row—’
	
At this moment the door of the house opened, and a 
large plate came skimming out, straight at the Footman’s 
head: it just grazed his nose, and broke to pieces against 
one of the trees behind him.
	
‘—or next day, maybe,’ the Footman continued in 
the same tone, exactly as if nothing had happened.

156
	
‘How am I to get in?’ asked Alice again, in a louder 
tone.
	
‘ARE you to get in at all?’ said the Footman. ‘That’s 
the first question, you know.’
	
It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told 
so. ‘It’s really dreadful,’ she muttered to herself, ‘the way 
all the creatures argue. It’s enough to drive one crazy!’
	
The Footman seemed to think this a good opportu-
nity for repeating his remark, with variations. ‘I shall sit 
here,’ he said, ‘on and off, for days and days.’
	
‘But what am I to do?’ said Alice.
	
‘Anything you like,’ said the Footman, and began 
whistling.
	
‘Oh, there’s no use in talking to him,’ said Alice des-
perately: ‘he’s perfectly idiotic!’ And she opened the door 
and went in.
	
The door led right into a large kitchen, which was 
full of smoke from one end to the other: the Duchess was 
sitting on a three-legged stool in the middle, nursing a 
baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring a large 
cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.
	
‘There’s certainly too much pepper in that soup!’ 
Alice said to herself, as well as she could for sneezing.
	
There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even 
the Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it 
was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment’s 
krismadden.com

157
pause. The only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, 
were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on the 
hearth and grinning from ear to ear.
	
‘Please would you tell me,’ said Alice, a little tim-
idly, for she was not quite sure whether it was good man-
ners for her to speak first, ‘why your cat grins like that?’
	
‘It’s a Cheshire cat,’ said the Duchess, ‘and that’s 
why. Pig!’
	
She said the last word with such sudden violence 
that Alice quite jumped; but she saw in another moment 
that it was addressed to the baby, and not to her, so she 
took courage, and went on again:—
	
‘I didn’t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in 
fact, I didn’t know that cats COULD grin.’
	
‘They all can,’ said the Duchess; ‘and most of ‘em 
do.’
	
‘I don’t know of any that do,’ Alice said very polite-
ly, feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation.
	
‘You don’t know much,’ said the Duchess; ‘and 
that’s a fact.’
	
Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, 
and thought it would be as well to introduce some other 
subject of conversation. While she was trying to fix on 
one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at 
once set to work throwing everything within her reach at 
the Duchess and the baby—the fire-irons came first; then

followed a shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The 
Duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her; 
and the baby was howling so much already, that it was 
quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.
	
‘Oh, PLEASE mind what you’re doing!’ cried Alice, 
jumping up and down in an agony of terror. ‘Oh, there 
goes his PRECIOUS nose’; as an unusually large sauce-
pan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it off.
	
‘If everybody minded their own business,’ the Duch-
ess said in a hoarse growl, ‘the world would go round a 
deal faster than it does.’
	
‘Which would NOT be an advantage,’ said Alice, 
who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a 
little of her knowledge. ‘Just think of what work it would 
make with the day and night! You see the earth takes 
twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis—’
	
‘Talking of axes,’ said the Duchess, ‘chop off her 
head!’
	
Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if 
she meant to take the hint; but the cook was busily stir-
ring the soup, and seemed not to be listening, so she went 
on again: ‘Twenty-four hours, I THINK; or is it twelve? 
I—’
	
‘Oh, don’t bother ME,’ said the Duchess; ‘I never 
could abide figures!’ And with that she began nursing her 
child again, singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so, 
and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line:
krismadden.com

159
‘Speak roughly to your little boy,
And beat him when he sneezes:
He only does it to annoy,
Because he knows it teases.’
CHORUS.
(In which the cook and the baby joined):—
‘Wow! wow! wow!’
	
While the Duchess sang the second verse of the 
song, she kept tossing the baby violently up and down, 
and the poor little thing howled so, that Alice could hardly 
hear the words:—
‘I speak severely to my boy,
I beat him when he sneezes;
For he can thoroughly enjoy
The pepper when he pleases!’
CHORUS.
‘Wow! wow! wow!’
	
‘Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!’ the Duch-
ess said to Alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke. ‘I 
must go and get ready to play croquet with the Queen,’

and she hurried out of the room. The cook threw a frying-
pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.
	
Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it 
was a queer-shaped little creature, and held out its arms 
and legs in all directions, ‘just like a star-fish,’ thought 
Alice. The poor little thing was snorting like a steam-en-
gine when she caught it, and kept doubling itself up and 
straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for the 
first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold 
it.
	
As soon as she had made out the proper way of 
nursing it, (which was to twist it up into a sort of knot, 
and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot, so 
as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it out into the 
open air. ‘IF I don’t take this child away with me,’ thought 
Alice, ‘they’re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn’t it be 
murder to leave it behind?’ She said the last words out 
loud, and the little thing grunted in reply (it had left off 
sneezing by this time). ‘Don’t grunt,’ said Alice; ‘that’s not 
at all a proper way of expressing yourself.’
	
The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very 
anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with 
it. There could be no doubt that it had a VERY turn-up 
nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also its 
eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether 
Alice did not like the look of the thing at all. ‘But perhaps 
it was only sobbing,’ she thought, and looked into its eyes 
again, to see if there were any tears.
krismadden.com

161
	
No, there were no tears. ‘If you’re going to turn 
into a pig, my dear,’ said Alice, seriously, ‘I’ll have noth-
ing more to do with you. Mind now!’ The poor little thing 
sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible to say which), 
and they went on for some while in silence.
	
Alice was just beginning to think to herself, ‘Now, 
what am I to do with this creature when I get it home?’ 
when it grunted again, so violently, that she looked down 
into its face in some alarm. This time there could be NO 
mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a pig, 
and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry 
it further.
	
So she set the little creature down, and felt quite 
relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood. ‘If it 
had grown up,’ she said to herself, ‘it would have made a 
dreadfully ugly child: but it makes rather a handsome pig, 
I think.’ And she began thinking over other children she 
knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just say-
ing to herself, ‘if one only knew the right way to change 
them—’ when she was a little startled by seeing the 
Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off.
	
The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked 
good-natured, she thought: still it had VERY long claws 
and a great many teeth, so she felt that it ought to be 
treated with respect.
	
‘Cheshire Puss,’ she began, rather timidly, as she 
did not at all know whether it would like the name: how-
ever, it only grinned a little wider. ‘Come, it’s pleased so

far,’ thought Alice, and she went on. ‘Would you tell me, 
please, which way I ought to go from here?’
	
‘That depends a good deal on where you want to get 
to,’ said the Cat.
	
‘I don’t much care where—’ said Alice.
	
‘Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,’ said the 
Cat.
	
‘—so long as I get SOMEWHERE,’ Alice added as 
an explanation.
	
‘Oh, you’re sure to do that,’ said the Cat, ‘if you only 
walk long enough.’
	
Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried 
another question. ‘What sort of people live about here?’
	
‘In THAT direction,’ the Cat said, waving its right 
paw round, ‘lives a Hatter: and in THAT direction,’ wav-
ing the other paw, ‘lives a March Hare. Visit either you 
like: they’re both mad.’
	
‘But I don’t want to go among mad people,’ Alice 
remarked.
	
‘Oh, you can’t help that,’ said the Cat: ‘we’re all 
mad here. I’m mad. You’re mad.’
	
‘How do you know I’m mad?’ said Alice.
	
‘You must be,’ said the Cat, ‘or you wouldn’t have 
come here.’
	
Alice didn’t think that proved it at all; however, she

163
went on ‘And how do you know that you’re mad?’
	
‘To begin with,’ said the Cat, ‘a dog’s not mad. You 
grant that?’
	
‘I suppose so,’ said Alice.
	
‘Well, then,’ the Cat went on, ‘you see, a dog growls 
when it’s angry, and wags its tail when it’s pleased. Now I 
growl when I’m pleased, and wag my tail when I’m angry. 
Therefore I’m mad.’
	
‘I call it purring, not growling,’ said Alice.
	
‘Call it what you like,’ said the Cat. ‘Do you play 
croquet with the Queen to-day?’
	
‘I should like it very much,’ said Alice, ‘but I haven’t 
been invited yet.’
	
‘You’ll see me there,’ said the Cat, and vanished.
	
Alice was not much surprised at this, she was get-
ting so used to queer things happening. While she was 
looking at the place where it had been, it suddenly ap-
peared again.
	
‘By-the-bye, what became of the baby?’ said the 
Cat. ‘I’d nearly forgotten to ask.’
	
‘It turned into a pig,’ Alice quietly said, just as if it 
had come back in a natural way.
	
‘I thought it would,’ said the Cat, and vanished 
again.

Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, 
but it did not appear, and after a minute or two she 
walked on in the direction in which the March Hare was 
said to live. ‘I’ve seen hatters before,’ she said to her-
self; ‘the March Hare will be much the most interesting, 
and perhaps as this is May it won’t be raving mad—at 
least not so mad as it was in March.’ As she said this, 
she looked up, and there was the Cat again, sitting on a 
branch of a tree.
	
‘Did you say pig, or fig?’ said the Cat.
	
‘I said pig,’ replied Alice; ‘and I wish you wouldn’t 
keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly: you make one 
quite giddy.’
	
‘All right,’ said the Cat; and this time it vanished 
quite slowly, beginning with the end of the tail, and end-
ing with the grin, which remained some time after the 
rest of it had gone.
	
‘Well! I’ve often seen a cat without a grin,’ thought 
Alice; ‘but a grin without a cat! It’s the most curious thing 
I ever saw in my life!’
	
She had not gone much farther before she came in 
sight of the house of the March Hare: she thought it must 
be the right house, because the chimneys were shaped 
like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It was so 
large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she 
had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, 
and raised herself to about two feet high: even then she

165
walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself 
‘Suppose it should be raving mad after all! I almost wish 
I’d gone to see the Hatter instead!’

CHAPTER VII. A Mad Tea-Party
	
There was a table set out under a tree in front of 
the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were hav-
ing tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast 
asleep, and the other two were using it as a cushion, rest-
ing their elbows on it, and talking over its head. ‘Very un-
comfortable for the Dormouse,’ thought Alice; ‘only, as it’s 
asleep, I suppose it doesn’t mind.’
	
The table was a large one, but the three were all 
crowded together at one corner of it: ‘No room! No room!’ 
they cried out when they saw Alice coming. ‘There’s 
PLENTY of room!’ said Alice indignantly, and she sat 
down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.
	
‘Have some wine,’ the March Hare said in an en-
couraging tone.
	
Alice looked all round the table, but there was 
nothing on it but tea. ‘I don’t see any wine,’ she remarked.
	
‘There isn’t any,’ said the March Hare.
	
‘Then it wasn’t very civil of you to offer it,’ said Al-
ice angrily.
	
‘It wasn’t very civil of you to sit down without being 
invited,’ said the March Hare.
	
‘I didn’t know it was YOUR table,’ said Alice; ‘it’s 
laid for a great many more than three.’
krismadden.com

167
	
‘Your hair wants cutting,’ said the Hatter. He had 
been looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity, 
and this was his first speech.
	
‘You should learn not to make personal remarks,’ 
Alice said with some severity; ‘it’s very rude.’
	
The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing 
this; but all he SAID was, ‘Why is a raven like a writing-
desk?’
	
‘Come, we shall have some fun now!’ thought Alice. 
‘I’m glad they’ve begun asking riddles.—I believe I can 
guess that,’ she added aloud.
	
‘Do you mean that you think you can find out the 
answer to it?’ said the March Hare.
	
‘Exactly so,’ said Alice.
	
‘Then you should say what you mean,’ the March 
Hare went on.
	
‘I do,’ Alice hastily replied; ‘at least—at least I 
mean what I say—that’s the same thing, you know.’
	
‘Not the same thing a bit!’ said the Hatter. ‘You 
might just as well say that “I see what I eat” is the same 
thing as “I eat what I see”!’
	
‘You might just as well say,’ added the March Hare, 
‘that “I like what I get” is the same thing as “I get what I 
like”!’
	
‘You might just as well say,’ added the Dormouse, 
who seemed to be talking in his sleep, ‘that “I breathe

168
when I sleep” is the same thing as “I sleep when I 
breathe”!’
	
‘It IS the same thing with you,’ said the Hatter, and 
here the conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for 
a minute, while Alice thought over all she could remember 
about ravens and writing-desks, which wasn’t much.
	
The Hatter was the first to break the silence. ‘What 
day of the month is it?’ he said, turning to Alice: he had 
taken his watch out of his pocket, and was looking at it 
uneasily, shaking it every now and then, and holding it to 
his ear.
	
Alice considered a little, and then said ‘The fourth.’
	
‘Two days wrong!’ sighed the Hatter. ‘I told you but-
ter wouldn’t suit the works!’ he added looking angrily at 
the March Hare.
	
‘It was the BEST butter,’ the March Hare meekly 
replied.
	
‘Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,’ 
the Hatter grumbled: ‘you shouldn’t have put it in with 
the bread-knife.’
	
The March Hare took the watch and looked at it 
gloomily: then he dipped it into his cup of tea, and looked 
at it again: but he could think of nothing better to say 
than his first remark, ‘It was the BEST butter, you know.’
	
Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some 
curiosity. ‘What a funny watch!’ she remarked. ‘It tells the 
krismadden.com

169
day of the month, and doesn’t tell what o’clock it is!’
	
‘Why should it?’ muttered the Hatter. ‘Does YOUR 
watch tell you what year it is?’
	
‘Of course not,’ Alice replied very readily: ‘but that’s 
because it stays the same year for such a long time to-
gether.’
	
‘Which is just the case with MINE,’ said the Hatter.
	
Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter’s remark 
seemed to have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was 
certainly English. ‘I don’t quite understand you,’ she said, 
as politely as she could.
	
‘The Dormouse is asleep again,’ said the Hatter, 
and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose.
	
The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and 
said, without opening its eyes, ‘Of course, of course; just 
what I was going to remark myself.’
	
‘Have you guessed the riddle yet?’ the Hatter said, 
turning to Alice again.
	
‘No, I give it up,’ Alice replied: ‘what’s the answer?’
	
‘I haven’t the slightest idea,’ said the Hatter.
	
‘Nor I,’ said the March Hare.
	
Alice sighed wearily. ‘I think you might do some-
thing better with the time,’ she said, ‘than waste it in ask-
ing riddles that have no answers.’
	
‘If you knew Time as well as I do,’ said the Hatter,

‘you wouldn’t talk about wasting IT. It’s HIM.’
	
I don’t know what you mean,’ said Alice.
	
‘Of course you don’t!’ the Hatter said, tossing his 
head contemptuously. ‘I dare say you never even spoke to 
Time!’
	
‘Perhaps not,’ Alice cautiously replied: ‘but I know I 
have to beat time when I learn music.’
	
‘Ah! that accounts for it,’ said the Hatter. ‘He won’t 
stand beating. Now, if you only kept on good terms with 
him, he’d do almost anything you liked with the clock. For 
instance, suppose it were nine o’clock in the morning, just 
time to begin lessons: you’d only have to whisper a hint to 
Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past 
one, time for dinner!’
	
(‘I only wish it was,’ the March Hare said to itself in 
a whisper.)
	
‘That would be grand, certainly,’ said Alice thought-
fully: ‘but then—I shouldn’t be hungry for it, you know.’
	
‘Not at first, perhaps,’ said the Hatter: ‘but you 
could keep it to half-past one as long as you liked.’
	
‘Is that the way YOU manage?’ Alice asked.
	
The Hatter shook his head mournfully. ‘Not I!’ he 
replied. ‘We quarrelled last March—just before HE went 
mad, you know—’ (pointing with his tea spoon at the 
March Hare,) ‘—it was at the great concert given by the 
Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing
krismadden.com

171
“Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!
How I wonder what you’re at!”
	
You know the song, perhaps?’
	
‘I’ve heard something like it,’ said Alice.
	
‘It goes on, you know,’ the Hatter continued, ‘in this 
way:—
“Up above the world you fly,
Like a tea-tray in the sky.
Twinkle, twinkle—”’
	
Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began sing-
ing in its sleep ‘Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle—’ and 
went on so long that they had to pinch it to make it stop.
	
‘Well, I’d hardly finished the first verse,’ said the 
Hatter, ‘when the Queen jumped up and bawled out, “He’s 
murdering the time! Off with his head!”’
	
‘How dreadfully savage!’ exclaimed Alice.
	
‘And ever since that,’ the Hatter went on in a 
mournful tone, ‘he won’t do a thing I ask! It’s always six 
o’clock now.’
	
A bright idea came into Alice’s head. ‘Is that the

reason so many tea-things are put out here?’ she asked.
	
‘Yes, that’s it,’ said the Hatter with a sigh: ‘it’s al-
ways tea-time, and we’ve no time to wash the things be-
tween whiles.’
	
‘Then you keep moving round, I suppose?’ said 	
Alice.
	
‘Exactly so,’ said the Hatter: ‘as the things get used 
up.’
	
‘But what happens when you come to the beginning 
again?’ Alice ventured to ask.
	
‘Suppose we change the subject,’ the March Hare 
interrupted, yawning. ‘I’m getting tired of this. I vote the 
young lady tells us a story.’
	
‘I’m afraid I don’t know one,’ said Alice, rather 
alarmed at the proposal.
	
‘Then the Dormouse shall!’ they both cried. ‘Wake 
up, Dormouse!’ And they pinched it on both sides at once.
	
The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. ‘I wasn’t 
asleep,’ he said in a hoarse, feeble voice: ‘I heard every 
word you fellows were saying.’
	
‘Tell us a story!’ said the March Hare.
	
‘Yes, please do!’ pleaded Alice.
	
‘And be quick about it,’ added the Hatter, ‘or you’ll 
be asleep again before it’s done.’

Building 
New 
Habits


	
Every day we translate text into meaning, provok-
ing a series of images and sounds and memories at the 
glance of a word. When we see the word, “McDonald’s”, 
many people think of the golden arches of the popular 
fast food chain, and yet when we see these same words in 
print, we feel the need to read them aloud. 
	
Habituation refers to reducing the response to a 
specific stimulus by means of repetition. These exercises 
aid in the elimination of the top five most-common words 
in the English language: “the”, “of”, “and”, “to”, and “a”. 
	
See, you probably read the word “and” twice, and 
now three times. How much faster could you read if you 
eliminated these common words? Much, much faster...

Practice Reading 
In the exercise that follows, every other word is “the”. In 
order to derive meaning from the text you’re going to have 
to skip over “the”, to read the text. In turn, you’ll also be 
skipping over the “the”s that are supposed to be there.

Performance Reading
	
‘Once upon a time there were three little sisters,’ 
the Dormouse began in a great hurry; ‘and their names 
were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and they lived at the bottom 
of a well—’
	
‘What did they live on?’ said Alice, who always took 
a great interest in questions of eating and drinking.
	
‘They lived on treacle,’ said the Dormouse, after 
thinking a minute or two.
	
‘They couldn’t have done that, you know,’ Alice gen-
tly remarked; ‘they’d have been ill.’
	
‘So they were,’ said the Dormouse; ‘VERY ill.’
	
Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraor-
dinary ways of living would be like, but it puzzled her too 
much, so she went on: ‘But why did they live at the bot-
tom of a well?’
	
‘Take some more tea,’ the March Hare said to Alice, 
very earnestly.
	
‘I’ve had nothing yet,’ Alice replied in an offended 
tone, ‘so I can’t take more.’
	
‘You mean you can’t take LESS,’ said the Hatter: 
‘it’s very easy to take MORE than nothing.’
	
‘Nobody asked YOUR opinion,’ said Alice.
	
‘Who’s making personal remarks now?’ the Hatter 
asked triumphantly.

Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she 
helped herself to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then 
turned to the Dormouse, and repeated her question. ‘Why 
did they live at the bottom of a well?’
	
The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think 
about it, and then said, ‘It was a treacle-well.’
	
‘There’s no such thing!’ Alice was beginning very 
angrily, but the Hatter and the March Hare went ‘Sh! sh!’ 
and the Dormouse sulkily remarked, ‘If you can’t be civil, 
you’d better finish the story for yourself.’
	
‘No, please go on!’ Alice said very humbly; ‘I won’t 
interrupt again. I dare say there may be ONE.’
	
‘One, indeed!’ said the Dormouse indignantly. How-
ever, he consented to go on. ‘And so these three little sis-
ters—they were learning to draw, you know—’
	
‘What did they draw?’ said Alice, quite forgetting 
her promise.
	
‘Treacle,’ said the Dormouse, without considering at 
all this time.
	
‘I want a clean cup,’ interrupted the Hatter: ‘let’s 
all move one place on.’
	
He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse fol-
lowed him: the March Hare moved into the Dormouse’s 
place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the place of the 
March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any 
advantage from the change: and Alice was a good dea 
worse off than before, as the March Hare had just upset

the milk-jug into his plate.
	
Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so 
she began very cautiously: ‘But I don’t understand. Where 
did they draw the treacle from?’
	
‘You can draw water out of a water-well,’ said the 
Hatter; ‘so I should think you could draw treacle out of a 
treacle-well—eh, stupid?’
	
‘But they were IN the well,’ Alice said to the Dor-
mouse, not choosing to notice this last remark.
	
‘Of course they were’, said the Dormouse; ‘—well 
in.’
	
This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the 
Dormouse go on for some time without interrupting it.
	
‘They were learning to draw,’ the Dormouse went 
on, yawning and rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very 
sleepy; ‘and they drew all manner of things—everything 
that begins with an M—’
	
‘Why with an M?’ said Alice.
	
‘Why not?’ said the March Hare.
	
Alice was silent.
	
The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and 
was going off into a doze; but, on being pinched by the 
Hatter, it woke up again with a little shriek, and went 
on: ‘—that begins with an M, such as mouse-traps, and 
the moon, and memory, and muchness—you know you say 
things are “much of a muchness”—did you ever see such a 
krismadden.com

211
thing as a drawing of a muchness?’
	
‘Really, now you ask me,’ said Alice, very much con-
fused, ‘I don’t think—’
	
‘Then you shouldn’t talk,’ said the Hatter.
	
This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could 
bear: she got up in great disgust, and walked off; the Dor-
mouse fell asleep instantly, and neither of the others took 
the least notice of her going, though she looked back once 
or twice, half hoping that they would call after her: the 
last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dor-
mouse into the teapot.
	
‘At any rate I’ll never go THERE again!’ said Alice 
as she picked her way through the wood. ‘It’s the stupid-
est tea-party I ever was at in all my life!’
	
Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the 
trees had a door leading right into it. ‘That’s very curious!’ 
she thought. ‘But everything’s curious today. I think I 
may as well go in at once.’ And in she went.
	
Once more she found herself in the long hall, and 
close to the little glass table. ‘Now, I’ll manage better this 
time,’ she said to herself, and began by taking the little 
golden key, and unlocking the door that led into the gar-
den. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom 
(she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about 
a foot high: then she walked down the little passage: and 
THEN—she found herself at last in the beautiful garden, 
among the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains.

CHAPTER VIII. The Queen’s 	
Croquet-Ground
	
A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the 
garden: the roses growing on it were white, but there 
were three gardeners at it, busily painting them red. Alice 
thought this a very curious thing, and she went nearer to 
watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard 
one of them say, ‘Look out now, Five! Don’t go splashing 
paint over me like that!’
	
‘I couldn’t help it,’ said Five, in a sulky tone; ‘Seven 
jogged my elbow.’
	
On which Seven looked up and said, ‘That’s right, 
Five! Always lay the blame on others!’
	
‘YOU’D better not talk!’ said Five. ‘I heard the 
Queen say only yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!’
	
‘What for?’ said the one who had spoken first.
	
‘That’s none of YOUR business, Two!’ said Seven.
	
‘Yes, it IS his business!’ said Five, ‘and I’ll tell 
him—it was for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of 
onions.’
	
Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun 
‘Well, of all the unjust things—’ when his eye chanced 
to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching them, and he 
checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also,

and all of them bowed low.
	
‘Would you tell me,’ said Alice, a little timidly, ‘why 
you are painting those roses?’
	
Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. 
Two began in a low voice, ‘Why the fact is, you see, Miss, 
this here ought to have been a RED rose-tree, and we put 
a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen was to find 
it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So 
you see, Miss, we’re doing our best, afore she comes, to—’ 
At this moment Five, who had been anxiously looking 
across the garden, called out ‘The Queen! The Queen!’ and 
the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon 
their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps, and Al-
ice looked round, eager to see the Queen.
	
First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were 
all shaped like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with 
their hands and feet at the corners: next the ten court-
iers; these were ornamented all over with diamonds, 
and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these 
came the royal children; there were ten of them, and the 
little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand, 
in couples: they were all ornamented with hearts. Next 
came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among 
them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in 
a hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was 
said, and went by without noticing her. Then followed the 
Knave of Hearts, carrying the King’s crown on a crimson 
velvet cushion; and, last of all this grand procession, came

THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.
	
Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not 
to lie down on her face like the three gardeners, but she 
could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at 
processions; ‘and besides, what would be the use of a pro-
cession,’ thought she, ‘if people had all to lie down upon 
their faces, so that they couldn’t see it?’ So she stood still 
where she was, and waited.
	
When the procession came opposite to Alice, they 
all stopped and looked at her, and the Queen said severely 
‘Who is this?’ She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only 
bowed and smiled in reply.
	
‘Idiot!’ said the Queen, tossing her head impatient-
ly; and, turning to Alice, she went on, ‘What’s your name, 
child?’
	
‘My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,’ said Al-
ice very politely; but she added, to herself, ‘Why, they’re 
only a pack of cards, after all. I needn’t be afraid of them!’
	
‘And who are THESE?’ said the Queen, pointing to 
the three gardeners who were lying round the rosetree; 
for, you see, as they were lying on their faces, and the pat-
tern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack, 
she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or sol-
diers, or courtiers, or three of her own children.
	
‘How should I know?’ said Alice, surprised at her 
own courage. ‘It’s no business of MINE.’
	
The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after 
krismadden.com

215
glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast, screamed 
‘Off with her head! Off—’
	
‘Nonsense!’ said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, 
and the Queen was silent.
	
The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly 
said ‘Consider, my dear: she is only a child!’
	
The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said 
to the Knave ‘Turn them over!’
	
The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.
	
‘Get up!’ said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and 
the three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bow-
ing to the King, the Queen, the royal children, and every-
body else.
	
‘Leave off that!’ screamed the Queen. ‘You make me 
giddy.’ And then, turning to the rose-tree, she went on, 
‘What HAVE you been doing here?’
	
‘May it please your Majesty,’ said Two, in a very 
humble tone, going down on one knee as he spoke, ‘we 
were trying—’
	
‘I see!’ said the Queen, who had meanwhile been 
examining the roses. ‘Off with their heads!’ and the pro-
cession moved on, three of the soldiers remaining behind 
to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran to Alice for 
protection.
	
‘You shan’t be beheaded!’ said Alice, and she put 
them into a large flower-pot that stood near. The three

216
soldiers wandered about for a minute or two, looking for 
them, and then quietly marched off after the others.
	
‘Are their heads off?’ shouted the Queen.
	
‘Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!’ the 
soldiers shouted in reply.
	
‘That’s right!’ shouted the Queen. ‘Can you play cro-
quet?’
	
The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the 
question was evidently meant for her.
	
‘Yes!’ shouted Alice.
	
‘Come on, then!’ roared the Queen, and Alice joined 
the procession, wondering very much what would happen 
next.
	
‘It’s—it’s a very fine day!’ said a timid voice at her 
side. She was walking by the White Rabbit, who was 
peeping anxiously into her face.
	
‘Very,’ said Alice: ‘—where’s the Duchess?’
	
‘Hush! Hush!’ said the Rabbit in a low, hurried 
tone. He looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, 
and then raised himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close 
to her ear, and whispered ‘She’s under sentence of execu-
tion.’
	
‘What for?’ said Alice.
	
‘Did you say “What a pity!”?’ the Rabbit asked.
	
‘No, I didn’t,’ said Alice: ‘I don’t think it’s at all a

217
pity. I said “What for?”’
	
‘She boxed the Queen’s ears—’ the Rabbit began. 
Alice gave a little scream of laughter. ‘Oh, hush!’ the Rab-
bit whispered in a frightened tone. ‘The Queen will hear 
you! You see, she came rather late, and the Queen said—’
	
‘Get to your places!’ shouted the Queen in a voice 
of thunder, and people began running about in all direc-
tions, tumbling up against each other; however, they got 
settled down in a minute or two, and the game began. 
Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-
ground in her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls 
were live hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the 
soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their 
hands and feet, to make the arches.
	
The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in man-
aging her flamingo: she succeeded in getting its body 
tucked away, comfortably enough, under her arm, with 
its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got 
its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give 
the hedgehog a blow with its head, it WOULD twist itself 
round and look up in her face, with such a puzzled expres-
sion that she could not help bursting out laughing: and 
when she had got its head down, and was going to begin 
again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had 
unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: be-
sides all this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the 
way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, 
as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up and

218
walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came 
to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.
	
The players all played at once without waiting 
for turns, quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the 
hedgehogs; and in a very short time the Queen was in a 
furious passion, and went stamping about, and shouting 
‘Off with his head!’ or ‘Off with her head!’ about once in a 
minute.
	
Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had 
not as yet had any dispute with the Queen, but she knew 
that it might happen any minute, ‘and then,’ thought she, 
‘what would become of me? They’re dreadfully fond of be-
heading people here; the great wonder is, that there’s any 
one left alive!’
	
She was looking about for some way of escape, and 
wondering whether she could get away without being 
seen, when she noticed a curious appearance in the air: 
it puzzled her very much at first, but, after watching it a 
minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said 
to herself ‘It’s the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have some-
body to talk to.’
	
‘How are you getting on?’ said the Cat, as soon as 
there was mouth enough for it to speak with.
	
Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nod-
ded. ‘It’s no use speaking to it,’ she thought, ‘till its ears 
have come, or at least one of them.’ In another minute 
the whole head appeared, and then Alice put down her 
krismadden.com

219
flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very 
glad she had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed 
to think that there was enough of it now in sight, and no 
more of it appeared.
	
‘I don’t think they play at all fairly,’ Alice began, in 
rather a complaining tone, ‘and they all quarrel so dread-
fully one can’t hear oneself speak—and they don’t seem to 
have any rules in particular; at least, if there are, nobody 
attends to them—and you’ve no idea how confusing it is 
all the things being alive; for instance, there’s the arch 
I’ve got to go through next walking about at the other end 
of the ground—and I should have croqueted the Queen’s 
hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it saw mine 
coming!’
	
‘How do you like the Queen?’ said the Cat in a low 
voice.
	
‘Not at all,’ said Alice: ‘she’s so extremely—’ Just 
then she noticed that the Queen was close behind her, 
listening: so she went on, ‘—likely to win, that it’s hardly 
worth while finishing the game.’
	
The Queen smiled and passed on.
	
‘Who ARE you talking to?’ said the King, going up 
to Alice, and looking at the Cat’s head with great curios-
ity.
	
‘It’s a friend of mine—a Cheshire Cat,’ said Alice: 
‘allow me to introduce it.’
	
‘I don’t like the look of it at all,’ said the King: ‘how-

ever, it may kiss my hand if it likes.’
	
‘I’d rather not,’ the Cat remarked.
	
‘Don’t be impertinent,’ said the King, ‘and don’t 
look at me like that!’ He got behind Alice as he spoke.
	
‘A cat may look at a king,’ said Alice. ‘I’ve read that 
in some book, but I don’t remember where.’
	
‘Well, it must be removed,’ said the King very de-
cidedly, and he called the Queen, who was passing at the 
moment, ‘My dear! I wish you would have this cat re-
moved!’
	
The Queen had only one way of settling all difficul-
ties, great or small. ‘Off with his head!’ she said, without 
even looking round.
	
‘I’ll fetch the executioner myself,’ said the King ea-
gerly, and he hurried off.
	
Alice thought she might as well go back, and see 
how the game was going on, as she heard the Queen’s 
voice in the distance, screaming with passion. She had 
already heard her sentence three of the players to be ex-
ecuted for having missed their turns, and she did not like 
the look of things at all, as the game was in such confu-
sion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not. 
So she went in search of her hedgehog.
	
The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another 
hedgehog, which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity 
for croqueting one of them with the other: the only diffi-
krismadden.com

221
culty was, that her flamingo was gone across to the other 
side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a 
helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.
	
By the time she had caught the flamingo and 
brought it back, the fight was over, and both the hedge-
hogs were out of sight: ‘but it doesn’t matter much,’ 
thought Alice, ‘as all the arches are gone from this side of 
the ground.’ So she tucked it away under her arm, that it 
might not escape again, and went back for a little more 
conversation with her friend.
	
When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was 
surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it: 
there was a dispute going on between the executioner, the 
King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once, while 
all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfort-
able.
	
The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to 
by all three to settle the question, and they repeated their 
arguments to her, though, as they all spoke at once, she 
found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they 
said.
	
The executioner’s argument was, that you couldn’t 
cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from: 
that he had never had to do such a thing before, and he 
wasn’t going to begin at HIS time of life.
	
The King’s argument was, that anything that had a 
head could be beheaded, and that you weren’t to talk 	
nonsense.

222
	
The Queen’s argument was, that if something 
wasn’t done about it in less than no time she’d have ev-
erybody executed, all round. (It was this last remark that 
had made the whole party look so grave and anxious.)
	
Alice could think of nothing else to say but ‘It be-
longs to the Duchess: you’d better ask HER about it.’
	
‘She’s in prison,’ the Queen said to the executioner: 
‘fetch her here.’
	
And the executioner went off like an arrow.
	
 The Cat’s head began fading away the moment 
he was gone, and, by the time he had come back with the 
Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so the King and the 
executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it, while 
the rest of the party went back to the game.

CHAPTER IX. The Mock Turtle’s 
Story
	
‘You can’t think how glad I am to see you again, you 
dear old thing!’ said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm 
affectionately into Alice’s, and they walked off together.
	
Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant 
temper, and thought to herself that perhaps it was only 
the pepper that had made her so savage when they met in 
the kitchen.
	
‘When I’M a Duchess,’ she said to herself, (not in a 
very hopeful tone though), ‘I won’t have any pepper in my 
kitchen AT ALL. Soup does very well without—Maybe it’s 
always pepper that makes people hot-tempered,’ she went 
on, very much pleased at having found out a new kind of 
rule, ‘and vinegar that makes them sour—and camomile 
that makes them bitter—and—and barley-sugar and such 
things that make children sweet-tempered. I only wish 
people knew that: then they wouldn’t be so stingy about 
it, you know—’
	
She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, 
and was a little startled when she heard her voice close 
to her ear. ‘You’re thinking about something, my dear, 
and that makes you forget to talk. I can’t tell you just now 
what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in a bit.’
	
‘Perhaps it hasn’t one,’ Alice ventured to remark.

224
	
‘Tut, tut, child!’ said the Duchess. ‘Everything’s got 
a moral, if only you can find it.’ And she squeezed herself 
up closer to Alice’s side as she spoke.
	
Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: 
first, because the Duchess was VERY ugly; and secondly, 
because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin 
upon Alice’s shoulder, and it was an uncomfortably sharp 
chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she bore it 
as well as she could.
	
‘The game’s going on rather better now,’ she said, 
by way of keeping up the conversation a little.
	
‘’Tis so,’ said the Duchess: ‘and the moral of that 
is—”Oh, ‘tis love, ‘tis love, that makes the world go 
round!”’
	
‘Somebody said,’ Alice whispered, ‘that it’s done by 
everybody minding their own business!’
	
‘Ah, well! It means much the same thing,’ said the 
Duchess, digging her sharp little chin into Alice’s shoulder 
as she added, ‘and the moral of THAT is—”Take care of 
the sense, and the sounds will take care of themselves.”’
	
‘How fond she is of finding morals in things!’ Alice 
thought to herself.
	
‘I dare say you’re wondering why I don’t put my 
arm round your waist,’ the Duchess said after a pause: 
‘the reason is, that I’m doubtful about the temper of your 
flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?’

225
	
‘HE might bite,’ Alice cautiously replied, not feeling 
at all anxious to have the experiment tried.
	
‘Very true,’ said the Duchess: ‘flamingoes and mus-
tard both bite. And the moral of that is—”Birds of a feath-
er flock together.”’
	
‘Only mustard isn’t a bird,’ Alice remarked.
	
‘Right, as usual,’ said the Duchess: ‘what a clear 
way you have of putting things!’
	
‘It’s a mineral, I THINK,’ said Alice.
	
‘Of course it is,’ said the Duchess, who seemed 
ready to agree to everything that Alice said; ‘there’s a 
large mustard-mine near here. And the moral of that is—
”The more there is of mine, the less there is of yours.”’
	
‘Oh, I know!’ exclaimed Alice, who had not attended 
to this last remark, ‘it’s a vegetable. It doesn’t look like 
one, but it is.’
	
‘I quite agree with you,’ said the Duchess; ‘and the 
moral of that is—”Be what you would seem to be”—or if 
you’d like it put more simply—”Never imagine yourself 
not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others 
that what you were or might have been was not otherwise 
than what you had been would have appeared to them to 
be otherwise.”’
	
‘I think I should understand that better,’ Alice said 
very politely, ‘if I had it written down: but I can’t quite fol-
low it as you say it.’

226
	
‘That’s nothing to what I could say if I chose,’ the 
Duchess replied, in a pleased tone.
	
‘Pray don’t trouble yourself to say it any longer 
than that,’ said Alice.
	
‘Oh, don’t talk about trouble!’ said the Duchess. ‘I 
make you a present of everything I’ve said as yet.’
	
‘A cheap sort of present!’ thought Alice. ‘I’m glad 
they don’t give birthday presents like that!’ But she did 
not venture to say it out loud.
	
‘Thinking again?’ the Duchess asked, with another 
dig of her sharp little chin.
	
‘I’ve a right to think,’ said Alice sharply, for she was 
beginning to feel a little worried.
	
‘Just about as much right,’ said the Duchess, ‘as 
pigs have to fly; and the m—’
	
But here, to Alice’s great surprise, the Duchess’s 
voice died away, even in the middle of her favourite word 
‘moral,’ and the arm that was linked into hers began to 
tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the Queen in 
front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a thun-
derstorm.
	
‘A fine day, your Majesty!’ the Duchess began in a 
low, weak voice.
	
‘Now, I give you fair warning,’ shouted the Queen, 
stamping on the ground as she spoke; ‘either you or your 
head must be off, and that in about half no time! Take

your choice!’
	
The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a mo-
ment.
	
‘Let’s go on with the game,’ the Queen said to Al-
ice; and Alice was too much frightened to say a word, but 
slowly followed her back to the croquet-ground.
	
The other guests had taken advantage of the 
Queen’s absence, and were resting in the shade: however, 
the moment they saw her, they hurried back to the game, 
the Queen merely remarking that a moment’s delay would 
cost them their lives.
	
All the time they were playing the Queen never left 
off quarrelling with the other players, and shouting ‘Off 
with his head!’ or ‘Off with her head!’ Those whom she 
sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers, who 
of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so that 
by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, 
and all the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, 
were in custody and under sentence of execution.
	
Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and 
said to Alice, ‘Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?’
	
‘No,’ said Alice. ‘I don’t even know what a Mock 
Turtle is.’
	
‘It’s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,’ said 
the Queen.
	
‘I never saw one, or heard of one,’ said Alice.

228
	
‘Come on, then,’ said the Queen, ‘and he shall tell 
you his history,’
	
As they walked off together, Alice heard the King 
say in a low voice, to the company generally, ‘You are all 
pardoned.’ ‘Come, THAT’S a good thing!’ she said to her-
self, for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of ex-
ecutions the Queen had ordered.
	
They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast 
asleep in the sun. (IF you don’t know what a Gryphon is, 
look at the picture.) ‘Up, lazy thing!’ said the Queen, ‘and 
take this young lady to see the Mock Turtle, and to hear 
his history. I must go back and see after some executions 
I have ordered’; and she walked off, leaving Alice alone 
with the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the 
creature, but on the whole she thought it would be quite 
as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage Queen: so 
she waited.
	
The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it 
watched the Queen till she was out of sight: then it chuck-
led. ‘What fun!’ said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Al-
ice.
	
‘What IS the fun?’ said Alice.
	
‘Why, SHE,’ said the Gryphon. ‘It’s all her fancy, 
that: they never executes nobody, you know. Come on!’
	
‘Everybody says “come on!” here,’ thought Alice, as 
she went slowly after it: ‘I never was so ordered about in 
all my life, never!’
krismadden.com

229
	
They had not gone far before they saw the Mock 
Turtle in the distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little 
ledge of rock, and, as they came nearer, Alice could hear 
him sighing as if his heart would break. She pitied him 
deeply. ‘What is his sorrow?’ she asked the Gryphon, and 
the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as 
before, ‘It’s all his fancy, that: he hasn’t got no sorrow, you 
know. Come on!’
	
So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at 
them with large eyes full of tears, but said nothing.
	
‘This here young lady,’ said the Gryphon, ‘she 
wants for to know your history, she do.’
	
‘I’ll tell it her,’ said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hol-
low tone: ‘sit down, both of you, and don’t speak a word 
till I’ve finished.’
	
So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some min-
utes. Alice thought to herself, ‘I don’t see how he can 
EVEN finish, if he doesn’t begin.’ But she waited 	
	
patiently.
	
‘Once,’ said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep 
sigh, ‘I was a real Turtle.’
	
These words were followed by a very long silence, 
broken only by an occasional exclamation of ‘Hjckrrh!’ 
from the Gryphon, and the constant heavy sobbing of the 
Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and saying, 
‘Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,’ but she could 
not help thinking there MUST be more to come, so she sat

230
still and said nothing.
	
‘When we were little,’ the Mock Turtle went on at 
last, more calmly, though still sobbing a little now and 
then, ‘we went to school in the sea. The master was an old 
Turtle—we used to call him Tortoise—’
	
‘Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn’t one?’ 
Alice asked.
	
‘We called him Tortoise because he taught us,’ said 
the Mock Turtle angrily: ‘really you are very dull!’
	
‘You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking 
such a simple question,’ added the Gryphon; and then 
they both sat silent and looked at poor Alice, who felt 
ready to sink into the earth. At last the Gryphon said to 
the Mock Turtle, ‘Drive on, old fellow! Don’t be all day 
about it!’ and he went on in these words:
	
‘Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you 
mayn’t believe it—’
	
‘I never said I didn’t!’ interrupted Alice.
	
‘You did,’ said the Mock Turtle.
	
‘Hold your tongue!’ added the Gryphon, before Alice 
could speak again. The Mock Turtle went on.
	
‘We had the best of educations—in fact, we went to 
school every day—’
	
‘I’VE been to a day-school, too,’ said Alice; ‘you 
needn’t be so proud as all that.’

231
	
‘With extras?’ asked the Mock Turtle a little 		
anxiously.
	
‘Yes,’ said Alice, ‘we learned French and music.’
	
‘And washing?’ said the Mock Turtle.
	
‘Certainly not!’ said Alice indignantly.
	
‘Ah! then yours wasn’t a really good school,’ said 
the Mock Turtle in a tone of great relief. ‘Now at OURS 
they had at the end of the bill, “French, music, AND 
WASHING—extra.”’
	
‘You couldn’t have wanted it much,’ said Alice; ‘liv-
ing at the bottom of the sea.’
	
‘I couldn’t afford to learn it.’ said the Mock Turtle 
with a sigh. ‘I only took the regular course.’
	
‘What was that?’ inquired Alice.
	
‘Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,’ the 
Mock Turtle replied; ‘and then the different branches of 
Arithmetic—Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Deri-
sion.’
	
‘I never heard of “Uglification,”’ Alice ventured to 
say. ‘What is it?’
	
The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. 
‘What! Never heard of uglifying!’ it exclaimed. ‘You know 
what to beautify is, I suppose?’
	
‘Yes,’ said Alice doubtfully: ‘it means—to—make—
anything—prettier.’

‘Well, then,’ the Gryphon went on, ‘if you don’t 
know what to uglify is, you ARE a simpleton.’
	
Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more ques-
tions about it, so she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said 
‘What else had you to learn?’
	
‘Well, there was Mystery,’ the Mock Turtle replied, 
counting off the subjects on his flappers, ‘—Mystery, an-
cient and modern, with Seaography: then Drawling—the 
Drawling-master was an old conger-eel, that used to come 
once a week: HE taught us Drawling, Stretching, and 
Fainting in Coils.’
	
‘What was THAT like?’ said Alice.
	
‘Well, I can’t show it you myself,’ the Mock Turtle 
said: ‘I’m too stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.’
	
‘Hadn’t time,’ said the Gryphon: ‘I went to the Clas-
sics master, though. He was an old crab, HE was.’
	
‘I never went to him,’ the Mock Turtle said with a 
sigh: ‘he taught Laughing and Grief, they used to say.’
	
‘So he did, so he did,’ said the Gryphon, sighing in 
his turn; and both creatures hid their faces in their paws.
	
‘And how many hours a day did you do lessons?’ 
said Alice, in a hurry to change the subject.
	
‘Ten hours the first day,’ said the Mock Turtle: ‘nine 
the next, and so on.’
	
‘What a curious plan!’ exclaimed Alice.

233
	
‘That’s the reason they’re called lessons,’ the Gry-
phon remarked: ‘because they lessen from day to day.’
	
This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought 
it over a little before she made her next remark. ‘Then the 
eleventh day must have been a holiday?’
	
‘Of course it was,’ said the Mock Turtle.
	
‘And how did you manage on the twelfth?’ Alice 
went on eagerly.
	
‘That’s enough about lessons,’ the Gryphon inter-
rupted in a very decided tone: ‘tell her something about 
the games now.’

CHAPTER X. The Lobster 
Quadrille
	
The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back 
of one flapper across his eyes. He looked at Alice, and 
tried to speak, but for a minute or two sobs choked his 
voice. ‘Same as if he had a bone in his throat,’ said the 
Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching 
him in the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his 
voice, and, with tears running down his cheeks, he went 
on again:—
	
‘You may not have lived much under the sea—’ (‘I 
haven’t,’ said Alice)—’and perhaps you were never even 
introduced to a lobster—’ (Alice began to say ‘I once tast-
ed—’ but checked herself hastily, and said ‘No, never’) ‘—
so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a Lobster 
Quadrille is!’
	
‘No, indeed,’ said Alice. ‘What sort of a dance is it?’
	
‘Why,’ said the Gryphon, ‘you first form into a line 
along the sea-shore—’
	
‘Two lines!’ cried the Mock Turtle. ‘Seals, turtles, 
salmon, and so on; then, when you’ve cleared all the jelly-
fish out of the way—’
	
‘THAT generally takes some time,’ interrupted the 
Gryphon.
krismadden.com

235
	
‘—you advance twice—’
	
‘Each with a lobster as a partner!’ cried the Gry-
phon.
	
‘Of course,’ the Mock Turtle said: ‘advance twice, 
set to partners—’
	
‘—change lobsters, and retire in same order,’ con-
tinued the Gryphon.
	
‘Then, you know,’ the Mock Turtle went on, ‘you 
throw the—’
	
‘The lobsters!’ shouted the Gryphon, with a bound 
into the air.
	
‘—as far out to sea as you can—’
	
‘Swim after them!’ screamed the Gryphon.
	
‘Turn a somersault in the sea!’ cried the Mock Tur-
tle, capering wildly about.
	
‘Change lobsters again!’ yelled the Gryphon at the 
top of its voice.
	
‘Back to land again, and that’s all the first figure,’ 
said the Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and 
the two creatures, who had been jumping about like mad 
things all this time, sat down again very sadly and qui-
etly, and looked at Alice.
	
‘It must be a very pretty dance,’ said Alice timidly.
	
‘Would you like to see a little of it?’ said the Mock 
Turtle.

‘Very much indeed,’ said Alice.
	
‘Come, let’s try the first figure!’ said the Mock Tur-
tle to the Gryphon. ‘We can do without lobsters, you know. 
Which shall sing?’
	
‘Oh, YOU sing,’ said the Gryphon. ‘I’ve forgotten 
the words.’
	
So they began solemnly dancing round and round 
Alice, every now and then treading on her toes when they 
passed too close, and waving their forepaws to mark the 
time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly and 
sadly:—
 ‘”Will you walk a little faster?” said a whiting to a snail.
 “There’s a porpoise close behind us, and he’s treading on 
my tail.
 See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!
 They are waiting on the shingle—will you come and join 
the dance?
 Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the 
dance?
 Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the 
dance?
 “You can really have no notion how delightful it will be

 When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, 
out to sea!”
 But the snail replied “Too far, too far!” and gave a look 
askance—
 Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not 
join the dance.
 Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join 
the dance.
 Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join 
the dance.
 ‘”What matters it how far we go?” his scaly friend replied.
 “There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.
 The further off from England the nearer is to France—
 Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the 
dance.
 Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the 
dance?
 Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the 
dance?”’
	
‘Thank you, it’s a very interesting dance to watch,’ 
said Alice, feeling very glad that it was over at last: ‘and I

do so like that curious song about the whiting!’
	
‘Oh, as to the whiting,’ said the Mock Turtle, 
‘they—you’ve seen them, of course?’
	
‘Yes,’ said Alice, ‘I’ve often seen them at dinn—’ she 
checked herself hastily.
	
‘I don’t know where Dinn may be,’ said the Mock 
Turtle, ‘but if you’ve seen them so often, of course you 
know what they’re like.’
	
‘I believe so,’ Alice replied thoughtfully. ‘They have 
their tails in their mouths—and they’re all over crumbs.’
	
‘You’re wrong about the crumbs,’ said the Mock 
Turtle: ‘crumbs would all wash off in the sea. But they 
HAVE their tails in their mouths; and the reason is—’ 
here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his eyes.—’Tell 
her about the reason and all that,’ he said to the Gryphon.

These exercises focus on visualizing the meaning 
that the text represents. Exercises in this chapter are 
similar to some of the teaching methods behind “whole 
language” reading instruction. Throughout this chapter 
you’ll be shown pictures and asked to describe what you 
see in the picture in a variety of ways. This will aid you in 
developing concrete visual association with text.
	
These exercises can also be expanded outside of this 
chapter and the methods can be applied to pictures that 
you encounter throughout your everyday life. I also sug-
gest keeping a thesaurus and dictionary handy, to help 
find the best words to fit each picture. 
	
Remember, be as specific as possible when working 
through these exercises.

‘The reason is,’ said the Gryphon, ‘that they 
WOULD go with the lobsters to the dance. So they got 
thrown out to sea. So they had to fall a long way. So they 
got their tails fast in their mouths. So they couldn’t get 
them out again. That’s all.’ 
	
‘Thank you,’ said Alice, ‘it’s very interesting. I never 
knew so much about a whiting before.’ 
	
‘I can tell you more than that, if you like,’ said the 
Gryphon. ‘Do you know why it’s called a whiting?’ 
	
‘I never thought about it,’ said Alice. ‘Why?’ 
	
‘IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES.’ the Gryphon 
replied very solemnly. 
	
Alice was thoroughly puzzled. ‘Does the boots and 
shoes!’ she repeated in a wondering tone. 
	
‘Why, what are YOUR shoes done with?’ said the 
Gryphon. ‘I mean, what makes them so shiny?’ 
Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before 
she gave her answer. ‘They’re done with blacking, I be-
lieve.’ 
	
‘Boots and shoes under the sea,’ the Gryphon went 
on in a deep voice, ‘are done with a whiting. Now you 
know.’ 
	
‘And what are they made of?’ Alice asked in a tone 
of great curiosity. 
krismadden.com

273
	
‘Soles and eels, of course,’ the Gryphon replied 
rather impatiently: ‘any shrimp could have told you that.’ 
	
‘If I’d been the whiting,’ said Alice, whose thoughts 
were still running on the song, ‘I’d have said to the por-
poise, “Keep back, please: we don’t want YOU with us!”’ 
	
‘They were obliged to have him with them,’ the 
Mock Turtle said: ‘no wise fish would go anywhere with-
out a porpoise.’ 
	
‘Wouldn’t it really?’ said Alice in a tone of great sur-
prise. 
	
‘Of course not,’ said the Mock Turtle: ‘why, if a fish 
came to ME, and told me he was going a journey, I should 
say “With what porpoise?”’ 
	
‘Don’t you mean “purpose”?’ said Alice. 
	
‘I mean what I say,’ the Mock Turtle replied in an 
offended tone. And the Gryphon added ‘Come, let’s hear 
some of YOUR adventures.’ 
	
‘I could tell you my adventures—beginning from 
this morning,’ said Alice a little timidly: ‘but it’s no use 
going back to yesterday, because I was a different person 
then.’ 
	
‘Explain all that,’ said the Mock Turtle. 
	
‘No, no! The adventures first,’ said the Gryphon 
in an impatient tone: ‘explanations take such a dreadful 
time.’ 
	
So Alice began telling them her adventures from

the time when she first saw the White Rabbit. She was a 
little nervous about it just at first, the two creatures got 
so close to her, one on each side, and opened their eyes 
and mouths so VERY wide, but she gained courage as she 
went on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to 
the part about her repeating ‘YOU ARE OLD, FATHER 
WILLIAM,’ to the Caterpillar, and the words all coming 
different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, 
and said ‘That’s very curious.’ 
	
‘It’s all about as curious as it can be,’ said the Gry-
phon. 
	
‘It all came different!’ the Mock Turtle repeated 
thoughtfully. ‘I should like to hear her try and repeat 
something now. Tell her to begin.’ He looked at the Gry-
phon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over 
Alice. 
	
‘Stand up and repeat “’TIS THE VOICE OF THE 
SLUGGARD,”’ said the Gryphon. 
	
‘How the creatures order one about, and make one 
repeat lessons!’ thought Alice; ‘I might as well be at school 
at once.’ However, she got up, and began to repeat it, but 
her head was so full of the Lobster Quadrille, that she 
hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came 
very queer indeed:— 
	
‘’Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,   
“You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.”   
As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose   Trims his

belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.’         [later 
editions continued as follows   When the sands are all dry, 
he is gay as a lark,   And will talk in contemptuous tones 
of the Shark,   But, when the tide rises and sharks are 
around,   His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.] 
	
‘That’s different from what I used to say when I 
was a child,’ said the Gryphon. 
	
‘Well, I never heard it before,’ said the Mock Turtle; 
‘but it sounds uncommon nonsense.’ 
	
Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face 
in her hands, wondering if anything would EVER happen 
in a natural way again. 
	
‘I should like to have it explained,’ said the Mock 
Turtle. 
	
‘She can’t explain it,’ said the Gryphon hastily. ‘Go 
on with the next verse.’ 
	
‘But about his toes?’ the Mock Turtle persisted. 
‘How COULD he turn them out with his nose, you know?’ 
	
‘It’s the first position in dancing.’ Alice said; but 
was dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to 
change the subject. 
	
‘Go on with the next verse,’ the Gryphon repeated 
impatiently: ‘it begins “I passed by his garden.”’ 
	
Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure 
it would all come wrong, and she went on in a trembling 
voice:—

‘I passed by his garden, and marked, with one 
eye,   How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie—’      
[later editions continued as follows   The Panther took pie-
crust, and gravy, and meat,   While the Owl had the dish 
as its share of the treat.   When the pie was all finished, 
the Owl, as a boon,   Was kindly permitted to pocket the 
spoon:   While the Panther received knife and fork with a 
growl,   And concluded the banquet—] 
	
‘What IS the use of repeating all that stuff,’ the 
Mock Turtle interrupted, ‘if you don’t explain it as you go 
on? It’s by far the most confusing thing I ever heard!’ 
	
‘Yes, I think you’d better leave off,’ said the Gry-
phon: and Alice was only too glad to do so. 
	
‘Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Qua-
drille?’ the Gryphon went on. ‘Or would you like the Mock 
Turtle to sing you a song?’ 
	
‘Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so 
kind,’ Alice replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a 
rather offended tone, ‘Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing 
her “Turtle Soup,” will you, old fellow?’ 
	
The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a 
voice sometimes choked with sobs, to sing this:— 
	
‘Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,    Wait-
ing in a hot tureen!    Who for such dainties would not 
stoop?    Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!    Soup of

Soo—oop!      Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!    Soo—oop of the

‘Chorus again!’ cried the Gryphon, and the Mock 
Turtle had just begun to repeat it, when a cry of ‘The tri-
al’s beginning!’ was heard in the distance. 
	
‘Come on!’ cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by 
the hand, it hurried off, without waiting for the end of the 
song. 
	
‘What trial is it?’ Alice panted as she ran; but the 
Gryphon only answered ‘Come on!’ and ran the faster, 
while more and more faintly came, carried on the breeze 
that followed them, the melancholy words:— 
	
‘Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,      Beautiful, beau-

CHAPTER XI. Who Stole the Tarts? 
	
The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their 
throne when they arrived, with a great crowd assembled 
about them—all sorts of little birds and beasts, as well as 
the whole pack of cards: the Knave was standing before 
them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard him; 
and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet 
in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the 
very middle of the court was a table, with a large dish of 
tarts upon it: they looked so good, that it made Alice quite 
hungry to look at them—’I wish they’d get the trial done,’ 
she thought, ‘and hand round the refreshments!’ But 
there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking 
at everything about her, to pass away the time. 
	
Alice had never been in a court of justice before, 
but she had read about them in books, and she was quite 
pleased to find that she knew the name of nearly every-
thing there. ‘That’s the judge,’ she said to herself, ‘because 
of his great wig.’ 
	
The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he 
wore his crown over the wig, (look at the frontispiece if 
you want to see how he did it,) he did not look at all com-
fortable, and it was certainly not becoming. 
	
‘And that’s the jury-box,’ thought Alice, ‘and those 
twelve creatures,’ (she was obliged to say ‘creatures,’ 
you see, because some of them were animals, and some 
krismadden.com

279
were birds,) ‘I suppose they are the jurors.’ She said this 
last word two or three times over to herself, being rather 
proud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few 
little girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all. How-
ever, ‘jury-men’ would have done just as well. 
	
The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on 
slates. ‘What are they doing?’ Alice whispered to the Gry-
phon. ‘They can’t have anything to put down yet, before 
the trial’s begun.’ 
	
‘They’re putting down their names,’ the Gryphon 
whispered in reply, ‘for fear they should forget them be-
fore the end of the trial.’ 
	
‘Stupid things!’ Alice began in a loud, indignant 
voice, but she stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried 
out, ‘Silence in the court!’ and the King put on his spec-
tacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who was 
talking. 
	
Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over 
their shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down 
‘stupid things!’ on their slates, and she could even make 
out that one of them didn’t know how to spell ‘stupid,’ 
and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. ‘A nice 
muddle their slates’ll be in before the trial’s over!’ thought 
Alice. 
	
One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This 
of course, Alice could not stand, and she went round the 
court and got behind him, and very soon found an op-

portunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly that the 
poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make 
out at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all 
about for it, he was obliged to write with one finger for the 
rest of the day; and this was of very little use, as it left no 
mark on the slate. 
	
‘Herald, read the accusation!’ said the King. 
	
On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the 
trumpet, and then unrolled the parchment scroll, and 
read as follows:— 
	
‘The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts, All 
on a summer day:     The Knave of Hearts, he stole those 
tarts, And took them quite away!’ 
	
‘Consider your verdict,’ the King said to the jury. 
	
‘Not yet, not yet!’ the Rabbit hastily interrupted. 
‘There’s a great deal to come before that!’ 
	
‘Call the first witness,’ said the King; and the White 
Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, 
‘First witness!’ 
	
The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a 
teacup in one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the 
other. ‘I beg pardon, your Majesty,’ he began, ‘for bringing 
these in: but I hadn’t quite finished my tea when I was 
sent for.’ 
	
‘You ought to have finished,’ said the King. ‘When 
did you begin?’ 
krismadden.com

281
	
The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had fol-
lowed him into the court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. 
‘Fourteenth of March, I think it was,’ he said. 
	
‘Fifteenth,’ said the March Hare. 
	
‘Sixteenth,’ added the Dormouse. 
	
‘Write that down,’ the King said to the jury, and the 
jury eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates, 
and then added them up, and reduced the answer to shil-
lings and pence. 
	
‘Take off your hat,’ the King said to the Hatter. 
	
‘It isn’t mine,’ said the Hatter. 
	
‘Stolen!’ the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, 
who instantly made a memorandum of the fact. 
	
‘I keep them to sell,’ the Hatter added as an expla-
nation; ‘I’ve none of my own. I’m a hatter.’ 
	
Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began 
staring at the Hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted. 
	
‘Give your evidence,’ said the King; ‘and don’t be 
nervous, or I’ll have you executed on the spot.’ 
	
This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: 
he kept shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneas-
ily at the Queen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece 
out of his teacup instead of the bread-and-butter. 
	
Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sen-
sation, which puzzled her a good deal until she made out 
what it was: she was beginning to grow larger again, and

she thought at first she would get up and leave the court; 
but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she 
was as long as there was room for her. 
	
‘I wish you wouldn’t squeeze so.’ said the Dor-
mouse, who was sitting next to her. ‘I can hardly breathe.’ 
	
‘I can’t help it,’ said Alice very meekly: ‘I’m grow-
ing.’ 
	
‘You’ve no right to grow here,’ said the Dormouse. 
	
‘Don’t talk nonsense,’ said Alice more boldly: ‘you 
know you’re growing too.’ 
	
‘Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,’ said the Dor-
mouse: ‘not in that ridiculous fashion.’ And he got up very 
sulkily and crossed over to the other side of the court. 
	
All this time the Queen had never left off star-
ing at the Hatter, and, just as the Dormouse crossed the 
court, she said to one of the officers of the court, ‘Bring 
me the list of the singers in the last concert!’ on which the 
wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes 
off. 
	
‘Give your evidence,’ the King repeated angrily, ‘or 
I’ll have you executed, whether you’re nervous or not.’ 
	
‘I’m a poor man, your Majesty,’ the Hatter began, 
in a trembling voice, ‘—and I hadn’t begun my tea—not 
above a week or so—and what with the bread-and-butter 
getting so thin—and the twinkling of the tea—’ 
	
‘The twinkling of the what?’ said the King.

283
	
‘It began with the tea,’ the Hatter replied. 
	
‘Of course twinkling begins with a T!’ said the King 
sharply. ‘Do you take me for a dunce? Go on!’ 
	
‘I’m a poor man,’ the Hatter went on, ‘and most 
things twinkled after that—only the March Hare said—’ 
	
‘I didn’t!’ the March Hare interrupted in a great 
hurry. 
	
‘You did!’ said the Hatter. 
	
‘I deny it!’ said the March Hare. 
	
‘He denies it,’ said the King: ‘leave out that part.’ 
	
‘Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said—’ the Hatter 
went on, looking anxiously round to see if he would deny 
it too: but the Dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep. 
	
‘After that,’ continued the Hatter, ‘I cut some more 
bread-and-butter—’ 
	
‘But what did the Dormouse say?’ one of the jury 
asked. 
	
‘That I can’t remember,’ said the Hatter. 
	
‘You MUST remember,’ remarked the King, ‘or I’ll 
have you executed.’ 
	
The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and 
bread-and-butter, and went down on one knee. ‘I’m a poor 
man, your Majesty,’ he began. 
	
‘You’re a very poor speaker,’ said the King. 
	
Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was im-

mediately suppressed by the officers of the court. (As that 
is rather a hard word, I will just explain to you how it was 
done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied up at the 
mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig, 
head first, and then sat upon it.) 
	
‘I’m glad I’ve seen that done,’ thought Alice. ‘I’ve so 
often read in the newspapers, at the end of trials, “There 
was some attempts at applause, which was immediately 
suppressed by the officers of the court,” and I never un-
derstood what it meant till now.’ 
	
‘If that’s all you know about it, you may stand 
down,’ continued the King. 
	
‘I can’t go no lower,’ said the Hatter: ‘I’m on the 
floor, as it is.’ 
	
‘Then you may SIT down,’ the King replied. 
	
Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was sup-
pressed. 
	
‘Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!’ thought Alice. 
‘Now we shall get on better.’ 
	
‘I’d rather finish my tea,’ said the Hatter, with an 
anxious look at the Queen, who was reading the list of 
singers. 
	
‘You may go,’ said the King, and the Hatter hur-
riedly left the court, without even waiting to put his shoes 
on. 
	
‘—and just take his head off outside,’ the Queen

added to one of the officers: but the Hatter was out of 
sight before the officer could get to the door. 
	
‘Call the next witness!’ said the King. 
	
The next witness was the Duchess’s cook. She car-
ried the pepper-box in her hand, and Alice guessed who 
it was, even before she got into the court, by the way the 
people near the door began sneezing all at once. 
	
‘Give your evidence,’ said the King. 
	
‘Shan’t,’ said the cook. 
	
The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, 
who said in a low voice, ‘Your Majesty must cross-examine 
THIS witness.’ 
	
‘Well, if I must, I must,’ the King said, with a mel-
ancholy air, and, after folding his arms and frowning at 
the cook till his eyes were nearly out of sight, he said in a 
deep voice, ‘What are tarts made of?’ 
	
‘Pepper, mostly,’ said the cook. 
	
‘Treacle,’ said a sleepy voice behind her. 
	
‘Collar that Dormouse,’ the Queen shrieked out. 
‘Behead that Dormouse! Turn that Dormouse out of court! 
Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his whiskers!’ 
	
For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, 
getting the Dormouse turned out, and, by the time they 
had settled down again, the cook had disappeared. 
	
‘Never mind!’ said the King, with an air of great re-
lief. ‘Call the next witness.’ And he added in an undertone

to the Queen, ‘Really, my dear, YOU must cross-examine 
the next witness. It quite makes my forehead ache!’ 
	
Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over 
the list, feeling very curious to see what the next witness 
would be like, ‘—for they haven’t got much evidence YET,’ 
she said to herself. Imagine her surprise, when the White 
Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the 
name ‘Alice!’

“Imigization” is an imaginary word I use to describe 
the exercises in this chapter. The exercises help expand 
your field of vision and helping you look at a page, not as a 
container of multiple symbols, but a container of one sym-
bol. Think about all the different brush strokes that make 
up a Van Gogh painting, but when we look at the painting 
we do not look at each brush individually to see the whole 
picture, instead we look at all of the strokes collectively 
and see the painting entirely. These exercises assist read-
ers in developing skills used to see text in a way that one 
sees a painting. 
	
If you find this section too easy, make sure you are 
not falling into your old habits of vocalizing the words, or 
shifting your gaze from point to point.

To further develop the skill of visualizing a number with 
text, each number is spliced in between its representa-
tive word. Keep your eyes focused on the “X” and count 
the numbers as you find them, and place a priority on 
not voicing any of the numbers, but line them up in a row 
within your mind as you find each consecutive number.

CHAPTER XII Alice’s Evidence 
	
‘Here!’ cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of 
the moment how large she had grown in the last few min-
utes, and she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped 
over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt, upsetting all 
the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there 
they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a 
globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset the week be-
fore. 
	
‘Oh, I BEG your pardon!’ she exclaimed in a tone of 
great dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly 
as she could, for the accident of the goldfish kept running 
in her head, and she had a vague sort of idea that they 
must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box, 
or they would die. 
	
‘The trial cannot proceed,’ said the King in a very 
grave voice, ‘until all the jurymen are back in their proper 
places—ALL,’ he repeated with great emphasis, looking 
hard at Alice as he said do. 
	
Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her 
haste, she had put the Lizard in head downwards, and 
the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a mel-
ancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon got it 
out again, and put it right; ‘not that it signifies much,’ she 
krismadden.com

321
said to herself; ‘I should think it would be QUITE as much 
use in the trial one way up as the other.’ 
	
As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the 
shock of being upset, and their slates and pencils had 
been found and handed back to them, they set to work 
very diligently to write out a history of the accident, all 
except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do 
anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the 
roof of the court. 
	
‘What do you know about this business?’ the King 
said to Alice. 
	
‘Nothing,’ said Alice. 
	
‘Nothing WHATEVER?’ persisted the King. 
	
‘Nothing whatever,’ said Alice. 
	
‘That’s very important,’ the King said, turning to 
the jury. They were just beginning to write this down on 
their slates, when the White Rabbit interrupted: ‘UNim-
portant, your Majesty means, of course,’ he said in a very 
respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as 
he spoke. 
	
‘UNimportant, of course, I meant,’ the King hastily 
said, and went on to himself in an undertone, 
	
‘important—unimportant—unimportant—impor-
tant—’ as if he were trying which word sounded best. 
	
Some of the jury wrote it down ‘important,’ and 
some ‘unimportant.’ Alice could see this, as she was near

enough to look over their slates; ‘but it doesn’t matter a 
bit,’ she thought to herself. 
	
At this moment the King, who had been for some 
time busily writing in his note-book, cackled out ‘Silence!’ 
and read out from his book, ‘Rule Forty-two. ALL PER-
SONS MORE THAN A MILE HIGH TO LEAVE THE 
COURT.’ 
	
Everybody looked at Alice. 
	
‘I’M not a mile high,’ said Alice. 
	
‘You are,’ said the King. 
	
‘Nearly two miles high,’ added the Queen. 
	
‘Well, I shan’t go, at any rate,’ said Alice: ‘besides, 
that’s not a regular rule: you invented it just now.’ 
	
‘It’s the oldest rule in the book,’ said the King. 
	
‘Then it ought to be Number One,’ said Alice. 
	
The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hast-
ily. ‘Consider your verdict,’ he said to the jury, in a low, 
trembling voice. 
	
‘There’s more evidence to come yet, please your 
Majesty,’ said the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great 
hurry; ‘this paper has just been picked up.’ 
	
‘What’s in it?’ said the Queen. 
	
‘I haven’t opened it yet,’ said the White Rabbit, 
‘but it seems to be a letter, written by the prisoner to—to 
somebody.’ 
krismadden.com

323
	
‘It must have been that,’ said the King, ‘unless it 
was written to nobody, which isn’t usual, you know.’ 
	
‘Who is it directed to?’ said one of the jurymen. 
	
‘It isn’t directed at all,’ said the White Rabbit; ‘in 
fact, there’s nothing written on the OUTSIDE.’ He unfold-
ed the paper as he spoke, and added ‘It isn’t a letter, after 
all: it’s a set of verses.’ 
	
‘Are they in the prisoner’s handwriting?’ asked an-
other of the jurymen. 
	
‘No, they’re not,’ said the White Rabbit, ‘and that’s 
the queerest thing about it.’ (The jury all looked puzzled.) 
	
‘He must have imitated somebody else’s hand,’ said 
the King. (The jury all brightened up again.) 
	
‘Please your Majesty,’ said the Knave, ‘I didn’t 
write it, and they can’t prove I did: there’s no name signed 
at the end.’ 
	
‘If you didn’t sign it,’ said the King, ‘that only 
makes the matter worse. You MUST have meant some 
mischief, or else you’d have signed your name like an hon-
est man.’ 
	
There was a general clapping of hands at this: it 
was the first really clever thing the King had said that 
day. 
	
‘That PROVES his guilt,’ said the Queen. 
	
‘It proves nothing of the sort!’ said Alice. ‘Why, you 
don’t even know what they’re about!’

‘Read them,’ said the King. 
	
The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. ‘Where 
shall I begin, please your Majesty?’ he asked. 
	
‘Begin at the beginning,’ the King said gravely, ‘and 
go on till you come to the end: then stop.’ 
	
These were the verses the White Rabbit read:— 
	
‘They told me you had been to her,     
	
And mentioned me to him:    
	
She gave me a good character,     
	
But said I could not swim. 
    
	
He sent them word I had not gone     
	
(We know it to be true):    
	
If she should push the matter on,     
	
What would become of you?
	
I gave her one, they gave him two,     
	
You gave us three or more;    
	
They all returned from him to you,     
	
Though they were mine before.   
  
	
If I or she should chance to be     
	
Involved in this affair,    
	
He trusts to you to set them free,     
	
Exactly as we were.

My notion was that you had been

An obstacle that came between     
	
Him, and ourselves, and it.     
	
Don’t let him know she liked them best,     
	
For this must ever be    
	
A secret, kept from all the rest,     
	
Between yourself and me.’ 
	
‘That’s the most important piece of evidence we’ve 
heard yet,’ said the King, rubbing his hands; ‘so now let 
the jury—’ 
	
‘If any one of them can explain it,’ said Alice, (she 
had grown so large in the last few minutes that she 
wasn’t a bit afraid of interrupting him,) ‘I’ll give him six-
pence. I don’t believe there’s an atom of meaning in it.’ 
	
The jury all wrote down on their slates, ‘SHE 
doesn’t believe there’s an atom of meaning in it,’ but none 
of them attempted to explain the paper. 
	
‘If there’s no meaning in it,’ said the King, ‘that 
saves a world of trouble, you know, as we needn’t try to 
find any. And yet I don’t know,’ he went on, spreading out 
the verses on his knee, and looking at them with one eye; 
‘I seem to see some meaning in them, after all. “—SAID I 
COULD NOT SWIM—” you can’t swim, can you?’ he add-
ed, turning to the Knave. 
	
The Knave shook his head sadly. ‘Do I look like it?’

he said. (Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely 
of cardboard.) 
	
‘All right, so far,’ said the King, and he went on 
muttering over the verses to himself: ‘”WE KNOW IT TO 
BE TRUE—” that’s the jury, of course—”I GAVE HER 
ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO—” why, that must be what 
he did with the tarts, you know—’ 
	
‘But, it goes on “THEY ALL RETURNED FROM 
HIM TO YOU,”’ said Alice. 
	
‘Why, there they are!’ said the King triumphantly, 
pointing to the tarts on the table. ‘Nothing can be clearer 
than THAT. Then again—”BEFORE SHE HAD THIS 
FIT—” you never had fits, my dear, I think?’ he said to the 
Queen. 
	
‘Never!’ said the Queen furiously, throwing an ink-
stand at the Lizard as she spoke. (The unfortunate little 
Bill had left off writing on his slate with one finger, as he 
found it made no mark; but he now hastily began again, 
using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as 
it lasted.) 
	
‘Then the words don’t FIT you,’ said the King, look-
ing round the court with a smile. There was a dead si-
lence. 
	
‘It’s a pun!’ the King added in an offended tone, and 
everybody laughed, ‘Let the jury consider their verdict,’ 
the King said, for about the twentieth time that day. 
	
‘No, no!’ said the Queen. ‘Sentence first—verdict

afterwards.’ 
	
‘Stuff and nonsense!’ said Alice loudly. ‘The idea of 
having the sentence first!’ 
	
‘Hold your tongue!’ said the Queen, turning purple. 
	
‘I won’t!’ said Alice. 
	
‘Off with her head!’ the Queen shouted at the top of 
her voice. Nobody moved. 
	
‘Who cares for you?’ said Alice, (she had grown to 
her full size by this time.) ‘You’re nothing but a pack of 
cards!’ 
	
At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and 
came flying down upon her: she gave a little scream, half 
of fright and half of anger, and tried to beat them off, and 
found herself lying on the bank, with her head in the lap 
of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead 
leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her 
face. 
	
‘Wake up, Alice dear!’ said her sister; ‘Why, what a 
long sleep you’ve had!’ 
	
‘Oh, I’ve had such a curious dream!’ said Alice, and 
she told her sister, as well as she could remember them, 
all these strange Adventures of hers that you have just 
been reading about; and when she had finished, her sister 
kissed her, and said, ‘It WAS a curious dream, dear, cer-
tainly: but now run in to your tea; it’s getting late.’ So Al-
ice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she

might, what a wonderful dream it had been. 
	
But her sister sat still just as she left her, lean-
ing her head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and 
thinking of little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, 
till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and this was 
her dream:— 
	
First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once 
again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and 
the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers—she 
could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that queer 
little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair 
that WOULD always get into her eyes—and still as she 
listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place around her 
became alive the strange creatures of her little sister’s 
dream. 
	
The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rab-
bit hurried by—the frightened Mouse splashed his way 
through the neighbouring pool—she could hear the rattle 
of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends shared 
their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen 
ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution—once 
more the pig-baby was sneezing on the Duchess’s knee, 
while plates and dishes crashed around it—once more the 
shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard’s slate-
pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs, 
filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miser-
able Mock Turtle.

So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed 
herself in Wonderland, though she knew she had but to 
open them again, and all would change to dull reality—
the grass would be only rustling in the wind, and the pool 
rippling to the waving of the reeds—the rattling teacups 
would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen’s 
shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy—and the 
sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and all the 
other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the con-
fused clamour of the busy farm-yard—while the lowing of 
the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock 
Turtle’s heavy sobs. 
	
Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little 
sister of hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown 
woman; and how she would keep, through all her riper 
years, the simple and loving heart of her childhood: and 
how she would gather about her other little children, and 
make THEIR eyes bright and eager with many a strange 
tale, perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long 
ago: and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows, 
and find a pleasure in all their simple joys, remembering 
her own child-life, and the happy summer days.

Congratulations! 
	
You have made it to the end of this work book, and 
have gained a new set of abilities and skills to use in your 
everyday reading. But remember, like all skill, they 	
weaken, the less that you practice them. 
	
My suggestion, practice an exercise, or a couple if 
you like, prior to an extended reading session. This helps 
in preventing you reverting back to your old habits. And 
remember that voicing the words that are printed on a 
page is not a bad skill. It is a great skil, but a bad habit. 
You have four other senses at your disposal for extracting 
meaning from a text. Your larynx has had the monopoly 
for too long, it’s time for a change.
	
Now, go and read, read, read, read, read, read.
