Author’s Acknowledgments
I am extremely grateful to the team of talented professionals at John Wiley 
and Sons for all their efforts in putting together this book. Special thanks go 
to my awesome project editor, Kim Darosett, who is the type of editor that 
all authors hope for but rarely experience: supportive, skilled, and amazingly 
calm in the face of any storm, including my not infrequent freakouts.
I also owe much to the rest of the folks in both the editorial and art depart-
ments, especially Heidi Unger, Steve Hayes, Andy Cummings, and Mary 
Bednarek. Thanks, too, to Jonathan Conrad for providing the awesome 
nighttime shot for Chapter 7, and to agent extraordinaire, Margot Maley 
Hutchison, for her continuing help and encouragement.
Last but oh, so not least, I am deeply indebted to Canon guru Chuck Westfall 
for always answering all my questions, even the silly ones; to Scott Heath 
at Synergy Communications for his help with this book and various other 
projects; and to technical editor David Hall, whose keen eye and vast experi-
ence set me on the right track whenever I mistakenly thought I should go left. 
Thank you, thank you, for sharing your time and your expertise — the book 
would not have been the same without it.

Canon EOS Rebel XS/1000D For Dummies 

Introduction
I
n 2003, when Canon introduced the very first sub-$1000 digital SLR 
camera, the EOS Rebel/300D, it revolutionized the camera scene. For the 
first time, photography enthusiasts could enjoy the benefits of digital SLR 
photography without breaking the bank. And even at the then-unheard-of 
price, the camera delivered exceptional performance and picture quality, 
earning it rave reviews and multiple industry awards. No wonder it quickly 
became a best seller.
That tradition of excellence and value lives on in the EOS Rebel XS/1000D. 
Available for a price well below that of its 2003 ancestor, this baby offers the 
range of advanced controls that experienced photographers demand plus an 
assortment of tools designed to help beginners to be successful as well.
If you count yourself among the latter camp, you may have a few questions 
about how to take advantage of all the features your camera offers, however. 
For starters, you may not even be sure what SLR means or how it affects 
your picture taking, let alone have a clue as to all the other techie terms 
you encounter in your camera manual — resolution, aperture, white balance, 
file format, and so on. And if you’re like many people, you may be so over-
whelmed by all the controls on your camera that you haven’t yet ventured 
beyond fully automatic picture-taking mode. Which is a shame because it’s 
sort of like buying a Porsche and never actually taking it on the road.
Therein lies the point of Canon EOS Rebel XS/1000D For Dummies: Through 
this book, you can discover not just what each bell and whistle on your 
camera does, but also when, where, why, and how to put it to best use. 
Unlike many photography books, this one doesn’t require any previous 
knowledge of photography or digital imaging to make sense of things, either. 
In classic For Dummies style, everything is explained in easy-to-understand 
language, with lots of illustrations to help clear up any confusion.
In short, what you have in your hands is the paperback version of an in-depth 
photography workshop tailored specifically to your Canon picture-taking 
powerhouse. Whether your interests lie in taking family photos, exploring 
nature and travel photography, or snapping product shots for your business, 
you’ll get the information you need to capture the images you envision.

Canon EOS Rebel XS/1000D For Dummies 
A Quick Look at What’s Ahead
This book is organized into four parts, each devoted to a different aspect of 
using your camera. Although chapters flow in a sequence that’s designed to 
take you from absolute beginner to experienced user, I’ve also tried to make 
each chapter as self-standing as possible so that you can explore the topics 
that interest you in any order you please.
The following sections offer brief previews of each part. If you’re eager to find 
details on a specific topic, the index shows you exactly where to look.
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps
Part I contains four chapters that help you get up and running with your 
Rebel XS/1000D:
 
✓ Chapter 1, “Getting the Lay of the Land,” offers a tour of the external 
controls on your camera, shows you how to navigate camera menus to 
access internal options, and walks you through initial camera setup and 
customization steps.
 
✓ Chapter 2, “Taking Great Pictures, Automatically,” shows you how to 
get the best results when using the camera’s fully automatic exposure 
modes, including Portrait, Sports, and Landscape modes.
 
✓ Chapter 3, “Controlling Picture Quality,” introduces you to one setting 
that’s critical whether you shoot in automatic or manual mode: the 
Quality setting, which affects resolution (pixel count), file format, file 
size, and picture quality.
 
✓ Chapter 4, “Monitor Matters: Picture Playback and Live View Shooting,” 
explains how to review your pictures on the camera monitor, delete 
unwanted images, and protect your favorites from accidental erasure. 
In addition, this chapter introduces you to Live View shooting, in which 
you can use your monitor as a viewfinder.
Part II: Taking Creative Control
Chapters in this part help you unleash the full creative power of your camera 
by moving into semiautomatic or manual photography modes.
 
✓ Chapter 5, “Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting,” covers the 
all-important topic of exposure, starting with an explanation of three 
critical exposure controls: aperture, shutter speed, and ISO. This chap-
ter also discusses your camera’s advanced exposure modes (P, Tv, Av, 
M, and A-DEP), explains exposure options such as metering mode and 
exposure compensation, and offers tips for using the built-in flash.

3
 Introduction
 
✓ Chapter 6, “Manipulating Focus and Color,” provides help with control-
ling those aspects of your pictures. Look here for information about 
your camera’s automatic and manual focusing features as well as 
details about color controls such as white balance and the Picture Style 
options.
 
✓ Chapter 7, “Putting It All Together,” summarizes all the techniques 
explained in earlier chapters, providing a quick-reference guide to the 
camera settings and shooting strategies that produce the best results 
for specific types of pictures: portraits, action shots, landscape scenes, 
close-ups, and more.
Part III: Working with Picture Files
This part of the book, as its title implies, discusses the often-confusing aspect 
of moving your pictures from camera to computer and beyond.
 
✓ Chapter 8, “Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Photos,” 
guides you through the process of transferring pictures from your 
camera memory card to your computer’s hard drive or other storage 
device. Just as important, this chapter explains how to organize and 
safeguard your photo files. 
 
✓ Chapter 9, “Printing and Sharing Your Photos,” helps you turn your digi-
tal files into “hard copies,” covering both retail and do-it-yourself print-
ing options. This chapter also explains how to prepare your pictures for 
online sharing and, for times when you have the neighbors over, how to 
display your pictures on a television screen.
Part IV: The Part of Tens
In famous For Dummies tradition, the book concludes with two “top ten” lists 
containing additional bits of information and advice.
 
✓ Chapter 10, “Ten Fast Photo-Editing Tricks,” shows you how to fix less-
than-perfect images using the free software provided with your camera. 
You can find out how to remove red-eye, adjust color and exposure, 
crop your photo, and more.
 
✓ Chapter 11, “Ten Special-Purpose Features to Explore on a Rainy Day,” 
presents information about some camera features that, while not found 
on most “Top Ten Reasons I Bought My Rebel XS/1000D” lists, are none-
theless interesting, useful on occasion, or a bit of both.

4
Canon EOS Rebel XS/1000D For Dummies 
Icons and Other Stuff to Note
If this isn’t your first For Dummies book, you may be familiar with the large, 
round icons that decorate its margins. If not, here’s your very own icon-
decoder ring: 
 
✓ A Tip icon flags information that will save you time, effort, money, or 
some other valuable resource, including your sanity.
 
✓ When you see this icon, look alive. It indicates a potential danger zone 
that can result in much wailing and teeth-gnashing if ignored.
 
✓ Lots of information in this book is of a technical nature — digital photog-
raphy is a technical animal, after all. But if I present a detail that is useful 
mainly for impressing your technology-geek friends, I mark it with this 
icon.
 
✓ I apply this icon either to introduce information that is especially worth 
storing in your brain’s long-term memory or to remind you of a fact that 
may have been displaced from that memory by some other pressing 
fact.
Additionally, I need to point out two other details that will help you use this 
book:
 
✓ Other margin art: Replicas of some of your camera’s buttons, dials, 
controls, and menu graphics also appear in the margins of some para-
graphs. I include these to provide a quick reminder of the appearance of 
the button or option being discussed. 
 
✓ Software menu commands: In sections that cover software, a series 
of words connected by an arrow indicates commands that you choose 
from the program menus. For example, if a step tells you to “Choose 
File➪Print,” click the File menu to unfurl it and then click the Print com-
mand on the menu.
 
✓ Camera firmware: Firmware is the internal software that controls many 
of your camera’s operations. This book was written using version 1.0.3 
of the firmware, which was the most current at the time of publication. 
 
 Occasionally, Canon releases firmware updates, and it’s a good idea to 
check the Canon Web site (www.canon.com) periodically to find out 
whether any updates are available. (Chapter 1 tells you how to deter-
mine which firmware version your camera is running.) Firmware updates 
typically don’t carry major feature changes — they’re mostly used to 
solve technical glitches in existing features — but if you do download an 
update, be sure to read the accompanying description of what it accom-
plishes so that you can adapt my instructions as necessary.

 Introduction
About the Software Shown in This Book
Providing specific instructions for performing photo organizing and edit-
ing tasks requires that I feature specific software. In sections that cover 
file downloading, organizing, printing, and e-mail sharing, I selected Canon 
EOS Utility along with Canon ZoomBrowser EX (for Windows users) and 
ImageBrowser (for Mac users). These programs are part of the free software 
suite that ships with your camera.
Rest assured, though, that the tools used in these programs work very 
similarly in other programs, so you should be able to easily adapt the steps 
to whatever software you use. (I recommend that you read your software 
manual for details, of course.)
Practice, Be Patient, and Have Fun!
To wrap up this preamble, I want to stress that if you initially think that 
digital photography is too confusing or too technical for you, you’re in very 
good company. Everyone finds this stuff a little mind-boggling at first. So take 
it slowly, experimenting with just one or two new camera settings or tech-
niques at first. Then, each time you go on a photo outing, make it a point to 
add one or two more shooting skills to your repertoire. 
I know that it’s hard to believe when you’re just starting out, but it really 
won’t be long before everything starts to come together. With some time, 
patience, and practice, you’ll soon wield your camera like a pro, dialing in the 
necessary settings to capture your creative vision almost instinctively.
So without further ado, I invite you to grab your camera, a cup of whatever it 
is you prefer to sip while you read, and start exploring the rest of this book. 
Your Rebel XS/1000D is the perfect partner for your photographic journey, 
and I thank you for allowing me, through this book, to serve as your tour 
guide.

Super Snaps

In this part . . .
M
aking sense of all the controls on your 
Rebel XS/1000D isn’t something you can do 
in an afternoon — heck, in a week, or maybe even 
a month. But that doesn’t mean that you can’t 
take great pictures today. By using your camera’s 
point-and-shoot automatic modes, you can cap-
ture terriﬁ c images with very little effort. All you 
do is compose the scene, and the camera takes 
care of almost everything else.
This part shows you how to take best advantage 
of your camera’s automatic features and also 
addresses some basic setup steps, such as adjust-
ing the viewﬁ nder to your eyesight and getting 
familiar with the camera menus, buttons, and 
dials. In addition, chapters in this part explain 
how to obtain the very best picture quality, 
whether you shoot in an automatic or manual 
mode, how to use your camera’s picture-playback 
features, and how to take advantage of Live View 
shooting.

I
 still remember the day that I bought my first SLR film camera. I was 
excited to finally move up from my one-button point-and-shoot 
camera, but I was a little anxious, too. My new pride and joy 
sported several unfamiliar buttons and dials, and the expla-
nations in the camera manual clearly were written for 
someone with an engineering degree. And then there 
was the whole business of attaching the lens to the 
camera, an entirely new task for me. I saved up my 
pennies a long time for that camera — what if my 
inexperience caused me to damage the thing before 
I even shot my first pictures?
You may be feeling similarly insecure if your Rebel 
XS/1000D is your first SLR, although some of the 
buttons on the camera back may look familiar if 
you’ve previously used a digital point-and-shoot 
camera. If your Canon is both your first SLR and first 
digital camera, you may be doubly intimidated.
Trust me, though, that your camera isn’t nearly as complicated as 
its exterior makes it appear. With a little practice and the help of this chap-
ter, which introduces you to each external control, you’ll quickly become as 
comfortable with your camera’s buttons and dials as you are with the ones 
on your car’s dashboard.

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
This chapter also guides you through the process of mounting and using an 
SLR lens, working with digital memory cards, and navigating your camera’s 
internal menus. Finally, the end of the chapter walks you through options 
that enable you to customize many aspects of your camera’s basic operation.
 
Before you start exploring this chapter, be sure that you fully charge your 
camera battery and then install it into the battery chamber on the bottom of 
the camera. I’m guessing that you have already taken this step, but if not and 
you need help, the front part of the camera manual provides details.
Getting Comfortable with Your Lens
One of the biggest differences between a point-and-shoot camera and an SLR 
(single-lens reflex) camera is the lens. With an SLR, you can swap out lenses 
to suit different photographic needs, going from an extreme close-up lens to 
a super-long telephoto, for example. In addition, an SLR lens has a movable 
focusing ring that gives you the option of focusing manually instead of relying 
on the camera’s autofocus mechanism.
Of course, those added capabilities mean that you need a little background 
information to take full advantage of your lens. To that end, the next three 
sections explain the process of attaching, removing, and using this critical 
part of your camera.
Attaching a lens
Your camera can accept two categories of Canon lenses: those with a so-
called EF-S design and those with a plain-old EF design.
 
The EF stands for electro focus; the S, for short back focus. And no, you don’t 
really need to remember that little detail — but you do need to make sure 
that if you buy a Canon lens other than the one sold with the camera, it car-
ries either the EF or EF-S specification. (If you want to buy a non-Canon lens, 
check the lens manufacturer’s Web site to find out which lenses work with 
the Rebel XS/1000D.)
Whatever lens you choose, follow these steps to attach it to the camera body:
 
1. Remove the cap that covers the lens mount on the front of the camera.
 
2. Remove the cap that covers the back of the lens.
 
3. Locate the proper lens mounting index on the camera body.
 
 A mounting index is simply a marker that tells you where to align the 
lens with the camera body when connecting the two. Your camera has 
two of these markers, one red and one white, as shown in Figure 1-1.

11
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
 
 Which marker you use to align your lens depends on the lens type:
 
• Canon EF-S lens: Align the lens mounting index with the white 
square on the camera body.
 
• Canon EF lens: Align the lens mounting index with the red dot 
instead.
 
 If you buy a non-Canon lens, check the lens manual for help with this step.

Figure 1-1: Which index marker you should use depends on the lens type.
 
4. Align the mounting index on the lens with the correct one on the 
camera body.
 
 The lens also has a mounting index; Figure 1-2 shows the one that 
appears on the so-called “kit lens” — the EF-S 18–55mm IS (image sta-
bilizer) zoom lens that Canon sells as a unit with the Rebel XS/1000D. 
If you buy a different lens, the index marker on the lens may be red or 
some other color, so again, check the lens instruction manual.

12
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
 
 
Figure 1-2: Place the lens in the lens mount with the mounting 
 
 
indexes aligned.
 
5. Keeping the mounting indexes aligned, position the lens on the 
 camera’s lens mount.
 
 When you do so, grip the lens by its back collar as shown in the figure.
 
6. Turn the lens in a clockwise direction until the lens clicks into place.
 
 In other words, turn the lens toward the lens-release button (see 
Figure 1-1), as indicated by the red arrow in Figure 1-2.
 
Always attach (or switch) lenses in a clean environment to reduce the risk 
of getting dust, dirt, and other contaminants inside the camera or lens. 
Changing lenses on a sandy beach, for example, isn’t a good idea. For added 
safety, point the camera body slightly down when performing this maneuver, 
as shown in the figure; doing so helps prevent any flotsam in the air from 
being drawn into the camera by gravity. See Chapter 3 for tips on cleaning 
your lens.
Removing a lens
To detach a lens from the camera body, take these steps:
 
1. Locate the lens-release button on the front of the camera.
 
 I labeled the button in Figure 1-1.

13
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
 
2. Grip the rear collar of the lens.
 
 In other words, hold onto the stationary part of the lens that’s closest to 
the camera body.
 
3. Press the lens-release button while turning the lens away from the 
lens-release button.
 
 You should feel the lens release from the mount at this point. Just lift 
the lens off the mount to remove it.
 
4. Place the rear protective cap onto the back of the lens.
 
 If you aren’t putting another lens on the camera, cover the lens mount 
with the protective cap that came with your camera, too.
Using an IS (image stabilizer) lens
The 18–55mm lens sold with the Rebel XS/1000D offers a feature called image 
stabilization. On Canon lenses, this feature is indicated by the initials IS in the 
lens name.
Image stabilization attempts to compensate for small amounts of camera 
shake that are common when photographers handhold their cameras and 
use a slow shutter speed, a lens with a long focal length, or both. That 
camera movement during the exposure can produce blurry images. Although 
image stabilization can’t work miracles, it does enable most people to cap-
ture sharper handheld shots in many situations than they otherwise could.
 
However, when you use a tripod, image stabilization can have detrimental 
effects because the system may try to adjust for movement that isn’t actu-
ally occurring. Although this problem shouldn’t be an issue with most Canon 
IS lenses, if you do see blurry images while using a tripod, try setting the 
Stabilizer On/Off switch (shown in Figure 1-3) to Off. You also can save bat-
tery power by turning off image stabilization when you use a tripod. (Note 
that blurry images can result from causes other than camera shake; see 
Chapter 6 for help.)
If you use a non-Canon lens, the image stabilization feature may go by 
another name: anti-shake, vibration compensation, and so on. In some cases, 
the manufacturers may recommend that you leave the system turned on or 
select a special setting when you use a tripod, so be sure to check the lens 
manual for information.
Chapter 6 offers more tips on achieving blur-free photos, and it also explains 
focal length and its impact on your pictures. See Chapter 5 for an explanation 
of shutter speed.

Focusing and zooming the lens
Like any modern camera, digital or film, yours offers autofocusing capabili-
ties, which you can explore in detail in Chapters 2 and 6. But with some 
subjects, autofocusing can be slow or impossible, which is why your camera 
also offers manual focusing. The process is quick and easy: You just turn the 
focusing ring on the lens until your subject comes into focus. To try it out, 
take these steps:
 
1. Locate the AF/MF switch on the side of the lens.
 
 Figure 1-3 shows you the switch as it appears on the Rebel XS/1000D kit lens. 
The switch should be in a similar location on other Canon lenses; if you use 
a lens from another manufacturer, check the lens instruction manual.
 
2. Set the switch to the MF position, as shown in the figure.
 
 Don’t try to move the focusing ring with the switch set to the AF 
 (autofocus) position; with some lenses, doing so can damage the lens.

15
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
 
3. While looking through the viewfinder, twist the focusing ring to adjust 
focus.
 
 The focusing ring is at the far end of the lens barrel, as indicated in 
Figure 1-3.
 
 If you have trouble focusing, you may be too close to your subject; every 
lens has a minimum focusing distance. (See Chapter 6 for more tips on 
focus issues.) You may also need to adjust the viewfinder to accommo-
date your eyesight; see the next section for details.
On a zoom lens, a movable zoom barrel lies behind the focusing ring, as 
shown in Figure 1-3. To zoom in or out, just move that zoom barrel forward 
and backward.
The numbers on the zoom barrel, by the way, represent focal lengths. I explain 
focal lengths in Chapter 6. In the meantime, just note that when the lens is 
mounted on the camera, the number that’s aligned with the white focal-length 
indicator, labeled in Figure 1-3, represents the current focal length. In Figure 1-3, 
for example, the focal length is 55mm.
Adjusting the Viewfinder Focus
Perched on the top right edge of the viewfinder is a tiny black knob, officially 
called the dioptric adjustment control. I labeled the knob in Figure 1-4. With 
this control, you can adjust the magnification of the viewfinder to mesh with 
your eyesight.
 
If you don’t take this step, scenes that appear out-of-focus through the view-
finder may actually be sharply focused through the lens, and vice versa.
 
Dioptric adjustment knob
Autofocus point
 
Figure 1-4: Use the dioptric adjustment control to set the viewfinder focus for your eyesight.

16
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Here’s how to make the necessary adjustment:
 
1. Remove the lens cap from the front of the lens.
 
2. Look through the viewfinder and concentrate on the focusing screen 
shown on the right side of Figure 1-4.
 
 The focusing screen is the collective name assigned to the group of seven 
autofocus points that appear in the viewfinder — the little squares with 
the dots inside. I labeled one of the little guys in Figure 1-4. 
 
3. Rotate the dioptric adjustment knob until the autofocus points appear 
to be in focus.
 
 Don’t worry about focusing the actual picture now; just pay attention to 
the autofocus points.
 
If your eyesight is such that you can’t get the autofocus points to appear 
sharp by using the dioptric adjustment control, you can buy an additional 
eyepiece adapter. This accessory, which you pop onto the eyepiece, just 
enables further adjustment of the viewfinder display. Prices range from about 
$15–30 depending on the magnification you need. Look for an adapter called 
an E-series dioptric adjustment lens.
 
Keep in mind, too, that with the XS/1000D, you can opt to use the monitor 
instead of the viewfinder to frame and preview your shots. This feature is 
called Live View shooting. Because many of the functions connected with 
Live View shooting are similar to those you use during picture playback, 
I cover both uses of your monitor together in Chapter 4. Chapters 5 and 6 
spell out some additional details of setting exposure and focusing in Live 
View mode.
Working with Memory Cards
Instead of recording images on film, digital cameras store pictures on memory 
cards. Your Rebel XS/1000D uses a specific type of memory card called an SD 
card (for Secure Digital), shown in Figures 1-5 and 1-6. Other card types — 
CompactFlash, Memory Stick, or any others — aren’t compatible with your 
camera. However, if you use SD cards in your cell phone, portable music 
player, or other device, you can use the same cards in your camera. Also, 
your camera can use the new, high-capacity SD cards, which carry the label 
SDHC, as well as plain-old SD cards.
Safeguarding your memory cards — and the images you store on them — 
requires just a few precautions:

17
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
 
✓ Inserting a card: First, be sure 
that the camera is turned off. 
Then put the card in the card 
slot with the label facing the 
back of the camera, as shown 
in Figure 1-5. Push the card into 
the slot until it clicks into place.
 
✓ Formatting a card: The first time 
you use a new memory card, 
take a few seconds to format it 
by choosing the Format option 
on Setup Menu 1. This step 
ensures that the card is properly 
prepared to record your pic-
tures. See the upcoming section 
“Setup Menu 1” for details.
 
✓ Removing a card: First, 
check the status of the memory 
card access light, labeled in 
Figure 1-5. After making sure that 
the light is off, indicating that 
the camera has finished record-
ing your most recent photo, 
turn the camera off. Open the 
memory card door, as shown in 
Figure 1-5. Depress the memory 
card slightly until you hear a 
little click and then let go. The 
card should pop halfway out of 
the slot, enabling you to grab it 
by the tail and remove it.
 
✓ Handling cards: Don’t touch 
the gold contacts on the back 
of the card. (See the left card in 
Figure 1-6.) When cards aren’t 
in use, store them in the protec-
tive cases they came in or in a 
memory card wallet. Keep cards 
away from extreme heat and 
cold as well.
 
✓ Locking cards: The tiny switch on the left side of the card, labeled lock 
switch in Figure 1-6, enables you to lock your card, which prevents any 
data from being erased or recorded to the card. Press the switch toward 
the bottom of the card to lock the card contents; press it toward the top 
of the card to unlock the data.

Exploring External Camera Controls
Scattered across your camera’s exterior are a number of buttons, dials, and 
switches that you use to change picture-taking settings, review and edit your 
photos, and perform various other operations. 
In later chapters, I discuss all of your camera’s functions in detail and pro-
vide the exact steps to follow to access those functions. This section pro-
vides just a basic road map to the external controls plus a quick introduction 
to each. You may want to put a sticky note or other bookmark on this page 
so that you can find it for easier reference later. (The cheat sheet at the front 
of the book offers a similar guide, albeit with less detail.)
With that preamble out of the way, the next three sections break down the 
external controls found on the top, back, and front-left side of the camera.
Topside controls
Your virtual tour begins on the top-right side of the camera, shown in Figure 1-7. 
There are six items of note here, as follows:
 
ISO button
Mode dial
Red-Eye Reduction/Self-Timer lamp
Shutter button
Main dial
 
Figure 1-7: The tiny pictures on the Mode dial represent 
 
special automatic shooting modes.

19
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
 
✓ On/Off switch: Okay, I’m pretty sure you already figured this one out, 
but just move the switch to On to fire up the camera and then back to 
Off to shut it down.
 
 By default, the camera automatically shuts itself off after 30 seconds of 
inactivity to save battery power. To wake up the camera, just press the 
shutter button halfway; you don’t need to use the On/Off switch. You 
can adjust the auto shutdown timing via Setup Menu 1, covered later in 
this chapter.
 
✓ Mode dial: Rotate this dial to select an exposure mode, which deter-
mines whether the camera operates in fully automatic, semi-automatic, 
or manual exposure mode. The little pictographs, or icons, on the dial 
represent Image Zone modes, which are automatic settings geared to 
specific types of photos: action shots, portraits, landscapes, and so on.
 
 Canon uses the term Basic Zone to refer collectively to the Image Zone 
modes and Full Auto mode. (That’s the one represented by the green-
ish rectangle on the Mode dial.) The more advanced modes (P, Tv, Av, 
M, and A-DEP) get the label Creative Zone. I think that having all those 
zones can be a little confusing, especially because the modes in the 
Image Zone category are often referred to generically in photography 
discussions as creative scene modes or creative modes. So, just to help 
keep things a little simpler in this book, I use the generic terms fully auto-
matic exposure modes to refer to all the Basic Zone modes and advanced 
exposure modes to refer to the Creative Zone modes. And note that none 
of the exposure modes affect focusing; you can use autofocus or manual 
focus in any of the exposure modes, as outlined earlier in this chapter.
 
✓ Main dial: Just forward of the Mode dial, you see a black dial that has 
the official name Main dial. This dial plays such an important role in 
choosing camera settings that you’d think it might have a more auspi-
cious name, but Main dial it is. 
 
✓ ISO button: You use this button, in conjunction with the Main dial, to 
adjust the camera’s ISO speed, which determines how sensitive the 
camera is to light. Chapter 5 details this critical exposure setting.
 
✓ Shutter button: You probably already understand the function of this 
button, too. But check out Chapter 2 to discover the proper shutter-
button-pressing technique — you’d be surprised how many people mess 
up their pictures because they press that button incorrectly.
 
✓ Red-Eye Reduction/Self-Timer Lamp: When you set your flash to Red-
Eye Reduction mode, this little lamp emits a brief beam of light prior to 
the real flash — the idea being that your subjects’ pupils will constrict 
in response to the light, thus lessening the chances of red-eye. If you use 
the camera’s self-timer feature, the lamp blinks to provide you with a 
visual countdown to the moment at which the picture will be recorded. 
See Chapter 2 for more details about Red-Eye Reduction flash mode and 
the self-timer function.

Back-of-the-body controls
Traveling over the top of the camera to its back side, you encounter a smor-
gasbord of buttons — 13, in fact, not including the viewfinder’s dioptric 
adjustment control, discussed earlier in this chapter. Figure 1-8 gives you a 
look at the layout of backside controls.
 
Set button and cross keys
 
Figure 1-8: Having lots of external buttons makes accessing the camera’s functions easier.
 
Don’t let the abundance of buttons intimidate you. Having all of those exter-
nal controls actually makes operating your camera easier. On cameras that 
have only a few external buttons, you have to dig through menus to access 
the camera features, which is a big pain in the keister. But on your camera, 
you can access almost every critical shooting setting via the external but-
tons. That’s a convenience you’ll come to appreciate after you familiarize 
yourself with all the camera options.
Also, as you look through this book, you may notice that the margins con-
tain little representations of some buttons to help you locate the one being 

21
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
discussed. So even though I provide the official control names in the follow-
ing list, don’t worry about getting all of those straight right now. The list I 
provide here is just to get you acquainted with the possibility of what you can 
accomplish with all of these features.
 
Do note, however, that many of the buttons have multiple names because 
they serve multiple purposes depending on whether you’re taking pictures, 
reviewing images, or performing some other function. In this book, I refer to 
these buttons by the first label you see in the following list just to simplify 
things. For example, I refer to the AF Point Selection/Enlarge button as the 
AF Point Selection button. Again, though, the margin icons help you know 
exactly which button I’m describing.
And here’s another tip: If the label or icon for a button is blue, it indicates 
a function related to viewing, printing, or downloading images. Labels that 
indicate a shooting-related function are either black or white, depending on 
whether the camera body is silver or black.
With that preamble out of the way, journey with me now over the camera 
back, starting at the top-right corner and working westward (well, assuming 
that your lens is pointing north, anyway):
 
 
✓ AF Point Selection/Enlarge button: When you use certain advanced 
shooting modes, you use this button to specify which of the seven auto-
focus points you want the camera to use when establishing focus. 
Chapter 6 tells you more about this feature. But in Playback mode and in 
Live View mode, you use the button to magnify the image display (thus 
the plus sign in the button’s magnifying glass icon). See Chapter 4 for 
help with that function.
 
 
✓ AE Lock/FE Lock/Index/Reduce button: As you can guess from the offi-
cial name of this button, it serves many purposes. The first two are 
related to image capture functions: You use the button to lock in the 
autoexposure (AE) settings and to lock flash exposure (FE). Chapter 5 
details both issues. Additionally, during Live View shooting, the button 
serves as the autofocus and autoexposure trigger, as explained in 
Chapter 6.
 
 The button also serves two image-viewing functions: It switches the dis-
play to Index mode, enabling you to see multiple image thumbnails at 
once, and it also reduces the magnification of images when displayed one 
at a time. Again, Chapter 4 explains all these monitor-related features. 
 
 
✓ Aperture/Exposure Compensation button: When you work in M (manual) 
exposure mode, you press this button and rotate the Main dial to choose 
the aperture setting, better known as the f-stop. In the other advanced 
exposure modes, you instead use the button and dial to apply exposure 
compensation, a feature that enables you to adjust the exposure selected 
by the camera’s autoexposure mechanism. Chapter 5 discusses both 
issues.

22
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
 
✓ White Balance/Print/Share button: Press this button to access the cam-
era’s white balance setting, which is a feature you can use to adjust 
image colors. This button is also involved when you transfer images to 
your computer or print pictures directly from the camera. See Chapter 6 
for details about white balance; check out Chapters 8 and 9 for informa-
tion about image transfer and printing, respectively.
 
✓ Set button and cross keys: Figure 1-8 points out the Set button and the 
four surrounding buttons, known as cross keys. These buttons team 
up to perform several functions, including choosing options from the 
camera menus. You use the cross keys to navigate through menus and 
then press the Set button to select a specific menu setting. (The later 
section, “Ordering from Camera Menus,” has the details.)
 
 In this book, the instruction “Press the left cross key” just means to 
press the one that sports the left-pointing arrowhead. “Press the up 
cross key” means to press the one with the up-pointing arrowhead, and 
so on. 
 
 The cross keys and the Set button also have individual responsibilities, 
as follows: 
 
• Press the Set button to switch to Live View display. You must first 
enable Live View through Setup Menu 2 and select one of the 
advanced exposure modes (P, Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP). See the end of 
Chapter 4 for details about using Live View.
 
• Press the right cross key to adjust the AF mode. This option controls 
the camera’s autofocus behavior, as outlined in Chapter 6.
 
• Press the left cross key to change the Drive mode. The Drive mode 
settings enable you to switch the camera from single-frame shoot-
ing to continuous capture or self-timer/remote-control shooting. 
See Chapter 2 for details.
 
• Press the down cross key to change the Picture Style. Chapter 6 
explains Picture Styles, which you can use to adjust color, con-
trast, and sharpness of your pictures.
 
• Press the up cross key to change the exposure metering mode or to 
use the Jump feature during picture playback. The metering mode 
determines which area of the frame the camera uses when deter-
mining the correct exposure settings. Chapter 5 has details. The 
Jump feature enables you to “fast forward” through your images 
during playback; see Chapter 4 for specifics.
 
 You can customize the functions of the Set button; Chapter 11 explains 
how. But while you’re working with this book, stick with the default 
setup, just described. Otherwise, the instructions I give in the book 
won’t work.

23
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
 
 
✓ Playback button: Press this button to switch the camera into picture 
review mode. Chapter 4 details the camera’s playback features.
 
 
✓ Erase button: Sporting a trash can icon, the universal symbol for delete, 
this button lets you erase pictures from your memory card. Chapter 4 
has specifics. In Live View mode, also covered in Chapter 4, this button 
is involved in the focusing process.
 
✓ Menu button: Press this button to access the camera menus. See the 
next section for details on navigating menus.
 
✓ DISP button: The Shooting Settings display, covered later in this chap-
ter, appears automatically on the monitor when you first turn on the 
camera and any time you press the shutter button halfway and then 
release it. You also can press the DISP button to view the Shooting 
Settings screen.
 
 But that’s just the start of the DISP button’s tricks. If the camera menus 
are displayed, pressing the button takes you to the Camera Functions 
display, explained in the upcoming section “Monitoring Critical Camera 
Settings.” In Playback mode and Live View mode, pressing the button 
changes the picture-display style, as outlined in Chapter 4. 
Front-left buttons
On the front-left side of the camera 
body, you find three more but-
tons, all labeled in Figure 1-9. One, 
the lens-release button, is key 
to taking the lens off the camera 
body, as discussed earlier in the 
chapter. The other two buttons 
work as follows:
 
 
✓ Flash button: Press this 
button to bring the camera’s 
built-in flash out of hiding 
when you use the advanced 
shooting modes. (In fully 
automatic modes, the camera 
pops up the flash without 
your help if it decides the 
flash light is needed.) 
Chapters 5 and 7 provide 
tips on flash photography.
Depth-of-Field Preview button

✓ Depth-of-Field Preview button: When you press this button, the image 
in the viewfinder offers an approximation of the depth of field that will 
result from your selected aperture setting, or f-stop. Depth of field refers 
to how much of the scene will be in sharp focus. Chapter 6 provides 
details on depth of field, which is an important aspect of your picture 
composition. Chapter 5 explains aperture and other exposure settings.
Ordering from Camera Menus
You access many of your camera’s features via internal menus, which, con-
veniently enough, appear when you press the Menu button, located atop the 
upper-left corner of the camera monitor. Features are grouped into seven 
main menus, described briefly in Table 1-1.

After you press the Menu button, a screen similar to the one shown on the left 
in Figure 1-10 appears. Along the top of the screen, you see the icons shown 
in Table 1-1, each representing one of the seven menus. The icon that is high-
lighted is the active menu; options on that menu automatically appear on the 
main part of the screen. In the figure, Shooting Menu 1 is active, for example.
 
 
Figure 1-10: Use the cross keys to navigate menus; press Set to access available settings.
 
Shooting Menu 2, Setup Menu 3, and My Menu do not appear in the menu dis-
play when you set the camera Mode dial to Full Auto or any of the other fully 
automatic exposure modes (Portrait, Landscape, Sports, and so on). You see 
these menus only when you use the advanced exposure modes (P, Tv, Av, M, 
and A-DEP). And some menu items on Setup Menu 2 are hidden in the fully 
automatic exposure modes.
I explain all the important menu options elsewhere in the book; for now, 
just familiarize yourself with the process of navigating menus and selecting 
options. Here’s the drill:
 
✓ To select a different menu: Press the right or left cross keys or rotate 
the Main dial to cycle through the available menus.
 
✓ To select and adjust a function on the current menu: Press the up or down 
cross key to highlight the feature you want to adjust. On the left side of 
Figure 1-10, the Quality option is highlighted, for example. Next, press the 
Set button. Settings available for the selected item then appear either right 
next to the menu item or on a separate screen, as shown on the right side 
of the figure. Either way, use the up and down cross keys to highlight your 
preferred setting and then press Set again to lock in your choice.

Monitoring Critical Camera Settings
As you advance in your photography and begin to move beyond the auto-
matic exposure modes, you need a way to keep track of what camera settings 
are currently active. To that end, your camera offers the Shooting Settings 
display, shown in Figure 1-11.
 
Battery status
Shots remaining
 
 Figure 1-11: If you don’t like the default Shooting Settings display (left), you can change it to 
the one shown in this book (right).
 
Normally, the display appears as shown on the left in Figure 1-11 — white 
text on a black background. But you can choose from three other color 
schemes if you prefer. To make things a little easier to read in this book, fig-
ures feature the alternative scheme shown on the right in the figure. If you 
want to experiment with this option, display Setup Menu 1 and highlight the 
Screen Color option, as shown on the left in Figure 1-12. Press Set to bring up 
the options shown on the right in the figure. Highlight one of the four choices 
and press Set to wrap up. (The color scheme you see from here on out in this 
book is option 2.)
Whatever color scheme you use, the Shooting Settings screen appears auto-
matically when you turn on the camera. Then, when you press the shutter 
button halfway, which is the first step in taking a picture, the screen disap-
pears. When you let up on the button, the screen reappears. You also can 
turn the monitor display on and off by pressing the DISP button or the Set 
button when no menus are active.

27
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
 
 
Figure 1-12: Visit Setup Menu 1 to change the color scheme of the Shooting Settings screen.
In Figure 1-11, you see an example of the settings that you can monitor in 
the advanced exposure modes (P, Tv, Av, M, and A-DEP). In fully automatic 
modes, many of the settings are hidden to make the display simpler. Either 
way, if what you see looks like a big confusing mess to you now, don’t worry. 
Most of it won’t mean anything to you until you make your way through later 
chapters and explore all of the camera controls.
The figure does label two key points of data that are helpful even in fully 
automatic modes, though: how many more pictures can fit on your memory 
card at the current settings and the status of the battery. A “full” battery icon 
like the one in the figure shows that the battery is fully charged; if the icon 
appears empty, go look for your battery charger.
In addition to the Shooting Settings 
display, you can activate the Camera 
Function Settings display, shown in 
Figure 1-13. To display this screen, 
first display the camera menus by 
pressing the Menu button. Then press 
the DISP button.
Again, the items listed on the screen 
in the figure appear in the advanced 
exposure modes. The following list 
explains the settings that you can 
monitor, detailed from top to bottom 
in the order they appear on the 
screen.
Figure 1-13: Press the DISP button when the 
menus are active to view this screen.

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
✓ Freespace: This value indicates how much storage space is left on your cur-
rent camera memory card. How many pictures you can fit into that space 
depends on the Quality setting you select. Chapter 3 explains this issue.
 
✓ Color Space: This value tells you whether the camera is currently 
capturing images in the sRGB or Adobe RGB color space, an advanced 
option that you can investigate in Chapter 6.
 
✓ White Balance Shift/Bracketing: Add this to the list of advanced color 
options covered in Chapter 6.
 
✓ Live View Shooting: Chapter 4 details this feature, which enables you to 
use your monitor instead of the viewfinder to compose your shots.
 
✓ Auto Sensor Cleaning and Red-Eye Reduction flash mode: (These two 
functions share a line in the screen.) See “Setup Menu 2,” later in this 
chapter, for more about automatic sensor cleaning; check out Chapter 2 
for information about red-eye reduction flash.
 
✓ Auto Power Off and Auto Rotate Display: For information on these two 
settings, which also cohabitate on the Camera Function Settings screen), 
see the upcoming section, “Setup Menu 1.”
 
✓ Beep: This setting determines whether the camera beeps at you after 
certain operations; you can adjust the setting via Shooting Menu 1, as 
explained later in this chapter.
 
✓ Date/Time: The section “Setup Menu 2” also explains how to adjust the 
date and time.
 
In the fully automatic exposure modes, the Color Space, White Balance Shift/
Bracketing, and Live View Shooting status information doesn’t appear in 
this screen because you can’t use those features unless you switch to an 
advanced exposure mode.
Of course, with the exception of the free card space value, you also can simply go 
to the menu that contains the option in question to check its current status. The 
Shooting Settings display and Camera Function Settings display just give you a 
quick way to monitor some of the critical functions without hunting through menus.
In addition, if you switch to Live View shooting, you also can display some of 
the same settings in the monitor preview, along with your image. Chapter 4, 
which introduces Live View shooting, shows you how to do so.
Decoding Viewfinder Data
When the camera is turned on, you can view critical exposure settings and a 
few other pieces of information in the viewfinder. Just put your eye to the view-
finder and press the shutter button halfway to activate the viewfinder display. (I’m 
assuming that Live View mode, in which you use the monitor as viewfinder, is dis-
abled, as it is by default. See Chapter 4 if you want more details about Live View.)

29
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
The viewfinder data changes depending on what action you’re currently 
undertaking and what exposure mode you’re using. For example, if you set 
the Mode dial to P (for programmed autoexposure), you see the current 
f-stop (aperture setting), shutter speed, exposure compensation setting, and 
ISO setting, as shown in Figure 1-14.
 
Maximum burst frames
ISO Speed
Shutter speed and f-stop
Exposure compensation amount
 
Figure 1-14: You also can view some camera information at the 
 
bottom of the viewfinder.
 
The final value (9, in the figure) shows you the number of maximum burst 
frames. This number relates to shooting in the Continuous capture mode, 
where the camera fires off multiple shots in rapid-fire succession as long 
as you hold down the shutter button. (Chapter 2 has details on this mode.) 
Note that although the highest number that the viewfinder can display is 
9, the actual number of maximum burst frames may be higher. At any rate, 
you don’t really need to pay attention to the number until it starts dropping 
toward 0, which indicates that the camera’s memory buffer (its temporary 
internal data-storage tank) is filling up. If that happens, just give the camera 
a moment to catch up with your shutter-button finger.
Rather than give you a full guide to all the possible viewfinder readouts 
here, which would only boggle your mind and cause lots of unnecessary 
page-flipping, I detail the relevant viewfinder data as I cover the various 
photographic topics later in the book.

Reviewing Basic Setup Options
You know how sometimes you visit someone’s house and their kitchen 
cabinets are arranged in a way that doesn’t make sense to you? Why are the 
mugs above the microwave instead of above the coffeepot? And wouldn’t 
it be better if the serving spoons were next to the stove instead of by the 
dishwasher? That’s how I feel about the way that settings that relate to basic 
camera setup are organized on the camera menus. They surely make sense to 
somebody — namely, I’m guessing, the important somebodies at Canon. But 
to me, a couple of the basic setup options are out of place, found on menus 
other than Setup Menus 1, 2, or 3, where you might expect to find them. And 
Setup Menus 2 and 3 offer some options that are related more to advanced 
photographic controls than basic camera operation.
Well, I can’t rearrange the menus for you any more than I can put those mugs 
near the coffeemaker, so instead, the following sections describe the options 
found on the aforementioned trio of Setup Menus, plus two additional 
options found on Shooting Menu 1.
If you don’t yet know how to select options from the menus, see the earlier 
section, “Ordering from Camera Menus” for help.
 
In case you haven’t noticed, the icons that represent the menus are color 
coded. Shooting Menus 1 and 2 have red icons; Setup Menus 1, 2, and 3 sport 
yellow icons; the Playback menu has a blue symbol; and the My Menus icon 
is green. (Chapter 11 explains the My Menus feature, through which you can 
create your own, custom menu.)
Setup Menu 1
 
 At the risk of being labeled conven-
tional, I suggest that you start your 
camera customization by opening this 
menu, shown in Figure 1-15.
Here’s a quick rundown of each menu 
item:
 
✓ Auto Power Off: To help save 
battery power, your camera 
automatically powers down after 
a certain period of inactivity. By 
default, the shutdown happens 
after 30 seconds, but you can 
change the shutdown delay to 1, 2, 4, 8, or 15 minutes. Or you can dis-
able auto shutdown altogether by selecting the Off setting.
Figure 1-15: Options on Setup Menu 1 deal 
mainly with basic camera behavior.

31
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
 
✓ File Numbering: This option controls how the camera names your 
picture files. When the option is set to Continuous, as it is by default, 
the camera numbers your files sequentially, from 0001 to 9999, and 
places all images in the same folder. The initial folder name is 100Canon; 
when you reach image 9999, the camera creates a new folder, named 
101Canon, for your next 9999 photos. This numbering sequence is 
retained even if you change memory cards, which helps to ensure that 
you don’t wind up with multiple images that have the same file name.
  
 By contrast, the Auto Reset option automatically starts file numbering at 
0001 each time you put in a different memory card. I discourage the use 
of this option, for the reason already stated.
 
 Whichever of these two options you choose, beware one gotcha: If you 
swap out memory cards and the new card already contains images, the 
camera may pick up numbering from the last image on the new card, 
which throws a monkey wrench into things. To avoid this problem, just 
format the new card before putting it into the camera. (See the upcom-
ing Format bullet point for details.)
 
 Finally, if you choose Manual Reset, the camera begins a new numbering 
sequence, starting at 0001, for your next shot. The Continuous mode is 
then automatically selected for you again.
 
✓ Auto Rotate: If you enable this feature, your picture files include a piece 
of data that indicates whether the camera was oriented in the vertical or 
horizontal position when you shot the frame. Then, when you view the 
picture on the camera monitor or on your computer, the image is auto-
matically rotated to the correct orientation.
 
 To automatically rotate images both in the camera monitor and on your 
computer monitor, stick with the default setting. In the menu, this set-
ting is represented by On followed by a camera icon and a monitor icon, 
as shown in Figure 1-15. If you want the rotation to occur just on your 
computer and not on the camera, select the second On setting, which is 
marked with the computer monitor symbol but not the camera symbol. 
To disable rotation for both devices, choose the Off setting.
 
 Note, though, that the camera may record the wrong orientation data 
for pictures that you take with the camera pointing directly up or down. 
Also, whether your computer can read the rotation data in the picture 
file depends on the software you use; the programs bundled with the 
camera can perform the auto rotation.
 
✓ Format: The first time you insert a new memory card, you should use 
this option to format the card, a maintenance function that wipes out 
any existing data on the card and prepares it for use by the camera.
 
 If you previously used your card in another device, such as a digital 
music player, be sure to copy those files to your computer before you 
format the card.

32
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
 When you choose the Format option from the menu, you can opt to 
perform a normal card formatting process or a low-level formatting. The 
latter gives your memory card a deeper level of cleansing than ordinary 
formatting and thus takes longer to perform. Normally, a regular format-
ting will do.
 
✓ LCD Off/On Btn: This option gives you three ways to control when 
the monitor displays and turns off the Shooting Settings screen. At the 
default setting, named Shutter Btn, the screen appears when you first 
turn the camera on, disappears when you press the shutter button 
halfway, and then reappears after you release the shutter button. The 
screen remains visible until you next press the shutter button or the 
camera shuts itself off automatically at the time you specify through 
the Auto Power Off option. (See the first bullet in this list.)
 
 If you select the second option, named Shutter/DISP, the screen disap-
pears when you press the shutter button halfway and does not reap-
pear when you release the button. You then must press the Set or DISP 
button to view the screen. And if you select the third option, Remains 
On, the screen does not go away when you press the shutter button half-
way; you must press Set or DISP to turn the monitor off. 
 
 Because the monitor is one of the biggest drains on battery power, I don’t 
advise using the Remains On setting. And while using this book, I suggest 
you stick with the default setting so that things work as described in steps 
and other text. 
 
✓ Screen Color: I cover this option earlier, in the section that introduces 
the Shooting Settings screen, but here’s a quick reminder: If you don’t 
like the default background color of the Shooting Settings display, which 
is white text on a black background, you can choose from three other 
color schemes via this menu option.
 
 For this book, I use color scheme 2, which produces black text on a 
white background, which is a little easier to read on the printed page.
Setup Menu 2
 
 Setup Menu 2, shown in Figure 1-16, offers an additional batch of customiza-
tion options. But you can take advantage of only the following options in all 
exposure modes (Full Auto, Manual, Portrait, and so on):
 
✓ LCD Brightness: This option enables you to make the camera monitor 
brighter or darker. After highlighting the option on the menu, as shown 
in Figure 1-16, press Set to display a screen similar to what you see in 
Figure 1-17. The camera displays a picture from your memory card in 
the main preview area; if the card is empty, you see a black box instead. 

33
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
Press the right and left cross keys 
to adjust the brightness setting. 
Press Set again to return to the 
menu.
 
 If you take this step, keep in mind 
that what you see on the display 
may not be an accurate rendition 
of the actual exposure of your 
image. Crank up the monitor 
brightness, for example, and an 
underexposed photo may look 
just fine. So I recommend that 
you keep the brightness at the 
default setting, which places the 
brightness marker at dead center 
on the little brightness scale, 
as shown in Figure 1-17. As an 
alternative, you can display the 
histogram, an exposure guide 
that I explain in Chapter 4, when 
reviewing your images.
 
✓ Date/Time: When you power up 
your camera for the very first 
time, it automatically displays 
this option and asks you to set 
the current date and time.
 
 Keeping the date/time accurate is 
important because that informa-
tion is recorded as part of the 
image file. In your photo browser, 
you can then see when you shot an image and, equally handy, search 
for images by the date they were taken. Chapter 8 shows you where to 
locate the date/time data when browsing your picture files.
 
✓ Language: This option determines the language of any text displayed on 
the camera monitor. Screens in this book display the English language, 
but I find it entertaining on occasion to hand my camera to a friend after 
changing the language to, say, Swedish. I’m a real yokester, yah?
 
✓ Video System: This option is related to viewing your images on a tele-
vision, a topic I cover in Chapter 9. Select NTSC if you live in North 
America or other countries that adhere to the NTSC video standard; 
select PAL for playback in areas that follow that code of video conduct.
Figure 1-16: Most options on Setup Menu 2 
can be used only in advanced exposure 
modes.
Figure 1-17: You can adjust the brightness of 
the camera monitor.

34
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
That leaves the following menu options, which you can’t access (or access 
fully) unless you switch to one of the advanced exposure modes (P, Tv, Av, 
M, or A-DEP):
 
✓ Sensor Cleaning: By default, the camera’s sensor-cleaning mechanism 
activates each time you turn the camera on and off. This process helps 
keep the image sensor — which is the part of the camera that captures 
the image — free of dust and other particles that can mar your photos.
 
 In the fully automatic modes, you have the option of turning the feature 
off, but I can’t imagine why you would choose to do so. You can also ini-
tiate a cleaning cycle via this menu option at any time.
 
 In the advanced exposure modes, you can access a third option that pre-
pares the camera for manual cleaning of the sensor. I don’t recommend 
this practice; sensors are delicate, and you’re really better off taking the 
camera to a good service center for cleaning. 
 
✓ Live View Functions: This part of the menu enables you to enable Live 
View mode, in which you can preview your shots in the monitor, and 
to customize a couple of aspects of how the camera behaves in that 
mode. Chapter 4 explains your options. (By default, Live View shooting 
is disabled.)
 
✓ Flash Control: Here’s where you customize certain aspects of how your 
flash behaves. Chapter 5 provides details on flash photography.
Setup Menu 3
 
 This menu, shown in Figure 1-18, con-
tains the following offerings, which 
you can access only in the advanced 
exposure modes. Again, those modes 
are P, Tv, Av, M, and A-DEP. Chapter 5 
introduces you to each mode.
 
✓ Custom Functions: Selecting this 
option opens the door to custom-
izing 12 camera functions, known 
as Custom Functions in Canon 
lingo. These functions either 
relate to advanced exposure 
options or are otherwise designed 
for people with some photography experience. Check the index to find 
out where to locate details about the various functions.
Figure 1-18: To display Setup Menu 3, you 
must set the Mode dial to an advanced 
exposure mode.

35
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
 
✓ Clear Settings: Via this menu option, you can restore the default shoot-
ing settings that are used for the advanced exposure modes. You also 
can reset all the Custom Functions settings to their defaults through this 
option.
 
✓ Firmware Ver.: This screen tells you the current version of the camera 
firmware (internal operating software). At the time of publication, the 
current firmware version was 1.0.3.
 
 Keeping your camera firmware up-to-date is important, so visit the 
Canon Web site (www.canon.com) regularly to find out whether your 
camera sports the latest version. Follow the instructions given on the 
Web site to download and install updated firmware if needed.
Three more customization 
options
 
 Shooting Menu 1, shown in Figure 1-19, 
offers two more basic setup options — 
at least, these options fall into that 
 category if you share my logic, which 
some may consider a frightening pros-
pect. At any rate, these two options 
work as follows:
 
✓ Beep: By default, your camera 
beeps at you after certain opera-
tions, such as after it sets focus 
when you shoot in Autofocus 
mode. If you’re doing top-secret surveillance work and need the camera 
to hush up, set this option to Off.
 
✓ Shoot w/o Card: Setting this option to Off prevents shutter-button 
release when no memory card is in the camera. If you turn the option 
on, you can take a picture and then review the results for a few seconds 
in the camera monitor. The image isn’t stored anywhere, however; it’s 
temporary.
 
 If you’re wondering about the point of this option, it’s designed for use 
in camera stores, enabling salespeople to demonstrate cameras without 
having to keep a memory card in every model. Unless that feature some-
how suits your purposes, keep this option set to Off.
Figure 1-19: You can silence the camera via 
Shooting Menu 1.

Why does this camera have two names?
As is the case with some other Canon cameras, 
yours goes by different names — EOS Rebel XS 
or EOS 1000D — depending on the part of the 
world where it’s sold.
The EOS part, by the way, stands for Electro 
Optical System, the core technology used in 
Canon’s autofocus SLR (single-lens reflex) 
cameras. According to Canon, the proper 
 pronunciation is ee-ohs, which is also how you 
pronounce the name Eos, the goddess of dawn 
in Greek mythology. 
With apologies to the goddess, I save a little 
room in this book by shortening the camera 
name to simply Rebel XS/1000D, which is 
already long enough.

A
re you old enough to remember the Certs television com-
mercials from the 1960s and ’70s? “It’s a candy mint!” 
declared one actor. “It’s a breath mint!” argued another. 
Then a narrator declared the debate a tie and spoke the 
famous catchphrase: “It’s two, two, two mints in one!”
Well, that’s sort of how I see the Rebel XS/1000D. 
On one hand, it provides a full range of powerful 
controls, offering just about every feature a seri-
ous photographer could want. On the other, it also 
offers fully automated exposure modes that enable 
people with absolutely no experience to capture 
beautiful images. “It’s a sophisticated photographic 
tool!” “It’s as easy as ‘point and shoot!’” “It’s two, two, 
two cameras in one!”
Now, my guess is that you bought this book for help with 
your camera’s advanced side, so that’s what other chapters 
cover. This chapter, however, is devoted to your camera’s simpler side. 
Even when you shoot in the fully automatic modes, following a few basic 
guidelines can help you get better results. For example, your camera offers a 
variety of fully automatic exposure modes, some of which may be new to you. 
The mode affects the look of your pictures, so this chapter explains those 

38
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
options. I also cover techniques that enable you to get the best performance 
from your camera’s autofocus and autoexposure systems and review the 
flash options and Drive mode settings available to you in automatic modes.
Getting Good Point-and-Shoot Results
 
Your camera offers several fully automatic exposure modes, all of which 
I explain later in this chapter. But in any of those modes, the key to good 
photos is to follow a specific picture-taking technique.
To try it out, set the Mode dial on top of the camera to Full Auto, as shown 
in the left image in Figure 2-1. Then set the focusing switch on the lens to the 
AF (autofocus) position, as shown in the right image in Figure 2-1. (The figure 
features the lens that is bundled with the Rebel XS/1000D. If you use a differ-
ent lens, the switch may look and operate differently; check your lens manual 
for details.)
 
Auto/Manual Focus switch
Full Auto mode
Image Stabilizer switch
 
Figure 2-1: Choose these settings for fully automatic exposure and focus.
 
Unless you are using a tripod, also set the Stabilizer switch to the On set-
ting, as shown in Figure 2-1. This feature helps produce sharper images by 
compensating for camera movement that can occur when you handhold 
the camera. Again, if you use a lens other than the kit lens, check your lens 
manual for details about using its stabilization feature, if provided.

39
 Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically
Your camera is now set up to work in the most automatic of automatic 
modes. Follow these steps to take the picture: 
 
1. Looking through the viewfinder, frame the image so that your subject 
appears under an autofocus point.
 
 The autofocus points are those seven tiny rectangles clustered in the 
center of the viewfinder, as shown in Figure 2-2.
 
 
 
Figure 2-2: The tiny rectangles in the viewfinder indicate autofocus points.
 
2. Press and hold the shutter button halfway down.
 
 The camera’s autofocus and autoexposure meters begin to do their 
thing. In dim light, the flash may pop up if the camera thinks additional 
light is needed. Additionally, the flash may shoot out an AF-assist beam, 
emitting a few rapid pulses of light designed to help the autofocusing 
mechanism find its target. (The AF stands for autofocus.)
 
 At the same time, the autoexposure meter analyzes the light and selects 
initial aperture (f-stop) and shutter speed settings, which are two criti-
cal exposure controls. These two settings appear in the viewfinder; in 
Figure 2-2, the shutter speed is 1/250 second and the f-stop is f/5.6. You 
also see the current ISO setting and the maximum burst rate. (Chapter 5
details shutter speed, f-stops, and ISO; see Chapter 1 for information 
about the maximum burst rate.)

40
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
 When focus is established, the camera beeps at you, assuming that you 
didn’t silence its voice via Shooting Menu 1. Additionally, the focus indi-
cator in the viewfinder lights, as shown in Figure 2-3, and the dot inside 
an autofocus point starts to blink red. That blinking dot indicates which 
autofocus point the camera used to establish focus. Sometimes multiple 
dots blink, which simply tells you that all the objects within those auto-
focus areas are now in focus; for example, in Figure 2-3, all autofocus 
points except the leftmost one are red.
 
 The autoexposure meter continues monitoring the light up to the time 
you take the picture, so the f-stop and shutter speed values in the view-
finder may change if the light shifts. 
 
Focus light
 
 
Figure 2-3: The green light indicates that the camera has locked focus.
 
3. Press the shutter button the rest of the way down to record the image.
 
 While the camera sends the image data to the camera memory card, the 
memory card access lamp lights, as shown in Figure 2-4. Don’t turn off 
the camera or remove the memory card while the lamp is lit, or you may 
damage both camera and card.
 
 When the recording process is finished, the picture appears briefly 
on the camera monitor. See Chapter 4 to find out how to adjust or dis-
able the instant review and how to switch to Playback mode and take a 
longer look at your image.

41
 Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically
I need to add a couple important notes 
about this process, especially related 
to Step 2:
 
✓ Solving autofocus problems: 
When you shoot in the fully 
automatic modes, the camera 
typically focuses on the closest 
object. If the camera insists on 
selecting an autofocus point that 
isn’t appropriate for your subject, 
the easiest solution is to switch 
to manual focusing and be done 
with it. Chapter 1 shows you how. 
Or you can use the advanced 
exposure modes, which enable 
you to select a specific autofocus 
point. Chapter 6 explains that 
option plus a few other tips for 
getting good autofocus results.
 
✓ Shooting moving subjects: If the focus indicator doesn’t light but you 
hear a continuous series of beeps, the camera’s telling you that it 
detected motion in the scene. To accommodate that motion, it shifts to 
an autofocusing mode called AI Servo. (The AI stands for artificial intel-
ligence.) In this mode, the camera focuses continually after you press 
the shutter button halfway. As long as you keep the subject within one 
of the autofocus points, focus should be correct. See Chapter 6 for more 
tips about this and other autofocus modes.
 
✓ Locking exposure: By default, pressing the shutter button halfway does 
not lock exposure along with focus. Your camera instead continues 
metering and adjusting exposure until you fully depress the shutter 
button. If you want to lock exposure, you must use an advanced expo-
sure mode; see Chapter 5 for help.
 
✓ Changing the Drive mode setting: In most of the automatic exposure 
modes, your camera automatically sets the Drive mode to Single, which 
records a single image with each press of the shutter button. But in 
Portrait and Sports modes, the camera instead selects Continuous 
mode, which records pictures as long as you hold down the shut-
ter button. You can change the Drive mode to a Self-Timer or Remote 
Control setting for any exposure mode, however. See the end of this 
chapter for details.
 
✓ Shooting in Live View mode: Unfortunately, you can’t use Live View 
mode, which enables you to frame your image using the camera moni-
tor instead of the viewfinder. If you want to take advantage of Live View, 
you must switch to an advanced exposure mode. Chapter 4 provides a

More focus factors to consider
When you focus the lens, either in autofocus or 
manual focus mode, you determine only the point 
of sharpest focus. The distance to which the 
sharp-focus zone extends from that point — what 
photographers call the depth of field — depends 
in part on the aperture setting, or f-stop, which 
is an exposure control. Some of your camera’s 
fully automatic exposure modes are designed to 
choose aperture settings that produce a certain 
depth of field.
The Portrait setting, for example, uses an aper-
ture setting that shortens the depth of field so 
that background objects are softly focused — an 
artistic choice that most people prefer for por-
traits. On the flip side of the coin, the Landscape 
setting selects an aperture that produces a large 
depth of field so that both foreground and back-
ground objects appear sharp.
Another exposure-related control, shutter 
speed, plays a focus role when you photograph 
moving objects. Moving objects appear blurry 
at slow shutter speeds; at fast shutter speeds, 
they appear sharply focused. On your camera, 
the Sports shooting mode automatically selects 
a high shutter speed to help you “stop” action, 
producing blur-free shots of the subject.
A fast shutter speed can also help safeguard 
against allover blurring that results when the 
camera is moved during the exposure. The 
faster the shutter speed, the shorter the expo-
sure time, which reduces the time that you need 
to keep the camera absolutely still. For a very 
slow shutter speed, using a tripod is the best 
way to avoid camera shake.
Keep in mind, too, that the range of f-stops 
and shutter speeds the camera can select in 
any of the creative scene modes depends on 
the lighting conditions. When you’re shooting 
at night, for example, the camera may not be 
able to select a shutter speed fast enough to 
stop action even in Sports mode. If you want to 
manipulate focus and depth of field to a greater 
extent than the automated exposure modes pro-
duce, visit Chapter 6. For an explanation of the 
role of shutter speed and aperture in exposure, 
check out Chapter 5.
Using Flash in Automatic Exposure Modes
Your options for using flash depend on which of the fully automatic exposure 
modes you choose, as follows:
 
 
✓ Sports, Landscape, and Flash Off modes: Flash is disabled for these 
modes. For the Flash Off mode, that behavior makes sense, of course. 
But why no flash in the other two modes? Well, Sports mode is designed 
to enable you to capture moving subjects, and the flash can make that 
more difficult because it needs time to recycle between shots. On top of 
that, the maximum shutter speed that’s possible with the built-in flash is 
1/200 second, which often isn’t fast enough to ensure a blur-free subject. 
Finally, action photos usually aren’t taken at a range close enough for 
the flash to reach the subject, which is also the reason why flash is dis-
abled for Landscape mode.

43
 Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically
 
✓ Full Auto, Portrait, Close Up, and Night Portrait modes: In these 
modes, the camera automatically pops up the built-in flash when 
needed. You do have the option of setting the flash to either normal or 
Red-Eye Reduction mode, however. You do so via the Red-Eye On/Off 
setting on Shooting Menu 1. Select the option, as shown on the left in 
Figure 2-5, and press the Set button to display the second screen in the 
figure. Then highlight your choice and press Set again. When you turn 
the feature off, the flash operates in normal mode.
 
 
Figure 2-5: Turn Red-Eye Reduction flash mode on and off via Shooting Menu 1.
 
 In Red-Eye Reduction mode, the Red-Eye Reduction lamp on the front 
of the camera lights up when you press the shutter button halfway. The 
purpose of this light is to attempt to shrink the subject’s pupils, which 
helps reduce the chances of red-eye. The flash itself fires when you 
press the shutter button the rest of the way. See Chapters 5 and 7 for 
more tips about using your flash.
 
You can also verify the current flash setting by displaying the Camera 
Function Settings screen; introduced in Chapter 1. To display this screen, 
press the Menu button and then press the DISP button. Additionally, the 
viewfinder displays the following symbols to alert you to the flash status:
 
 
✓ Flash On: A little lightning bolt like the one you see in the margin here 
and in the highlighted area of Figure 2-6 tells you that the flash is 
enabled. The viewfinder symbol doesn’t indicate whether the Red-Eye 
Reduction mode is enabled, however.
 
✓ Flash Recycling: If you see the word Busy along with the lightning bolt, 
as shown in Figure 2-6, the flash needs a few moments to recharge. 
When the flash is ready to go, the Busy message disappears.

44
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
✓ Red-Eye Signal: After you 
press the shutter button 
halfway in Red-Eye 
Reduction flash mode, a 
row of vertical bars 
appears in the center of 
the viewfinder display, just 
to the left of the ISO value 
readout. A few instants 
later, the bars turn off one 
by one. For best results, 
wait until all the bars are 
off to take the picture. 
(The delay gives the sub-
ject’s pupils time to con-
strict in response to the 
Red-Eye Reduction lamp.)
Exploring Your Automatic Options
You can choose from seven fully auto-
matic exposure modes, all of which 
you access via the Mode dial on the 
top of the camera, shown in Figure 2-7.
The next sections provide details on 
each of these options. For information 
about the five other settings on the 
Mode dial, see Chapter 5.
Full Auto mode
 
 In this mode, represented on the Mode 
dial by the rectangle you see in the 
margin here, the camera selects all 
settings based on the scene that it 
detects in front of the lens. Your only 
job is to lock in focus, using the two-
stage autofocus technique I outline at the beginning of the chapter, or by set-
ting the lens to manual focus mode and using the focus ring on the lens, as 
explained in Chapter 1.
Full Auto mode is great for casual, quick snapshooting. But keep these limita-
tions in mind:

Fully automatic exposure modes
Figure 2-7: You can select from seven fully

45
 Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically
 
✓ Picture Style: Full Auto mode records your photo using the Standard 
Picture Style setting. The aim of this mode is to produce a crisp, vivid 
image. You can get more details about how Picture Styles affect your 
photos in Chapter 6.
 
✓ Drive mode: The camera selects the Single setting automatically, so you 
record one image for every press of the shutter button. For information 
on how to change the setting to a Self-Timer or Remote Control mode, 
see the last section in this chapter.
 
✓ Flash: The camera takes control over whether you can use flash. You 
can’t enable the flash if the camera’s autoexposure meter doesn’t sense 
that additional light is needed. Nor can you disable the flash or adjust its 
intensity, a feature I cover in Chapter 5. You can, however, use Red-Eye 
Reduction flash mode; see the preceding section for details.
 
✓ Autofocusing: In most cases, the camera focuses the closest object that 
falls under one of the autofocus points. To focus on a different area, the 
easiest option is to switch to manual focusing.
 
 If you do stick with autofocus, note that the camera adjusts its autofo-
cusing behavior depending on whether it thinks you’re shooting a still 
or moving subject. For still subjects, the camera locks focus when you 
depress the shutter halfway. But if the camera senses motion, it continu-
ally adjusts focus from the time you depress the shutter button halfway. 
You must reframe your shot as necessary to keep the subject within one 
of the seven autofocus points to ensure sharp focus.
 
 See Chapter 6 for additional information on getting good autofocus 
results.
 
✓ Color: Color decisions are also handled for you automatically. Normally, 
the camera’s color brain does a good job of rendering the scene, but if 
you do want to tweak color, you must switch to an advanced exposure 
mode. You can then manipulate color via the white-balance controls and 
Picture Style options, all covered in Chapter 6.
 
✓ Exposure: You also give up total control over exposure to the camera. 
Chapter 5 shows you what you’re missing.
 
✓ Quality: For the Quality setting, which determines both the image reso-
lution, or pixel count, and the file format, you are limited to settings that 
use the JPEG file format. Chapter 3 discusses this issue.
 
I purposely didn’t include an example of a photo taken in Full Auto mode 
because, frankly, the results that this setting create vary widely depending 
on how well the camera detects whether you’re trying to shoot a portrait, 
landscape, action shot, or whatever. But the bottom line is that Full Auto is a 
one-size-fits-all approach that may not take best advantage of your camera’s 
capabilities. So if you want to more consistently take great pictures instead 
of good ones, I encourage you to explore the exposure, focus, and color infor-
mation found in Part II so that you can abandon this exposure mode in favor 
of ones that put more photographic decisions in your hands.

46
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Automatic scene modes (a.k.a. Image Zone modes)
In Full Auto mode, the camera tries to figure out what type of picture you 
want to take by assessing what it sees through the lens. If you don’t want to 
rely on the camera to make that judgment, your camera offers six other fully 
automatic modes that are specifically designed for taking popular catego-
ries of pictures. For example, most people prefer portraits that have softly 
focused backgrounds. So in Portrait mode, the camera selects settings that 
can produce that type of background. 
 
These six automatic modes — the ones represented by the little pictographs 
on the Mode dial — are officially known as Image Zone modes in Canon lingo 
and in your camera manual. For reasons I state in Chapter 1, I avoid using the 
whole “zone” moniker system in this book and instead refer to the six Image 
Zone modes as fully automatic scene modes. But if you should seek informa-
tion about these modes elsewhere, whether online or in your manual, be sure 
to search for the topic under its official name. 
Whatever you call them, all six modes share a few limitations — or benefits, 
depending on how you look at things: 
 
✓ Color: As with Full Auto mode, you can’t tweak color. Some modes 
manipulate colors in ways that you may or may not appreciate, and 
you’re stuck if you have a color cast problem.
 
✓ Exposure: The camera takes complete control of exposure, too.
 
✓ Quality: You can’t take advantage of the Raw file format (CR2, on your 
Canon); you must use the JPEG format. See Chapter 3 to find out which 
of the JPEG settings is most appropriate for the way you plan to use 
your pictures.
In the next sections, you can read about the unique features of each of the 
scene modes.
Portrait mode
 
 Portrait mode attempts to select an aperture (f-stop) setting that results in a 
short depth of field, which blurs the background and puts the visual empha-
sis on your subject. Figure 2-8 offers an example. Keep in mind, though, that 
the short depth of field produced by Portrait mode may result in softer focus 
on objects set in front of your subject, not just those behind it. Either way, 
the extent to which the depth of field is reduced depends on the current 
lighting conditions (which affect the range of f-stops the camera can use), the 
distance between your subject and those foreground or background objects, 
and a couple of other factors that I discuss in Chapter 6.

47
 Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically
 
 
Figure 2-8: Portrait setting produces a softly focused background.
Along with favoring an f-stop that produces a shorter depth of field, the 
camera selects these settings in Portrait mode:
 
✓ Picture Style: Logically enough, the camera automatically sets the Picture 
Style option to Portrait. As detailed in Chapter 6, this Picture Style results 
in a slightly less sharp image, the idea being to keep skin texture nice and 
soft. Colors are also adjusted subtly to enhance skin tones.
 
✓ Drive mode: Contrary to what you may expect, the Drive mode is set 
to Continuous, which means that the camera records a series of images 
in rapid succession as long as you hold down the shutter button. This 
technique can come in especially handy if your portrait subject can’t be 
counted on to remain still for very long — a toddler or pet, for example.
 
 Should you want to include yourself in the portrait, you can switch the 
Drive mode setting to a Self-Timer or Remote Control mode. See the end 
of this chapter for details.
 
✓ Flash: You have the option of using regular or Red-Eye Reduction mode — 
but only if the camera decides that you need a flash to properly light the 
scene.
 
 For outdoor portraits, this can pose a problem: A flash generally 
improves outdoor portraits, and if the ambient light is very bright, the 
camera doesn’t give you access to the flash. For an illustration of the dif-
ference a flash can make, see Chapter 7. That chapter also contains tips 
on using flash in nighttime and indoor portraits.

48
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
✓ Autofocusing: Portrait mode employs the One-Shot AF (autofocus) 
mode. This is one of three AF modes available on your camera, all 
detailed in Chapter 6. In One-Shot mode, the camera locks focus when 
you press the shutter button halfway. Typically, the camera locks focus 
on the closest object that falls under one of the seven autofocus points. 
If your subject moves out of the selected autofocus point, the camera 
doesn’t adjust focus to compensate.
 
Keep in mind that you can use Portrait mode any time you want a slightly 
blurry background, not just for people pictures. Try this mode when shooting 
statues, still-life arrangements (such as a vase of flowers on a kitchen table), 
and the like.
Landscape mode
 
 Whereas Portrait mode aims for a very shallow depth of field (small zone of 
sharp focus), Landscape mode, which is designed for capturing scenic vistas, 
city skylines, and other large-scale subjects, produces a large depth of field. 
As a result, objects both close to the camera and at a distance appear 
sharply focused, as shown in Figure 2-9.
 
 
Figure 2-9: Landscape mode produces a large zone of sharp focus and 
 
also intensifies blues and greens.

49
 Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically
Like Portrait mode, Landscape mode achieves the greater depth of field by 
manipulating the exposure settings — specifically, the aperture, or f-stop set-
ting. So the extent to which the camera can succeed in keeping everything in 
sharp focus depends on the available light. To fully understand this issue, see 
Chapters 5 and 6. And in the meantime, know that you also can extend depth 
of field by zooming out, if you’re using a zoom lens, and moving farther from 
your subject.
As for other camera settings, Landscape mode results in the following 
options:
 
✓ Picture Style: The camera automatically sets the Picture Style option to 
Landscape, which produces a sharper image, with well-defined “edges” — 
the borders between areas of contrast or color change. The Picture Style 
setting also produces more vivid blues and greens, which is what most 
people prefer from their landscape photos. You can read more about 
Picture Styles in Chapter 6.
 
✓ Drive mode: The camera selects the Single option, which records one 
image for each press of the shutter button. As with the other scene 
modes, you can switch to a Self-Timer or Remote-Control setting by fol-
lowing the steps laid out at the end of this chapter.
 
✓ Flash: The built-in flash is disabled, which is typically no big deal: 
Because of its limited range, a built-in flash is of little use when shooting 
most landscapes anyway.
 
✓ Autofocusing: The AF (autofocus) mode is set to One-Shot, which means 
that focus is locked when you depress the shutter button halfway. 
(See Chapter 6 for details.) Focus usually is set on the nearest object 
that falls under one of the seven autofocus points, but remember that 
because of the large depth of field that the Landscape mode produces, 
both far and near objects may appear equally sharp, depending on their 
distance from the lens.
 
Again, think beyond the Landscape moniker when you look for good ways to 
put this mode to use: Try it when shooting long-range pictures of animals at 
the zoo, for example, so that critters both near and far appear sharp.
Close-Up mode
 
 Switching to Close-Up mode doesn’t enable you to focus at a closer distance 
to your subject than normal as it does on some non-SLR cameras. The close-
focusing capabilities of your camera depend entirely on the lens you use.

50
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
But choosing Close-Up mode does tell 
the camera to try to select an aperture 
(f-stop) setting that results in a short 
depth of field, which blurs background 
objects so that they don’t compete 
for attention with your main subject. 
I used this setting to capture the crab 
apple blossoms in Figure 2-10. As with 
Portrait mode, though, how much the 
background blurs varies depending on 
the distance between your subject and 
the background as well as on the lighting 
conditions (which determine the range 
of f-stops that will produce a good expo-
sure), your camera-to-subject distance, 
and the lens focal length. (Chapter 6 
explains all these issues.)
Other settings selected for you in 
Close-Up mode are as follows:
 
✓ Picture Style: Close-Up mode uses 
the Standard picture style, just like 
Full Auto. The resulting image fea-
tures crisp edges and vivid colors.
 
✓ Drive mode: The Drive mode is set to Single, so you record one photo 
each time you fully depress the shutter button. You can, however, select 
a Self-Timer or Remote Control mode if needed.
 
✓ Flash: Flash is enabled when the camera thinks additional light is 
needed, and it’s disabled when the camera decides that the ambient 
light is sufficient. You can set the flash to Red-Eye Reduction mode, but 
frankly, you shouldn’t be firing the flash at close range to either human 
or animal subjects — you can hurt their eyes.
 
✓ Autofocusing: The AF mode is set to One-Shot mode; again, that simply 
means that when you depress the shutter button halfway, the camera 
locks focus, usually on the nearest object that falls under one of the 
seven autofocus points.
See Chapter 6 for more details about AF modes and other focusing issues. 
Chapter 7 offers additional tips on close-up photography.
Figure 2-10: Close-Up mode also 
produces short depth of field.

51
 Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically
Sports mode
 
 Sports mode results in a number of settings that can help you photograph 
moving subjects, such as the girl in the swing in Figure 2-11. First, the camera 
selects a fast shutter speed, which is needed to “stop motion.” Shutter speed is 
an exposure control that you can explore in Chapter 5.
Also keep these Sports mode settings in 
mind:
 
✓ Picture Style: The camera automati-
cally sets the Picture Style option to 
Standard, which is designed to pro-
duce sharp images with bold colors.
 
✓ Drive mode: To enable rapid-fire 
image capture, the Drive mode 
is set to Continuous. This mode 
enables you to record multiple 
frames with a single press of the 
shutter button. You also have the 
option of switching to a Self-Timer 
or Remote Control mode. Check out 
the end of this chapter for details 
on Drive mode settings.
 
✓ Flash: Flash is disabled, which can 
be a problem in low-light situations, 
but it also enables you to shoot 
successive images more quickly 
because the flash needs a brief 
period to recycle between shots. 
In addition, disabling the flash per-
mits a faster shutter speed; when the flash is on, the maximum shutter 
speed is 1/200 second. (See Chapter 5 for details about flash and shutter 
speeds.)
 
✓ Autofocusing: The AF mode is set to AI Servo. In this mode, the camera 
establishes focus initially when you depress the shutter button halfway. 
But if the subject moves, the camera attempts to refocus.
 
 For this feature to work correctly, you must adjust framing so that your 
subject remains within one of the autofocus points. You may find it 
easier to simply switch to manual focusing and twist the focusing ring as 
needed to track the subject’s movement yourself. 
Figure 2-11: To capture moving subjects 
without blur, try Sports mode.

52
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
The other critical thing to understand about Sports mode is that whether the 
camera can select a shutter speed fast enough to stop motion depends on the 
available light and the speed of the subject itself. In Figure 2-11, the camera 
selected a shutter speed that did, in fact, catch my subject in midswing; 
although if you look very closely, you can see some slight blurring of the foot 
near the bottom of the frame. 
To fully understand shutter speed, visit Chapter 5. And for more tips on 
action photography, check out Chapter 7.
Night Portrait mode
 
 As its name implies, Night Portrait mode is designed to deliver a better-look-
ing portrait at night (or in any dimly lit environment). It does so by combin-
ing flash with a slow shutter speed. That slow shutter speed produces a 
longer exposure time, which enables the camera to rely more on ambient 
light and less on the flash to expose the picture. The result is a brighter back-
ground and softer, more even lighting.
 
I cover the issue of using a slow shutter speed in detail in Chapter 5; Chapter 
7 has some additional nighttime photography tips. For now, the important 
thing to know is that the slower shutter speed means that you probably need 
a tripod; if you try to handhold the camera, you run the risk of moving the 
camera during the long exposure, resulting in a blurry image. Enabling the 
Image Stabilizer (IS) feature of your lens, if available, can help, but for night-
time shooting, even that may not permit successful handheld shooting. Your 
subjects also must stay perfectly still during the exposure, which can also be 
a challenge.
If you do try Night Portrait mode, be aware of these other settings that are 
automatically selected by the camera:
 
✓ Picture Style: The Standard setting, designed to deliver sharp, bold 
photos, is selected. See Chapter 6 for more about Picture Styles.
 
✓ Drive mode: The default setting is Single, but you also can choose a Self-
Timer or Remote Control mode. Check out the end of this chapter for 
details.
 
✓ Flash: Flash is enabled when the camera thinks more light is needed — 
which, assuming that you’re actually shooting at night, should be most 
of the time. You can set the flash to Red-Eye Reduction mode if you 
prefer. 
 
✓ Autofocusing: The AF mode is set to One-Shot, which locks focus when 
you depress the shutter button halfway.

53
 Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically
Flash Off mode
 
 The Flash Off mode delivers the same results as Full Auto mode but ensures 
that the flash doesn’t fire, even in dim lighting. This mode provides an easy 
way to ensure that you don’t break the rules when shooting in locations that 
don’t permit flash: museums, churches, and so on. But it can also come in 
handy any time you prefer not to use flash. See Chapters 5 and 7 for informa-
tion about flash photography.
Changing the Drive Mode
Your camera offers the following Drive mode settings:
 
 
✓ Single: This setting, which is the default for all of the fully automatic 
modes except Portrait and Sports, records a single image each time you 
press the shutter button. In other words, this is normal-photography 
mode.
 
 
✓ Continuous: Sometimes known as burst mode, this setting records a 
continuous series of images as long as you hold down the shutter 
button. On the Rebel XS/1000D, you can capture as many as three shots 
per second. Obviously, this mode is great for capturing fast-paced sub-
jects, which is why it’s the default setting for Sports mode. It’s also 
selected for Portrait mode, which is a great benefit if your subject is the 
fidgety type.
 
 
✓ Self-Timer/Remote Control: Want to put yourself in the picture? Select 
this mode and then press the shutter button and run into the frame. You 
have about 10 seconds to get yourself in place and pose before the 
image is recorded.
 
 I also often use the self-timer function when I want to avoid any possi-
bility of camera shake. The mere motion of pressing the shutter button 
can cause slight camera movement, which can blur an image. So I put 
the camera on a tripod and then activate the self-timer function. This 
enables “hands-free” — and therefore motion-free — picture-taking.
 
 As another alternative, you can purchase the optional remote-control 
switch sold by Canon. Choose the Self-Timer/Remote Control mode to 
use that gadget to trigger the shutter release button. (Note that your 
camera can use only the unit that connects to the camera via cable; 
wireless remotes aren’t compatible with the Rebel XS/1000D.)
 
2
 
✓ 2-Second Self-Timer: This mode works just like the regular self-timer 
mode, but the capture happens just two seconds after you fully depress 
the shutter button. Unfortunately, this mode isn’t available to you in the 
fully automatic exposure modes; you can choose this option only in P, 
Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP modes. I cover it here just so you’ll know the option 
exists.

54
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
c
 
✓ Self-Timer Continuous: With this option, the camera waits 10 seconds 
after you depress the shutter button and then captures a continuous 
series of images. You can record as many as 10 continuous images.
To select a Drive mode, press the 
left cross key. You then see a screen 
similar to the one in Figure 2-12. 
However, you see all five Drive mode 
options only in the advanced exposure 
modes (P, Tv, Av, M, and A-DEP). In 
the fully automatic modes, you see 
only the default Drive mode option 
that the camera uses for your selected 
exposure mode, plus the Self-Timer/
Remote Control option and the Self-
Timer Continuous option.
Either way, press the right or left cross 
key to highlight your Drive mode of 
choice. For the Self-Timer Continuous 
mode, press the up or down cross key to set the number of continuous shots 
you want the camera to capture, as shown in the figure. Finally, press the Set 
button to lock in the setting.
 
Your selected Drive mode remains in force until you change it or switch to an 
exposure mode for which the selected Drive mode isn’t available.
Figure 2-12: You can access all of these 
Drive options only in advanced exposure 
modes.

Controlling Picture Quality
In This Chapter
▶ Reviewing factors that lead to poor photo quality
▶ Exploring resolution, pixels, and ppi
▶ Calculating the right resolution for traditional print sizes
▶ Understanding the tradeoff between picture quality and file size
▶ Deciding on the best file format: JPEG or Raw?
▶ Picking the right JPEG quality level
A
lmost every review of the Rebel XS/1000D contains glowing reports about 
the camera’s top-notch picture quality. As you’ve no doubt discovered for 
yourself, those claims are true, too: This baby can create large, beautiful images.
Getting the maximum output from your camera, however, 
depends on choosing the right capture settings. Chief among 
them, and the topic of this chapter, is the appropriately 
named Quality setting. Found on Shooting Menu 1, this 
critical control determines two important aspects 
of your pictures: resolution, or pixel count; and file 
format, which refers to the type of computer file the 
camera uses to store your picture data.
Resolution and file format work together to deter-
mine the quality of your photos, so selecting from 
the eight Quality settings on your camera is an impor-
tant decision. Why not just dial in the setting that pro-
duces the maximum quality level and be done with it, 
you ask? Well, that’s the right choice for some photogra-
phers. But because choosing that maximum setting has some 
disadvantages, you may find that stepping down a notch or two 
on the quality scale is a better option every now and then.
To help you figure out which Quality setting meets your needs, this chapter 
explains exactly how resolution and file format affect your pictures. Just in 
case you’re having quality problems related to other issues, though, the first 
section of the chapter provides a handy quality-defect diagnosis guide.

56
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Diagnosing Quality Problems
When I use the term picture quality, I’m not talking about the composition, 
exposure, or other traditional characteristics of a photograph. Instead, I’m 
referring to how finely the image is rendered in the digital sense.
Figure 3-1 illustrates the concept: The first example is a high-quality image, 
with clear details and smooth color transitions. The other examples show 
five common digital-image defects.
High quality
Pixelation
JPEG artifacts
Noise
Color cast
Lens/sensor dirt
Figure 3-1: Refer to this symptom guide to determine the cause of poor image quality.
Each of these defects is related to a different issue, and only two are affected 
by the Quality setting on Shooting Menu 1. So if you aren’t happy with your 
image quality, first compare your photos to those in the figure to properly 
diagnose the problem. Then try these remedies:

57
 Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality
 
✓ Pixelation: When an image doesn’t have enough pixels (the colored tiles 
used to create digital images), details aren’t clear, and curved and diago-
nal lines appear jagged. The fix is to increase image resolution, which 
you do via the Quality control. See the upcoming section, “Considering 
Resolution: Large, Medium, or Small?” for details.
 
✓ JPEG artifacts: The “parquet tile” texture and random color defects 
that mar the third image in Figure 3-1 can occur in photos captured in 
the JPEG (jay-peg) file format, which is why these flaws are referred to 
as JPEG artifacts. This defect is also related to the Quality setting; see 
“Understanding File Type (JPEG or Raw)” to find out more.
 
✓ Noise: This defect gives your image a speckled look, as shown in the 
lower-left example in Figure 3-1. Noise is most often related to a very 
long exposure time (that is, a very slow shutter speed) or to an exposure 
control called ISO, which you can explore in Chapter 5. To adjust shutter 
speed or ISO, you must switch to one of the advanced exposure modes 
(P, Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP).
 
✓ Color cast: If your colors are seriously out of whack, as shown in the 
lower-middle example in the figure, try adjusting the camera’s white bal-
ance setting. Chapter 6 covers this control and other color issues. Note, 
though, that you also must use an advanced exposure mode to adjust 
white balance.
 
✓ Lens/sensor dirt: A dirty lens is the first possible cause of the kind of 
defects you see in the last example in the figure. If cleaning your lens 
doesn’t solve the problem, dust or dirt may have made its way onto the 
camera’s image sensor. See the sidebar “Maintaining a pristine view,” later 
in this chapter, for information on safe lens and sensor cleaning. 
 
When diagnosing image problems, you may want to open the photos in your 
photo software and zoom in for a close-up inspection. Some defects, espe-
cially pixelation and JPEG artifacts, have a similar appearance until you see 
them at a magnified view.
I should also tell you that I used a little digital enhancement to exaggerate the 
flaws in my example images to make the symptoms easier to see. With the 
exception of an unwanted color cast or a big blob of lens or sensor dirt, these 
defects may not even be noticeable unless you print or view your image at a 
very large size. And the subject matter of your image may camouflage some 
flaws; most people probably wouldn’t detect a little JPEG artifacting in a pho-
tograph of a densely wooded forest, for example.
In other words, don’t consider Figure 3-1 as an indication that your Canon is 
suspect in the image quality department. First, any digital camera can pro-
duce these defects under the right circumstances. Second, by following the 
guidelines in this chapter and the others mentioned in the preceding list, you 
can resolve any quality issues that you may encounter.

Decoding the Quality Options
Your camera’s Quality control determines both the image resolution and 
file format of the pictures you shoot. To access the control, press the Menu 
button and then display Shooting Menu 1, shown on the left in Figure 3-2. 
Highlight Quality and press the Set button to display the screen you see on 
the right in the figure.
 
 
Figure 3-2: You set resolution and file format together via the Quality menu.
 
In Figure 3-2, the right screen displays 
all the Quality settings available on the 
Rebel XS/1000D. But see that little rep-
lica of the Mode dial on the left side of 
the screen? When the symbol repre-
senting an exposure mode is dimmed, 
you can’t use that mode if you want to 
access all the settings on the screen. 
In this case, for example, the graphic 
tells you that the eight Quality options 
shown in Figure 3-2 are available only 
in the P, Tv, Av, M, and A-DEP modes. 
If you instead set the camera to Full 
Auto or one of the automatic scene 
modes, you’re limited to the first six 
settings, as shown in Figure 3-3.
Either way, if you’re new to digital photography, the Quality settings won’t 
make much sense to you until you read the rest of this chapter, which 
explains format and resolution in detail. But even if you are schooled in those 
topics, you may need some help deciphering the way that the settings are

represented on your camera. As you can see from Figures 3-2 and 3-3, the 
options are presented in rather cryptic fashion, so here’s your decoder ring:
 
✓ The first column of settings produce files in the JPEG file format.
 
 
✓ The little arc-like icons represent the level of JPEG compression, which 
affects picture quality and file size. You get two JPEG options, Fine and 
Normal. The Fine setting is represented by the smooth arcs; the Normal 
setting is represented by the stairstepped arcs. Check out the section 
“JPEG: The imaging (and Web) standard” for details on this issue.
 
✓ Within the JPEG category, you can choose from three resolution settings, 
represented by L, M, and S (large, medium, and small). See the next sec-
tion for information that will help you select the right resolution.
 
✓ The Quality settings in the second column enable you to capture images 
in the Raw file format. Again, these two options appear only if you set 
the camera Mode dial to one of the advanced exposure modes. All Raw 
files are created at the Large resolution setting, giving you the maximum 
pixel count. One of the two Raw settings also records a JPEG Fine ver-
sion of the image, also at the maximum resolution. The section “Raw 
(CR2): The purist’s choice” explains the benefits and downsides to using 
the Raw format.
To select a Quality option, just high-
light it and press the Set button. The 
selected setting then appears next 
to the Quality item in Shooting Menu 
1 and at the bottom of the Shooting 
Settings display, as shown in Figure 3-4.
 
Changing the Quality setting also 
changes the number of pictures that 
you can store on your memory card. 
That number appears in the lower-
right corner of the display, as labeled 
in Figure 3-4. See the upcoming side-
bar “How many pictures fit on my 
memory card?” for details.
Which Quality option is best depends 
on several factors, including how you 
plan to use your pictures and how much time you care to spend processing 
your images on your computer. The rest of this chapter explains these and 
other issues related to the Quality settings.

Considering Resolution: Large, 
Medium, or Small?
To decide upon a Quality setting, the first decision you need to make is how 
many pixels you want your image to contain. Pixels are the little square tiles 
from which all digital images are made; the word pixel is short for picture ele-
ment. You can see some pixels close up in the right image in Figure 3-5, which 
shows a greatly magnified view of the eye area of the left image.
 
 
Figure 3-5: Pixels are the building blocks of digital photos.
The number of pixels in an image is referred to as resolution. Your camera 
offers you three resolution levels, which are assigned the generic labels 
Large, Medium, and Small and are represented on the list of Quality settings 
by the initials L, M, and S. Table 3-1 shows you the pixel count that results 
from each option. (If you select Raw as your Quality setting, images are 
always captured at the Large resolution value.)

61
 Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality
 
In the table, the first pair of numbers shown for each setting represents the 
image pixel dimensions — that is, the number of horizontal pixels and the 
number of vertical pixels. The values in parentheses indicate the total resolu-
tion, which you get by multiplying the horizontal and vertical pixel values. 
This number is usually stated in megapixels, abbreviated MP for short. One 
megapixel equals 1 million pixels. (I rounded off the megapixel values in the 
table.)
To figure out how many pixels are enough, you need to understand how 
resolution affects print quality, display size, and file size. The next sections 
explain these issues, as well as a few other resolution factoids.
Pixels and print quality
 
When mulling over resolution options, your first consideration is how large 
you want to print your photos, because pixel count determines the size at 
which you can produce a high-quality print. If you don’t have enough pixels, 
your prints may exhibit the defects you see in the pixelation example in 
Figure 3-1, or worse, you may be able to see the individual pixels, as in the 
right example in Figure 3-5.
Depending on your photo printer, you typically need anywhere from 200 to 
300 pixels per linear inch, or ppi, of the print. To produce an 8-by-10-inch 
print at 200 ppi, for example, you need a pixel count of 1600 x 2000.
Table 3-2 lists the pixel counts needed to produce traditional print sizes at 
200 ppi and 300 ppi. But again, the optimum ppi varies depending on the 
printer — some printers prefer even more than 300 ppi — so check your 
manual or ask the photo technician at the lab that makes your prints. (And 
note that ppi is not the same thing as dpi, which is a measurement of printer 
resolution. Dpi refers to how many dots of color the printer can lay down per 
inch; most printers use multiple dots to reproduce one pixel.)

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
Even though many photo editing programs enable you to add pixels to an 
existing image, doing so isn’t a good idea. For reasons I won’t bore you with, 
adding pixels — known as resampling — doesn’t enable you to successfully 
enlarge your photo. In fact, resampling typically makes matters worse. The 
printing discussion at the start of Chapter 9 includes some example images 
that illustrate this issue.
Pixels and screen display size
 
Resolution doesn’t affect the quality of images viewed on a monitor, television, 
or other screen device as it does on printed photos. Instead, it determines the 
size at which the image appears.
This issue is one of the most misunderstood aspects of digital photography, 
so I explain it thoroughly in Chapter 9. For now, just know that you need 
way fewer pixels for onscreen photos than you do for printed photos. For 
example, Figure 3-6 shows a 450-x-300-pixel image that I attached to an e-mail 
message.
 
 
Figure 3-6: A 450-x-300-pixel image is plenty large for sharing via e-mail.

63
 Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality
 
For e-mail images, I usually stick with a maximum horizontal pixel count of 
450 and a maximum vertical size of 400 pixels, depending on whether the pic-
ture is oriented horizontally, as in the figure, or vertically. If your image is 
much larger, the recipient may not be able to view the entire picture without 
scrolling the display.
In short, even if you use one of the Small Quality settings on your Rebel 
XS/1000D, which produces images that contain 1936 x 1288 pixels, you’ll have 
more than enough pixels for most onscreen uses. The only exception might 
be an image that you want to display via a digital projector that has a very 
high screen resolution. Again, Chapter 9 details this issue and also shows you 
how to prepare your pictures for online sharing.
Pixels and file size
Every additional pixel increases the amount of data required to create a digi-
tal picture file. So a higher-resolution image has a larger file size than a low-
resolution image.
 
Large files present several problems:
 
✓ You can store fewer images on your memory card, on your computer’s 
hard drive, and on removable storage media such as a CD-ROM.
 
✓ The camera needs more time to process and store the image data on 
the memory card after you press the shutter button. This extra time can 
hamper fast-action shooting.
 
✓ When you share photos online, larger files take longer to upload and 
download.
 
✓ When you edit your photos in your photo software, your computer 
needs more resources and time to process large files.
To sum up, the tradeoff for a high-resolution image is a large file size. But 
note that file format, which is the other half of the Quality equation on your 
Canon, also affects file size. See the section “Understanding File Type (JPEG 
or Raw)” for more on that topic. The upcoming sidebar “How many pictures 
fit on my memory card?” provides details on the file-storage issue.
Resolution recommendations
As you can see, resolution is a bit of a sticky wicket. What if you aren’t sure 
how large you want to print your images? What if you want to print your 
photos and share them online? 

64
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Personally, I take the “better safe than sorry” route, which leads to the 
following recommendations about whether to choose Large, Medium, or 
Small when you select a Quality setting: 
 
✓ Always shoot at a resolution suitable for print. You then can create 
a low-resolution copy of the image in your photo editor for use online. 
Chapter 9 shows you how.
 
 Again, you can’t go in the opposite direction, adding pixels to a low-
resolution original in your photo editor to create a good, large print. 
Even with the very best software, adding pixels doesn’t improve the 
print quality of a low-resolution image.
 
✓ For everyday snapshots, the Medium setting (5.3 MP) is probably suf-
ficient. I find that 10 MP, which is what you get from the Large setting, to 
be overkill for most casual snapshots, which means that you’re creating 
huge files for no good reason. So I stick with Medium unless I’m shooting 
critical images.
 
✓ Jump up to Large (10 MP) if you plan to crop your photos or make 
huge prints. Always use the maximum resolution if you think you may 
want to crop your photo and enlarge the remaining image. For example, 
when I shot the left photo in Figure 3-7, I wanted to fill the frame with 
the butterfly, but I couldn’t do so without getting so close that I risked 
scaring it away. So I kept my distance and took the picture at the Large 
setting, which enabled me to crop the photo and still have enough pixels 
left to produce a great print, as you see in the right image.
 
 
Figure 3-7: Capture images that you plan to crop and enlarge at the highest possible resolution (Large).

65
 Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality
 
✓ Reduce resolution if shooting speed is paramount. If you’re shooting 
action and the shot-to-shot capture time is slower than you’d like — that 
is, the camera takes too long after you take one shot before it lets you 
take another — dialing down the resolution may help. Lower resolution 
produces smaller files, and the smaller the file, the less time the camera 
needs to record the image to your memory card. Also see Chapter 7 for 
other tips on action photography.
How many pictures fit on my memory card?
That question is one of the first asked by new 
camera owners — and it’s an important one 
because you don’t want to run out of space on 
your memory card just as the perfect photo-
graphic subject presents itself.
As explained in the discussions in this chapter, 
image resolution (pixel count) and file format 
(JPEG or Raw) together determine the size of the 
picture file which, in turn, determines how many 
photos fit in a given amount of camera memory.
The table below shows you the approximate 
size of the files, in megabytes (MB) that are 
generated at each of the possible resolution/
format combinations on your Rebel XS/1000D. 
(The actual file size of any image also depends 
on other factors, such as the subject, ISO set-
ting, and Picture Style setting.) In the Image 
Capacity column, you see approximately how 
many pictures you can store at the setting on a 
1GB (gigabyte) memory card.

Understanding File Type (JPEG or Raw)
In addition to establishing the resolution of your photos, the Quality setting 
determines the file format. The file format simply refers to the type of image 
file that the camera produces.
Your Canon offers two file formats, JPEG and Raw, with a couple variations of 
each. The next sections explain the pros and cons of each setting.
 
Don’t confuse file format with the Format option on Setup Menu 1. That 
option erases all data on your memory card; see Chapter 1 for details.
JPEG: The imaging (and Web) standard 
Pronounced jay-peg, this format is the default setting on your camera, as it is 
for most digital cameras. JPEG is popular for two main reasons:
 
✓ Web compatibility: All Web browsers and e-mail programs can display 
JPEG files, so you can share them online immediately after you shoot 
them.
 
✓ Small files: JPEG files are smaller than those produced by the other 
common format offered by today’s digital cameras, known as Camera 
Raw, or just Raw. And smaller files means that your pictures consume 
less room on your camera memory card and in your computer’s storage 
tank.
The downside — you knew there had to be one — is that JPEG creates 
smaller files by applying lossy compression. This process actually throws 
away some image data. Too much compression leads to the defects you see 
in the JPEG Artifacts example in Figure 3-1, near the start of this chapter.
On your camera, the amount of compression that is applied depends on 
whether you choose a Quality setting that carries the label Fine or Normal. 
The difference between the two breaks down as follows:
 
 
✓ Fine: At this setting, represented by the symbol you see in the margin 
here, very little compression is applied, so you shouldn’t see many com-
pression artifacts, if any.
 
 
✓ Normal: Switch to Normal, and the compression amount rises, as does 
the chance of seeing some artifacting. Notice the jaggedy-ness of the 
Normal icon, shown in the margin here? That’s your reminder that all 
may not be “smooth” sailing when you choose a Normal setting.
For comparison, Figures 3-8 and 3-9 show you the same subject shot at the 
Large/Fine and Large/Normal settings, along with the respective file sizes that 
each option produces. (I captured each image at the same resolution so that 
file type is the only variable.)

67
 Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality
Large/Fine, 3.8MB
Figure 3-8: The Fine setting produces very good image quality and reasonable file sizes.
Large/Normal, 2.0MB
Figure 3-9: Enlarging an image captured at the Normal setting reveals some quality loss.
When you view the left examples in the comparison figures, you may not see 
much difference between the images. For most printed photos, in fact, com-
pression defects aren’t terribly distinct when the print size is small. But when 
you enlarge your photos, as I did for the right examples in the figures, the 
exact nature of the quality loss that occurs with JPEG compression becomes 
clearer.
Know, too, that compression artifacts usually are significantly easier to spot 
when you view digital images on a computer monitor. (The print process 
itself softens some of the compression defects.) Artifacting is also usually 
more visible in areas of flat color than it is in detailed or textured areas.

68
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
For my money, the file size benefit you gain when going from Fine to Normal 
isn’t worth the risk of artifacts, especially with the price of camera memory 
cards getting lower every day. And of all the defects that you can correct in a 
photo editor, artifacting is perhaps the hardest to accomplish. So if I shoot in 
the JPEG format, I stick with Fine.
If you don’t want any risk of artifacting, bypass JPEG altogether and change 
the file type to Raw, explained next.
Raw (CR2): The purist’s choice
The other picture-file type that you can create on your camera is Camera 
Raw, or just Raw (as in uncooked) for short.
 
Each manufacturer has its own flavor of Raw files; Canon’s are called CR2 
files (or, on some older cameras, CRW). If you use a Windows computer, you 
see that three-letter designation at the end of your picture filenames.
Raw is popular with advanced, very demanding photographers, for two reasons:
 
✓ Greater creative control: With JPEG, internal camera software tweaks 
your images, making adjustments to color, exposure, and sharpness as 
needed to produce the results that Canon believes its customers prefer. 
With Raw, the camera simply records the original, unprocessed image 
data. The photographer then copies the image file to the computer and 
uses special software known as a raw converter to produce the actual 
image, making decisions about color, exposure, and so on at that point. 
The upshot is that “shooting Raw” enables you, not the camera, to have 
the final say on the visual characteristics of your image.
 
✓ Best picture quality: Because Raw doesn’t apply the destructive com-
pression associated with JPEG, you don’t run the risk of the artifacting 
that can occur with JPEG.
But of course, as with most things in life, Raw isn’t without its disadvantages. 
To wit:
 
✓ You must spend time processing your Raw pictures. Until you process 
your files in a Raw converter, you can’t edit your photos or share them 
online. Nor can you have them printed at your local drugstore’s photo 
kiosk or your favorite online printer; if you want a hard copy of a Raw 
image, you must print it yourself, using the Canon software provided 
with your camera (or a third-party program that offers Raw-printing 
capabilities). Additionally, some photo browsers can’t display Raw 
images, although again, you can always view your photos using the pro-
vided Canon software. Long story short, when you shoot Raw, you add 
to the time you must spend in front of the computer instead of behind 
the camera lens. Chapter 8 shows you how to process your Raw files 
using your Canon software.

69
 Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality
 
✓ Raw files are larger than JPEGs. The type of file compression that Raw 
applies doesn’t degrade image quality, but the tradeoff is larger files. In 
addition, Raw files are always captured at the maximum resolution avail-
able on your camera, even if you don’t really need all those pixels. For 
both reasons, Raw files are significantly larger than JPEGs, so they take 
up more room on your memory card and on your computer’s hard drive 
or other picture-storage device.
Are the disadvantages worth the gain? Only you can decide. But before you 
make up your mind, compare the Large/Fine JPEG image in Figure 3-8 with 
its Raw counterpart, shown in Figure 3-10. You may be able to detect some 
subtle quality differences in the enlarged view, but most people would be 
hard pressed to distinguish between the two otherwise. And JPEG certainly 
wins out in terms of convenience, time savings, and smaller file size. (Note 
that during the Raw conversion process, I tried to use settings that kept the 
Raw image as close as possible to its JPEG cousin in all aspects but quality. 
But any variations in exposure, color, and contrast are a result of the conver-
sion process, not of the format per se.)
Raw (CR2), 9.8MB
Figure 3-10: The difference between Raw and Large/Fine images typically is noticeable only when images 
are greatly enlarged.
 
That said, I do shoot in the Raw format when I’m dealing with tricky lighting 
because doing so gives me more control over the final image exposure. For 
example, if you use a capable Raw converter, you can specify how bright you 
want the brightest areas of your photo to appear and how dark you prefer 
your deepest shadows. With JPEG, the camera makes those decisions, which 
can potentially limit your flexibility if you try to adjust exposure in your 
photo editor later.

70
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
I also go Raw if I know that I’m going to want huge prints of a subject. But keep 
in mind: I’m a photography geek, I have all the requisite software, and I don’t 
really have much else to do with my time than process scads of Raw images.
If you do decide to try Raw shooting, you can select from the following two 
Quality options:
 
✓ RAW: This setting produces a single Raw file at the maximum resolution 
(10 megapixels).
 
✓ RAW+Large/Fine: This setting produces two files: the standard Raw file 
plus a JPEG file captured at the Large/Fine setting. At first glance, this 
option sounds great: You can share the JPEG online or get prints made 
and then process your Raw files when you have time.
 
 The problem is that, like the Raw file, the JPEG image is captured at the 
maximum pixel count — which is too large for onscreen viewing. That 
means that you have to edit the JPEG file anyway to trim down the pixel 
count before online sharing, although you can produce great prints right 
away. In addition, creating two files for every image eats up substantially 
more memory card space. I leave it up to you to decide whether the 
pluses are worth the minuses.
My take: Choose Fine or Raw
At this point, you may be finding all this technical goop a bit much — I recog-
nize that panicked look in your eyes — so allow me to simplify things for you. 
Until you have time or energy to completely digest all the ramifications of 
JPEG versus Raw, here’s a quick summary of my thoughts on the matter:
 
✓ If you require the absolute best image quality and have the time and 
interest to do the Raw conversion process, shoot Raw. See Chapter 8 for 
more information on the conversion process.
 
✓ If great photo quality is good enough for you, you don’t have wads of 
spare time, or you aren’t that comfortable with the computer, stick with 
one of the Fine settings (Large/Fine, Medium/Fine, or Small/Fine). 
 
✓ Stay away from JPEG Normal. The tradeoff for smaller files isn’t, in my opin-
ion, worth the risk of compression artifacts. As with my recommendations 
on resolution, this fits the “better safe than sorry” formula: You never know 
when you may capture a spectacular, enlargement-worthy subject, and it 
would be a shame to have the photo spoiled by compression defects.
 
✓ Finally, remember that the format and resolution together determine the 
ultimate picture quality. So be sure that you select the Quality setting 
that offers both the appropriate number of pixels and format for how 
you plan to use your image. If you capture an image at the Small/Normal 
setting, for example, and then print the photo at a large size, the com-
bination of a lower pixel count and a higher level of JPEG compression 
may produce a disappointing picture quality.

71
 Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality
Maintaining a pristine view
Often lost in discussions of digital photo 
defects — compression artifacts, pixelation, 
and the like — is the impact of plain-old dust 
and dirt on picture quality. But no matter what 
camera settings you use, you aren’t going to 
achieve great picture quality with a dirty lens. 
So make it a practice to clean your lens on a 
regular basis, using one of the specialized 
cloths and cleaning solutions made expressly 
for that purpose.
If you continue to notice random blobs or hair-
like defects in your images (refer to the last 
example in Figure 3-1), you probably have a dirty 
image sensor. That’s the part of your camera 
that does the actual image capture — the 
digital equivalent of a film negative, if you will. 
By default, your camera performs an internal 
sensor cleaning every time you turn it on and 
off; you can also run the cleaning process at 
any time you want by opening Setup Menu 2, 
choosing the Sensor Cleaning option, and then 
selecting Clean Now.
Especially if you frequently change lenses in a 
dirty environment, however, this internal clean-
ing mechanism may not be able to fully remove all 
specks from the sensor. In that case, you need a 
more thorough cleaning, which is done by actually 
opening up the camera and using special sensor-
cleaning tools. You can do this job yourself, but . . .
I don’t recommend it. Image sensors are pretty 
delicate beings, and you can easily damage it 
or other parts of your camera if you aren’t care-
ful. Instead, find a local camera store that offers 
this service. In my area (central Indiana), sensor 
cleaning costs about $30 to $50. If you bought 
your camera at a traditional camera store, the 
store may even provide free sensor cleaning as 
a way to keep your business.
One more cleaning tip: Never — and I mean 
never — try to clean any part of your camera 
using a can of compressed air. Doing so can 
not only damage the interior of your camera, 
blowing dust or dirt into areas where it can’t be 
removed, but it can also crack the monitor.

ithout question, my favorite thing about digital photogra-
phy is being able to view my pictures on the camera 
monitor the instant after I shoot them. No more guessing 
whether I captured the image I wanted or need to try 
again; no more wasting money on developing and print-
ing pictures that stink. In fact, this feature alone was 
reason enough for me to turn my back forever on my 
closet full of film photography hardware and all the 
unexposed film remaining from my predigital days.
Of course, with the Rebel XS/1000D, you can use 
the monitor not only to review your photos, but 
also to preview them. That is, if you turn on Live 
View shooting, you can use the monitor instead of the 
viewfinder to compose and focus your shots.
Because both functions of your camera monitor involve some 
of the same buttons, bells, and whistles, I cover them together in 
this chapter. In addition, this chapter explains how to delete pictures that 
you don’t like and protect the ones you love from accidental erasure.

For details about still more monitor-related topics, such as accessing camera 
menus and viewing current shooting settings, check out Chapter 1 if you 
haven’t already done so. Also visit Chapter 9, which covers some additional 
ways to view your images, including how to create in-camera slide shows and 
display your photos on a television screen.
Disabling and Adjusting Instant Review
After you take a picture, it automatically appears briefly on the camera moni-
tor. By default, the instant-review period lasts just two seconds. But you can 
customize this behavior via the Review Time option on Shooting Menu 1, as 
shown in Figure 4-1.
 
 
Figure 4-1: You can extend or disable automatic picture review.
Your choices are as follows:
 
✓ Select one of three specific review periods: 2, 4, or 8 seconds.
 
✓ Select Off to disable the automatic instant review altogether. Turning off 
the monitor can save battery power, so keep this option in mind if the 
battery is running low. You can still view your pictures by pressing the 
Playback button. See the next section for details.
 
✓ Select Hold to display the current image indefinitely — or at least until the 
camera automatically shuts itself off to save power. (See the Chapter 1 
section about Setup Menu 1 to find out about the auto-shutdown feature.)
Viewing Images in Playback Mode
To switch your camera to Playback mode and view the images currently on 
your memory card, take these steps:

75
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback and Live View Shooting
 
 
1. Press the Playback button, labeled in Figure 4-2 and shown in the 
margin here.
 
 The monitor displays the last picture you took along with some shooting 
data.
 
 To find out how to interpret the picture data and specify what data you 
want to see, see the upcoming section “Viewing Picture Data.” If you’re 
curious about your options now, though, press the DISP button to cycle 
through the available data-display formats. (Figure 4-2 shows the image 
in the mode that displays the least amount of shooting data.)
 
Playback button
 
Figure 4-2: Press the Playback button to inspect your photos.
 
2. Press the right or left cross key to scroll through your pictures.
 
• Press the right cross key to view images starting with the oldest 
one on the card.
 
• Press the left cross key to view images in reverse order, starting 
with the most current picture.
 
 Just keep pressing either key to browse through all of your images.
  
3. To return to picture-taking mode, press the Playback button or press 
the shutter button halfway.
 
 The camera exits Playback mode, and the Shooting Settings display 
appears on the monitor. Chapter 1 introduces you to that display.
These steps assume that the camera is currently set to display a single photo 
at a time, as shown in Figure 4-2. You can also display multiple images at a time 
and jump through images 10 or 100 at a time; the next two sections tell all.

76
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Jumping through images
 
If your memory card contains scads of images, here’s a trick you’ll love: By 
using the Jump feature, you can rotate the Main dial to leapfrog through pic-
tures instead of pressing the right or left cross key a bazillion times to get to 
the picture you want to see. You also can search for the first image shot on a 
specific date.
This feature works like so:
 
 
1. Press the Playback button to put the camera into Playback mode.
 
2. Press the up cross key.
 
 The jump bar appears at the 
bottom of the monitor, as shown 
in Figure 4-3.
 
3. Select a Jump mode by pressing 
the up or down cross key.
 
 The current Jump mode appears 
on the jump bar. You have four 
Jump mode options:
 
• Jump 10 Images: Select 
this option to advance 10 
images at a time.
 
• Jump 100 Images: Select 
this option to advance 100 
images at a time.
 
• Jump Shot Date: If your card contains images shot on different 
dates, you can jump between dates with this option. For example, 
if you’re looking at the first of 30 pictures taken on June 1, you can 
jump past all the others from that day to the first image taken on, 
say, June 5.
 
• Jump 1 Image: This option, in effect, disables jumping, restricting 
you to browsing pictures one at a time. More about the point of 
this option later.
 
4. Rotate the Main dial to browse images using the selected Jump mode.
 
 How many images you advance with each turn of the dial depends upon 
the Jump mode you selected.
 
5. To exit Jump mode, press the right or left cross key.
 
 Now you’re back to regular Playback mode, in which each press of the 
right or left cross key advances through your pictures one at a time. You 
can return to your selected Jump mode by simply rotating the Main dial 
at any time.
Figure 4-3: The current Jump mode appears 
on the jump bar.

77
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback and Live View Shooting
 
 So what’s the point of the Jump 1 Image option, if you can return to one-
by-one playback just by pressing the right or left cross key? It’s simply 
provided in case you prefer to use the Main dial to browse your images 
instead of the cross keys. When you select the option, the Jump bar dis-
appears, and then you can use either the Main dial or the cross keys to 
navigate your pictures.
 
You can jump through images only in regular, full-screen Playback mode. The 
Main dial performs a different function in index display mode, in which you 
can view four or nine image thumbnails at a time. The next section explains 
this viewing mode.
Viewing multiple images at a time
 
 If you want to quickly review and compare several photos, you can set the 
camera to index display mode and view thumbnails of either four or nine 
images at a time, as shown in Figure 4-4. Just press the AE Lock button, found 
on the upper-right corner of the camera back and shown in the margin here. 
Press once to display four thumbnails at a time; press again to display nine 
thumbnails.
Note the little blue checkerboard and magnifying glass icons under the 
button — they’re reminders of the function the button serves in Playback 
mode. The checkerboard indicates the index function, and the minus sign in 
the magnifying glass tells you that pressing the button reduces the size of the 
image thumbnail. (The black or silver labels near these buttons indicate a 
function related to picture-taking.)
 
Selected photo
 
Figure 4-4: You can view four or nine thumbnails at once.

78
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Remember these factoids about navigating and viewing your photo collection 
in index display mode: 
 
✓ The highlight box surrounds the currently selected image. For exam-
ple, in Figure 4-4, the upper-left photo is selected.
 
✓ Use the cross keys to select a different image. Press the up cross key to 
shift the selection box up, the right cross key to move it right, and so on.
 
✓ Rotate the Main dial to scroll through screens of thumbnails. Rotate 
right to shift to the next screen; rotate left to go back one screen.
 
 
✓ Press the AF Point Selection button to reduce the number of thumb-
nails. This button lives right next door to the AE Lock button. It, too, 
has a blue magnifying glass icon, this time with a plus sign in the center 
to indicate that pressing the button enlarges the thumbnail size. Press 
once to go from nine thumbnails to four; press again to go from four 
thumbnails to filling the screen with the selected image. To return to 
index display mode, press the AE Lock button again.
Rotating vertical pictures
When you take a picture, the camera can record the image orientation — that 
is, whether you held the camera normally, creating a horizontally oriented 
image, or turned the camera on its side to shoot a vertically oriented photo. 
This bit of data is simply added into the picture file. Then when you view the 
picture, the camera reads the data and rotates the image so that it appears 
upright in the monitor, as shown on the left in Figure 4-5. The image is also 
rotated automatically when you view it in the photo software that shipped 
with your camera.
 
 
Figure 4-5: You can display vertically oriented pictures in their upright position (left) or 
 
sideways (right).

79
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback and Live View Shooting
 
Official photo lingo uses the term portrait orientation to refer to vertically 
oriented pictures and landscape orientation to refer to horizontally oriented 
pictures.
By default, automatic picture rotation is enabled for you. If you want to turn 
it off, you can do so through the Auto Rotate option on Setup Menu 1, as 
shown in Figure 4-6. You also can specify that you want the picture to be 
rotated just on your computer monitor by choosing the second of the two On 
settings (the one that doesn’t sport the little camera icon).
 
 
Figure 4-6: Go to Setup Menu 1 to disable or adjust automatic image rotation.
If you do turn off automatic rotation, you can rotate one or more images 
during playback by taking these steps:
 
 
1. Display the Playback menu and highlight Rotate, as shown in 
Figure 4-7.
 
 
Figure 4-7: You also can rotate individual images from the Playback menu.

80
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
2. Press the Set button.
 
 An image appears on the monitor, as shown on the right in Figure 4-7.
 
3. Navigate to the photo that you want to rotate.
 
 Just press the right and left cross keys to do so.
 
4. Press Set to rotate the image.
 
 Press once to rotate the image 90 degrees; press again to rotate 270 
degrees; and once more to return to 0 degrees.
 
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 to rotate additional photos.
 
6. Press Menu to exit Rotate mode and return to the Playback menu.
You can also rotate images in Index Display mode; just use the cross keys 
to select the photo that you want to rotate and then press the Set key. 
Remember, the highlight box indicates the selected photo.
Zooming in for a closer view
 
 By pressing the AF Point Selection button, posing here in the margin, you can 
more closely inspect a portion of the onscreen image. This feature comes in 
especially handy for checking small details, such as whether anyone’s eyes 
are closed in a group portrait. Here’s the scoop on this feature:
 
✓ Zoom in. You can enlarge an image display to a maximum of 10 times its 
original size. Just keep pressing the AF Point Selection button until you 
reach the magnification you want.
 
✓ View another part of the 
picture. Whenever the image 
is magnified, a little thumbnail 
representing the entire image 
appears briefly in the lower-right 
corner of the monitor, as shown 
in Figure 4-8. The white box indi-
cates the portion of the image 
that’s currently consuming the 
rest of the monitor space.
 
 Use the cross keys to scroll the 
display to view a different por-
tion of the image. Press the up 
cross key to scroll up, the left 
cross key to scroll left, and so on.
Magnified area
Figure 4-8: Press the cross keys to scroll the 
display of the magnified image.

81
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback and Live View Shooting
 
✓ View more images at the same magnification. Here’s an especially neat 
trick: While the display is zoomed, you can rotate the Main dial to dis-
play the same area of the next photo at the same magnification. So, for 
example, if you shot that group portrait several times, you can easily 
check each one for shut-eye problems.
 
✓ View magnified images in index display mode. You can get close-up 
views of the currently selected thumbnail (the one surrounded by the 
highlight box) by pressing the AF Point Selection button. Just press the 
button once or twice to get to full-frame view (depending on whether 
you’re in 4-thumbnail or 9-thumbnail view). Then press again to magnify 
the selected image.
 
 
✓ Zoom out. To zoom out to a reduced magnification, press the AE Lock 
button. Continue holding the button down until you reach the magnifica-
tion you want.
 
✓ Return to full-frame view. When you’re ready to return to the normal 
magnification level, you don’t need to keep pressing the AE Lock button 
until you’re all the way zoomed out. Instead, just press the Playback 
button, which quickly returns you to the standard view.
Viewing Picture Data
In Playback mode, you can choose from four information-display styles, 
which determine which shooting data appears along with the image in the 
monitor.
To cycle through the various modes, just press the DISP button. In single-
image Playback mode, you can access all four display styles. When you 
switch to index mode (viewing four or nine thumbnails at a time) or magnify 
an image, you can choose from just the first two display modes.
Each display mode provides a different assortment of shooting information 
along with your image. The next several sections offer a guide to the data 
you can see in each mode, starting with the most basic and working up to the 
most complex.
Basic information modes
In the simplest display mode, officially called Single Image display, your 
photo appears on the monitor as shown in Figure 4-9. Along the top of the 
screen, you see the following bits of information, labeled in the figure:

82
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
✓ Shutter speed and aperture 
(f-stop): Chapter 5 explains 
these two exposure settings.
 
✓ Exposure Compensation 
value: This option, also 
detailed in Chapter 5, enables 
you to produce a brighter or 
darker image than the cam-
era’s autoexposure meter 
thinks appropriate. If you 
applied exposure compensa-
tion, the amount appears to 
the right of the f-stop. If you 
applied no exposure compen-
sation, this area of the display 
is empty.
 
✓ Protect: Using the Protect 
feature, described later in this 
chapter, you can “lock” an 
image to prevent it from being 
erased when you use the cam-
era’s Erase function. (Formatting the memory card does delete the pic-
ture, however, so use caution.) If you protect the photo, a little key icon 
appears next to the Exposure Compensation value. Otherwise, this part 
of the display is empty.
 
✓ Folder number and last four digits of file number: See Chapter 1 for infor-
mation about how the camera 
assigns folder and file numbers.
From Single Image mode, press the 
DISP button again to shift to a mode 
called Single Image Plus Quality. Now 
you get two additional pieces of infor-
mation, as shown in Figure 4-10: 
 
✓ Quality setting: This setting, cov-
ered in Chapter 3, determines the 
image resolution (pixel count) 
and file format (JPEG or Raw).
 
 The Quality symbols are the 
same ones used to indicate the 
Quality setting on the camera 
menus and Shooting Settings 
screen. Chapter 3 has a chart to 
help you decode them.

Image number/total images
Figure 4-10: Press DISP again to add Quality 
setting information to the basic display.

83
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback and Live View Shooting
 
✓ Image number/total images: This pair of values shows you the current 
image number and the total number of images on the memory card. For 
example, in Figure 4-10, you’re seeing picture 20 out of 29. (Don’t con-
fuse the image number with the actual file number; again, the last four 
digits of the file number appear in the top-right corner of the display, 
along with the folder number.)
To view more complete details about the camera settings you used to take a 
picture, switch to Shooting Information display mode or Histogram display 
mode. The next sections explain how to interpret all the data that appears in 
these two modes.
Shooting Information display
In the Shooting Information display 
mode, the camera presents a thumb-
nail of your image along with scads of 
shooting data, as shown in Figure 4-11. 
(Remember: Just press the DISP button 
to cycle through display modes.)
The chart-like thingy on the right 
side of the screen is an exposure-
evaluation tool known as a histogram. 
You can get schooled in reading histo-
grams in the next section.
 
If any areas of the image thumbnail 
are blinking, though, you don’t even 
need to go that far to know that you 
may have an exposure problem. Those blinking spots indicate areas that are 
completely white — known in the photography business as blown highlights. 
Depending on where in the image those areas occur, you may or may not have 
an exposure problem. For example, if someone’s face contains the blinking 
spots, that someone is overexposed, and you should take steps to correct the 
problem. But if the blinking occurs in, say, a bright window behind the subject, 
and the subject itself looks fine, you may choose to just ignore the alert.
To sort out the maze of other data, it helps to break the display down into 
five rows of information — the row along the top of the screen and the four 
rows that appear under the image thumbnail and histogram, as follows:
 
✓ Row 1 data: Here you see the same data that appears in the two basic 
display modes, explained in the preceding section.
 
✓ Row 2 data: Jump now to the row of symbols just underneath the 
thumbnail and histogram. Labeled in Figure 4-12, these symbols indicate 
the following:
Figure 4-11: You can view more data in 
Shooting Information playback mode.

84
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
Metering mode
Exposure mode
ISO speed
Flash Compensation
 
Figure 4-12: This row contains additional exposure information.
 
• Exposure mode: This symbol indicates which of the camera’s 
exposure modes you used — Full Auto, P (programmed autoex-
posure), Portrait, and so on. The symbols mirror what you see on 
the camera Mode dial. You can find details about all the modes in 
Chapters 2 and 5.
 
• Exposure metering mode: This symbol represents the metering 
mode, which determines which part of the frame the camera used 
when calculating exposure. Chapter 5 explains.
 
• Flash Compensation amount: Here you can see whether you 
adjusted flash power using the Flash Compensation feature, 
detailed in Chapter 5.
 
• ISO speed: Chapter 5 also explains this option, which controls the 
light sensitivity of the camera’s image sensor.
 
✓ Row 3 data: Information on this row of the display, labeled in Figure 4-13, 
is mostly related to color settings. Here’s the scoop:
 
White balance
Picture style
White balance correction
 
Figure 4-13: Look to this row for details about advanced color settings.
 
• White balance setting: Chapter 6 has details on this option, which 
helps eliminate any unwanted color casts from your photos. AWB 
stands for Auto White Balance; see the table in Chapter 6 for a look 
at what the other symbols you may see here represent.
 
• White balance correction: Adjacent to the White Balance icon, this 
collection of data tells you whether you applied any adjustment 
to the white balance setting you used. Chapter 6 explains this 
advanced color option.

85
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback and Live View Shooting
 
• Picture Style: Notice that this symbol looks just like the one on the 
bottom cross key on the camera back? In both cases, the symbol 
represents Picture Styles, which enable you to tweak image color, 
contrast, and sharpness. The S you see in Figure 4-13 represents 
the Standard Picture Style, which is the default applied in most 
exposure modes. The values to the right of the symbol relate to 
the four characteristics that you can adjust for each Picture Style. 
Chapter 6 explains how each Picture Style affects your image.
 
✓ Row 4 data: Shown at the top of Figure 4-14, this row tells you the fol-
lowing tidbits of information:
 
Quality
Color space
File size
Image number/total images
Date/time
Original Decision Data
 
Figure 4-14: The bottom two rows of the display offer this data.
 
• Quality and file size: For details on the Quality setting and how it 
affects file size and picture quality, see Chapter 3.
 
• Original Decision Data: The Rebel XS/1000D enables you to tag an 
image file with a code that indicates that the image is original — 
meaning that it hasn’t been altered in a photo program or oth-
erwise tampered with after it was captured. In order to check 
the code, you need a separate product called the Original Data 
Verification Kit, which retails for about $650, unfortunately. If you 
do enable the feature on the camera, which I explain how to do in 
Chapter 11, a lock icon appears in this area of the playback screen.
 
• Color space: Your camera can capture images in two color spaces, 
sRGB and Adobe RGB. A color space is a definition of the spectrum 
of colors that an image can contain. You can change color spaces 
only in advanced exposure modes; Chapter 6 has details about 
how and why to do so.
 
✓ Row 5 data: Wrapping up the smorgasbord of shooting data, the bottom 
row of the playback screen holds two more pieces of information:
 
• Image number/total images recorded: Again, this pair of numbers 
indicates the current image number with respect to the total 
number of images on the current memory card. 

86
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
• Date and time: These values show you the exact moment that the 
image was recorded. Of course, you must first set the camera date 
and time, as Chapter 1 explains.
 
One note about Figures 4-11 through 4-14: I included all possible symbols, 
values, and other shooting data just for the purposes of illustration. If any of 
the data items don’t appear on your monitor, it simply means that the feature 
wasn’t enabled when you captured the photo.
Understanding Histogram display mode
When you switch from Shooting 
Information display mode to the 
Histogram display mode, you see the 
data shown in Figure 4-15. Again, you 
get the thumbnail view of your image, 
but this time some of the extensive 
shooting data is replaced by a second 
histogram.
The next two sections explain what 
information you can glean from the 
histograms. See the preceding sec-
tions for a map to the other shooting 
data on the screen. 
Interpreting a brightness 
histogram
One of the most difficult photo prob-
lems to correct in a photo editing 
program is known as blown highlights in some circles and clipped highlights 
in others. In plain English, both terms mean that highlights — the brightest 
areas of the image — are so overexposed that areas that should include 
a variety of light shades are instead totally white. For example, in a cloud 
image, pixels that should be light to very light gray become white due to 
overexposure, resulting in a loss of detail in those clouds.
In Shooting Information display mode, areas that fall into this category blink 
in the image thumbnail. This warning is a great feature because simply view-
ing the image on the camera monitor isn’t always a reliable way to gauge 
exposure; the relative brightness of the monitor and the ambient light in 
which you view it affect the appearance of the image onscreen. 
For a detailed analysis of the image exposure, check the Brightness histogram, 
which is a little graph that indicates the distribution of shadows, highlights, and 
midtones (areas of medium brightness) in your image, as shown in Figure 4-16. 
Brightness histogram
RGB histogram
Figure 4-15: Histogram display mode replaces 
some shooting data with an RGB histogram.

87
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback and Live View Shooting
Photographers use the term tonal 
range to describe this aspect of 
their pictures. The Brightness 
histogram appears to the right of 
the image thumbnail in Shooting 
Info display mode and in the lower 
right corner in Histogram display 
mode.
The horizontal axis of the graph 
represents the possible picture 
brightness values, from the dark-
est shadows on the left to the 
brightest highlights on the right. 
And the vertical axis shows you 
how many pixels fall at a particu-
lar brightness value. A spike indi-
cates a heavy concentration of 
pixels. For example, in Figure 4-16, which shows the histogram for the image 
in Figure 4-15, the histogram shows a fairly broad range of brightness values, 
but few pixels at the maximum brightness or shadow values. 
 
Keep in mind that there is no one “perfect” histogram that you should try 
to achieve. Instead, you need to interpret the histogram with respect to the 
amount of shadows, highlights, and midtones that comprise your subject. For 
example, the histogram in Figure 4-15 makes sense for this particular image 
because the subject itself contains few very white or black areas — hence 
the lack of pixels at either end of the histogram. You should pay attention, 
however, if you see a very high concentration of pixels at the far right or left 
end of the histogram, which can indicate a seriously overexposed or under-
exposed image, respectively.
Reading an RGB 
histogram
When you view your images 
in Histogram display mode, 
you see two histograms: the 
Brightness histogram, 
covered in the preceding 
section, and an RGB histo-
gram, shown in Figure 4-17.
To make sense of the RGB 
histogram, you first need to 
know that digital images are 
called RGB images because 
Shadows
Highlights

tonal range of your image.
Less saturated
More saturated
Figure 4-17: The RGB histogram can indicate problems 
with color saturation.

88
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
they are created out of three primary colors of light: red, green, and blue. 
The RGB histogram shows you the brightness values for each of those pri-
mary colors.
By checking the brightness levels of the individual color components, some-
times referred to as color channels, you can assess the picture’s color satu-
ration levels. If most of the pixels for one or more channels are clustered 
toward the right end of the histogram, colors may be oversaturated, which 
destroys detail. On the flip side, a heavy concentration of pixels at the left 
end of the histogram indicates an image that may be undersaturated.
A savvy RGB histogram reader can also spot color balance issues by look-
ing at the pixel values. But frankly, color-balance problems are fairly easy to 
notice just by looking at the image itself. And understanding how to translate 
the histogram data for this purpose requires more knowledge about RGB 
color theory than I have room to present in this book.
 
If you are a fan of RGB histograms, however, you may be interested in 
another possibility: You can swap the standard Brightness histogram that 
appears in Shooting Information playback mode with the RGB histogram. 
Just visit the Playback menu, highlight the Histogram option, as shown in 
Figure 4-18, and press the Set button to display the right screen in the figure. 
Select RGB instead of Brightness and press the Set button again.
 
 
Figure 4-18: You can change the histogram type that appears in Shooting Information 
 
playback mode.
For information about manipulating color, see Chapter 6.

 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback and Live View Shooting
Deleting Photos
When you spot a clunker image during your picture review, you can erase it from 
your memory card in a couple of ways, as outlined in the next three sections.
Erasing single images
To delete photos one at a time, take these steps:
 
1. Select the image that you want to delete.
 
 If you are viewing images in single-frame mode, just display the image 
on the monitor. In index display mode, use the cross keys to move the 
highlight box over the image thumbnail.
 
 
2. Press the Erase button.
 
 It’s the one with the little trash can icon, as shown in the margin here.
 
 Two options — Cancel and 
Erase — appear at the bottom 
of the screen, as shown in 
Figure 4-19.
 
3. Highlight Erase and then press 
the Set button.
 
 Your picture is zapped into digi-
tal oblivion.
 
If you accidentally erase a picture, 
don’t panic — you may be able to 
restore it by using data-restoration 
software. One memory card manufac-
turer, SanDisk, even provides this type 
of software free on some of its memory 
cards. You also can buy stand-alone programs such as MediaRecover ($30, 
www.mediarecover.com) or Lexar Image Rescue (also $30, www.lexar.com). 
But in order to have a chance at recovering deleted data, you must not take 
any more pictures or perform any other operations on your camera while the 
current memory card is in it. If you do, you may overwrite the erased picture 
data for good and eliminate the possibility of recovering the image.
Figure 4-19: Highlight Erase and press Set to 
delete the current image.

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Erasing all images on your memory card
To dump all the pictures on the memory card, take this approach:
 
1. Display the Playback menu and highlight Erase Images, as shown on 
the left in Figure 4-20.
 
 
Figure 4-20: Use the Erase option on the Playback menu to delete multiple images quickly.
 
2. Press the Set button to display the right screen in Figure 4-20.
 
3. Highlight All Images on Card and press the Set button.
 
 After you press Set, you see a confirmation screen asking whether you 
really want to delete all of your pictures. Select OK and press Set to go 
ahead and dump the photos. (Note, though, that pictures that you have 
protected, a step discussed two sections from now, are left intact.)
 
4. Press Menu to return to the Playback menu.
 
 Or press the shutter button halfway to return to shooting pictures.
Erasing selected images
If you want to erase many, but not all, images on your memory card, you can 
save time by using this deleting option:
 
1. On the Playback menu, highlight Erase Images, as shown on the left in 
Figure 4-21, and press Set.
 
 You see the main Erase Images screen, as shown on the right in Figure 4-21.

Protecting Photos
You can protect pictures from accidental erasure by giving them protected 
status. After you take this step, the camera doesn’t allow you to delete a pic-
ture with the Erase Images function.
 
Formatting your memory card, however, does erase even protected pictures. 
See the nearby sidebar for more about formatting.
The picture protection feature comes in especially handy if you share a camera 
with other people. You can protect pictures so that those other people know 
that they shouldn’t delete your super-great images to make room on the memory 
card for their stupid, badly photographed ones. (This step isn’t foolproof, 
though, because anyone can remove the protected status from an image.)
 
Perhaps more importantly, when you protect a picture, it shows up as a 
“read-only” file when you transfer it to a computer. Files that have that 
read-only status can’t be altered. Again, anyone with some computer savvy 
can remove the status, but this feature can keep casual users from messing 
around with your images after you’ve downloaded them to your system.
Of course, you have to know how to remove the read-only status yourself if you 
plan on editing your photo in your photo software. (Hint: In Canon ZoomBrowser 
EX, the free Windows-based software that ships with your camera, you can do 
this by choosing File➪Protect. That command toggles image protection on and 
off. In ImageBrowser, the Mac version of the Canon software, choose File➪Get 
Info and then click the Lock box to toggle file-protection on and off.)
Deleting versus formatting: What’s the diff?
In Chapter 1, I introduce you to the Format com-
mand, which lives on Setup Menu 1 and erases 
everything on your memory card. What’s the dif-
ference between erasing photos by formatting 
and by using the Erase Images option on the 
Playback menu to delete all your pictures?
Well, in terms of pictures taken with your Canon, 
none. But if you happen to have stored other 
data on the card, such as, say, a music file or 
a picture taken on another type of camera, you 
need to format the card to erase everything on 
it. You can’t view those files on the monitor, so 
you can’t use the Erase Images feature to get 
rid of them.
One final — and important — note: Although 
using the Protect feature (explained elsewhere 
in this chapter) prevents the Erase function from 
erasing a picture, formatting erases all pictures, 
protected or not. Formatting also ensures that 
the card is properly prepared to store any new 
images you may take.

93
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback and Live View Shooting
Anyway, protecting a picture on the camera is easy. Just take these steps:
 
1. Display the Playback menu and highlight Protect Images, as shown on 
the left in Figure 4-23.
 
 
Figure 4-23: Apply Protect status to prevent accidental erasure of important images.
 
2. Press Set.
 
 An image appears on the monitor, along with a little key icon in the 
upper-left corner, as shown on the right in Figure 4-23.
 
3. Navigate to the picture that you want to protect.
 
 Just press the right or left cross key to scroll through your pictures.
 
4. Press Set to lock the picture.
 
 Now a second key icon appears 
with the data at the top of the 
screen, as shown in Figure 4-24.
 
5. To lock more pictures, repeat 
Steps 3 and 4.
 
6. Press the Menu button to exit 
the protection process.
To remove picture protection while 
the picture card is still in the camera, 
follow these same steps. When you 
display the locked picture, just press 
Set to turn the protection off.
Figure 4-24: The key icon indicates that the 
picture is protected.

Using Your Monitor as a Viewfinder
If you’ve used a compact, point-and-shoot digital camera, you may be used 
to composing your pictures on the camera monitor rather than by looking 
through the viewfinder. In fact, many compact cameras no longer even offer 
a viewfinder, which is a real shame, in my opinion. Why? Because when you 
use the monitor to frame the image, you must hold the camera away from 
your body, a shooting posture that increases the likelihood of blurry images 
caused by camera shake. When you use the viewfinder, you can brace the 
camera against your face, creating a much steadier shooting stance.
Due to some design complexities that I won’t bore you with, most digital SLR 
cameras do not enable you to preview shots on the monitor. Your XS/1000D, 
however, does offer that feature, known as Live View in Canon nomenclature. 
But using your monitor as a viewfinder on your camera isn’t quite as simple 
as when you use a point-and-shoot, non-SLR model — again, the difference is 
due to the more involved design of an SLR camera.
 
Here are the important points to know before you experiment with Live View 
shooting:
 
✓ Live View is available only in advanced exposure modes. That is, you 
must set the Mode dial to P, Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP mode.
  
✓ Manual focusing is recommended. You can use autofocusing, but 
manual focusing usually offers faster, more precise results. Chapter 6 
covers the autofocusing methods available in Live View mode just the 
same.
 
✓ You must set some capture settings before switching to Live View 
mode. After you enable Live View, you can’t adjust the Drive mode 
(covered in Chapter 2), the Picture Style (Chapter 6), the AF Selection 
Point, or the AF mode (both covered in Chapter 6). Of course, the latter 
two options, which relate to autofocusing, don’t matter if you’re using 
manual focus. 
 
✓ Some other functions are either disabled or limited in Live View 
mode. Here’s the list of affected features:
 
• Flash limitations: Flash Exposure lock, covered in Chapter 5, is dis-
abled. In addition, non-Canon flash units will not work in Live View 
mode.
 
• A-DEP mode: This mode functions the same as P (programmed 
autoexposure), meaning that it no longer tries to achieve a depth 
of field that keeps all objects in the frame in sharp focus. Chapter 
5 explains more about these two modes; Chapter 6 details depth of 
field and its creative impact on your pictures.

95
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback and Live View Shooting
 
• Continuous shooting: You can use the Continuous Drive mode, 
introduced in Chapter 2, but the camera will use the exposure 
settings chosen for the first frame for all the images. 
 
• Metering mode: You cannot use Center-Weighted Average or Partial 
exposure metering; the camera always uses Evaluative metering in 
Live View mode. Chapter 5 explains metering modes.
 
• Custom Functions 9, 10, and 11: You can’t enable mirror lock-up 
(Custom Function 9) in Live View mode. Also, any custom settings 
that you apply to the shutter button and AE Lock button through 
Custom Function 10 don’t work. Finally, the Set button is used to 
switch Live View on and off, so it can’t perform any of the func-
tions that you may assign via Custom Function 11. (See Chapter 11 
for details on all these Custom Functions.)
 
✓ Using Live View for an extended period of time can increase image 
noise. When you work in Live View mode for a long time, the camera’s 
innards heat up, and that extra heat can create the right electronic con-
ditions for noise, a defect that gives your pictures a speckled look.
  
 Shooting at a high ISO speed or selecting a very slow shutter speed can 
also produce noise. To avoid compounding the risk of noise when you 
use Live View, set up your shot and then give the camera a brief cool-
down by turning off Live View for a few minutes. You can then return to 
Live View mode and capture the image. See Chapter 5 for more informa-
tion about the other two potential causes of noise.
 
✓ You must be extra careful to keep the camera steady during the image 
capture. Just as with a point-and-shoot camera, holding the camera out in 
front of you to capture the image can cause slight camera shake that can 
blur your image. But with an SLR, the risk is greater because of the added 
weight of the camera and lens. And if you use a so-called long lens — a 
telephoto or zoom lens that extends to a long focal length — the potential 
for camera shake is compounded. So for best results, mount the camera 
on a tripod when you use Live View.
Live View also has the same two other disadvantages that you get when you 
frame with the monitor on a point-and-shoot camera: First, any time you use 
the camera monitor, whether it’s for composing a shot or reviewing your 
images, you put extra strain on the battery. So keep an eye on the battery 
status icon to avoid running out of juice at a critical moment. Second, the 
monitor display can wash out in bright sunlight, making it difficult to use for 
composing outdoor shots.
This laundry list of caveats doesn’t mean that I’m advising you not to use Live 
View, however — just that you shouldn’t envision it as a full-time alternative 
to your viewfinder. Rather, think of it as a special-purpose tool that can help in 
shooting situations where framing with the viewfinder is cumbersome.

96
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
I find Live View most helpful for still-life, tabletop photography, especially in 
cases that require a lot of careful arrangement of the scene. For example, I 
have a shooting table that’s about waist high. Normally, I put my camera on a 
tripod, come up with an initial layout of the objects I want to photograph, set 
up my lights, and then check the scene through the viewfinder. Then there’s 
a period of refining the object placement, the lighting, and so on. If I’m shoot-
ing from a high angle, requiring the camera to be positioned above the table 
and pointing downward, I have to stand on my tiptoes or get a stepladder to 
check things out through the viewfinder between each compositional or light-
ing change. At lower angles, where the camera is tabletop height or below, I 
have to either bend over or kneel to look through the viewfinder, causing no 
end of later aches and pains to back and knees. With Live View, I can alleviate 
much of that bothersome routine (and pain) because I can usually see how 
things look in the monitor no matter what the camera position.
With that lengthy preamble out of the way, the next few sections show you 
how to enable Live View and provide a brief introduction to the process 
of Live View shooting. Also see Chapter 5 for details about monitoring and 
adjusting exposure in Live View mode; check out Chapter 6 for Live View 
autofocusing options.
Enabling Live View
Before you can use Live View, you must take these steps:
 
1. Set the Mode dial to P, Tv, Av, 
M, or A-DEP.
 
 You can use Live View only in 
these exposure modes. Chapter 5 
explains them all; for now, choose 
P (programmed autoexposure) if 
you’re not familiar with the other 
modes and you just want to exper-
iment with Live View.
 
2. Press the Menu button and dis-
play Setup Menu 2.
 
3. Highlight Live View Function 
Settings, as shown in Figure 4-25.
 
4. Press the Set button.
 
 You see the screen shown on the left in Figure 4-26.
Figure 4-25: You must enable Live View 
through Setup Menu 2.

97
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback and Live View Shooting
 
 
Figure 4-26: Select Enable and press the Set button.
 
5. Select Live View Shoot and press the Set button again.
 
 Now you see the screen shown on the right in Figure 4-26.
 
6. Select Enable and press Set.
 
7. Adjust the metering timing (optional).
 
 By default, the exposure meter shuts itself off after 16 seconds when you 
work in Live View mode to conserve battery power. You can adjust this 
timing through the Metering Timer option, shown on the left in Figure 
4-26. Highlight the option, press Set, and then select a time option. Your 
choices range from 4 seconds to 30 minutes. Press Set once more after 
making your selection. (Chapter 5 talks more about the purpose of the 
exposure meter.)
 
8. Press the Menu button to return to Setup Menu 2.
 
After you enable Live View shooting, just press Set to toggle the monitor pre-
view on and off. Note, though, that turning the monitor preview off does not 
officially disable Live View mode; you must revisit the Live View Shoot option 
on Setup Menu 2 to do that. (Don’t forget that while Live View is enabled, you 
lose access to certain other camera features; see the preceding section for 
details.)
Taking a shot in Live View mode
After you enable Live View, follow this approach to focus and record your 
shot:
 
1. Check the setting on the Mode dial on top of the camera.
 
 Remember, you must set the dial to P, Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP to use Live 
View. (Again, if you’re just experimenting, select P.)

98
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
2. Set the focus switch on your lens to MF (for manual focus).
 
 You can use autofocusing in Live View mode, but focusing manually is 
easier, faster, and may be more precise. If you do want to use autofocus, 
Chapter 6 spells out how to do so; you can set up the camera for two 
types of Live View autofocusing, each of which works a little differently.
 
 Note that if you use a lens other than the kit lens sold with the Rebel 
XS/1000D, the switch that shifts you to manual focus may sport a label 
other than MF. Consult the lens manual for specifics.
 
3. If the camera is mounted on a tripod, turn off the Image Stabilizer 
feature.
 
 As explained in Chapter 1, image stabilization isn’t necessary when you 
shoot with a tripod. And because it consumes extra battery power, turn-
ing it off is a good idea for Live View tripod shooting with most lenses. 
However, check your lens manual just to be sure: Some lens manufactur-
ers vary in their recommendations on this issue.
 
4. Press the Set button to switch from normal viewfinder operation to 
the Live View preview.
 
 Now you see your scene in 
the monitor, as shown in 
Figure 4-27. At the bottom 
of the screen, you see 
data similar to what is dis-
played in the viewfinder 
during normal shooting: 
shutter speed and aper-
ture (f-stop), the exposure 
meter, the number of 
shots remaining on the 
camera memory card, and 
the ISO speed setting.
 
 Also note the rectangle in 
the center of the screen, 
labeled Focusing frame in 
Figure 4-27. That frame is 
provided as a way for you 
to verify focus, as detailed 
in Steps 5 and 6.
 
 You can display other information by pressing the DISP button; see the 
next section for a look at your options.
 
5. Frame the shot as desired.
Focusing frame
Figure 4-27: Place the center square over the point 
where you want to establish focus.

99
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback and Live View Shooting
 
6. Press the cross keys to move the focusing frame over the spot where 
you want to focus.
 
 Or, to put the focusing frame smack in the middle of the screen, press 
the Erase button (the one that sports the trash can symbol).
 
7. Turn the lens focusing ring to set initial focus.
 
 On the kit lens, the focus ring is at the far end of the lens. (See Chapter 1 
if you need help.)
 
 
8. Press the AF Point Selection button to magnify the view and refine 
focus if needed.
 
 By pressing the button, you magnify the area within the focusing frame. 
Your first press of the button magnifies the view by five, as shown on 
the left in Figure 4-28. The second press zooms you to ten times magnifi-
cation, as shown on the right. 
 
Magnified area
 
Figure 4-28: Magnify the preview to double-check focus.
 
 In the lower-right corner of the monitor, you see a label showing the cur-
rent magnification level. Underneath that label, the box inside the small 
rectangle indicates the portion of the overall frame that you’re viewing. 
If needed, you can reposition the focusing frame to check another part 
of the image by using the cross keys.
 
 Adjust the focusing ring as needed to achieve just the right focusing dis-
tance. When you’re happy with the focus, press the AF Point Selection 
button once more to return to full-frame view.

100
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
9. Press the shutter button halfway to initiate exposure metering.
 
 If needed, you can adjust exposure in P, Av, and Tv modes by using 
Exposure Compensation, a feature covered in Chapter 5. In Manual (M) 
exposure mode, you can adjust shutter speed and f-stop as usual. Again, 
Chapter 5 spells out the details.
 
10. Depress the shutter button fully to take the shot.
 
 You see your just-captured image on the monitor for a few seconds as 
usual. Then the Live View preview returns, and you’re ready to take the 
next shot.
 
11. To exit the Live View preview, press the Set button.
 
 You’re returned to the standard Shooting Settings screen. You can then 
return to framing your images through the viewfinder.
Customizing the Live View display
You can alter a couple of aspects of the monitor display for Live View 
shooting, as follows:
 
✓ Display an alignment grid. When 
you’re doing the kind of work for 
which Live View is best suited, 
such as taking product shots or 
capturing other still-life subjects, 
the exact placement of objects 
in the frame can sometimes be 
important. To assist you in that 
regard, the camera can display a 
grid on the monitor, as shown in 
Figure 4-29. 
 
 To display the grid, visit Setup 
Menu 2, highlight Live View 
Function Settings, and press the 
Set button. Then highlight Grid 
Display, as shown on the left in Figure 4-30, press the Set button, high-
light On as shown on the right in the figure, and press Set again. Repeat 
the process and choose Off to lose the grid.
 
✓ Display shooting information. By pressing the DISP button, you can 
superimpose a few additional bits of shooting information on the scene, 
as shown in Figure 4-31. For the most part, the icons you see here are 
the same as when you view shooting information in Playback mode, a 
topic discussed earlier in this chapter. Here’s a brief review: 
Figure 4-29: For help aligning objects in the 
frame, display the grid.

Chapter 6.
 
• Picture Style: Chapter 6 also details Picture Styles, which affect pic-
ture color, contrast, and sharpness.
 
• Quality: This icon tells you the selected Quality setting, which 
Chapter 3 explains.
 
• Exp.SIM: This symbol, which stands for exposure simulation, indi-
cates whether the image brightness you see on the monitor is sim-
ulating the actual exposure you will record. If the symbol blinks or 
is dimmed, as in the figure, the camera can’t provide an accurate 
exposure preview, which can occur if the ambient light is either 
very bright or very dim. Exposure simulation is also disabled when 
you use flash in Live View mode.
 
• AE (autoexposure) lock and flash status: The asterisk tells you that 
autoexposure lock is in force; a steady flash symbol tells you that 
the flash is ready to fire. Neither symbol appears if you don’t use 
these features for your shot. See Chapter 5 for information about 
both features.
 
• Shutter speed and aperture (f-stop): See Chapter 5 for help under-
standing these options, too.
 
• Exposure meter: Yep, here’s another exposure feature covered in 
Chapter 5.
 
• Flash Compensation: If you enabled Flash Compensation to adjust 
the flash power, this symbol appears. Otherwise, the area of the 
screen is empty. Chapter 5 covers this feature as well.
 
• Shots remaining: This number tells you how many pictures will fit 
on the memory card at your current Quality setting.
 
• ISO speed: This setting controls the camera’s sensitivity to light; 
see Chapter 5 for information.
 
• Battery status: A full battery icon like the one in Figure 4-31 says 
you’re good to go.
 
✓ Display a brightness histogram. After pressing DISP once to reveal all 
the icons shown in Figure 4-31, press again to add a brightness histo-
gram to the mix, as shown in Figure 4-32. See the section “Interpreting 

103
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback and Live View Shooting
a brightness histogram,” 
earlier in this chapter, to 
find out what the histo-
gram can tell you.
 
 When you use flash, the 
histogram is dimmed 
(and what you can see 
isn’t accurate because it 
doesn’t reflect the expo-
sure as it will be when the 
flash is used). 
 
If you switch to autofocusing 
in Live View mode, what you 
see on the monitor differs 
slightly than what you see in 
the figures in this chapter. For 
details about using autofocus 
with Live View, visit Chapter 6.

Taking Creative Control

In this part . . .
A
s nice as it is to be able to set your camera 
to automatic mode and let it handle most of 
the photographic decisions, I encourage you to 
also explore the advanced exposure modes (P, Tv, 
Av, M, and A-DEP). In these modes, you can make 
your own decisions about the exposure, focus, 
and color characteristics of your photo, which is 
key to capturing an image as you see it in your 
mind’s eye. And don’t think that you have to be a 
genius or spend years to be successful — adding 
just a few simple techniques to your photographic 
repertoire can make a huge difference in how 
happy you are with the pictures you take. 
The ﬁ rst two chapters in this part explain every-
thing you need to know to do just that, providing 
some necessary photography fundamentals and 
details about using the advanced exposure modes. 
Following that, Chapter 7 helps you draw together 
all the information presented earlier in the book, 
summarizing the best camera settings and other 
tactics to use when capturing portraits, action 
shots, landscapes, and close-up shots.

y using the fully automatic modes covered in 
Chapter 2, you can take great pictures with your 
Rebel XS/1000D. But to really exploit your camera’s 
capabilities — and, more important, to exploit your 
creative capabilities — you need to explore your 
camera’s five advanced exposure modes, repre-
sented on the Mode dial by the letters P, Tv, Av, M, 
and A-DEP. 
This chapter explains everything you need to know 
to start taking advantage of these five modes. First, 
you get an introduction to the critical exposure con-
trols known as aperture, shutter speed, and ISO. Adjusting 
these settings enables you to not only fine-tune image expo-
sure but also affect other aspects of your image, such as depth 
of field (the zone of sharp focus) and motion blur. In addition, this 
chapter explains other advanced exposure features, such as exposure com-
pensation and metering modes, and discusses the flash options available to 
you in the advanced exposure modes. 

108
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
If you’re worried that this stuff is too complicated for you, by the way, don’t 
be. Even in these advanced exposure modes, the camera provides you with 
enough feedback that you’re never truly flying without a net. Between the 
in-camera support and the information in this chapter, you can easily master 
aperture, shutter speed, and all the other exposure features — an important 
step in making the shift from picture-taker to photographer.
Kicking Your Camera into Advanced Gear
 
The first step to taking the exposure 
reins is to set your camera’s Mode 
dial to one of the five shooting modes 
highlighted in Figure 5-1: P, Tv, Av, 
M, or A-DEP. You also need to shoot 
in one of these modes to use certain 
other camera features, such as manual 
white balancing, a color feature that 
you can explore in Chapter 6.
Each of the five modes offers a differ-
ent level of control over two critical 
exposure settings, aperture and shutter 
speed. Later in this chapter, I explain 
these controls fully, but here’s a quick 
introduction:
 
✓ P (programmed auto exposure): 
In this mode, the camera selects 
both the aperture and shutter speed for you. But you can choose from 
different combinations of the two, which gives you creative flexibility 
not possible in the fully automatic modes discussed in Chapter 2. 
 
✓ Tv (shutter-priority autoexposure): In this mode, you select a shutter 
speed, and the camera chooses the aperture setting that produces a 
good exposure. Why Tv? Well, shutter speed controls exposure time; 
Tv stands for time value. 
 
✓ Av (aperture-priority autoexposure): The opposite of shutter-priority 
autoexposure, this mode asks you to select the aperture setting — thus 
Av, for aperture value. The camera then selects the appropriate shutter 
speed to properly expose the picture.
 
✓ A-DEP (auto depth of field): Depth of field refers to the extent to which 
objects at a distance from your subject appear sharply focused. One 
way to control depth of field is to adjust the aperture setting. In this 
exposure mode, the camera assesses the distance between the lens and 
major objects in the frame and tries to choose an aperture setting that 
keeps all those objects within the zone of sharp focus. Then the camera 
sets the shutter speed appropriate for the aperture it selected.
Advanced exposure modes
Figure 5-1: You can control exposure and 
other picture properties only in P, Tv, Av, M, 
and A-DEP modes.

109
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
 
 Although this mode is a nice feature for photographers not yet schooled 
in manipulating depth of field, it provides the least amount of photo-
graphic control of all the advanced exposure modes because you’re stuck 
with whatever aperture and shutter speed the camera selects. In addition, 
when you use flash or enable Live View shooting, you lose the automatic 
depth-of-field feature, and A-DEP mode works just like P mode — but with-
out giving you the benefit of being able to select from different combina-
tions of aperture and shutter speed. So after you digest the depth-of-field 
discussion in Chapter 6, I suggest that you practice using Av mode 
instead, where you can select the aperture yourself.
 
✓ M (manual exposure): In this mode, you specify both shutter speed and 
aperture. But even in manual mode, the camera assists you by displaying 
a meter that tells you whether your exposure settings are on target.
Again, I realize that the descriptions of these modes won’t make much sense 
to you if you aren’t already schooled in the basics of exposure. If you are and 
you just want to know the specifics of using these modes on your camera, flip 
to “Setting ISO, f-stop, and Shutter Speed,” later in this chapter. Otherwise, 
the next several sections provide you with the fundamentals you need to 
make good use of the advanced modes.
Introducing the Exposure Trio: Aperture, 
Shutter Speed, and ISO
Any photograph, whether taken 
with a film or digital camera, is 
created by focusing light through a 
lens onto a light-sensitive recording 
medium. In a film camera, the film 
negative serves as that medium; in a 
digital camera, it’s the image sensor, 
which is an array of light-responsive 
computer chips.
Between the lens and the sensor are 
two barriers, known as the aperture 
and shutter, which together control 
how much light makes its way to 
the sensor. The actual design and 
arrangement of the aperture, shutter, 
and sensor vary depending on the 
camera, but Figure 5-2 offers an 
illustration of the basic concept.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
The aperture and shutter, along with a third feature known as ISO, determine 
exposure — what most of us would describe as the picture’s overall bright-
ness and contrast. This three-part exposure formula works as follows:
 
✓ Aperture (controls amount of light): The aperture is an adjustable hole 
in a diaphragm set just behind the lens. By changing the size of the aper-
ture, you control the size of the light beam that can enter the camera. 
Aperture settings are stated as f-stop numbers, or simply f-stops, and are 
expressed with the letter f followed by a number: f/2, f/5.6, f/16, and so 
on. The lower the f-stop number, the larger the aperture, as illustrated 
by Figure 5-3.
 
f/2
f/4
f/2.8
f/5.6
f/16
f/11
f/8
 
Figure 5-3: The smaller the f-stop number, the larger the 
 
aperture.
 
 The range of possible f-stops depends on your lens and, if you use a zoom 
lens, on the zoom position (focal length) of the lens. For the kit lens sold 
with the Rebel XS/1000D, you can select apertures from f/3.5–f/22 when 
zoomed all the way out to the shortest focal length (18mm). When you 
zoom in to the maximum focal length (55mm), the aperture range is 
f/5.6–f/36. (See Chapter 6 for a discussion of focal lengths.)
 
✓ Shutter speed (controls duration of light): Set behind the aperture, the 
shutter works something like, er, the shutters on a window. When you 
aren’t taking pictures, the camera’s shutter stays closed, preventing 
light from striking the image sensor. When you press the shutter button, 
the shutter opens briefly to allow light that passes through the aperture 
to hit the image sensor.
 
 The length of time that the shutter is open is called the shutter speed 
and is measured in seconds: 1/60 second, 1/250 second, 2 seconds, and 

111
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
so on. Shutter speeds on the Rebel XS/1000D range from 30 seconds to 
1/4000 second when you shoot without flash. Should you want a shutter 
speed longer than 30 seconds, manual (M) exposure mode also provides 
a feature called bulb exposure. At this setting, the shutter stays open 
indefinitely as long as you press the shutter button down.
 
 If you do use a flash, the fastest available shutter speed is 1/200 second; 
the slowest ranges from 1/60 second to 30 seconds, depending on the 
exposure mode. See the section “Understanding your camera’s approach 
to flash,” later in this chapter, for details.
 
✓ ISO (controls light sensitivity): ISO, which is a digital function rather 
than a mechanical structure on the camera, enables you to adjust how 
responsive the image sensor is to light. The term ISO is a holdover from 
film days, when an international standards organization rated each 
film stock according to light sensitivity: ISO 100, ISO 200, ISO 400, ISO 
800, and so on. Film or digital, a higher ISO rating means greater light 
sensitivity, which means that less light is needed to produce the image, 
enabling you to use a smaller aperture, faster shutter speed, or both.
 
 On your camera, you can select ISO settings ranging from 100 to 1600 
when you shoot in the advanced exposure modes. For the fully auto-
matic modes, you’re limited to ISO speeds from 100 to 800, and the 
camera chooses the setting for you automatically.
 
Distilled to its essence, the image-exposure formula is just this simple: 
 
✓ Aperture and shutter speed together determine the quantity of light that 
strikes the image sensor.
 
✓ ISO determines how much the sensor reacts to that light.
The tricky part of the equation is that aperture, shutter speed, and ISO set-
tings affect your pictures in ways that go beyond exposure. You need to be 
aware of these side effects, explained in the next section, to determine which 
combination of the three exposure settings will work best for your picture.
Understanding exposure-setting side effects
As illustrated by the images in Figure 5-4, you can create the same expo-
sure with different combinations of aperture, shutter speed, and ISO. And 
although the figure shows you only two variations of settings, your choices 
are pretty much endless — you’re limited only by the aperture range allowed 
by the lens and the shutter speeds and ISO settings offered by the camera.

Figure 5-4: Aperture and shutter speed affect depth of field and motion blur.
But the settings you select impact your image beyond mere exposure, as 
follows:
 
✓ Aperture affects depth of field. The aperture setting, or f-stop, affects 
depth of field. I introduce this concept in Chapter 2, but here’s a quick 
recap: With a shallow depth of field, your subject appears more sharply 
focused than faraway objects; with a large depth of field, the sharp-focus 
zone spreads over a greater distance.
 
 As you reduce the aperture size — or stop down the aperture, in photo 
lingo — by choosing a higher f-stop number, you increase depth of field. 
As an example, notice that the background in the first image in Figure 
5-4, taken at f/13, appears noticeably sharper than in the right example, 
taken at f/5.6. Aperture is just one contributor to depth of field, however; 
see Chapter 6 for the complete story.
 
✓ Shutter speed affects motion blur. At a slow shutter speed, moving objects 
appear blurry, whereas a fast shutter speed captures motion cleanly. 
Compare the fountain spray in the photos in Figure 5-4, for example. At a 
shutter speed of 1/125 second (right photo), the water droplets appear 
much more sharply focused than at 1/25 second (left). At the slower shutter 
speed, the water blurs, giving it a misty look. How high a shutter speed you 
need to freeze action depends on the speed of your subject, of course.

113
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
 
 If your picture suffers from overall image blur like you see in Figure 5-5, 
where even stationary objects appear out of focus, the camera itself 
moved during the exposure. As you increase the exposure time (by 
selecting a slower shutter speed), you increase the risk of this problem 
because you have to keep the camera still longer. Most people enter the 
camera-shake zone at speeds slower than about 1/50 second, although 
some people have steadier hands than others. Turning on image stabili-
zation, available on some lenses, helps raise the odds of sharp handheld 
shots at slower shutter speeds. (On the kit lens, turn the Stabilizer 
switch on the side of the lens to On to enable this feature.)
 
 My abilities vary depending on the day and my caffeine intake; I was able 
to snap the first example in Figure 5-4 at 1/25 second, but frankly, that 
was a lucky accident as I usually can’t handhold at speeds that slow, 
even with image stabilization. At the 1/5 second shutter speed used in 
Figure 5-5, camera shake was almost inevitable.
 
 To avoid this issue, use a tripod or otherwise steady the camera. (If you’re 
not using the kit lens, check the lens manual to find out whether you 
should turn off image stabilization for tripod shooting.) See Chapter 6 for 
tips on solving other focus problems and Chapter 7 for more help with 
action photography.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
✓ ISO affects image noise. As ISO increases, making the image sensor more 
reactive to light, you increase the risk of producing a defect called noise. 
This defect looks like sprinkles of sand and is similar in appearance to film 
grain, a defect that often mars pictures taken with high ISO film.
 
 Ideally, you should always use the lowest ISO setting on your camera — 
ISO 100 — to ensure top image quality. But sometimes, the lighting con-
ditions simply don’t permit you to do so and still use the aperture and 
shutter speeds you need.
 
 As an example, I shot the floral close-ups in Figure 5-6 on a windy day. 
Because the flower was moving quite a bit in the breeze, I knew I needed a 
fast shutter to capture it without blur. I opened the aperture to f/5.6, which 
was the maximum on the lens I was using, to allow as much light as pos-
sible into the camera. Even so, I needed a shutter speed of 1/125 second to 
expose the picture at ISO 100 — and that shutter speed wasn’t fast enough 
to catch the swaying flower without blur, as shown on the left in Figure 5-6. 
By raising the ISO to 400, I was able to use a shutter speed of 1/500 second, 
which captured the flower cleanly, as shown on the right. Note that the 
slight softening of focus you see in the center of the flower is due not to 
motion blur but to the short depth of field created by my open aperture 
and close proximity to the flower, which also reduces depth of field. (Again, 
Chapter 6 explores all the ways you can manipulate depth of field.)

Figure 5-6: Raising the ISO enabled me to increase the shutter speed and avoid motion blur.

115
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
 
 Fortunately, you usually don’t encounter serious noise with the Rebel 
XS/1000D until you really crank up the ISO. You’d have to look pretty close 
to detect much noise in the ISO 400 image in Figure 5-6, for example. In fact, 
you may be able to get away with ISO 800 if you keep the print or display 
size of the picture small — as with other image defects, noise becomes 
more apparent as you enlarge the photo. Noise also is more problematic 
in areas of flat color. When you bump ISO all the way up to 1600, however, 
expect to see at least some noise even at small picture sizes.
 
 Just to give you a better look at how ISO affects noise, Figure 5-7 offers 
magnified views of an area of my ISO 100 and 400 photos, plus additional 
shots captured at ISO 200, 800, and 1600.
 
 One more important note about noise: A long exposure time — say, 
1 second or more — also can produce this defect. Your camera offers 
built-in noise-reduction filters that aim to compensate for both high ISO 
noise and long-exposure noise; see the sidebar “Dampening noise” else-
where in this chapter for details.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Long story short, understanding how aperture, shutter speed, and ISO affect 
your image enables you to have much more creative input over the look 
of your photographs — and, in the case of ISO, to also control the quality of 
your images. (Chapter 3 discusses other factors that affect image quality.)
Doing the exposure balancing act
 
As you change any of the three exposure settings — aperture, shutter speed, 
and ISO — one or both of the others must also shift in order to maintain 
the same image brightness. If you want a faster shutter speed, for example, 
you have to compensate with either a larger aperture, to allow in more light 
during the shorter exposure, or a higher ISO setting, to make the camera 
more sensitive to the light, or both. And as the preceding section explains, 
changing these settings impacts your image in ways beyond exposure. So 
when you boost that shutter speed, you have to decide whether you prefer 
the shorter depth of field that comes with a larger aperture or the increased 
risk of noise that accompanies a higher ISO. Figure 5-8 offers an illustration to 
help you envision this balancing act.

 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
All photographers have their own approaches to finding the right combina-
tion of aperture, shutter speed, and ISO, and you’ll no doubt develop your 
own system as you become more practiced at using the advanced exposure 
modes. In the meantime, here’s how I handle things:
 
✓ I always use the lowest possible ISO setting unless the lighting condi-
tions are so poor that I can’t use the aperture and shutter speed I want 
without raising the ISO.
 
✓ If my subject is moving (or might move, as with a squiggly toddler or 
antsy pet), I give shutter speed the next highest priority in my expo-
sure decision. I might choose a fast shutter speed to ensure a blur-free 
photo or, on the flip side, select a slow shutter to intentionally blur that 
moving object, an effect that can create a heightened sense of motion. 
When shooting waterfalls, for example, I use a slow shutter to give the 
water a blurry, misty look.
 
✓ For images of non-moving subjects, I make aperture a priority over shut-
ter speed, setting the aperture according to the depth of field I have in 
mind. For portraits, for example, I use a wide-open aperture (low f-stop 
number) so that I get a short depth of field, creating a nice, soft back-
ground for my subject.
Keeping all this straight is a little overwhelming at first, but the more you 
work with your camera, the more the whole exposure equation will make 
sense to you. You can find tips for choosing exposure settings for specific 
types of pictures in Chapter 7; keep moving through this chapter for details 
on how to monitor and adjust aperture, shutter speed, and ISO settings.
Putting the f (stop) in focus
One way to remember the relationship between 
f-stop and depth of field, or the distance over 
which focus remains sharp, is simply to think of 
the f as standing for focus: The higher the f-stop 
number, the larger the zone of sharp focus.
Please don’t share this tip with photography 
elites, who will roll their eyes and inform you 
that the f in f-stop most certainly does not stand 
for focus but for the ratio between the aperture 
size and lens focal length — as if that’s help-
ful to know if you aren’t an optical engineer. 
(Chapter 6 explains focal length, which is help-
ful to know.)

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Monitoring Exposure Settings
When you press the shutter button halfway, the current f-stop, shutter speed, 
and ISO speed appear in both the viewfinder display, as shown in Figure 5-9, and 
in the Shooting Settings display, as shown in Figure 5-10. In Live View mode, the 
exposure data appears at the bottom of the monitor and takes a form similar to 
what you see in the viewfinder. (The upcoming sidebar provides information 
about exposure-related aspects of shooting in Live View mode.)
 
In the viewfinder and on the monitor in Live View mode, shutter speeds are 
presented as whole numbers, even if the shutter speed is set to a fraction of 
a second. For example, for a shutter speed of 1/500 second, you see just the 
number 500 in the display, as shown in Figure 5-9. When the shutter speed slows 
to 1 second or more, you see quote marks after the number in both displays — 
1" indicates a shutter speed of 1 second, 4" means 4 seconds, and so on.

Figure 5-9: The shutter speed, f-stop, and ISO speed appear in the

The viewfinder, Shooting Settings display, and Live View display also offer an 
exposure meter, labeled in Figures 5-9 and 5-10. This little graphic serves two 
different purposes, depending on which of the advanced exposure modes 
you’re using:

Figure 5-10: You also can view the settings in the Shooting Settings 
 
display.
 
✓ In manual (M) exposure mode, the meter acts in its traditional role, 
which is to indicate whether your current settings will properly expose 
the image. Figure 5-11 gives you three examples. When the exposure 
indicator aligns with the center point, as in the middle example, the 
current settings will produce a proper exposure. If the indicator moves 
to the left of center, toward the minus side of the scale, as in the left 
example in the figure, the camera is alerting you that the image will be 
underexposed. If the indicator moves to the right of center, as in the 
right example, the image will be overexposed. The farther the indicator 
moves toward the plus or minus sign, the greater the potential exposure 
problem.
 
✓ In the other modes (P, Tv, Av, and A-DEP), the meter displays the cur-
rent Exposure Compensation setting. Exposure compensation is a feature 
that enables you to tell the camera to produce a brighter or darker expo-
sure than its autoexposure brain thinks is correct. When the exposure 
indicator is at 0, as in Figures 5-9 and 5-10, no compensation is being 
applied. See the upcoming section “Overriding Autoexposure Results 
with Exposure Compensation” for details.

Exposure indicator
Figure 5-11: In manual mode, the meter indicates whether exposure settings are on target.
 
Because the meter is designated as an exposure compensation guide when 
you shoot in the P, Tv, Av, and A-DEP modes, the camera alerts you to expo-
sure problems in those modes as follows:
 
✓ Av mode (aperture-priority autoexposure): The shutter speed value 
blinks to let you know that the camera can’t select a shutter speed that 
will produce a good exposure at the aperture you selected. You need to 
choose a different f-stop or adjust ISO.
 
✓ Tv mode (shutter-priority autoexposure): The aperture value blinks 
instead of the shutter speed. That’s your notification that the camera 
can’t open or stop down the aperture enough to expose the image at 
your selected shutter speed. Your options are to change the shutter 
speed or ISO.
 
✓ P mode (programmed autoexposure): In P mode, both the aperture and 
shutter speed values blink if the camera can’t select a combination that 
will properly expose the image. Your only recourse is to either adjust 
the lighting or change the ISO setting.
 
✓ A-DEP mode (auto depth of field): Either the aperture or shutter speed 
value may blink. If the shutter speed value blinks 30" (for 30 seconds) or 
4000 (for 1/4000 second), the light is too dark or too bright, respectively, 
for the camera to expose the image properly at any combination of 
aperture and shutter speed. To compensate for dim lighting, you can 
raise the ISO or add flash. In too-bright light, lower the ISO if possible — 
otherwise, find a way to shade the subject or relocate it.
 
 If the aperture setting blinks, the exposure will be okay, but the f-stop 
won’t produce the depth of field needed to keep everything in the frame 
in sharp focus. (See Chapter 6 for complete details on depth of field and 
the A-DEP mode.)
 
One more word of advice: Keep in mind that the camera’s take on exposure 
may not always be the one you want to follow. First, the camera’s exposure 
decisions are based on the current exposure metering mode. As covered next, 
you can choose three different metering modes, and each one calculates 

121
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
exposure on a different area of the frame. Second, you may want to purposely 
choose exposure settings that leave parts of the image very dark or parts 
very light for creative reasons. In other words, the meter and the blinking 
alerts are guides, not dictators.
Exposure and Live View shooting
Your camera’s Live View mode, detailed at the 
end of Chapter 4, enables you to use your moni-
tor instead of the viewfinder to compose your 
images. If you do switch to Live View mode, 
keep these exposure-related tips in mind:
 ✓ Your camera strap sports a little rubber view-
finder cover that you should place over the 
viewfinder when you’re shooting in Live View 
mode. Otherwise, light can seep in through 
the viewfinder and affect exposure.
 ✓ Several exposure-related functions are dis-
abled in Live View mode. You can’t use Flash 
Exposure lock; you’re limited to Evaluative 
metering mode; and you can’t adjust the 
function of the AE Lock (autoexposure lock) 
button. All three features are explained 
elsewhere in this chapter. In addition, the 
A-DEP exposure mode works the same as 
P mode during Live View shooting.
 ✓ Image noise may be increased if you engage 
Live View shooting for a long period of time. 
This issue is related to the fact that Live 
View causes the camera to heat up more 
than usual; you can help matters by com-
posing the shot, powering off the camera 
for a few minutes, and then turning it back 
on to take the picture.
 ✓ You can display certain exposure settings, 
as shown in the figure here, as well as a his-
togram along with your image in the moni-
tor. Chapter 4 tells you how and explains 
histograms.
 ✓ If the Exposure Simulation symbol on the 
monitor is white, the image brightness will 
be approximately the same as what you 
see on the monitor. But if the symbol blinks 
or is dimmed, don’t rely on the monitor for 
an exposure preview. In extreme lighting 
conditions, the camera may not be able to 
simulate exposure properly. And if you use 
flash, exposure simulation is automatically 
disabled.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Choosing an Exposure Metering Mode
 
The metering mode determines which part of the frame the camera analyzes 
to calculate the proper exposure. Your Rebel XS/1000D offers three meter-
ing modes, described in the following list and represented in the Shooting 
Settings display by the icons you see in the margins:
 
✓ Evaluative metering: The camera analyzes the entire frame and then 
selects an exposure that’s designed to produce a balanced exposure.
 
✓ Partial metering: The camera bases exposure only on the light that 
covers approximately the center 10 percent of the frame.
 
✓ Center-Weighted Average metering: The camera bases exposure on the 
entire frame but puts extra emphasis — or weight — on the center.
In most cases, Evaluative metering does a good job of calculating exposure. But 
it can get thrown off when a dark subject is set against a bright background or 
vice versa. As an example, in the left image in Figure 5-12, the amount of bright 
background caused the camera to select an exposure that left the statue too 
dark. So I switched to Partial metering, which properly exposed the statue.
Of course, if your background is very bright and the subject is very dark, the 
exposure that does the best job on the subject typically overexposes the 
background. Sadly, there is no way around this issue; you just have to decide 
which part of the picture is the most critical and base exposure on that area.
 
Evaluative
Partial
 
Figure 5-12: In Evaluative mode, the camera underexposed the statue; 
 
switching to Partial metering produced a better result.

123
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
You can verify which metering mode is currently active by checking the 
Shooting Settings display. The left image in Figure 5-13 shows you where to 
find the metering mode icon.
 
Metering mode icon
 
Figure 5-13: Press the up cross key to access your metering mode options.
 
You’re restricted to Evaluative metering in the fully automatic exposure 
modes. In the advanced exposure modes, you can specify a metering mode 
as long as you don’t enable Live View shooting, which also limits you to 
Evaluative metering. To set the metering mode, follow these steps:
 
1. Press the up cross key.
 
 The key is marked with the same little icon that represents Evaluative 
metering mode. The monitor then displays the screen you see on the 
right in Figure 5-13.
 
2. Press the up or down cross key to highlight your choice.
 
3. Press the Set button.
 
 Your selected metering mode remains in force until you change it.
 
In theory, the best practice is to always check the metering mode before 
you shoot and choose the one that best matches your exposure goals. But 
in practice, that’s a bit of a pain, not just in terms of having to adjust yet one 
more capture setting but in terms of having to remember to adjust one more 
capture setting.
So here’s my advice: Until you’re really comfortable with all the other con-
trols on your camera, just stick with the default setting, which is Evaluative 
metering. That mode produces good results in most situations, and, after 
all, you can see in the monitor whether you disagree with how the camera 
metered or exposed the image and simply reshoot after adjusting the expo-
sure settings to your liking. This option, in my mind, makes the whole meter-
ing mode issue a lot less critical than it is when you shoot with film.

124
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Setting ISO, f-stop, and Shutter Speed
 
If you want to control ISO, aperture (f-stop), or shutter speed, you must set the 
camera to one of the five advanced exposure modes. Formally called Creative 
Zone modes in Canon nomenclature, these modes include programmed autoex-
posure (P), shutter-priority autoexposure (Tv), aperture-priority autoexposure 
(Av), manual exposure (M), and auto depth of field (A-DEP). 
I explain each of these modes at the start of the chapter. The next sections 
provide specifics (finally, you say) on how to adjust ISO, aperture, and shut-
ter speed in all five modes.
Controlling ISO
As explained at the start of this chapter, your camera’s ISO setting controls 
how sensitive the image sensor is to light. At higher ISO values, you need less 
light to expose an image.
 
Remember the downside to raising ISO however: The higher the ISO, the 
greater the possibility of noisy images. See Figure 5-7 for a reminder of what 
that defect looks like.
In the fully automatic exposure modes, the camera selects an ISO from 100 to 
800, depending on the available light. You have no control over ISO in those 
exposure modes.
In the advanced exposure modes, you have the following ISO choices:
 
✓ Auto: You can still rely on the camera to adjust ISO for you in the 
advanced exposure modes if you prefer. The same parameters apply as 
for the fully automatic exposure modes; that is, the camera chooses an 
ISO setting from 100 to 800, depending on the available light. However, 
if you set the Mode dial to M, for manual exposure mode, or enable the 
flash, ISO is always set to 400.
 
✓ Specific ISO speeds: You can choose from ISO 100, 200, 400, 800, or 1600. 
The current ISO is displayed in the upper-right corner of the Shooting 
Settings display, as shown on the left in Figure 5-14. You can also monitor the 
ISO in the viewfinder display and in the Live View display.
To adjust the setting, press the ISO button, located just behind the Main 
dial, on top of the camera. You then see the screen shown on the right in the 
figure. Use the cross keys or rotate the Main dial to highlight your choice. 
Then press the Set button.

125
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
 
ISO setting
 
Figure 5-14: Press the ISO button on top of the camera to access the ISO setting.
 
In Auto ISO mode, the Shooting Settings display and Live View display ini-
tially show Auto as the ISO value, as you would expect. But if you press the 
shutter button halfway, which initiates exposure metering, the value changes 
to show you the ISO setting the camera has selected for you. You also see the 
selected value in the viewfinder rather than the word Auto.
Adjusting aperture and shutter speed
 
You can adjust aperture and shutter speed only in P, Tv, Av, and M exposure 
modes. In A-DEP mode, the camera forces you to use its selected exposure 
settings. (You can, however, tweak the exposure by using the exposure-com-
pensation feature discussed in the next section.)
To see the current exposure settings, start by pressing the shutter button 
halfway. The following activities then take place:
 
✓ The exposure meter comes to life. If autofocus is enabled, focus is also 
set at this point.
 
✓ The current aperture and shutter speed appear in the viewfinder and 
Shooting Settings display. In Live View mode, the settings appear under 
the image preview on the monitor.
 
✓ In manual exposure mode, the exposure meter also lets you know 
whether the current settings will expose the image properly. In the other 
advanced exposure modes — Tv, Av, P, and A-DEP — the camera indi-
cates an exposure problem not with the meter, but by flashing either 
the shutter speed or f-stop value. (See the section “Monitoring Exposure 
Settings,” earlier in this chapter, for details.)

126
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Dampening noise
Noise, the digital defect that gives your pictures 
a speckled look (refer to Figure 5-7), can occur 
for two reasons: a high ISO speed and a long 
exposure time.
The Rebel XS/1000D offers two noise-removal 
filters, one designed to help eradicate ISO-
related noise and another to dampen the type of 
noise that occurs during long exposures. Both 
filters are provided through Custom Functions, 
however, which means that you can access 
them only in the advanced exposure modes.
To enable High ISO noise reduction, visit Setup 
Menu 3, select Custom Functions, press Set, 
and then use the right or left cross key to select 
Custom Function 4, as shown in the left figure 
here. (The Custom Function number appears in 
the upper-right corner of the screen.) Press Set 
to activate the options, highlight On, and press 
Set again.
For long-exposure noise reduction, select 
Custom Function 3 and press Set. You then can 
choose from these settings, shown in the right 
figure below. The options work as follows: 
 ✓ Off: No noise reduction is applied. This is 
the default setting.
 ✓ Auto: Noise reduction is applied when you 
use a shutter speed of 1 second or longer, 
but only if the camera detects the type of 
noise that’s caused by long exposures.
 ✓ On: Noise reduction is always applied at 
exposures of 1 second or longer.
Before you enable noise reduction, be aware that 
doing so has a few disadvantages. First, the filter 
is applied after you take the picture, as the camera 
processes the image data and records it to your 
memory card. The time needed to apply the filter 
is about the same as the original exposure time, 
which slows down your shooting speed.
Second, noise-reduction filters work primar-
ily by applying a slight blur to the image. Don’t 
expect this process to totally eliminate noise, 
and do expect some resulting image softness. 
You may be able to get better results by using 
the blur tools or noise-removal filters found in 
many photo editors because then you can blur 
just the parts of the image where noise is most 
noticeable — usually in areas of flat color or 
little detail, such as skies.
Finally, if you enable ISO noise reduction, you 
lose the option of continuous shooting (enabled 
through the Drive mode setting, covered in 
Chapter 2) and White Balance Bracketing (an 
advanced color feature you can explore in 
Chapter 6).

 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
The technique you use to change the exposure settings depends on the 
exposure mode, as outlined in the following list: 
 
✓ P (programmed auto): In this mode, the camera initially displays its 
recommended combination of aperture and shutter speed. To select a 
different combination, rotate the Main dial.
 
• To select a lower f-stop number (larger aperture) and faster shut-
ter speed, rotate the dial to the right.
 
• To select a higher f-stop number (smaller aperture) and slower 
shutter speed, rotate the dial to the left.
 
✓ Tv (shutter-priority autoexposure): Rotate the Main dial to the right for 
a faster shutter speed; nudge it to the left for a slower speed. As you 
change the shutter speed, the camera automatically adjusts the aperture 
as needed to maintain the proper exposure.
 
 Remember that as the aperture shifts, so does depth of field — so even 
though you’re working in shutter-priority mode, keep an eye on the f-stop, 
too, if depth of field is important to your photo. Also note that in extreme 
lighting conditions, the camera may not be able to adjust the aperture 
enough to produce a good exposure at your current shutter speed — 
again, possible aperture settings depend on your lens. So you may need to 
compromise on shutter speed (or, in dim lighting, raise the ISO).
 
✓ Av (aperture-priority autoexposure): Rotate the Main dial to the right to 
stop down the aperture to a higher f-stop number. Rotate the dial to the 
left to open the aperture to a lower f-stop number. As you do, the camera 
automatically adjusts the shutter speed to maintain the exposure.
 
 If you’re handholding the camera, be careful that the shutter speed 
doesn’t drop so low when you stop down the aperture that you run the 
risk of camera shake. And if your scene contains moving objects, make 
sure that when you dial in your preferred f-stop, the shutter speed that 
the camera selects is fast enough to stop action (or slow enough to blur 
it, if that’s your creative goal).
 
✓ M (manual exposure): In this mode, you select both aperture and shut-
ter speed, like so:
 
• To adjust shutter speed: Rotate the Main dial to the right for a faster 
shutter speed; rotate left for a slower shutter. 
 
• To adjust aperture: Press and hold the Exposure Compensation 
button, shown in Figure 5-15, as you rotate the Main dial.
 
 See the Av label next to the button? That’s your cue as to the aper-
ture-related function of the button — Av stands for aperture value.
 
 Rotate the dial to the right for a higher f-stop (smaller aperture); 
rotate left to select a lower f-stop. Don’t let up on the button as you 
rotate the Main dial — if you do, you instead adjust the shutter 
speed.

Exposure Compensation button
 
Figure 5-15: To set aperture in M mode, press the Exposure 
 
Compensation button as you rotate the Main dial.
 
In M, Tv, and Av modes, the setting currently available for adjustment 
appears in the Shooting Settings display in purple, with little arrows at each 
side. Your camera manual refers to this display as the Main dial pointer, 
and it’s provided as a reminder that you use the Main dial to change the set-
ting. For example, in M (manual exposure) mode, the shutter speed appears 
purple until you hold down the Exposure Compensation button, at which 
point the marker shifts to the aperture (f-stop) value, as shown in Figure 5-15.
Keep in mind that when you use P, Tv, Av, and A-DEP modes, the settings 
that the camera selects are based on what it thinks is the proper exposure. 
If you don’t agree with the camera, you have two options: You can switch to 
manual exposure mode and simply dial in the aperture and shutter speed 
that deliver the exposure you want; or if you want to stay in P, Tv, Av, or 
A-DEP mode, you can tweak the autoexposure settings by using the feature 
explained in the very next section.
Overriding Autoexposure Results 
with Exposure Compensation
When you set your camera to the P, Tv, Av, or A-DEP exposure modes, you 
can enjoy the benefits of autoexposure support but still retain some control 
over the final, overall exposure. If you think that the image the camera pro-
duced is too dark or too light, you can use a feature known as exposure com-
pensation, which is sometimes also called EV compensation. (The EV stands 
for exposure value.)

129
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
Whatever you call it, this feature enables you to tell the camera to produce 
a darker or lighter exposure than what its autoexposure mechanism thinks 
is appropriate. Best of all, this feature is probably one of the easiest on the 
whole camera to understand. Here’s all there is to it:
 
✓ Exposure compensation settings are stated in terms of EV values, as in 
+2.0 EV. Possible values range from +2.0 EV to –2.0 EV.
 
✓ A setting of EV 0.0 results in no exposure adjustment. 
 
✓ For a brighter image, you raise the EV value. The higher you go, the 
brighter the image becomes.
 
✓ For a darker image, you lower the EV value. The picture becomes pro-
gressively darker with each step down the EV scale.
 
Each full number on the EV scale represents an exposure shift of one full 
stop. In plain English, that means that if you change the exposure compensa-
tion setting from EV 0.0 to EV –1.0, the camera adjusts either the aperture or 
shutter speed to allow half as much light into the camera as you would get at 
the current setting. If you instead raise the value to EV +1.0, the settings are 
adjusted to double the light.
By default, the exposure is adjusted in 1/3 stop increments. In other words, 
you can shift from EV 0.0 to EV +0.3, +0.7, +1.0, and so on. But you can change 
the adjustment to 1/2-stop increments if you want to shift the exposure in 
larger jumps — from EV 0.0 to EV +0.5, +1.0, and so on. To do so, display 
Setup Menu 3, highlight Custom Functions, and press Set. Then select Custom 
Function 1, press Set, and press the up or down cross key to change the set-
ting. Press Set again to lock in the new setting. If you make this change, the 
meter will appear slightly different in the Shooting Settings display and Live 
View display than you see it in this book. (There will be only one intermedi-
ate notch between each number on the meter instead of the usual two.) The 
viewfinder meter does not change, but the exposure indicator bar appears as 
a double line if you set the exposure compensation value to a half-step value 
(+0.5, +1.5, and so on). 
 
Exposure compensation is especially helpful when your subject and back-
ground are significantly different in brightness. As an example, take a look 
at the first image in Figure 5-16. Because of the very bright sky in the back-
ground, the camera chose an exposure that left the palm tree too dark.
One way to cope with this situation is to adjust the exposure metering 
mode, as discussed earlier in this chapter. I took the images in Figure 5-16 in 
Evaluative mode, for example, which meters exposure on the entire frame. 
Switching to Partial metering might have done the trick, but frankly, I find it 
easier to use exposure compensation than to fool with metering mode adjust-
ments in most situations. So I left the metering mode alone and just amped 
the exposure compensation setting to EV +1.0, which produced the brighter 
exposure on the right.

Figure 5-16: For a brighter exposure than the autoexposure mechanism chooses,

To apply exposure compensation, take these steps:
 
1. Hold down the Exposure Compensation button.
 
 You can see the button in the margin here; it’s the same one you use to 
adjust the f-stop when you shoot in manual exposure mode. (Refer to 
Figure 5-15.)
 
 If the Shooting Settings display 
is active, the exposure meter 
becomes highlighted, as shown 
in Figure 5-17. Again, the purple 
highlight and the two pointers at 
the edges of the highlighted area 
are there to remind you that you 
can now adjust the setting with 
the Main dial. If you’re looking 
through the viewfinder or shoot-
ing in Live View mode, the meter 
appears as usual.

indicates the exposure compensation setting.

131
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
 
2. While keeping the button pressed, rotate the Main dial to change the 
exposure compensation value.
 
 As you rotate the dial, the exposure indicator moves right or left along 
the exposure meter.
 
• Rotate the dial to the left to lower the value and produce a darker 
exposure. In Figure 5-17, for example, I dialed in a setting of EV –1.0.
 
• Rotate the dial to the right to raise the value and produce a 
brighter exposure.
 
• To return to no adjustment, rotate the dial until the exposure indi-
cator is back at the center position on the meter.
 
3. Release the Exposure Compensation button after you select the value 
you want to use.
 
How the camera arrives at the brighter or darker image you request depends 
on the exposure mode:
 
✓ In Av (aperture-priority) mode, the camera adjusts the shutter speed but 
leaves your selected f-stop in force. Be sure to check the resulting shut-
ter speed to make sure that it isn’t so slow that camera shake or blur 
from moving objects is problematic. 
 
✓ In Tv (shutter-priority) mode, the opposite occurs: The camera opens or 
stops down the aperture, leaving your selected shutter speed alone.
 
✓ In P (programmed autoexposure) and A-DEP mode, the camera decides 
whether to adjust aperture, shutter speed, or both to accommodate the 
exposure compensation setting.
These explanations assume that you have a specific ISO setting selected 
rather than Auto ISO; if you do use Auto ISO, the camera may adjust that 
value instead.
Keep in mind, too, that the camera can adjust the aperture only so much, 
according to the aperture range of your lens. The range of shutter speeds 
is limited by the camera itself. So if you reach the ends of those ranges, you 
either have to compromise on shutter speed or aperture or adjust ISO.
 
One final, and critical point about exposure compensation: When you power 
off the camera, it doesn’t return you to a neutral setting (EV 0.0). The setting 
you last used remains in force for the P, Tv, Av, and A-DEP exposure modes 
until you change it.

132
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Disabling Auto Lighting Optimization
When you shoot in any of the fully automatic exposure modes, the camera 
automatically checks each picture for two potential exposure problems: a 
too-dark subject and a lack of contrast. If it detects either, it automatically 
applies a subtle corrective tweak as it records the picture to the memory 
card. Canon calls this feature Auto Lighting Optimization. 
In general, Auto Lighting Optimization is a good thing, which is why the fea-
ture is also applied by default in the advanced exposure modes if you shoot 
in the JPEG format. (Chapter 3 explains JPEG and the other available format, 
Raw.) However, if you don’t want the camera making these adjustments, you 
can turn off the feature. You might want to do so if you’re purposely trying 
to shoot a backlit subject in silhouette, for example, or your artistic goal is a 
low-contrast image.
 
In addition, the correction filter that’s applied by Auto Lighting Optimization 
can make some other exposure-adjustment features less effective. So turn it 
off if you don’t get the results you expect when you’re using the following 
features:
 
✓ Exposure compensation, discussed earlier in this chapter
 
✓ Flash compensation, discussed later in this chapter
 
✓ Automatic exposure bracketing, also discussed later in this chapter
To disable Auto Lighting Optimization, 
visit Setup Menu 3, select Custom 
Functions, and press Set. Then press 
the right or left cross keys to hunt 
down Custom Function 5, press Set, 
and highlight Disable, as shown in 
Figure 5-18. Press Set again to finish 
the job.
 
Note that for all Custom Functions, 
the option that appears in blue text is 
the one that’s active.
Locking Autoexposure Settings
To help ensure a proper exposure, your camera continually meters the light 
until the moment you depress the shutter button fully to shoot the picture. 
In autoexposure modes — that is, any mode but M — it also keeps adjusting 
exposure settings as needed.
Figure 5-18: You can disable automatic 
exposure correction via Custom Function 5.

133
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
For most situations, this approach works great, resulting in the right set-
tings for the light that’s striking your subject at the moment you capture 
the image. But on occasion, you may want to lock in a certain combination 
of exposure settings. Here’s one such scenario: Suppose that you’re shoot-
ing several images of a large landscape that you want to join together into a 
panorama in your photo editor. Unless the lighting is even across the entire 
landscape, the camera’s autoexposure brain will select different exposure 
settings for each shot, depending on which part of the scene is currently 
in the frame. That can lead to weird breaks in the brightness and contrast 
of the image when you seam the image together. And if it’s the f-stop that’s 
adjusted, which is what could happen in P or Tv exposure modes, you may 
notice shifts in depth of field as well because the aperture setting affects that 
aspect of your pictures.
 
The easiest way to lock in exposure settings is to switch to M (manual) expo-
sure mode and use the same f-stop, shutter speed, and ISO settings for each 
shot. In Manual mode, the camera never overrides your exposure decisions; 
they’re locked until you change them.
But if you prefer to stay in P, Tv, or Av mode, you can lock in the current 
autoexposure settings. Here’s how: 
 
1. Press the shutter button halfway.
 
 If you’re using autofocusing, focus is locked at this point.
 
2. Press the AE Lock button, 
highlighted in Figure 5-19.
 
 The AE stands for autoexposure.
 
 Exposure is now locked and 
remains locked for four sec-
onds, even if you release the 
AE Lock button and the shutter 
button. To remind you that AE 
Lock is in force, the camera 
displays a little asterisk in the 
viewfinder and on the monitor 
in Live View mode. If you need 
to relock exposure, just press 
the AE Lock button again.
Note that if your goal is to use the 
same exposure settings for multiple 
shots, you must keep the AE Lock 
button pressed during the entire 
series of pictures. Every time you let 
up on the button and press it again, 
you lock exposure anew based on 
the light currently in the frame.
AE Lock button
Figure 5-19: You can lock the current 
autoexposure settings by pressing this button.

134
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
One other critical point to remember about using AE Lock: The camera estab-
lishes and locks exposure differently depending on the metering mode, the 
focusing mode (automatic or manual), and on an autofocusing setting called 
AF Point Selection mode. (Chapter 6 explains this option thoroughly.) Here’s 
the scoop:
 
✓ Evaluative metering and automatic AF Point Selection: Exposure is 
locked on the focusing point that achieved focus.
 
✓ Evaluative metering and manual AF Point Selection: Exposure is 
locked on the selected autofocus point.
 
✓ All other metering modes: Exposure is based on the center autofocus 
point, regardless of the AF Point Selection mode.
 
✓ Manual focusing: Exposure is based on the center autofocus point.
Again, if all of this focusing lingo just sounded like gibberish, check out 
Chapter 6 to get a full explanation.
 
By combining autoexposure lock with Partial metering, you can ensure a 
good exposure for photographs in which you want your subject to be off-
center, and that subject is significantly darker or lighter than the back-
ground. Imagine, for example, a dark statue set against a light blue sky. First, 
select Partial metering, so that the camera only considers the object located 
in the center of the frame. Frame the scene initially so that your statue is 
located in the center of the viewfinder. Press and hold the shutter button 
halfway to establish focus and then lock exposure by pressing the AE Lock 
button. Now reframe the shot to your desired composition and take the pic-
ture. (See Chapter 6 for details on selecting an autofocus point.)
Note that all of these bits of advice assume that you haven’t altered the func-
tion of the AE Lock button, which you can do via a Custom Function. You 
can swap the tasks of the shutter button and AE Lock button, for example, 
so that pressing the shutter button halfway locks exposure and pressing the 
AE Lock button locks focus. Chapter 11 offers details on the relevant Custom 
Function.
Bracketing Exposures Automatically
One of my favorite exposure features on the Rebel XS/1000D is automatic 
exposure bracketing, or AEB for short. This feature makes it easy to bracket 
exposures — which simply means to take the same shot using several expo-
sure settings to up the odds that you come away with a perfectly exposed 
image.

135
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
When you enable AEB, your first shot is recorded at the current exposure 
settings; the second, with settings that produce a darker image; and the third, 
with settings that produce a brighter image. You can specify how much change 
in exposure you want in the three images when you turn on the feature.
 
You can take advantage of AEB in any of the advanced exposure modes. 
However, the feature isn’t available when you use flash. If you want to 
bracket exposures when using flash, you have to do it yourself, either by 
using exposure compensation or, in manual exposure mode, by changing the 
aperture and shutter speed directly.
Speaking of exposure compensation, you can combine that feature with AEB 
if you want. The camera simply applies the compensation amount when it 
calculates the exposure for the three bracketed images.
 
One feature you may want to disable when you use AEB, however, is the Auto 
Lighting Optimizer option. Because that feature is designed to automatically 
adjust images that are underexposed or lacking in contrast, it can render AEB 
ineffective. See the section “Disabling Auto Lighting Optimization,” earlier in 
this chapter, for information on where to find and turn off the feature.
With that preamble out of the way, take these steps to turn on AEB:
 
1. Display Shooting Menu 2 and highlight AEB, as shown on the left in 
Figure 5-20.
 
 
Figure 5-20: Auto exposure bracketing records your image at three exposure settings.
 
2. Press Set to activate the little exposure meter, as shown on the right in 
Figure 5-20.
 
3. Press the right cross key to establish the amount of exposure change 
you want between images.

136
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
 After you press the right cross key, you see three exposure indicators 
under the meter. These indicators show you the amount of exposure 
shift in the three shots the camera will record. Each whole number rep-
resents one full exposure stop.
 
 For example, if you use the setting shown in Figure 5-20, the camera 
shoots one image at the actual exposure settings, and it then takes the 
second image using settings that allow half as much light into the camera. 
The third image is recorded using settings that allow twice as much light.
 
 To reduce the amount of exposure shift, press the left cross key, which 
moves the exposure indicators closer together.
 
4. Press Set.
 
 AEB is now enabled. To remind 
you of that fact, the exposure 
meter in the Shooting Settings 
display shows the three expo-
sure indicators to represent the 
exposure shift you established 
in Step 3, as shown in Figure 
5-21. You see the same markers 
in the viewfinder and in the Live 
View display.
How you actually record your trio 
of exposures depends on whether 
the Drive mode is set to Single or 
Continuous. The Drive mode, which 
I introduce in Chapter 2, determines 
whether the camera records a single 
image or multiple images with each 
press of the shutter button. (Press the 
left cross key to access the screen that enables you to change this setting.)
 
✓ AEB in Single mode: You take each exposure separately, pressing the 
shutter button fully three times to record your trio of images. 
 
 If you forget which exposure you’re taking, look at the exposure meter. 
After you press the shutter button halfway to lock focus, the meter 
shows just a single indicator bar instead of three. If the bar is at 0, you’re 
ready to take the first capture. If it’s to the left of 0, you’re on capture 
two, which creates the darker exposure. If it’s to the right of 0, you’re on 
capture three, which produces the brightest image.
 
✓ AEB in Continuous mode: The camera records all three exposures with 
one press of the shutter button. To record another series, release and 
then press the shutter button again. In other words, when AEB is turned 
on, the camera doesn’t keep recording images until you release the shut-
ter button as it normally does in Continuous mode — you can take only 
three images with one press of the shutter button.
Auto Exposure Bracketing indicators
Figure 5-21: The three bars under the 
meter remind you that automatic exposure 
bracketing is enabled.

137
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
 
✓ Self-Timer/Remote modes: All three exposures are recorded with a 
single press of the shutter button, as with Continuous mode.
To turn off auto exposure bracketing, just revisit Shooting Menu 2 and 
change the AEB setting back to 0.
 
AEB is also turned off when you power down the camera, enable the flash, 
replace the camera battery, or replace the memory card. You also can’t use 
the feature in manual exposure mode if you set the shutter speed to the Bulb 
option. (At that setting, the camera keeps the shutter open as long as you 
press the shutter button down.)
Using Flash in Advanced Exposure Modes
Sometimes, no amount of fiddling with aperture, shutter speed, and ISO pro-
duces a bright enough exposure — in which case, you simply have to add more 
light. The built-in flash on your camera offers the most convenient solution.
 
 To pop up the flash, press the Flash button on the side of the camera, high-
lighted in Figure 5-22. To turn off the flash, just press down on the flash 
assembly to close it.
As you can in the fully automatic 
modes, you also can set the flash 
to Red-Eye Reduction mode. Just 
display Shooting Menu 1 and turn 
the Red Eye option on or off. When 
enabled, the camera lights the Red-
Eye Reduction lamp on the front of 
the camera for a brief time before the 
flash goes off in an effort to constrict 
the subject’s pupils and thereby 
lessen the chances of red-eye.
The next section goes into a little 
background detail about how the 
camera calculates the flash power 
that’s needed to expose the image. 
This stuff is a little technical, but it 
will help you better understand how 
to get the results you want because 
the flash performance varies depend-
ing on the exposure mode.
Following that discussion, the rest 
of the chapter covers advanced flash features, including flash exposure com-
pensation and flash exposure lock. You’ll find some tips on getting better

flash, flip back to Chapter 2, which spells everything out. Be sure to also visit 
Chapter 7, where you can find additional flash and lighting tips related to spe-
cific types of photographs.
Understanding your camera’s approach to flash
 
When you use flash, your camera automatically calculates the flash power 
needed to illuminate the subject. This process is sometimes referred to as flash 
metering. Your Rebel XS/1000D uses a flash-metering system that Canon calls 
E-TTL II. The E stands for evaluative; TTL, for through the lens. And the II refers 
to the fact that this system is an update to the first version of the system.
It isn’t important that you remember what the initials stand for or even the 
flash system’s official name. But what is helpful to keep in mind is how the 
system is designed to work.
First, you need to know that a flash can be used in two basic ways: as the 
primary light source or as a fill flash. When flash is the primary light source, 
both the subject and background are lit by the flash. In dim lighting, this typi-
cally results in a brightly lit subject and a dark background, as shown on the 
left in Figure 5-23.
 
Flash as primary light source
Fill flash
 
Figure 5-23: Fill flash produces brighter backgrounds.

139
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
With fill flash, the background is exposed primarily by ambient light, and the 
flash adds a little extra illumination to the subject. Fill flash typically pro-
duces brighter backgrounds and, often, softer lighting of the subject because 
not as much flash power is needed. The downside is that if the ambient light 
is dim, as in my nighttime photo, you need a slow shutter speed to properly 
expose the image, and both the camera and the subject must remain very 
still to avoid blurring. The shutter speed for my fill-flash image was 1/30 
second, for example. Fortunately, I had a tripod, and the deer didn’t seem 
inclined to move.
Neither choice is necessarily right or wrong, by the way: Whether you want 
a dark background depends on the scene and your artistic interpretation. If 
you want to diminish the background, you may prefer the darker background 
you get when you use flash as your primary light source. But if the back-
ground is important to the context of the shot, allowing the camera to absorb 
more ambient light and adding just a small bit of fill flash may be more to 
your liking.
 
One more note on flash: Although most people think of flash as a tool for night-
time and low-light photography, most outdoor daytime pictures, especially 
portraits, also benefit from a little fill flash. As a case in point, Figure 5-24 
shows you the same scene, shot at a farmer’s market on a sunny morning, 
 captured with and without fill flash.
 
Without flash
With flash
 
Figure 5-24: Flash often improves daytime pictures outdoors.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Using a flash in bright sunlight also produces a slight warming effect, as 
illustrated in Figure 5-24. This color shift occurs because when you enable 
the flash, the camera’s white balancing mechanism warms color slightly to 
compensate for the bluish light of a flash. But because your scene is actually 
lit primarily by sunlight, which is not as cool as flash light, the white balance 
adjustment takes the image colors a step warmer than neutral. If you don’t 
want this warming effect, see Chapter 6 to find out how to make a manual 
white balance adjustment.
So how does this little flash lesson relate to your camera? Well, the exposure 
mode you use (P, Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP) determines whether the flash operates 
as a fill flash or as the primary light source. The exposure mode also controls 
the extent to which the camera adjusts the aperture and shutter speed in 
response to the ambient light in the scene.
 
In all modes, the camera analyzes the light both in the background and on 
the subject. Then it calculates the exposure and flash output as follows: 
 
✓ P: In this mode, the shutter speed is automatically set between 1/60 and 
1/200 second. If the ambient light is sufficient, the flash output is geared 
to providing fill-flash lighting. Otherwise, the flash is determined to be 
the primary light source, and the output is adjusted accordingly. In the 
latter event, the image background may be dark, as in the left example in 
Figure 5-23.
 
✓ Tv: In this mode, the flash defaults to fill-flash behavior. After you select 
a shutter speed, the camera determines the proper aperture to expose 
the background with ambient light. Then it sets the flash power to pro-
vide fill-flash lighting to the subject.
 
 You can select a shutter speed between 30 seconds and 1/200 second. 
If the aperture (f-stop) setting blinks, the camera can’t expose the 
background properly at the shutter speed you selected. You can adjust 
either the shutter speed or ISO to correct the problem.
 
✓ Av: Again, the flash is designed to serve as fill-flash lighting. After you 
set the f-stop, the camera selects the shutter speed needed to expose 
the background using only ambient light. The flash power is then geared 
to fill in shadows on the subject.
 
 Depending on the ambient light and your selected f-stop, the camera 
sets the shutter speed at anywhere from 30 seconds to 1/200 second. So 
be sure to note the shutter speed before you shoot — at slow shutter 
speeds, you may need a tripod to avoid camera shake. Your subject also 
must stay very still to avoid blurring.
 
 If you want to avoid the possibility of a slow shutter altogether, you can, 
however. Display Setup Menu 3, select Custom Functions, and press 
Set. Then select Custom Function 2, as shown in Figure 5-25. At the Auto 
setting, the camera operates as just described. If you instead select the 
1/200 second option, the shutter speed is always set to that value when 

141
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
you use flash. This ensures that 
you can handhold the camera 
without blur, but obviously, in 
dim lighting, it can result in a 
dark background because the 
camera doesn’t have time to soak 
up much ambient light.
 
✓ M: In this mode, the shutter 
speed, aperture, and ISO setting 
you select determine how brightly 
the background will be exposed. 
The camera takes care of illumi-
nating the subject with fill flash. 
The maximum shutter speed you 
can select is 1/200 second.
 
✓ A-DEP: You can use flash in this mode, but doing so disables the auto-
matic depth-of-field feature. The flash and exposure systems then oper-
ate as described for P mode. However, you can’t choose from multiple 
combinations of aperture and shutter speed as you can in that mode; 
you’re stuck with the combination that the camera selects.
If the flash output in any mode isn’t to your liking, you can adjust it by using flash 
exposure compensation, explained next. Also check out the upcoming section 
“Locking the flash exposure” for another trick you can use to manipulate flash 
results.
Keep in mind, too, that in any autoexposure mode, you can use exposure 
compensation, discussed earlier, to tweak the ambient exposure — that is, 
the brightness of your background. So you have multiple points of control: 
exposure compensation to manipulate the background brightness, and flash 
compensation and flash exposure lock to adjust the flash output.
Adjusting flash power with flash 
exposure compensation
 
When you shoot with your built-in flash, the camera attempts to adjust the 
flash output as needed to produce a good exposure in the current lighting 
conditions. On some occasions, you may find that you want a little more or 
less light than the camera thinks is appropriate.
You can adjust the flash output by using a feature called flash exposure compen-
sation. This feature works similarly to exposure compensation, discussed earlier 
in this chapter. But flash exposure compensation affects the output level of the 
flash unit, whereas exposure compensation affects the brightness of the back-
ground in your flash photos. As with exposure compensation, the flash exposure 
compensation settings are stated in terms of EV (exposure value) numbers. A 
Figure 5-25: You can limit the camera to a 
fast shutter when using Av mode with flash.

142
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
setting of 0.0 indicates no flash adjustment; you can increase the flash power to 
+2.0 or decrease it to –2.0.
As an example of the benefit of this feature — again, available only when 
you shoot in the advanced exposure modes — take a look at Figure 5-26. I 
snapped these tomatoes during bright daylight, but they were shaded by a 
tent awning. The first image shows you a flash-free shot. Clearly, I needed a 
little more light, but at normal flash power, the flash was too strong, blowing 
out the highlights in some areas, as shown in the middle image. By dialing the 
flash power down to EV –1.3, I got a softer flash that straddled the line per-
fectly between no flash and too much flash.
No flash
Flash EV 0.0
Flash EV –1.3
Figure 5-26: When normal flash output is too strong, dial in a lower flash exposure compensation setting.
As for boosting the flash output, well, you may find it necessary on some 
occasions, but don’t expect the built-in flash to work miracles even at a flash 
exposure compensation of +2.0. Any built-in flash has a limited range, and 
you simply can’t expect the flash light to reach faraway objects. In other 
words, don’t even try taking flash pictures of a darkened recital hall from 
your seat in the balcony — all you’ll wind up doing is annoying everyone.
Whichever direction you want to go with flash power, display Shooting Menu 
2 and highlight the Flash Exp Comp option, as shown on the left in Figure 
5-27. Press Set to activate the little meter and then press the right or left 
cross key to specify the amount of flash compensation, as shown on the right 
in the figure. A higher value increases flash output; a lower value reduces it. 

143
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
 
 
Figure 5-27: Adjust flash power via Shooting Menu 2.
 
By the way, if you use flash exposure compensation a lot, you can customize 
the camera so that pressing the Set button displays that control, saving you 
the trouble of using the menus. Chapter 11 shows you how.
To let you know that flash compensa-
tion is in effect, the icon labeled in 
Figure 5-28 appears in the Shooting 
Settings display. You see the same 
plus/minus flash symbol in the 
viewfinder and Live View display, 
although in both cases without the 
actual flash exposure compensation 
value.
 
As with exposure compensation, any 
flash-power adjustment you make 
remains in force until you reset 
the control, even if you turn off the 
camera. So be sure to check the set-
ting before you next use your flash. In 
addition, the Auto Lighting Optimizer 
feature, covered earlier in this chap-
ter, can interfere with flash exposure compensation, so you may want to dis-
able it.
Locking the flash exposure
You might never notice it, but when you press the shutter button to take 
a picture with flash enabled, the camera emits a very brief preflash before 
the actual flash. This preflash is used to determine the proper flash power 
needed to expose the image.
Flash Exposure Compensation
Figure 5-28: This symbol tells you that flash 
compensation is in effect.

144
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
On occasion, the information that the camera collects from the preflash can 
be off-target because of the assumptions the system makes about what area 
of the frame is likely to contain your subject. To address this problem, your 
camera has a feature called flash exposure lock, or FE Lock. This tool enables 
you to set the flash power based only on the center of the frame.
 
Unfortunately, FE Lock is not available in Live View mode. So if you want to 
use this feature, you must abandon Live View and use the viewfinder to frame 
your images. Then follow these steps to FE Lock:
 
1. Frame your photo so that your subject falls under the center autofocus 
point.
 
 You want your subject smack in the middle of the frame. You can 
reframe the shot after locking the flash exposure if you want.
 
2. Press the shutter button halfway down.
 
 If you’re using autofocusing, focus is set on your subject, and the green 
focus confirmation dot appears in the viewfinder. You can now lift your 
finger off the shutter button if you want.
 
3. While the subject is still under the center autofocus point, press and 
release the AE Lock button.
 
 You can see the button in the margin here. The camera emits the pre-
flash, and the letters FEL display for a second in the viewfinder. (FEL 
stands for flash exposure lock.) You also see the asterisk symbol — the 
one that appears above the AE Lock button on the camera body — next 
to the flash icon in the viewfinder. 
 
4. If needed, re-establish focus on your subject.
 
 In autofocus mode, press and hold the shutter button halfway down. 
(You need to take this step only if you released the shutter button after 
Step 2.) In manual focus mode, twist the focusing ring on the lens to 
establish focus.
 
5. Reframe the image to your desired composition.
 
 As you do, keep the shutter button pressed halfway to maintain focus if 
you’re using autofocusing.
 
6. Press the shutter button the rest of the way to take the picture.
 
 The image is captured using the flash output setting you established in 
Step 3.
 
Flash exposure lock is also helpful when you’re shooting portraits. The pre-
flash sometimes causes people to blink, which means that with normal flash 
shooting, in which the actual flash and exposure occur immediately after the 
preflash, their eyes are closed at the exact moment of the exposure. With 
flash exposure lock, you can fire the preflash and then wait a second or two 
for the subject’s eyes to recover before you take the actual picture.

145
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
Better yet, the flash exposure setting remains in force for about 16 seconds, 
meaning that you can shoot a series of images using the same flash setting 
without firing another preflash at all. 
Exploring more flash options
Setup Menu 2, shown on the left in Figure 5-29, offers an option called Flash 
Control. Through this menu item, you can customize a few additional aspects 
of your camera’s built-in flash as well as an external flash head.
 
 
Figure 5-29: You can customize additional flash options via Setup Menu 2.
To explore your options, highlight Flash Control, as shown on the left in 
Figure 5-29, and press Set. You then see the screen shown on the right in the 
figure. Here’s the rundown of the available options:
 
✓ Flash Firing: Normally, this option is set to Enable. If you want to dis-
able the flash, you can choose Disable instead. However, you don’t have 
to take this step in most cases — just close the pop-up flash head on top 
of the camera if you don’t want to use flash.
 
 What’s the point of this option, then? Well, if you use autofocusing in 
dim lighting, the camera may need some help finding its target. To that 
end, it sometimes emits an AF-assist beam from the flash head — the 
beam is actually a series of rapid pulses of light. If you want the benefit 
of the AF-assist beam but you don’t want the flash to actually fire, you 
can disable flash firing. Remember that you do have to pop up the flash 
unit to expose the lamp that emits the beam. You also can take advan-
tage of this option when you attach an external flash head.
 
✓ Built-In Flash Function Setting: If you highlight this option, as shown on 
the right in Figure 5-29, and press Set, you display options related to the 
built-in flash, as shown in Figure 5-30. The first option is unavailable for 
the built-in flash. The other three affect the flash as follows.

146
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
• Shutter Sync: By default, the 
flash fires at the beginning 
of the exposure. This flash 
timing, known as first-curtain 
sync, is the best choice for 
most subjects. However, if 
you use a very slow shutter 
speed and you’re photo-
graphing a moving object, 
first-curtain sync causes the 
blur that results from the 
motion to appear in front 
of the object, which doesn’t 
make much visual sense. 
 
 To solve this problem, you 
can change the Shutter Sync option to second-curtain sync, also 
known as rear-curtain sync. In that flash mode, the motion trails will 
appear behind the moving object. The flash actually fires twice in 
this mode: once when you press the shutter button and again at 
the end of the exposure.
 
• Flash Exposure Compensation: This setting adjusts the power of 
the built-in flash, just like the option with the same name that lives 
on Shooting Menu 2. For details, see the earlier section “Adjusting 
flash power with flash exposure compensation.” You can set this 
option on either menu.
 
• E-TTL II: This option enables you to switch from the default flash 
metering approach, called Evaluative. In this mode, the camera 
operates as described in the earlier section, “Understanding your 
camera’s approach to flash.” That is, it exposes the background 
using ambient light when possible and then sets the flash power to 
serve as fill light on the subject.
 
 If you instead select the Average option, the flash is used as the 
primary light source, meaning that the flash power is set to expose 
the entire scene without relying on ambient light. Typically, this 
results in a more powerful (and possibly harsh) flash lighting and 
dark backgrounds.
 
✓ External Flash controls: The final three options on the Flash Control list 
(refer to the right screen in Figure 5-29) relate to external flash heads; 
they don’t affect the performance of the built-in flash. However, they 
apply only to Canon EX-series Speedlites that enable you to control 
the flash through the camera. If you own such a flash, refer to the flash 
manual for details.
Figure 5-30: These advanced flash options 
affect only the built-in flash.

147
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
As you can probably discern from these descriptions, most of these features 
are designed for photographers who are schooled in flash photography and 
want to mess around with advanced flash options. If that doesn’t describe 
you, don’t worry about it. The default settings selected by Canon will serve 
you well in most every situation — the exception being flash exposure com-
pensation, which you can just as easily adjust via Shooting Menu 2.
Using an external flash unit
In addition to its built-in flash, your 
camera has a hot shoe, which is photo-
geek terminology for a connection that 
enables you to add an external flash 
head like the one shown in Figure 5-31. 
The figure features the Canon Speedlite 
580EX II, which currently retails for 
right around $350.
Although certainly not the cheapest of 
camera accessories, an external flash 
may be a worthwhile investment if you 
do a lot of flash photography, especially 
portraits. For one thing, an external 
flash offers greater power, enabling you 
to illuminate a larger area than you can 
with a built-in flash. And with flash units 
like the one in Figure 5-31, you can rotate 
the flash head so that the flash light 
bounces off a wall or ceiling instead of 
hitting your subject directly. This results 
in softer lighting and can eliminate the 
harsh shadows often caused by the 
strong, narrowly focused light of a built-
in flash. (Chapter 7 offers an example of 
the difference this lighting technique can make in portraits.)
Whether the investment in an external flash will be worthwhile depends 
on the kind of photography you want to do. However, if you simply want 
a softer, more diffused light than your built-in flash produces, you have 
another option: You can buy a flash diffuser attachment like the one shown 
in Figure 5-32. This diffuser, made by LumiQuest (www.lumiquest.com), sells 
for just $13 and is a heck of a lot lighter and smaller to tuck into your camera 
bag than a flash head. This is just one of many diffuser designs, so visit your 
camera store to compare all of your options.
Figure 5-31: An external flash with a 
rotating head offers greater lighting 
flexibility.

148
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
If you decide to purchase an external 
flash, I strongly recommend that you 
shop at a reputable camera store where 
the personnel can help you match the 
flash unit to your shooting needs. You 
don’t have to buy a Canon flash, but be 
aware that non-Canon flash units do not 
operate in Live View mode.
You may also want to dig into some of 
the many books that concentrate solely 
on flash photography. There’s a lot 
more to that game than you may imag-
ine, and you’ll no doubt discover some 
great ideas about lighting your pictures 
with flash. You can start with Chapter 7, 
which provides some specific examples 
of how to get better flash results when 
you shoot portraits, whether you go 
with the built-in flash, an external flash, 
or, my favorite, no flash.
Figure 5-32: If you don’t own an external 
flash head, try using a diffuser to soften the 
light from your built-in flash.

T
o many people, the word focus has just one interpretation when applied 
to a photograph: Either the subject is in focus or it’s blurry. And it’s 
true, this characteristic of your photographs is an important one. 
There’s not much to appreciate about an image that’s so 
blurry that you can’t make out whether you’re looking at 
Peru or Peoria.
But an artful photographer knows that there’s more 
to focus than simply getting a sharp image of a 
subject. You also need to consider depth of field, 
or the distance over which objects remain sharply 
focused. This chapter explains all the ways to con-
trol depth of field and also discusses how to use 
your Canon’s advanced autofocus options.
In addition, this chapter dives into the topic of color, 
explaining such concepts as white balancing, which 
compensates for the varying color casts created by dif-
ferent light sources, and color space, which determines the 
spectrum of colors your camera can capture. Finally, a section 
near the end of the chapter introduces you to Picture Styles, which enable 
you to take even greater control over image sharpness and color.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Reviewing Focus Basics
I touch on various focus issues in Chapters 1, 2, and 5. But just in case you’re 
not reading this book from front to back, the following steps provide a recap 
of the basic process of focusing with your Rebel XS/1000D.
 
These steps assume that Live View shooting, introduced in Chapter 4, is not 
enabled. Focusing works a little differently in Live View mode; see the upcom-
ing section “Autofocusing in Live View Mode” for details.
 
1. If you haven’t already done so, adjust the viewfinder to your eyesight.
 
 Look through the view-
finder and pay attention 
only to the autofocus 
points, labeled in Figure 
6-1. Then nudge the diop-
tric adjustment knob, to 
the right of the viewfinder, 
until the autofocus points 
appear sharp — don’t 
worry about the scene in 
front of the lens.
 
2. Set the focusing switch 
on the lens to manual or 
automatic focusing.
 
 To focus manually, set the 
switch to the MF position. 
For autofocusing, set the 
switch to the AF position, 
as in Figure 6-2. (These 
directions are specific to 
the kit lens sold with the 
Rebel XS/1000D, shown in the figure. If you use another lens, the switch 
may look or operate differently, so check the product manual.)
 
3. For handheld shooting, turn on Image Stabilization.
 
 For sharper handheld shots, set the Stabilizer switch on the kit lens to 
On, as shown in Figure 6-2. If you use another lens that offers image sta-
bilization (it may go by another name, depending on the manufacturer), 
check the lens manual to find out how to turn the feature on.
 
 For tripod-mounted shooting with a non-Canon lens, the manufacturer 
may suggest turning stabilization off, so check the lens manual. You don’t 
need to turn the feature off for most Canon IS lenses, but you can save 
battery power by doing so.
AF (autofocus) points

Figure 6-1: The viewfinder offers these focusing aids.

 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
 
4. To set focus in autofocus mode, press 
and hold the shutter button halfway 
down.
 
 When focus is established, the focus 
lamp in the viewfinder lights, and one 
or more of the autofocus points turns 
red, as shown in Figure 6-1. A red dot 
indicates an active autofocus point and 
tells you that the area under the dot is 
in focus. You can tell the camera to base 
focus on a specific autofocus point by 
following the steps in the next section.
 
 Focus is maintained as long as you 
continue to hold the shutter button down 
halfway. (Press the button the rest of the 
way when you’re ready to snap the 
picture.)
 
5.  To set focus manually, twist the 
focusing ring on the lens.
 
 Don’t forget to first set the switch on the 
lens to the MF position to avoid possibly 
damaging the lens.
 
 Note that even in manual mode, you can confirm focus by pressing the 
shutter button halfway. The autofocus point or points that achieved focus 
flash for a second or two, and the viewfinder’s focus lamp lights up.
Adjusting Autofocus Performance
You can adjust two aspects of your Rebel XS/1000D’s autofocusing system: 
which autofocus points are used to establish focus and the AF (autofocus) 
mode. The next two sections explain these features.
Auto/Manual focus switch
Image Stabilizer switch
Figure 6-2: Select AF for autofocus 
or MF for manual focus.
Shutter speed and blurry photos
A poorly focused photo isn’t always related to 
the issues discussed in this chapter. Any move-
ment of the camera or subject can also cause 
blur. Both of these problems are actually related 
to shutter speed, an exposure control that I 
cover in Chapter 5. Be sure to also visit Chapter 
7, which provides some additional tips for cap-
turing moving objects without blur.

152
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Selecting an autofocus point
When you shoot in any of the fully automatic exposure modes (Full Auto, 
Portrait, Landscape, and so on) as well as in A-DEP mode, all seven of your 
camera’s autofocus points are active. That means that the camera’s autofocus-
ing system looks at all the points when trying to establish focus. Typically, the 
camera sets focus on the point that falls over the object closest to the lens. If 
that focusing decision doesn’t suit your needs, you have two options:
 
✓ Focus manually.
 
✓ Set the camera to P, Tv, Av, or M exposure mode. In those modes, you 
can tell the camera to base focus on a specific autofocus point.
Chapter 1 explains how to adjust focus manually. If you want to use autofocus-
ing and specify an autofocus point, the following steps spell out the process.
 
These steps assume that you are not shooting in Live View mode. I explain 
the intricacies of Live View autofocusing a little later in this chapter, in the 
section cleverly named “Autofocusing in Live View Mode.” However, some of 
the autofocusing concepts involved in normal shooting also come into play 
for Live View autofocusing, so familiarize yourself with these steps before 
you jump to that discussion.
 
1. Set the Mode dial to P, Tv, Av, or M.
 
 Again, you can specify an autofocus point only in these exposure modes. 
 
 
2. Press and release the AF Point 
Selection button, highlighted 
in Figure 6-3.
 
 When you do, you see the AF 
Point Selection screen on the 
monitor. In Automatic AF Point 
Selection mode, all the autofo-
cus points appear in color, as in 
Figure 6-4. In Manual AF Point 
Selection mode, only one point is 
selected and appears in color, as 
shown in Figure 6-5. In the figure, 
the center AF point is selected.
 
 You can check the current 
mode by looking through the 
viewfinder, too. When you 
press and release the AF Point 
Selection button, all seven auto-
focus points turn red if you’re 
in Automatic AF Point Selection 
mode. A single point turns red if 
you’re in Manual AF Point Selection mode.
AF Point Selection button
Figure 6-3: Press and release the AF Point 
Selection button to select an autofocus point.

153
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
 
3. To choose a single autofocus 
point, set the camera to Manual 
AF Point Selection mode.
 
 You can do this in two ways:
 
• Rotate the Main dial. This 
option is easiest when your 
eye is up to the viewfinder.
 
• Press the Set button. Press-
ing the button toggles you 
between Automatic AF 
Point Selection and Manual 
AF Point Selection with the 
center point activated.
 
4. Specify which AF Point you 
want to use.
 
 You can either rotate the Main 
dial or press the cross keys to 
select a point. When all auto-
focus points again turn red, 
you’ve cycled back to automatic 
AF Point Selection mode. Rotate 
the dial or press a cross key 
to switch back to single-point 
selection.
That’s all there is to it — after you 
select the autofocus point, just frame 
your shot so that your subject falls 
under that point and then press the 
shutter button halfway to focus.
 
If you want the benefits of autofocus but find it bothersome to have to worry 
about selecting an autofocus point, try this approach: Set the camera to 
Manual AF Point Selection and select the center point as the active point. 
Now the camera will always set focus based on whatever is at the center of 
the frame. If you want your subject to appear off-center, you still can: Just 
frame the picture initially so that the subject is centered, depress the shutter 
button halfway to establish focus, and then reframe the image before press-
ing the shutter button the rest of the way. 
Do be careful about exposure if you use this technique, however. If the 
exposure metering mode is set to either Partial or Center-Weighted Average 
metering and you reframe the image so that your subject isn’t at the center of 
the frame, exposure may be off. To compensate, you may need to lock expo-
sure (using the AE Lock button) before you reframe. In Evaluative metering 
Figure 6-4: In Automatic mode, all seven 
autofocus points are active.
Figure 6-5: You also can base autofocus 
on a single point; here, the center point is 
selected.

154
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
mode, this issue shouldn’t be a big problem because exposure is based on 
the entire frame. Chapter 5 provides details about metering modes, autoex-
posure lock, and other exposure issues. 
Changing the AF (autofocus) mode
Your camera offers three different autofocusing schemes, which you select 
through a control called AF mode. The three choices work like so:
 
✓ One-Shot: In this mode, which is geared to shooting stationary subjects, 
the camera locks focus when you depress the shutter button halfway. 
Focus remains locked as long as you hold the shutter button at that half-
way position.
 
✓ AI Servo: In this mode, the camera adjusts focus continually as needed 
from the time you press the shutter button halfway to the time you take 
the picture. This mode is designed to make it easier to focus on moving 
objects.
 
 For AI Servo to work properly, you must reframe as needed to keep your 
subject under the active autofocus point if you’re working in Manual 
AF Point Selection mode. If the camera is set to Automatic AF Point 
Selection, keep the subject within the area covered by the seven autofo-
cus points. (The preceding section explains these two modes.)
 
 In either case, the green focus dot in the viewfinder blinks rapidly if the 
camera isn’t tracking focus successfully. If all is going well, the focus dot 
does not light up at all, nor do you hear the beep that normally sounds 
when focus is achieved.
 
✓ AI Focus: This mode automatically switches the camera from One-Shot 
to AI Servo as needed. When you first press the shutter button halfway, 
focus is locked on the active autofocus point (or points), as usual in 
One-Shot mode. But if the subject moves, the camera shifts into AI Servo 
mode and adjusts focus as it thinks is warranted.
Which of these three autofocus modes are available to you, however, 
depends on the exposure mode, as follows:
 
✓ In P, Tv, Av, and M modes, you can select any of the three AF mode 
options.
 
✓ In A-DEP mode as well as in Portrait, Landscape, Night Portrait, and 
Close-Up modes, the camera restricts you to One-Shot mode.
 
✓ Sports mode always uses AI Servo autofocus.
 
✓ Full Auto and No Flash modes always use AI Focus.
 
 The AI stands for artificial intelligence, if that helps.

155
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
So, assuming that you can choose from all three, which mode is best? Well, 
here’s my take: One-Shot mode works best for shooting still subjects, and AI 
Servo is the right choice for moving subjects. But frankly, AI Focus does a 
good job in most cases of making that shift for you and saves you the trouble 
of having to change the mode each time you go from shooting still to moving 
subjects. So, in my mind, there’s no real reason to fiddle with the setting 
unless you’re shooting moving objects and want to be able to lock focus at a 
specific position — in which case, my 
recommendation would be to simply 
switch to manual focusing anyway.
Whatever you decide, you can set the 
AF mode as follows:
 
1. Press the right cross key (the 
one labeled AF).
 
 The monitor displays the screen 
you see in Figure 6-6.
 
2. Press the left or right cross keys 
to highlight your choice.
 
3. Press the Set button.
Autofocusing in Live View Mode
Chapter 4 covers the basics of shooting in Live View mode, which enables 
you to compose your shots by using the camera monitor instead of the view-
finder. As I mention in that discussion, using this photography mode on a dig-
ital SLR isn’t as simple as it is on a compact point-and-shoot model because 
of the complexities of SLR design. On the Rebel XS/1000D, shooting in Live 
View mode requires some tradeoffs, such as not being able to use certain 
exposure features or any of the fully automatic exposure modes (Full Auto, 
Portrait, and so on).
As for focusing, the simplest and usually most reliable choice is to focus 
manually, and the Chapter 4 guide to Live View shooting explains the steps 
involved in doing just that. (The process is a little different in Live View mode 
than when you use the viewfinder to preview your shots.)
You can use autofocusing in Live View mode, however. In fact, you have 
your choice of two autofocusing methods: Quick mode and Live mode. (Hint: 
Quick mode is usually the best option.)
 
The next three sections explain the art of autofocusing in Live View mode. 
Before you move on to those sections, though, note the following limitations:
Figure 6-6: Press the right cross key to 
display the AF mode options.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
✓ Continuous autofocusing isn’t possible. You can set the AF mode to AI 
Servo, but even if you do, the camera behaves as if you instead selected 
the One-Shot option. In other words, the camera won’t track focus on a 
moving subject during Live View shooting.
 
✓ Autoexposure and autofocus are set and locked together. When you 
autofocus in Live View mode, you don’t press the shutter button halfway 
to lock focus as you normally do. Instead, you focus by pressing the AE 
Lock button — which also locks autoexposure, as explained in Chapter 5. 
If you want to lock exposure and focus separately in Live View mode, you 
have to reset the function of the AE Lock button.
 
 You do this through Custom Function 9, which you can explore fully in 
Chapter 11. For the purpose of Live View autofocusing, select option 1, 
AE Lock/AF. After you do, you lock autoexposure by using the shutter 
button and lock autofocus by pressing the AE Lock button. (Trust me, 
however, that simply focusing manually is much simpler than this con-
voluted process. And don’t make this change to the button functions 
while using this book, or things won’t work as described.)
 
✓ Autofocusing isn’t possible with remote-control shooting. If you want 
to control the camera with a remote unit, either switch to manual focus-
ing or don’t enable Live View.
 
Don’t forget that the Live View function is turned off by default. You enable 
the feature via the Live View Function Settings option on Setup Menu 2. 
(Chapter 4 explains this step.)
Enabling Live View autofocusing
By default, autofocusing is disabled for Live View shooting. If you want to 
autofocus, take these steps:
 
1. Set the camera to P, Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP mode.
 
 You can’t use Live View in any other mode.
 
2. Display Setup Menu 3 and highlight Custom Functions, as shown on 
the left in Figure 6-7.
 
3. Press Set and then press the right or left cross key to navigate to 
Custom Function 7.
 
 The Custom Function number appears in the upper-right corner of the 
screen. You should see options shown on the right in Figure 6-7.
 
4. Press Set again to activate the options list.

157
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
 
 
Figure 6-7: Enable Live View autofocusing through Custom Function 7.
 
5. Highlight your choice of autofocusing modes and then press Set.
 
 The next two sections explain the difference between Quick mode 
and Live mode autofocusing. After you press Set, your selected option 
appears in blue text in the menu, as shown on the right in Figure 6-7. 
(The blue always indicates the selected option for Custom Functions.)
Live View autofocus option 1: Quick mode
As its name implies, Quick mode offers the fastest autofocusing during Live 
View shooting. Here’s how it works:
 
1. Set the camera Mode dial to one of the advanced exposure modes (P, 
Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP).
 
 But remember that in Live View mode, the automatic depth-of-field fea-
ture supplied by the A-DEP mode is disabled, and the camera operates as 
it does when set to P (programmed autoexposure). See Chapter 5 if you 
can’t remember the difference between these two autoexposure settings.
 
2. Select Quick mode for Custom Function 7, as explained in the preced-
ing section.
 
3. Set the AF mode to One-Shot.
 
 To do so, press the right cross key to access the AF mode settings. 
Highlight One-Shot and press Set. 
 
 You can use the other two AF mode settings, but the camera can’t adjust 
focus to track moving subjects in those modes as it normally can. In 
addition, the other two settings can slow the autofocusing process. 

158
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
4. Set the desired autofocus point.
 
 You do this by pressing the AF Point Selection button and then using the 
techniques spelled out earlier in this chapter, in the section “Selecting 
an autofocus point.”
 
5. Press the shutter button halfway to return to shooting mode.
 
 You can then release the shutter button.
 
6. Press Set to engage the Live View preview.
 
 Now you see your subject on 
the monitor, along with either 
two or eight rectangles, as 
shown in Figure 6-8. Here’s the 
scoop:
 
• The large rectangle is 
the focusing frame that 
appears anytime you use 
Live View. It becomes 
involved in autofocusing 
if you choose to magnify 
the image display to 
check focus, as spelled 
out in Step 10.
 
• The small rectangles 
represent the autofocus 
points. If you’re using 
Automatic AF Point 
Selection, all seven points appear, as in Figure 6-8. If you’re using 
Manual AF Point Selection, you see only a single small rectangle 
that represents your chosen autofocus point.
 
7. Frame your shot so that an autofocus point falls over your subject.
 
 Again, the small rectangle (or rectangles) represent the autofocus 
point(s).
 
 
8. Press and hold the AE Lock button until you hear a beep.
 
 As soon as you press the button, the monitor turns black, and the auto-
focusing mechanism kicks into gear. Keep pressing the button until the 
camera beeps at you. The beep signals you that focus is set.
 
 In P, Tv, Av, or A-DEP modes, the autoexposure system fires up and 
locks exposure settings along with focus.
 
9. When focus is set, release the AE Lock button.
 
 The live image reappears on the monitor.
Focusing frame

autofocus points; the large rectangle, the Live 
View focusing frame.

10. Verify focus (optional).
 
 You can magnify the Live View display to double-check focus if 
you want. First press the cross keys to move the large focusing frame 
(refer to Figure 6-8) over the area of interest. Then press the AF Point 
Selection button to magnify the area inside the frame. Your first 
press displays a five-times magnified view; press again for a 10-times 
magnification.
 
 If focus is off, you can try reframing the scene and repeating Step 8 — 
that is, press and hold the AE Lock button until you hear the beep that 
indicates that focus has been reestablished. You can’t, however, select a 
different AF point without exiting from Live View mode. To do so, press 
the Set button. You then can repeat Steps 4 through 6 to change the AF 
point and return to Live View mode.
 
 When you’re satisfied with focus, press the AF Point Selection button 
again to return to the normal display magnification.
 
11. Depress the shutter button fully to take the picture.
 
 Because the shutter button doesn’t affect autofocus, as it does when 
you’re not using Live View mode, you don’t have to use the normal two-
stage button press. You can press that baby all in a single motion. (But 
press, don’t jab, or you may shake the camera and cause image blur.)
Live View autofocus option 2: Live mode
Live mode autofocusing enables you to select an autofocus point without 
exiting Live View shooting mode, an option you don’t get with Quick mode 
autofocusing.
 
On the very significant downside, however, Live mode autofocusing is notice-
ably slower than Quick mode, and the camera may have more trouble finding 
the focus point than in Quick mode. (The difference is due to the autofocus-
ing system that the camera employs.)
To compare the two modes, first visit Custom Function 7, on Setup Menu 3, 
and select Live mode from the list of options, as explained in the earlier sec-
tion, “Enabling Live View autofocusing.” Then set focus as follows:
 
1. Press Set to switch to Live View mode.
 
 Remember, in order to use Live View, you must use one of the advanced 
exposure modes: P, Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP.
 
 After you press Set, your subject appears on the monitor. This time, you 
see just the large rectangular focusing frame, labeled in Figure 6-8, with-
out the smaller autofocus point or points.

160
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
2. Position the focusing frame over the area on which you want to focus.
 
 You can move the focusing frame by pressing the cross keys.
 
3. Press and hold the AE Lock button.
 
 The camera attempts to establish focus and also sets exposure, if you’re 
using any exposure mode but M (manual).
 
4. When the focusing frame turns green and you hear a beep, release the 
AE Lock button.
 
 These signals tell you focus has been established and, in the autoexpo-
sure modes, that exposure has been set as well.
 
 If the focusing frame instead turns orange, the camera can’t establish focus. 
The best option here is to switch to manual focusing. (See the instructions 
in Chapter 4 for help with manual focusing in Live View mode.)
 
5. Verify focus (optional).
 
 To zoom in on the area inside the focusing frame and check focus, press 
the AF Selection Point button. Press once to zoom to a five-times magni-
fication; press again to display the scene at 10-times magnification. You 
can press the cross keys to shift the position of the focusing frame to 
inspect another area of the image.
 
 If focus appears off, you can press the AE Lock button again to restart 
autofocusing. Again, wait for the beep and green focusing frame indica-
tor to release the button.
 
 When you’re happy with focus, press the AF Point Selection button once 
more to return to normal, non-magnified view.
 
6. Press the shutter button to take the picture.
 
Although this option may seem like the easiest way to shoot in Live View 
mode, I suspect that you’ll find that it’s actually the least successful because 
of the length of time the camera needs to establish focus — assuming that 
it can do so at all. Once again, if you enjoy Live View shooting, I strongly 
encourage you to opt out of autofocusing and instead use the manual focus-
ing technique explored in Chapter 4.
Manipulating Depth of Field
Getting familiar with the concept of depth of field is one of the biggest steps 
you can take to becoming a more artful photographer. I introduce you to 
depth of field in Chapters 2 and 5, but here’s a quick recap just to hammer 
home the lesson:
 
✓ Depth of field refers to the distance over which objects in a photograph 
appear sharply focused.

161
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
 
✓ With a shallow, or small, depth 
of field, only your subject and 
objects very close to it appear 
sharp. Objects at a distance from 
the subject appear blurry.
 
✓ With a large depth of field, the 
zone of sharp focus extends to 
include distant objects.
Which arrangement works best 
depends entirely on your creative 
vision and your subject. In portraits, 
for example, a classic technique is 
to use a shallow depth of field, as in 
Figure 6-9. This approach increases 
emphasis on the subject while dimin-
ishing the impact of the background. 
But for the photo shown in Figure 
6-10, I wanted the historical marker, 
the lighthouse, and the cottage 
behind to have equal weight in the 
scene, so I used settings that pro-
duced a large depth of field, keeping 
them all in sharp focus.
Note, though, that with a shallow 
depth of field, you can just as easily throw fore-
ground objects into soft focus as background 
objects. In the lighthouse scene, for example, if 
I had used settings that produced a short depth 
of field and I set focus on the lighthouse, the 
historical marker and the cottage both might be 
outside the zone of sharp focus.
So how do you adjust depth of field? You have 
three points of control, as follows:
 
✓ Aperture setting (f-stop): The aperture 
is one of three exposure settings, all 
explained fully in Chapter 5. Depth of field 
increases as you stop down the aperture 
(by choosing a higher f-stop number). For 
shallow depth of field, open the aperture 
(by choosing a lower f-stop number).
Shallow depth of field
Figure 6-9: A shallow depth of field blurs the 
background and draws added attention to the 
subject.
Large depth of field
Figure 6-10: A large depth of field 
keeps both near and far subjects 
in sharp focus.

162
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
 Figure 6-11 offers an example. Notice that the trees in the background 
are much more softly focused in the f/5.6 example than in the f/11 ver-
sion. Of course, changing the aperture requires adjusting the shutter 
speed or ISO to maintain the equivalent exposure; for these images, 
I adjusted shutter speed.
 
f/5.6, 1/1000 second
f/11, 1/200 second
 
Figure 6-11: Raising the f-stop value increases depth of field.
 
✓ Lens focal length: In lay terms, focal length determines what the lens 
“sees.” As you increase focal length, measured in millimeters, the angle 
of view narrows, objects appear larger in the frame, and — the impor-
tant point for this discussion — depth of field decreases. Additionally, 
the spatial relationship of objects changes as you adjust focal length.
 
 As an example, Figure 6-12 compares the same scene shot at focal 
lengths of 138mm and 255mm. I used the same aperture, f/22, for both 
examples.
 
 Whether you have any focal-length flexibility depends on your lens: If 
you have a zoom lens, you can adjust the focal length — just zoom in 
or out. (The Rebel XS/1000D kit lens, for example, offers a focal range of 
18–55mm.) If you don’t have a zoom lens and can’t switch to a lens offer-
ing a different focal length than your current lens, scratch this means of 
manipulating depth of field.

255mm, f/22
 
Figure 6-12: Zooming to a longer focal length also reduces depth of field.
 
 For more technical details about focal length and your camera, see the 
sidebar “Fun facts about focal length.”
 
✓ Camera-to-subject distance: As you move the lens closer to your sub-
ject, depth of field decreases. This assumes that you don’t zoom in or 
out to reframe the picture, thereby changing the focal length. If you do, 
depth of field is affected by both the camera position and focal length.
 
Together, these three factors determine the maximum and minimum depth of 
field that you can achieve, as illustrated by my clever artwork in Figure 6-13 
and summed up in the following list:
 
✓ To produce the shallowest depth of field: Open the aperture as wide 
as possible (select the lowest f-stop number), zoom in to the maximum 
focal length of your lens, and get as close as possible to your subject.
 
✓ To produce maximum depth of field: Stop down the aperture to the 
highest possible f-stop setting, zoom out to the shortest focal length 
your lens offers, and move farther from your subject.

164
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
Greater depth of field:
Select higher f-stop
Decrease focal length (zoom out)
Move farther from subject
Shorter depth of field:
Select lower f-stop
Increase focal length (zoom in)
Move closer to subject
 
Figure 6-13: Aperture, focal length, and your shooting distance determine depth of field.
Here are a few additional tips and tricks related to depth of field:
 
✓ When depth of field is a primary concern, try using aperture-priority 
autoexposure (Av). In this mode, detailed fully in Chapter 5, you set the 
f-stop, and the camera selects the appropriate shutter speed to produce 
a good exposure. The range of aperture settings you can access depends 
on your lens.
 
✓ Some of the fully automatic scene modes are also designed with depth 
of field in mind. Portrait and Close-Up modes produce shortened depth 
of field; Landscape mode produces a greater depth of field. You can’t 
adjust aperture in these modes, however, so you’re limited to the setting 
the camera chooses. And in certain lighting conditions, the camera may 
not be able to choose an aperture that produces the depth of field you 
expect from the selected mode.
 
✓ The Rebel XS/1000D also offers a special autoexposure mode called 
A-DEP, which stands for automatic depth of field. In this mode, the 
camera selects the aperture setting that it thinks will keep all objects in 
the frame within the zone of sharp focus. You can read more about this 
mode in the next section.
 
✓ Not sure which aperture setting you need to produce the depth of field 
you want? Good news: Your camera offers depth-of-field preview, which 
enables you to see in advance how the aperture affects the focus zone. 
See the section labeled “Checking depth of field” for details on how to 
use this feature.

165
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
Fun facts about focal length
Every lens can be characterized by its focal 
length, or in the case of a zoom lens, the range of 
focal lengths it offers. Measured in millimeters, 
focal length determines the camera’s angle of 
view, the apparent size and distance of objects 
in the scene, and depth of field. According to 
photography tradition, a focal length of about 
50mm is a “normal” lens. Most point-and-shoot 
cameras feature this focal length, which is a 
medium-range lens that works well for the type 
of snapshots that users of those kinds of cam-
eras are likely to shoot.
A lens with a focal length under 35mm is typi-
cally known as a wide-angle lens because at 
that focal length, the camera has a wide angle 
of view and produces a long depth of field, 
making it good for landscape photography. A 
short focal length also has the effect of making 
objects seem smaller and farther away. At the 
other end of the spectrum, a lens with a focal 
length longer than about 80mm is considered a 
telephoto lens and often referred to as a long 
lens. With a long lens, angle of view narrows, 
depth of field decreases, and faraway subjects 
appear closer and larger, which is ideal for 
wildlife and sports photographers.
Note, however, that the focal lengths stated 
here and elsewhere in the book are so-called 
35mm equivalent focal lengths. Here’s the deal: 
For reasons that aren’t really important, when 
you put a standard lens on most digital cameras, 
including your Rebel XS/1000D, the available 
frame area is reduced, as if you took a picture 
on a camera that uses 35mm film negatives (the 
kind you’ve probably been using for years) and 
then cropped it.
This so-called crop factor, sometimes also 
called the magnification factor, varies depend-
ing on the digital camera, which is why the photo 
industry adopted the 35mm-equivalent measur-
ing stick as a standard. With your camera, the 
cropping factor is roughly 1.6. So the 18–55mm 
kit lens sold with the Rebel XS/1000D, for exam-
ple, actually captures the approximate area you 
would get from a 27–82mm lens on a 35mm film 
camera. In the figure here, for example, the red 
outline indicates the image area that results 
from the 1.6 crop factor.
Note that although the area the lens can cap-
ture changes when you move a lens from a 
35mm film camera to a digital body, depth of 
field isn’t affected, nor are the spatial relation-
ships between objects in the frame. So when 
lens shopping, you gauge those two character-
istics of the lens by looking at the stated focal 
length — no digital-to-film conversion math is 
required.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
✓ The extent to which background focus shifts as you adjust depth of field 
also is affected by the distance between the subject and the background. 
For increased background blurring, move the subject farther in front of 
the background.
 
✓ If you adjust aperture to affect depth of field, be sure to always keep an 
eye on shutter speed as well. To maintain the same exposure, shutter 
speed must change in tandem with aperture, and you may encounter 
a situation where the shutter speed is too slow to permit hand-holding 
of the camera. Lenses that offer optical image stabilization do enable 
most people to handhold the camera at slower shutter speeds than 
non-stabilized lenses, but double-check your results just to be sure. You 
can also consider raising the ISO setting to make the image sensor more 
reactive to light, but remember that higher ISO settings can produce 
noise. (Chapter 5 has details.)
Using A-DEP mode
In addition to the four advanced exposure modes found on most digital SLR 
cameras, your Rebel XS/1000D offers a fifth mode called A-DEP, as shown in 
Figure 6-14. The initials stand for automatic depth of field.
This mode is designed to assist you in producing photos that have a depth 
of field sufficient to keep all objects in the frame in sharp focus. The camera 
accomplishes this by analyzing the lens-to-subject distance for all those 
objects and then selecting the aperture that results in the appropriate depth 
of field. After choosing the aperture, the camera then selects the necessary 
shutter speed to properly expose the image at the selected f-stop.
A-DEP mode isn’t a surefire bet, however, 
and it does have some restrictions that 
may make it unsuitable for your subject. 
Here’s what you need to know:
 
✓ In very dim lighting, the shutter 
speed the camera selects may be too 
slow to allow you to handhold the 
camera without risking camera shake. 
So check the shutter speed in the 
viewfinder after you press the shutter 
button halfway to meter and focus 
the image.
 
✓ If the aperture value blinks in the 
viewfinder, the camera can’t set the f-stop so that you get both a good 
exposure and the depth of field necessary to keep all objects in the 
frame in sharp focus. In this situation, the camera assumes that your pri-
mary goal is a good exposure and adjusts the aperture as needed based 
on the available light.
Figure 6-14: A-DEP stands for automatic 
depth of field.

167
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
 
✓ If the shutter speed blinks in the viewfinder, the light is either too bright 
or too dim for the camera to properly expose the image at any combina-
tion of aperture and shutter speed. In bright light, you can lower the ISO, 
if it isn’t already at 100, or reposition or shade your subject. In dim light-
ing, raise the ISO or add artificial light.
 
✓ You can use flash with A-DEP mode, but the minute you turn on the 
flash, the camera no longer does its automatic depth-of-field calculation. 
The same thing occurs if you switch to Live View shooting. In either 
case, the camera simply presents you with a fixed combination of aper-
ture and shutter speed that will properly expose the image. The depth of 
field may or may not be what you want.
Given these limitations, my personal recommendation is that as soon as you 
fully understand the impact of aperture on depth of field, you politely decline 
the option of using A-DEP mode and instead work in aperture-priority auto-
exposure mode (Av) instead. Then you can simply match the f-stop to the 
depth of field you have in mind, without giving up the option of using flash or 
Live View shooting.
Checking depth of field
When you look through your viewfinder and press the shutter button half-
way, you can get only a partial indication of the depth of field that your cur-
rent camera settings will produce. You can see the effect of focal length and 
the camera-to-subject distance, but because the aperture doesn’t actually 
open to your selected f-stop until you take the picture, the viewfinder doesn’t 
show you how that setting will affect depth of field.
By using the Depth-of-Field Preview button on your camera, however, you 
can do just that. Almost hidden away on the front of your camera, the button 
is labeled in Figure 6-15.
To use this feature, just press and hold the shutter button halfway down and 
then press and hold the Depth-of-Field Preview button with the other hand. 
Depending on the selected f-stop, the scene in the viewfinder may then get 
darker. Or in Live View mode, the same thing happens in the monitor pre-
view. Either way, this effect doesn’t mean that your picture will be darker; 
it’s just a function of how the preview works.
After the preview engages, you can release the shutter button and then rotate 
the Main dial to see how changing the f-stop affects the depth of field. (The 
exception is when the camera is set to A-DEP mode, in which you have no 
control over aperture.)

168
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
Note that the preview doesn’t 
engage in P, Tv, Av, or A-DEP mode 
if your current aperture and shutter 
speed aren’t adequate to expose the 
image properly. You have to solve 
the exposure issue before you can 
use the preview.
Controlling Color
Compared with understanding 
some aspects of digital photogra-
phy — resolution, aperture and 
shutter speed, depth of field, and 
so on — making sense of your cam-
era’s color options is easy-breezy. 
First, color problems aren’t all 
that common, and when they are, 
they’re usually simple to fix with a 
quick shift of your camera’s white 
balance control. And getting a grip 
on color requires learning only a 
couple of new terms, an unusual 
state of affairs for an endeavor that often seems more like high-tech science 
than art.
The rest of this chapter explains the aforementioned white balance control, 
plus a couple of menu options that enable you to fine-tune the way your 
camera renders colors. For information on how to alter colors of existing pic-
tures by using the software that shipped with your camera, see Chapter 10.
Correcting colors with white balance
Every light source emits a particular color cast. The old-fashioned fluores-
cent lights found in most public restrooms, for example, put out a bluish-
greenish light, which is why our reflections in the mirrors in those restrooms 
always look so sickly. And if you think that your beloved looks especially 
attractive by candlelight, you aren’t imagining things: Candlelight casts a 
warm, yellow-red glow that is flattering to the skin.

 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
 
Science-y types measure the color of light, officially known as color tempera-
ture, on the Kelvin scale, which is named after its creator. You can see an 
illustration of the Kelvin scale in Figure 6-16.
When photographers talk about “warm light” and “cool light,” though, they 
aren’t referring to the position on the Kelvin scale — or at least not in the 
way we usually think of temperatures, with a higher number meaning hotter. 
Instead, the terms describe the visual appearance of the light. Warm light, 
produced by candles and incandescent lights, 
falls in the red-yellow spectrum you see at the 
bottom of the Kelvin scale in Figure 6-16; cool 
light, in the blue-green spectrum, appears at 
the top of the scale. 
At any rate, most of us don’t notice these fluc-
tuating colors of light because our eyes auto-
matically compensate for them. Except in very 
extreme lighting conditions, a white tablecloth 
appears white to us no matter whether we view 
it by candlelight, fluorescent light, or regular 
houselights.
Similarly, a digital camera compensates for dif-
ferent colors of light through a feature known 
as white balancing. Simply put, white balanc-
ing neutralizes light so that whites are always 
white, which in turn ensures that other colors 
are rendered accurately. If the camera senses 
warm light, it shifts colors slightly to the cool 
side of the color spectrum; in cool light, the 
camera shifts colors the opposite direction.
The good news is that, as with your eyes, your camera’s Automatic White 
Balance setting, which carries the label AWB, tackles this process remarkably 
well in most situations, which means that you can usually ignore it and con-
centrate on other aspects of your picture. But in some lighting conditions, 
the AWB adjustment doesn’t quite do the trick, resulting in an unwanted 
color cast like the one you see in the left image in Figure 6-17.

Figure 6-17: Multiple light sources resulted in a yellow color cast in Auto 
 
White Balance mode (left); switching to the Tungsten Light setting solved the 
 
problem (right).
Serious AWB problems most often occur when your subject is lit by a variety 
of light sources. For example, I shot the figurine in Figure 6-17 in my home 
studio, where I use a couple of high-powered photo lights that use tungsten 
bulbs, which produce light with a color temperature similar to regular house-
hold incandescent bulbs. The problem is that the windows in that room also 
permit some pretty strong daylight to filter through. In Automatic White 
Balance mode, the camera reacted to that daylight — which has a cool color 
cast — and applied too much warming, giving my original image a yellow 
tint. No problem: I just switched the white balance mode from AWB to the 
Tungsten Light setting. The right image in Figure 6-17 shows the corrected 
colors.
 
Unfortunately, you can’t make this kind of manual white balance selection if 
you shoot in the fully automatic exposure modes. So if you spy color prob-
lems in your camera monitor, you need to switch to either P, Tv, Av, M, or 
A-DEP mode. (Chapter 5 details all five exposure modes).
The next section explains precisely how to make a simple white balance cor-
rection; following that, you can explore some advanced white balance features.

 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
Changing the white balance setting
To switch from automatic to manual white balancing, follow these steps:
 
1. Set the camera Mode dial to P, Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP.
 
 You can tweak white balance only in these advanced exposure modes.
 
 
2. Press the WB button.
 
 
 You see the White Balance screen, shown on the left in Figure 6-18.
 
White Balance symbol
 
Figure 6-18: Press the WB button to access white balance options.
 
3. Press the right or left cross key to highlight the setting you want to use.
 
 As you scroll through the list of options, the name of the selected setting 
appears on the screen. For some settings, the camera also displays the 
approximate Kelvin temperature of the selected light source, as shown 
in the figure. (Refer to Figure 6-16 for a look at the Kelvin scale.)
  
 If the scene is lit by several sources, choose the setting that corre-
sponds to the strongest one. The Tungsten Light setting is usually best 
for regular incandescent household bulbs, by the way. And with the 
Custom option, you can define your own white balance setting; see the 
next section for details.
 
4. Press Set to lock in your choice.
You can confirm the current White Balance setting by displaying the Shooting 
Settings screen. The symbol representing the setting appears in the position 
labeled in the right image in Figure 6-18. (You also can display the symbol 
during Live View shooting; see Chapter 4 to find out how.) Table 6-1 offers a 
reminder of what setting each symbol represents.

172
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
Your selected white balance setting remains in force for the P, Tv, Av, M, and 
A-DEP exposure modes until you change it again. So you may want to get in 
the habit of resetting the option to AWB (automatic white balance) after you 
finish shooting whatever subject it was that caused you to switch to manual 
white balance mode.

Creating a custom white balance setting
If none of the preset white balance options produces the right amount of 
color correction, you can create your own custom setting. To use this tech-
nique, you need a piece of card stock that’s either neutral gray or absolute 
white — not eggshell white, sand white, or any other close-but-not perfect 
white. (You can buy reference cards made just for this purpose in many 
camera stores for under $20.)
Position the reference card so that it receives the same lighting you’ll use for 
your photo. Then take these steps:
 
1. Set the camera to the P, Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP exposure mode.
 
 You can’t create a custom setting in any of the fully automatic modes.
 
2. Set the camera to manual focusing and then focus on your reference 
card.

173
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
 
 Chapter 1 has details on manual focusing if you need help.
 
3. Frame the shot so that your reference card fills the center area of the 
viewfinder.
 
 In other words, make sure that at least the center autofocus point and 
the six surrounding points fall over the reference card.
 
4. Make sure that the exposure settings are correct.
 
 Just press the shutter button halfway to check exposure. In M mode, 
make sure that the exposure indicator is at the midway point of the 
exposure meter. In other modes, a blinking aperture or shutter speed 
value indicates an exposure problem. If necessary, adjust ISO, aperture, 
or shutter speed to fix the problem; Chapter 5 explains how.
 
5. Take the picture of your reference card.
 
 The camera will use this picture to establish your custom white balance 
setting.
 
6. Display Shooting Menu 2 and highlight Custom WB, as shown on the 
left in Figure 6-19.
 
 
Figure 6-19: You can create a custom white balance setting through Shooting Menu 2. 
 
7. Press Set.
 
 Now you see the screen shown on the right in Figure 6-19. The image you 
just captured should appear in the display. (The figure shows the pic-
ture I took of a gray reference card.) If not, press the right or left cross 
key to scroll to the image.
 
8. Press Set.
 
 You see the message shown on the left in Figure 6-20, asking you to con-
firm that you want the camera to use the image to create the custom 
White Balance setting.

174

Figure 6-20: This message indicates that your White Balance setting is stored.
 
9. Press the right or left cross key to highlight OK and then press Set.
 
 Now you see the screen shown on the right in Figure 6-20. This message 
tells you that the White Balance setting is now stored. The little icon in 
the message area represents the Custom setting.
 
10. Press Set one more time to finalize the deal and return to Shooting 
Menu 2.
Your Custom White Balance setting remains stored until the next time you 
work your way through these steps. So anytime you’re shooting in the same 
lighting conditions and want to apply the same white balance correction, just 
press the WB button to access the White Balance settings and then select the 
Custom option.
Fine-tuning White Balance settings
As yet another alternative for manipulating colors, your Rebel XS/1000D 
enables you to tweak white balancing in a way that shifts all colors toward a 
particular part of the color spectrum. The end result is similar to applying a 
traditional color filter to your lens.
To access this option, called White Balance Correction, take these steps:
 
1. Set the Mode dial to P, Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP exposure mode.
 
 You can take advantage of White Balance Correction only in these 
modes.
 
2. Display Shooting Menu 2 and highlight WB Shift/Bkt, as shown on the 
left in Figure 6-21.

175
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
 
 
Figure 6-21: White Balance Correction offers one more way to control colors.
 
3. Press Set to display the screen you see on the right in Figure 6-21.
 
 The screen contains a grid that is oriented around two main color pairs: 
green and magenta, represented by the G and M labels, and blue and 
amber, represented by B and A. The little white square indicates the 
current amount of white balance correction, or shift. When the square is 
dead center in the grid, as in the figure, no shift is applied.
 
4. Use the cross keys to move the square marker in the direction of the 
shift you want to achieve.
 
 As you do, the Shift area of the 
display tells the amount of color 
bias that you’ve selected. For 
example, in Figure 6-22, I shifted 
three levels toward amber and 
one toward magenta.
 
 If you’re familiar with traditional 
lens filters, you may know that 
the density of a filter, which 
determines the degree of color 
correction it provides, is mea-
sured in mireds (pronounced 
my-redds). The white balance grid 
is designed around this system: 
Moving the marker one level is 
the equivalent of adding a filter 
with a density of 5 mireds.
 
5. Press Set to apply the change and return to the menu.
 
 After you apply white balance correction, a little plus or minus sign 
appears next to the White Balance symbol in the Shooting Settings dis-
play, as shown on the left in Figure 6-23. That’s your reminder that white 
balance shift is being applied. The same symbol appears in the view-
finder, right next to the ISO value.

176
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
 You can see the exact shift values in Shooting Menu 2, as shown on the 
right in Figure 6-23, and also in the Camera Function Settings display. 
(Remember, to activate that display, first display any menu and then 
press the DISP button. Chapter 1 provides more details.)
 
White Balance Shift icon
 
Figure 6-23: The +/– symbol lets you know that white balance shift is being applied.
 
 Your adjustment remains in force for all the advanced exposure modes 
until you change it. And the correction is applied no matter what White 
Balance setting you choose. So make it a point to check the monitor or 
viewfinder before your next shoot — otherwise, you may forget to adjust 
the white balance for the current light.
 
6. To cancel White Balance Correction, repeat Steps 1–3, set the marker 
back to the center of the grid, and press Set.
 
 Use the cross keys to move the marker back to the center of the grid. Be 
sure that values in the Shift area of the display are both set to 0.
 
 As an alternative, you can press the DISP button after you get to the grid 
display. However, doing so also cancels white balance bracketing, a fea-
ture explained in the next section. After you press DISP, be sure to press 
Set to lock in your decision. 
 
Many film-photography enthusiasts place colored filters on their lenses to 
either warm or cool their images. Portrait photographers, for example, often 
add a warming filter to give skin tones a healthy, golden glow. You can mimic 
the effects of such filters by simply fine-tuning your camera’s White Balance 
settings as just described. Experiment with shifting the white balance a tad 
toward amber and magenta for a warming effect or toward blue and green for 
a cooling effect.

177
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
Bracketing shots with white balance
Chapter 5 introduces you to your camera’s automatic exposure bracketing, 
which enables you to easily record the same image at three different expo-
sure settings. Similarly, you can take advantage of automatic White Balance 
Bracketing. With this feature, the camera records the same image three 
times, using a slightly different white balance adjustment for each.
This feature is especially helpful when you’re shooting in varying light 
sources — for example, a mix of fluorescent light, daylight, and flash. 
Bracketing the shots ups the odds that the color renditions of at least one of 
the shots will be to your liking.
 
Note a couple of things about this feature:
 
✓ You can’t use White Balance Bracketing if you set the camera’s Quality 
setting to either Raw or Raw+Large/Fine. And frankly, there isn’t any 
need to do so in Raw mode because you can precisely tune colors when 
you process the Raw files. Chapter 8 has details on Raw processing.
 
✓ White Balance Bracketing is also disabled if you turn on High ISO Speed 
Noise Reduction. You can read about that feature, accessed through 
Custom Function 4, in Chapter 5.
 
✓ Because the camera records three images, white balance bracketing 
reduces the maximum capture speed that is possible when you use the 
Continuous shooting mode. See Chapter 2 for more about Continuous 
mode. Of course, recording three images instead of one also eats up 
more space on your memory card.
 
✓ The White Balance Bracketing feature is designed around the same grid 
used for White Balance Correction, explained in the preceding section. 
As a reminder, the grid is based on two color pairs: green/magenta and 
blue/amber.
 
✓ When White Balance Bracketing is enabled, the camera always records 
the first of the three bracketed shots using a neutral white balance 
setting — or, at least, what it considers to be neutral, given its own 
measurement of the light. The second and third shots are then recorded 
using the specified shift along either the green/magenta or blue/amber 
axis of the color grid.
If all that is as clear as mud, just take a look at Figure 6-24 for an example. 
I captured these images using a single tungsten studio light and the candle 
light itself. I set up White Balance Bracketing to work along the blue/amber 
color axis. So the camera recorded the first image at neutral, the second with 
a slightly blue color bias, and the third with an amber bias.

178
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Neutral
+3 Blue bias
+3 Amber bias
Figure 6-24: I captured one neutral image, one with a blue bias, and one with an amber bias.
To enable White Balance Bracketing, take these steps:
 
1. Set the Mode dial to an advanced exposure mode (P, Tv, Av, M, or 
A-DEP).
 
2. Make sure the Quality option is not set to record Raw images.
 
 You find this setting on Shooting Menu 1. If you select Raw (or 
Raw+Large/Fine), the camera simply records each image the same way. 
You then can adjust colors in your Raw processor.
 
3. Display Shooting Menu 2 and highlight WB/Shift Bkt.
 
4. Press Set to display the grid 
shown in Figure 6-25.
 
 The screen is the same one you see 
when you use the White Balance 
Correction feature, explained in the 
preceding section.
 
5. Rotate the Main dial to set the 
amount and direction of the 
bracketing shift.
 
 Rotate the dial as follows to specify 
whether you want the bracketing 
to be applied across the horizontal 
axis (blue to amber) or the vertical 
axis (green to magenta).
Figure 6-25: I used these settings to capture 
the bracketed candle images.

179
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
 
• Blue to amber bracketing: Rotate the dial right.
 
• Green to magenta bracketing: Rotate the dial left. 
 
 As you rotate the dial, three markers appear on the grid, indicating the 
amount of shift that will be applied to your trio of bracketed images. You 
can apply a maximum shift of plus or minus three levels of adjustment.
 
 The BKT area of the screen also indicates the shift; for example, in 
Figure 6-25, the display shows a bracketing amount of plus and minus 
three levels on the blue/amber axis. I used the settings shown in Figure 
6-25 to record the example images in Figure 6-24. As you can see, even at 
the maximum shift (+/– 3), the difference to the colors is subtle.
 
 If you want to get really fancy, you can combine White Balance 
Bracketing with White Balance Shift. To set the amount of White Balance 
Shift, press the cross keys to move the square markers around the grid. 
Then use the Main dial to adjust the bracketing setting.
 
6. Press Set to apply your changes and return to the menu.
 
 The bracketing symbol shown 
in Figure 6-26 appears in the 
Shooting Settings display. The 
Camera Function Settings display, 
which you bring up by pressing 
DISP when any menu is visible, 
also reports the current bracket-
ing setting.
 
Your bracketing setting remains in 
effect until you turn the camera off. 
You can also cancel bracketing by 
revisiting the grid screen shown in 
Figure 6-25 and either rotating the 
Main dial until you see only a single 
grid marker or pressing the DISP 
button. Either way, press Set to offi-
cially turn off bracketing.
Choosing a Color Space: sRGB vs. Adobe RGB
Normally, your camera captures images using the sRGB color mode, which 
simply refers to an industry-standard spectrum of colors. (The s is for stan-
dard, and the RGB is for red-green-blue, which are the primary colors in the 
digital imaging color world.) This color mode was created to help ensure 
color consistency as an image moves from camera (or scanner) to moni-
tor and printer; the idea was to create a spectrum of colors that all of these 
devices can reproduce. 
White Balance Bracketing icon
Figure 6-26: This symbol indicates that White 
Balance Bracketing is turned on.

180
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
However, the sRGB color spectrum leaves out some colors that can be repro-
duced in print and onscreen, at least by some devices. So as an alternative, 
your camera also enables you to shoot in the Adobe RGB color mode, which 
includes a larger spectrum (or gamut) of colors. Figure 6-27 offers an illustra-
tion of the two spectrums.
 
Visible Spectrum
Adobe RGB
sRGB
 
Figure 6-27: Adobe RGB includes some colors not found in the 
 
sRGB spectrum.
Which option is right for you depends on what you plan to do with your 
photos. If you’re going to print your pictures without doing any editing to 
them, sRGB is probably the best choice because it typically results in the 
“punchy” colors that most people like. Some Internet printing services also 
request sRGB images.
On the other hand, if you’re a color purist, will be editing your photos, 
making your own prints, or all of the above, experiment with Adobe RGB. For 
the record, this is the route that I go because I see no reason to limit myself 
to a smaller spectrum from the get-go. However, do note that some colors 
in Adobe RGB can’t be reproduced in print; the printer substitutes the clos-
est available color when necessary. Additionally, you’ll need photo software 
that offers support for Adobe RGB as well as some basic color management 

181
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
controls, which ensure that your image colors are properly handled when you 
open, print, edit, and save your files. You should plan to spend a little time 
educating yourself about color management, too, because you can muck up 
the works if you don’t set all the color-management options correctly. Long 
story short: If you’re brand new to digital imaging, this option may be one 
you explore after you get more comfortable with the whole topic.
If you do want to capture images in Adobe RGB instead of sRGB, visit 
Shooting Menu 2 and highlight the Color Space option, as shown on the left in 
Figure 6-28. Press Set to display the screen shown on the right in the figure. 
Press the up or down cross key to highlight Adobe RGB and press Set again.
 
Remember that this color mode choice applies only when you shoot in the 
advanced exposure modes: P, Tv, Av, M, and A-DEP. In all other modes, the 
camera automatically selects sRGB as the color space.
 
 
Figure 6-28: Choose Adobe RGB for a broader color spectrum.
 
You can tell whether you captured an image in the Adobe RGB format by 
looking at its filename: Adobe RGB images start with an underscore, as in 
_MG_0627.jpg. Pictures captured in the sRGB color space start with the letter 
I, as in IMG_0627.jpg.
Exploring Picture Styles
In addition to all the focus and color features already covered in this chapter, 
your Rebel XS/1000D offers Picture Styles. Through Picture Styles, you can fur-
ther tweak color as well as saturation, contrast, and image sharpening.
 
Sharpening is a software process that adjusts contrast in a way that creates 
the illusion of slightly sharper focus. I explain sharpening fully in Chapter 10, 
but the important thing to note for now is that sharpening cannot remedy poor 
focus, but instead produces a subtle tweak to this aspect of your pictures.

182
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
In fact, many of the adjustments that Picture Styles apply are pretty subtle, at 
least to my eye. The impact of any of these settings varies depending on your 
subject, but on the whole, if you want to make large-scale changes to color, 
contrast, or sharpening, you’re probably going to need to use your computer 
and photo editing software. Again, though, your mileage may vary, as they 
say, as may your opinion of what constitutes the optimum color and sharpen-
ing characteristics.
The next section introduces you to your Picture Style options. Later sections 
explain how to change the Picture Style setting, customize the six prefab 
styles, and define your very own, custom styles.
Assessing the Picture Styles
When you set the Mode dial to Full Auto or any of the other fully automatic 
exposure modes, the camera selects a Picture Style for you. In P, Tv, Av, M, 
and A-DEP modes, however, you can specify which of the Picture Styles you 
want to use. Here’s a quick description of the six styles:
 
✓ Standard: The default setting, this option captures the image using the 
characteristics that Canon offers as suitable for the majority of subjects. 
 
✓ Portrait: This mode reduces sharpening slightly from the amount that’s 
applied in Standard mode, with the goal of keeping skin texture soft. 
Color saturation, on the other hand, is slightly increased. If you shoot in 
the Portrait autoexposure mode, the camera automatically applies this 
Picture Style for you.
 
✓ Landscape: In a nod to traditions of landscape photography, this Picture 
Style emphasizes greens and blues and amps up color saturation and sharp-
ness, resulting in bolder images. The camera automatically applies this 
Picture Style if you set the Mode dial to the Landscape autoexposure mode.
 
✓ Neutral: This setting reduces saturation and contrast slightly compared 
to how the camera renders images when the Standard option is selected. 
 
✓ Faithful: The Faithful style is designed to render colors as closely as 
possible to how your eye perceives them.
 
✓ Monochrome: This setting produces black-and-white photos, or, to be 
more precise, grayscale images (technically speaking, a true black-and-
white image contains only black and white, with no shades of gray).
 
 If you set the Quality option on Shooting Menu 1 to Raw (or Raw + Large/
Fine), the camera displays your image on the monitor in black and white 
during playback. But during the Raw converter process, you can either 
choose to go with your grayscale version or view and save a full-color 
version. Or, even better, you can process and save the image once as a 
grayscale photo and again as a color image.
 
 If you don’t capture the image in the Raw format, you can’t access the 
original image colors later. 

183
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
 
✓ User Defined 1, 2, and 3: These options enable you to create and save 
three of your own Picture Styles. I cover this feature in the last section 
of the chapter.
Figure 6-29 shows you how the camera rendered the same scene in each of 
the six preset Picture Styles. As you can see, Landscape has the most notice-
able impact. To my taste, in fact, Landscape colors are a little over the top, 
but that’s strictly a personal preference.

in the figure.

Figure 6-30: Press the down cross key to quickly change the 
 
Picture Style.
 
Here’s what you need to know about this cryptic-looking screen:
 
✓ Picture Style icons: The two columns of symbols on the right repre-
sent the Picture Styles, as labeled in Figure 6-30. (Notice that the icons 
bear the same symbol as the down cross key.) The six prefab styles are 
marked with an initial (S for Standard, P for Portrait, and so on). The 1, 
2, and 3 icons represent the three User Defined custom styles that you 
can create. 
 
✓ Adjustment setting icons: On the left side of the screen, you see the 
name of the currently selected style plus four more symbols, each 
accompanied by a number. I labeled these four symbols “Adjustment 
settings” in Figure 6-30; you can get a close-up view in Figure 6-31. The 
icons represent the four characteristics that the styles affect: sharpness, 
contrast, saturation, and color tone.

185
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
 
 
If you select the Monochrome 
Picture Style, the saturation and 
color tone options are replaced 
by two other options, filter effect 
and toning effect.
 
✓ Adjustment values: As for the 
numbers next to the symbols, 
they work a little differently 
than you may expect. Sharpness 
values range from 0 to 7; the 
higher the value, the more sharp-
ening is applied. At 0, no sharpen-
ing is applied.
 
 The other values, however, all 
initially appear as 0, which in this 
case represents a middle-of-the-
road setting. If you customize the style, the number indicates the level 
of adjustment. For example, if you customize the style so that it applies 
three levels more saturation than normal, you see a 3 next to the satu-
ration icon. If you go the other direction, tweaking the style so that it 
applies three levels less saturation than normal, you see a –3 instead.
 
 See the upcoming section, “Customizing Picture Styles,” for a little more 
detail about the four picture characteristics.
To select a style, press the up or 
down cross key to highlight that 
style’s icon. Press Set to lock in your 
style choice. As soon as you do, the 
Shooting Settings display appears 
automatically, and you can see the 
icon for your selected Picture Style in 
the position labeled in Figure 6-32.
You can also change the Picture Style 
through Shooting Menu 2, shown on 
the left in Figure 6-33. Highlight the 
Picture Styles option and press Set to 
display the screenful of options you 
see on the right in the figure. (You 
can see only the six prefab Picture 
Style settings on the first screen; 
scroll down using the cross keys to 
view the User Defined styles.)

The symbols at the top of the Picture Style screen (right image in Figure 6-33) are 
the same ones shown in Figure 6-30. And the numbers next to each style show 
you the amount of adjustment for each of the four picture characteristics.
 
However you set the Picture Style, remember that you must do so before 
you switch to Live View shooting, if you choose to turn on that feature. See 
Chapter 4 for an introduction to Live View shooting.
Customizing Picture Styles
You can customize the results that you get from the prefab Picture Styles. For 
the Standard, Landscape, Portrait, Neutral, and Faithful styles, you can adjust 
sharpness, contrast, saturation, and color tone. (The Color Tone option 
enables you to make your colors either a little more red or a little more 
yellow and is designed to help you tweak skin tones in portraits.)
For the Monochrome Picture Style, saturation and color tone are irrelevant, 
so they are replaced by two other options, Filter Effect and Toning Effect. The 
Filter Effect options mimic color filters sometimes used by photographers 
shooting black-and-white film. The color of the filter determines which colors 
in the original scene become prominent in the black-and-white image. The 
Toning Effect options enable you to apply a sepia, blue, purple, or green tint 
to your monochrome image.
To dig into Picture Style customizing, take these steps:
 
1. Display Shooting Menu 2 and highlight Picture Style, as shown on the 
left in Figure 6-33.
 
 Remember, you can access this menu and the Picture Style options only 
in the advanced exposure modes (P, Tv, Av, M, and A-DEP).

to adjust.
 
4. Press the DISP button.
 
 The screen shown in Figure 6-34 appears, listing the four characteristics 
that you can adjust for your selected Picture Style.
 
5. Highlight the characteristic that you want to tweak and press Set.
 
 The little scale next to the selection option becomes active.
 
6. Press the right or left cross key to adjust the setting.
 
 As soon as you adjust the setting, 
you see two markers: The gray 
one shows you the default setting; 
the white one, your customized 
setting, as labeled in Figure 6-34.
 
 For Contrast, Saturation, and 
Sharpness, move the little marker 
on the scale to the right to increase 
the effect. For Color Tone, move 
the slider toward the minus sign to 
make colors less yellow and more 
red; move the slider toward the 
plus sign to make colors less red 
and more yellow.
 
 When you adjust the Filter Effect 
and Toning Effect options for the 
Monochrome style, the adjust-
ment scale and slider are replaced 
by a simple list of options; just highlight the one you want to use.
 
7. Press Set to lock in your adjustment.
 
8. Repeat Steps 5 through 7 to adjust the other settings as desired.
 
9. Press the Menu button to return to the main Picture Styles screen.

Unfortunately, you can’t preview how your adjustments will affect your image 
because the Picture Style attributes are applied to the photo after you shoot 
it, during the time the image is recorded to your memory card. So I’d like to 
offer an alternative: If you shoot in the Raw format, you don’t have to worry 
about in-camera adjustments to Picture Styles — or even selecting a Picture 
Style, for that matter — because you can apply the style when you process 
your Raw images. Just follow the directions laid out in Chapter 8 to use the 
Raw converter provided in ZoomBrowser EX (Windows) or ImageBrowser 
(Mac). On the Image Quality Adjustment panel, you can select a Picture Style 
and then make the same adjustments to the style as you can in the camera.
At the very least, experimenting with Picture Styles in the Raw converter 
should help you know what adjustments you may want to make to the actual 
camera settings. And for creating monochrome images, using the Raw con-
verter tools enables you to try out the different Filter Effect and Toning Effect 
options to find the one you like best.
Creating your own Picture Style
The User Defined options on the Picture Style menu enable you to create 
and store up to three of your very own Picture Styles. So if you hit upon a 
combination of customized settings that you really like for a particular type 
of  subject — snow scenes, for example, or pictures of your pooch — you can 
easily reuse those settings.
Follow these steps to create your custom Picture Style:
 
1. Display Shooting Menu 2, highlight Picture Style, and press Set.
 
 You see the normal list of Picture Styles.
 
2. Press the down cross key to scroll the display until the User Defined 
options come into view.
 
3. Highlight one of the User Defined options, as shown on the left in 
Figure 6-35.
 
4. Press the DISP button.
 
 Now you see the screen shown on the right in Figure 6-35.
 
5. Highlight the Picture Style option, as shown on the right in Figure 6-35, 
and press Set.
 
6. Press the up or down arrow key to select the style on which you want 
to base your custom style and press Set.
 
 If you want to create your own style for portraits, for example, select 
the Portrait option. Or, if you want to create a special black-and-white 
style, choose Monochrome. Your new style will be based on the one you 
select.

In This Chapter 
▶ Reviewing the best all-around picture-taking settings
▶ Adjusting the camera for portrait photography
▶ Discovering the keys to super action shots
▶ Dialing in the right settings to capture landscapes and other scenic vistas
▶ Capturing close-up views of your subject
▶ Shooting through glass, capturing fireworks, and conquering other special challenges
E
arlier chapters of this book break down each and every picture-taking 
feature on your Rebel XS/1000D, describing in detail how the various 
controls affect exposure, picture quality, focus, color, and the like. This 
chapter pulls all that information together to help you set up your 
camera for specific types of photography.
The first few pages offer a quick summary of critical 
picture-taking settings that should serve you well no 
matter what your subject. Following that, I offer my 
advice on which settings to use for portraits, action 
shots, landscapes, and close-ups. To wrap things 
up, the end of the chapter includes some miscel-
laneous tips for dealing with special shooting situa-
tions and subjects.
Keep in mind that although I present specific recom-
mendations here, there are no hard and fast rules as 
to the “right way” to shoot a portrait, a landscape, or 
whatever. So don’t be afraid to wander off on your own, 
tweaking this exposure setting or adjusting that focus con-
trol, to discover your own creative vision. Experimentation is 
part of the fun of photography, after all — and thanks to your camera 
monitor and the Erase button, it’s an easy, completely free proposition.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Recapping Basic Picture Settings
Your subject, creative goals, and lighting conditions determine which set-
tings you should use for some picture-taking options, such as aperture and 
shutter speed. I offer my take on those options throughout this chapter. But 
for a few basic options, I recommend the same settings for almost every 
shooting scenario. Table 7-1 lists these options as well as how you access 
them. Figure 7-1 offers a reminder of where to find the buttons that are refer-
enced in the table. (The ISO button isn’t fully visible in this shot; the button’s 
on top of the camera, right behind the Main dial.)

Figure 7-1: You can access several critical settings with a press 
 
of a single button.
Other chapters detail all these settings, but here’s a quick reminder of how 
each one affects your image:
 
✓ Quality: This setting, introduced in Chapter 3, determines the file format 
and resolution of picture files the camera creates. For best quality and 
the largest possible print size, choose Large/Fine or Raw (CR2). Keep 
in mind that you must process Raw files in a raw converter; Chapter 8 
explains that issue. For everyday images that you don’t plan to print 
large or crop, Medium/Fine is also a good choice and creates smaller 
files than the other two settings.

193
 Chapter 7: Putting It All Together
 
✓ White Balance: White balance compensates for the color casts pro-
duced by different light sources. Auto White Balance (AWB) mode usu-
ally does the trick unless you’re dealing with multiple light sources; 
in that case, you may need to switch to manual White Balance con-
trol. Chapter 6 tells you how. You can control this setting only in the 
advanced exposure modes.
 
 
✓ ISO: This setting determines the light sensitivity of the camera’s image 
sensor. Increasing the ISO value can create noise defects, so stick with 
the lowest setting possible given the available light. You can’t select 
ISO in the fully automatic exposure modes; the camera sets the value 
between 100 and 800 for you. Chapter 5 details ISO.
 
✓ AF (autofocus) mode: Chapter 6 details this option, which affects the 
autofocus system. In the AI Focus mode, the camera chooses the best 
autofocus mode based on whether it thinks you’re shooting a still or 
moving subject. (The AI stands for artificial intelligence.) In most cases, 
this setting works well. You can control this option only in P, Tv, Av, and 
M exposure modes.
 
✓ Drive mode: This setting enables you to shift from Single mode, in 
which you record one image each time you press the shutter button, to 
Continuous mode, in which the camera continues to capture images as 
long as you hold down the shutter button.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
 Single mode is the best choice in most cases, but Continuous can come 
in handy for action shots, as covered later in this chapter. But you can 
select Continuous or Single only in the advanced exposure modes. 
In the fully automatic modes, the camera chooses for you. Note that 
your camera also offers three other settings that permit self-timer 
and remote-control shooting; see Chapter 2 for details on all the Drive 
modes.
 
 
✓ AF Point Selection: This control enables you to choose from two autofo-
cusing setups when you shoot in the P, Tv, Av, or M exposure mode. In 
Automatic AF Point Selection mode, all seven of the camera’s autofocus 
points are active, and the camera typically locks focus on the point that 
covers the nearest object or person. In Manual AF Point Selection mode, 
you can specify which of the autofocus points you want the camera to 
use when establishing focus. The camera always uses the automatic 
option when you shoot in the fully automatic exposure modes or A-DEP 
mode.
 
✓ Metering mode: This option determines what part of the frame the 
camera analyzes when calculating exposure. Evaluative metering takes 
the whole frame into account, which produces good results for most 
scenes. See Chapter 5 for the scoop on the other options, Partial and 
Center-Weighted Average metering, which are selectable only when you 
shoot in the advanced exposure modes. All fully automatic modes use 
Evaluative metering. 
 
✓ Picture Style: When you shoot in the advanced exposure modes, you 
can manipulate color, saturation, sharpness, and contrast by select-
ing from one of six preset Picture Style settings or by defining your 
own custom style. In the fully automatic modes, the camera selects the 
Picture Style for you based on which mode you’re using. For example, 
in Portrait exposure mode, the camera selects the Portrait Picture Style 
setting. See Chapter 6 for a review of all the Picture Style controls.
 
✓ Live View: Enabling Live View shooting, in which you use the moni-
tor as a viewfinder, results in the loss of control over some important 
photography options, including Metering mode, Drive mode, AF mode, 
and Flash Exposure Lock (FE Lock). For this reason, along with some 
other caveats that you can explore at the end of Chapter 4, I suggest that 
you disable Live View for most shots. The exception is the scenario for 
which Live View is really intended: still-life photography in which you 
can use a tripod or otherwise stabilize the camera. In any case, you can 
use Live View only in the advanced exposure modes.

 Chapter 7: Putting It All Together
Setting Up for Specific Scenes
For the most part, the settings detailed in the preceding section fall into the 
“set ’em and forget ’em” category. That leaves you free to concentrate on a 
handful of other camera options, such as aperture and shutter speed, that 
you can manipulate to achieve a specific photographic goal.
The next four sections explain which of these additional options typically pro-
duce the best results when you’re shooting portraits, action shots, landscapes, 
and close-ups. I offer a few compositional and creative tips along the way — 
but again, remember that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and for every so-
called rule, there are plenty of great images that prove the exception.
Shooting still portraits
By “still portrait,” I mean that your subject isn’t moving. For subjects who 
aren’t keen on sitting still long enough to have their picture taken — children, 
pets, and even some teenagers I know — skip ahead to the next section and 
use the techniques given for action photography instead.
Assuming that you do have a subject willing to pose, the classic portraiture 
approach is to keep the subject sharply focused while throwing the back-
ground into soft focus, as shown in the examples in this section. This artistic 
choice emphasizes the subject and helps diminish the impact of any distract-
ing background objects in cases where you can’t control the setting. The fol-
lowing steps show you how to achieve this look: 
 
1. Set the Mode dial to Av (aperture-priority auto exposure) and then 
select the lowest f-stop value possible.
 
 As Chapter 5 explains, a low f-stop number opens the aperture, which 
shortens depth of field, or the range of sharp focus. So dialing in a low 
f-stop value is the first step in softening your portrait background. (The 
f-stop range available to you depends on your lens.) Also keep in mind 
that the farther your subject is from the background, the more back-
ground blurring you can achieve.
 
 I recommend aperture-priority autoexposure when depth of field is a 
primary concern because you can control the f-stop while relying on the 
camera to select the shutter speed that will properly expose the image. 
Just rotate the Main dial to select your desired f-stop. But if you aren’t 
comfortable with this advanced exposure mode, Portrait mode also 
results in a more open aperture, although the exact f-stop setting is out 
of your control. Chapter 2 details Portrait mode.

196
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
 Whichever mode you choose, you can monitor the current aperture and 
shutter speed both in the Shooting Settings display, as shown on the left 
in Figure 7-2, and in the viewfinder display, as shown on the right.

2. To further soften the background, zoom in, get closer, or both. 
 
 As covered in Chapter 6, zooming in to a longer focal length also reduces 
depth of field, as does moving physically closer to your subject.
 
 Avoid using a lens with a short focal length (a wide-angle lens) for por-
traits. They can cause features to appear distorted — sort of like how 
people look when you view them through a security peephole in a door.
 
3. For indoor portraits, shoot flash-free if possible.
 
 Shooting by available light rather than flash produces softer illumina-
tion and avoids the problem of red-eye. To get enough light to go flash-
free, turn on room lights or, during daylight, pose your subject next to a 
sunny window.
 
 In the Av exposure mode, simply keeping the built-in flash unit closed dis-
ables the flash. In Portrait mode, unfortunately, you can’t disable the flash 
if the camera thinks more light is needed. Your only option is to change 
the exposure mode to No Flash, in which case the camera may or may not 
choose an aperture setting that throws the background into soft focus.
 
 If flash is unavoidable, see my list of flash tips at the end of the steps to 
get better results.
 
4. For outdoor portraits, use a flash.

197
 Chapter 7: Putting It All Together
 
 Even in bright daylight, a flash adds a beneficial pop of light to subjects’ 
faces, as discussed in Chapter 5 and illustrated here in Figure 7-3.
No flash
With flash
Figure 7-3: To properly illuminate the face in outdoor portraits, use fill flash.
 
 Unfortunately, the camera doesn’t let you use flash in Portrait mode if 
the light is very bright. In the Av exposure mode, just press the Flash 
button on the side of the camera to enable the flash.
 
 Remember that in dim lighting, the camera may select a shutter speed 
as slow as 1/30 second when you enable flash in Av mode, so keep an 
eye on that value and use a tripod if necessary to avoid blurring from 
camera shake. On the flip side of the coin, the fastest shutter speed you 
can use with the built-in flash is 1/200 second, and in extremely bright 
conditions, that may be too slow to avoid overexposing the image. If 
necessary, move your subject into the shade.
 
5. Press and hold the shutter button halfway to engage exposure meter-
ing and, in autofocus mode, to lock in focus.
 
 Make sure that an active autofocus point falls over your subject. (In the 
viewfinder, active autofocus points turn red.) For best results, try to set 
focus on your subject’s eyes.
 
 Chapter 6 explains more about using autofocus, but if you have trouble, 
simply set your lens to manual focus mode and then twist the focusing 
ring to set focus.
 
6. Press the shutter button the rest of the way to capture the image.

198
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Again, these steps just give you a starting point for taking better portraits. A 
few other tips can also improve your people pics:
 
✓ Before pressing the shutter button, do a quick background check. 
Scan the entire frame looking for intrusive objects that may distract the 
eye from the subject. If necessary, reposition the subject against a more 
flattering backdrop if possible. Inside, a softly textured wall works well; 
outdoors, trees and shrubs can provide nice backdrops as long as they 
aren’t so ornate or colorful that they diminish the subject (for example, 
a magnolia tree laden with blooms).
 
✓ Frame the subject loosely to allow for later cropping to a variety of 
frame sizes. Your camera produces images that have an aspect ratio of 
3:2. That means that your portrait perfectly fits a 4-x-6-inch print size but 
will require cropping to print at any other proportions, such as 5 x 7 or 
8 x 10. Chapter 9 talks more about this issue.
 
✓ Pay attention to white balance if your subject is lit by both flash 
and ambient light. If you set the White Balance control to automatic 
(AWB), as I recommend in Table 7-1, enabling flash tells the camera to 
warm colors to compensate for the cool light of a flash. If your subject 
is also lit by room lights or daylight, the result may be colors that are 
slightly warmer than neutral. This warming effect typically looks nice in 
portraits, giving the skin a subtle glow. But if you aren’t happy with the 
result or want even more warming, see Chapter 6 to find out how to fine-
tune white balance. Again, you can make this adjustment only in P, Tv, 
Av, M, or A-DEP exposure mode.
 
✓ When flash is unavoidable, try these tricks to produce better results. 
The following techniques can help solve flash-related issues:
 
• Indoors, turn on as many room lights as possible. With more ambient 
light, you reduce the flash power that’s needed to expose the pic-
ture. This step also causes the pupils to constrict, further reducing 
the chances of red-eye. (Pay heed to my white balance warning, 
however.)
 
• Try setting the flash to Red-Eye Reduction mode for nighttime and 
indoor portraits. Warn your subject to expect both a light coming 
from the Red-Eye Reduction lamp, which constricts pupils, and the 
actual flash. See Chapter 2 for details about using this flash mode, 
which you enable through Shooting Menu 1.
 
• For nighttime pictures, try Night Portrait mode. In this autoexposure 
mode, the camera automatically selects a slower shutter speed 
than normal. This enables the camera to soak up more ambient 
light, producing a brighter background and reducing the flash 
power that’s needed to light the subject. A slow shutter, however, 
means that you need to use a tripod to avoid camera shake, which 
can blur the photo. You also need to warn your subjects to remain 
very still during the exposure.

199
 Chapter 7: Putting It All Together
 
• Soften the flash light by attaching a diffuser to the flash head. This 
inexpensive tool both softens and spreads the light. You can see a 
picture of one type of diffuser in Chapter 5. You may need to bump 
up exposure slightly to compensate for the light filtering that 
occurs; the camera doesn’t know that you attached the diffuser 
and so doesn’t adjust the exposure on its own. In the P, Tv, Av, 
or A-DEP autoexposure modes, you can use exposure compensa-
tion to adjust the image brightness or, as an alternative, you can 
increase the flash power slightly. Again, Chapter 5 has details on 
these exposure features.
 
• For professional results, use an external flash with a rotating flash 
head. Then aim the flash head upward so that the flash light 
bounces off the ceiling and falls softly down onto the subject. 
An external flash isn’t cheap, but the results make the purchase 
worthwhile if you shoot lots of portraits. Compare the two por-
traits in Figure 7-4 for an illustration. In the first example, the 
built-in flash resulted in strong shadowing behind the subject and 
harsh, concentrated light. To produce the better result on the 
right, I used the Canon Speedlite 580EX II and bounced the light off 
the ceiling.
 
Direct flash
Bounce flash
 
Figure 7-4: To eliminate harsh lighting and strong shadows (left), I used bounce 
 
flash and moved the subject farther from the background (right).

200
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
• To reduce shadowing from the flash, move your subject farther 
from the background. I took this extra step for the right image in 
Figure 7-4. The increased distance not only reduced shadowing 
but also softened the focus of the wall a bit (because of the short 
depth of field resulting from my f-stop and focal length).
 
 A good general rule is to position your subjects far enough from 
the background that they can’t touch it. If that isn’t possible, 
though, try going the other direction: If the person’s head is smack 
up against the background, any shadow will be smaller and less 
noticeable. For example, you get less shadowing when a subject’s 
head is resting against a sofa cushion than if that person is sitting 
upright, with the head a foot or so away from the cushion.
 
• Study the flash information in Chapter 5 and practice before you need 
to take important portraits. How the camera calculates the aperture, 
shutter speed, and flash power needed to expose your subject and 
background varies depending on the exposure mode you use. So 
to fully understand how to get the flash results you want, it pays 
to experiment with each of the advanced exposure modes, all cov-
ered in Chapter 5.
 
 For the maximum control over aperture, shutter speed, and flash 
power, try working in manual exposure mode and make friends 
with the Flash Exposure Compensation and FE Lock (flash expo-
sure lock) features.
Capturing action
A fast shutter speed is the key to capturing a blur-free shot of any moving 
subject, whether it’s a spinning Ferris wheel, a butterfly flitting from flower 
to flower, or in the case of Figures 7-5 and 7-6, a hockey-playing teen. In the 
first image, a shutter speed of 1/125 second was too slow to catch the sub-
ject without blur. For this subject, who was moving at a fairly rapid speed, 
I needed to bump the shutter speed all the way up to 1/1000 second to freeze 
the action cleanly, as shown in Figure 7-6.
Along with the basic capture settings outlined in Table 7-1, I use the tech-
niques in the following steps to photograph a subject in motion:
 
1. Set the Mode dial to Tv (shutter-priority autoexposure).
 
 In this mode, you control the shutter speed, and the camera takes care 
of choosing an aperture setting that will produce a good exposure. 
 
 If you aren’t ready to step up to this advanced autoexposure mode, 
explained in Chapter 5, try using Sports mode, detailed in Chapter 2. But 
be aware that you have no control over any other aspects of your pic-
ture (such as white balance, flash, and so on) in that mode.

Figure 7-6: Raising the shutter speed to 1/1000 second “froze” the action.

202
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
2. Rotate the Main dial to select 
the shutter speed.
 
 In the Shooting Settings dis-
play, the option that appears 
in purple, with the little arrow 
pointers at each side, is the 
one that you can adjust with 
the Main dial. In Tv mode, the 
shutter speed is the active 
option, as shown in Figure 7-7. 
After you select the shutter 
speed, the camera selects the 
aperture (f-stop) necessary to 
produce a good exposure.
 
 What shutter speed you need 
depends on how fast your 
subject is moving, so some 
experimentation is needed. But generally speaking, 1/500 second should 
be plenty for all but the fastest subjects — speeding hockey players like 
my subject, race cars, boats, and so on. For slower subjects, you can 
even go as low as 1/250 or 1/125 second.
 
 If the aperture value blinks after you set the shutter speed, the camera 
can’t select an f-stop that will properly expose the photo at that shutter 
speed. See Chapter 5 for more details about how the camera notifies you 
of potential exposure problems.
 
3. Raise the ISO setting or add flash to produce a brighter exposure if 
needed.
 
 In dim lighting, you may not be able to get a good exposure at your 
chosen shutter speed without taking this step. Raising the ISO does 
increase the possibility of noise, but a noisy shot is better than a blurry 
shot. The current ISO setting appears just below the f-stop value in the 
Shooting Settings display, as shown in Figure 7-7.
 
 Note that in Sports mode, the camera automatically overrides your ISO 
setting if it deems necessary, but it can go only as high as ISO 800. For 
more on all of these ISO issues, see Chapter 5.
 
 Adding flash is a bit tricky for action shots, unfortunately. First, the flash 
needs time to recycle between shots, so try to go without if you want 
to capture images at a fast pace. Second, the built-in flash has limited 
range — so don’t waste your time if your subject isn’t close by. And third, 
remember that the fastest possible shutter speed when you enable the 
built-in flash is 1/200 second, which may not be fast enough to capture a 
quickly moving subject without blur. For more on this issue, check out 
Chapter 5.
 
 If you do decide to use flash, you must bail out of Sports mode, though; 
it doesn’t permit you to use flash.

Figure 7-7: Changing the Drive mode to 
Continuous allows rapid-fire shooting.

 Chapter 7: Putting It All Together
 
 
4. For rapid-fire shooting, set the Drive mode to Continuous.
 
 In this mode, you can take as many as three pictures per second. The 
camera continues to record images as long as the shutter button is 
pressed. You can switch the Drive mode by pressing the left cross key; 
the icon representing the current mode appears in the Shooting Settings 
display, as labeled in Figure 7-7. Chapter 2 explains more about all the 
Drive mode options.
 
5. For fastest shooting, switch to manual focusing.
 
 You then eliminate the time the camera needs to lock focus in autofocus 
mode. Chapter 1 shows you how to focus manually, if you need help.
 
 If you do use autofocus, try these two autofocus settings for best 
performance:
 
 
• Set the AF Point Selection mode to Automatic. Press the button 
shown in the margin here to adjust this setting.
 
• Set the AF (autofocus) mode to AI Servo (continuous-servo auto-
focus). Press the right cross key to access this setting.
 
 Chapter 6 details these autofocus options.
 
6. Turn off automatic image review to speed up the camera even more.
 
 You do this via the Review Time option on Shooting Menu 1. Turning 
the option off can help speed up the time your camera needs to recover 
between shots.
 
7. Compose the subject to allow for movement across the frame.
 
 You can always crop the photo later to a tighter composition. (I did 
so for my example images, which originally contained quite a bit more 
background than you see in the book.) Chapter 10 shows you how to 
crop pictures.
 
8. Lock in autofocus (if used) in advance.
 
 Press the shutter button halfway to do so. Now when the action occurs, 
just press the shutter button the rest of the way. Your image-capture 
time is faster because the camera has already done the work of estab-
lishing focus. Remember that in AI Servo mode, you must keep the sub-
ject under the active autofocus point (or points) in order for the camera 
to maintain focus. Again, Chapter 6 details this feature.
 
Using these techniques should give you a better chance of capturing any fast-
moving subject. But action-shooting strategies also are helpful for shooting 
candid portraits of kids and pets. Even if they aren’t currently running, leap-
ing, or otherwise cavorting, snapping a shot before they do move or change 
positions is often tough. So if an interaction or scene catches your eye, set 
your camera into action mode and then just fire off a series of shots as fast as 
you can.

204
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Capturing scenic vistas
Providing specific capture settings for landscape photography is tricky 
because there’s no single best approach to capturing a beautiful stretch of 
countryside, a city skyline, or other vast subject. Take depth of field, for 
example: One person’s idea of a super cityscape might be to keep all build-
ings in the scene sharply focused. But another photographer might prefer to 
shoot the same scene so that a foreground building is sharply focused while 
the others are less so, thus drawing the eye to that first building.
That said, I can offer a few tips to help you photograph a landscape the way 
you see it:
 
✓ Shoot in aperture-priority autoexpo-
sure mode (Av) so that you can control 
depth of field. If you want extreme 
depth of field, so that both near and 
distant objects are sharply focused, as 
in Figure 7-8, select a high f-stop value. I 
used an aperture of f/16 for this shot.
 
 You can also use the Landscape autoex-
posure mode to achieve a large depth 
of field. In this mode, the camera auto-
matically selects a high f-stop number, 
but you have no control over the exact 
value (or any other picture-taking set-
tings.) Of course, if the light is dim, 
the camera may be forced to open 
the aperture, reducing depth of field, 
to properly expose the image. (Don’t 
confuse Landscape autoexposure mode 
with the Landscape Picture Style; the 
Landscape mode you want is the one 
you select from the Mode dial on top 
of the camera. See Chapter 6 for more 
details about Picture Styles.)
 
✓ If the exposure requires a slow shutter, use a tripod to avoid blurring. 
The downside to a high f-stop is that you need a slower shutter speed 
to produce a good exposure. If the shutter speed drops below what you 
can comfortably hand-hold — for me, that’s about 1/50 second — use a 
tripod to avoid picture-blurring camera shake. No tripod handy? Look 
for any solid surface on which you can steady the camera. You can 
always increase the ISO setting to increase light sensitivity, which in 
turn allows a faster shutter speed, too, but that option brings with it the 
chances of increased image noise. See Chapter 5 for details. Also see 
Chapter 1 for details about image stabilization, which can help you get 
sharper handheld shots at slow shutter speeds.

Landscape mode) to keep foreground

 Chapter 7: Putting It All Together
 
✓ For dramatic waterfall and fountain 
shots, consider using a slow shutter 
to create that “misty” look. The slow 
shutter blurs the water, giving it a 
soft, romantic appearance. Figure 7-9 
shows you a close-up of this effect. 
Again, use a tripod to ensure that the 
rest of the scene doesn’t also blur 
due to camera shake.
 
✓ At sunrise or sunset, base exposure 
on the sky. The foreground will be 
dark, but you can usually brighten 
it in a photo editor if needed. If you 
base exposure on the foreground, on 
the other hand, the sky will become 
so bright that all the color will be 
washed out — a problem you usually 
can’t fix after the fact.
 
 This tip doesn’t apply, of course, if 
your sunrise or sunset is merely serv-
ing as a gorgeous backdrop for a por-
trait. In that case, you should enable 
your flash and expose for the subject.
 
✓ For cool nighttime city pics, experiment with slow shutter. Assuming 
that cars or other vehicles are moving through the scene, the result is 
neon trails of light like those you see in the foreground of the image in 
Figure 7-10, taken by my friend Jonathan Conrad. Shutter speed for this 
image was 8 seconds.

Figure 7-9: For misty waterfalls, use a 
slow shutter speed (and tripod).

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
 Instead of changing the shutter speed manually between each shot, try 
setting the speed to Bulb. Available only in M (manual) exposure mode, 
this option records an image for as long as you hold down the shutter 
button. So just take a series of images, holding the button down for dif-
ferent lengths of time for each shot. In Bulb mode, you also can exceed 
the minimum (slowest) shutter speed of 30 seconds. Note that in Bulb 
mode, the camera displays the elapsed capture time on the monitor.
 
 Because long exposures can produce image noise, you also may want 
to enable the Long Exposure Noise Reduction feature. You access this 
option via the Custom Function option on Setup Menu 3; select Custom 
Function 3 and change the setting from Off to Auto or On. Chapter 5 dis-
cusses this option in more detail.
 
✓ For the best lighting, shoot during the “magic hours.” That’s the term 
photographers use for early morning and late afternoon, when the light 
cast by the sun is soft and warm, giving everything that beautiful, gently 
warmed look.
 
 Can’t wait for the perfect light? Tweak your camera’s White Balance 
setting, using the instructions laid out in Chapter 6, to simulate magic-
hour light.
 
✓ In tricky light, bracket shots. Bracketing simply means to take the same 
picture at several different exposures to increase the odds that at least 
one of them will capture the scene the way you envision. Bracketing is 
especially a good idea in difficult lighting situations such as sunrise and 
sunset.
 
 Your camera offers automatic exposure bracketing when you shoot in 
the advanced exposure modes. See Chapter 5 to find out how to take 
advantage of this feature.
Capturing dynamic close-ups
For great close-up shots, start with the basic capture settings outlined in 
Table 7-1. Then try the following additional settings and techniques:
 
✓ Check your owner’s manual to find out the minimum close-focusing 
distance of your lens. How “up close and personal” you can get to your 
subject depends on your lens, not the camera body itself. 
 
✓ Take control over depth of field by setting the camera mode to Av 
(aperture-priority autoexposure) mode. Whether you want a shallow, 
medium, or extreme depth of field depends on the point of your photo. 
For the romantic scene shown in Figure 7-11, for example, I wanted to 
blur the background to help the subjects stand out more, so I set the 
aperture to f/5.6. But if you want the viewer to be able to clearly see all 
details throughout the frame — for example, if you’re shooting a prod-
uct shot for your company’s sales catalog — you need to go the other 
direction, stopping down the aperture as far as possible.

207
 Chapter 7: Putting It All Together
 
 Not ready for the advanced expo-
sure modes yet? Try the Close-Up 
scene mode instead. (It’s the one 
marked with the little flower on 
your Mode dial.) In this mode, the 
camera automatically opens the 
aperture to achieve a short depth of 
field and bases focus on the center 
of the frame.
 
✓ Remember that zooming in and 
getting close to your subject both 
decrease depth of field. So back to 
that product shot: If you need depth 
of field beyond what you can achieve 
with the aperture setting, you may 
need to back away, zoom out, or 
both. (You can always crop your 
image to show just the parts of the 
subject that you want to feature.)
 
✓ When shooting flowers and other 
nature scenes outdoors, pay atten-
tion to shutter speed, too. Even a 
slight breeze may cause your sub-
ject to move, causing blurring at slow 
shutter speeds. (Chapter 5 offers some examples that illustrate this issue.)
 
✓ Use fill flash for better outdoor lighting. Just as with portraits, a tiny 
bit of flash typically improves close-ups when the sun is your primary 
light source. You may need to reduce the flash output slightly, via the 
camera’s Flash Exposure Compensation control. Chapter 5 offers details 
about using flash.
 
 Also keep in mind that the maximum shutter speed possible when you 
use flash is 1/200 second. So in very bright light, you may need to use a 
high f-stop setting to avoid overexposing the picture. You also can lower 
the ISO speed setting, if it’s not already all the way down to ISO 100.
 
✓ When shooting indoors, try not to use flash as your primary light source. 
Because you’ll be shooting at close range, the light from your flash may 
be too harsh even at a low Flash Exposure Compensation setting. If flash 
is inevitable, turn on as many room lights as possible to reduce the flash 
power that’s needed — even a hardware-store shop light can do in a pinch 
as a lighting source. (Remember that if you have multiple light sources, 
though, you may need to tweak the white balance setting.)
 
✓ To really get close to your subject, invest in a macro lens or a set of 
diopters. A true macro lens, which enables you to get really, really close 
to your subjects, is an expensive proposition; expect to pay around $200 
or more. But if you enjoy capturing the tiny details in life, it’s worth the 
investment. 
Figure 7-11: Shallow depth of field helps 
set the subject apart from the similarly 
colored background.

208
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
 For a less expensive way to go, you can spend about $40 for a set of 
diopters, which are sort of like reading glasses that you screw onto your 
existing lens. Diopters come in several strengths — +1, +2, +4, and so 
on — with a higher number indicating a greater magnifying power. I took 
this approach to capture the rose in Figure 7-12. The left image shows you 
the closest I could get to the subject with my regular lens; to produce the 
right image, I attached a +6 diopter. The downfall of diopters, sadly, is that 
they typically produce images that are very soft around the edges, as in 
Figure 7-12 — a problem that doesn’t occur with a good macro lens.
 
No diopter

Figure 7-12: To extend your lens’ close-focus ability, you can add magnifying diopters.
Coping with Special Situations
A few subjects and shooting situations pose some additional challenges not 
already covered in earlier sections. So to wrap up this chapter, here’s a quick 
list of ideas for tackling a variety of common “tough-shot” photos:
 
✓ Shooting through glass: To capture subjects that are behind glass, try 
putting your lens flat against the glass. Then switch to manual focusing; 
the glass barrier can give the autofocus mechanism fits. Disable your flash 
to avoid creating any unwanted reflections, too. I used this technique to 
capture the image of the turtle sticking his neck out in Figure 7-13.
 
✓ Shooting out a car window: Set the camera to shutter-priority autoexpo-
sure or manual mode and dial in a fast shutter speed to compensate for 
the movement of the car. Oh, and keep a tight grip on your camera. 

209
 Chapter 7: Putting It All Together
 
✓ Shooting in strong backlight-
ing: When the light behind your 
subject is very strong and illu-
minating the subject with flash 
isn’t an option, you can expose 
the image with the subject in 
mind, in which case the back-
ground may be overexposed.
 
 As an alternative, you can 
expose for the background and 
purposely underexpose the sub-
ject to create a silhouette effect. 
I opted for this technique when 
capturing the image in Figure 
7-14, which shows a young 
friend standing mesmerized in 
front of an aquarium. Be sure to 
disable your flash when trying to shoot silhouettes.
 
 
Figure 7-14: Experiment with shooting backlit subjects in silhouette.
 
✓ Shooting fireworks: First off, use a tripod; fireworks require a long expo-
sure, and trying to handhold your camera simply isn’t going to work. 
If using a zoom lens, zoom out to the shortest focal length. Switch to 
manual focusing and set focus at infinity (the farthest focus point possi-
ble on your lens). Set the exposure mode to manual, choose a relatively 
high f-stop setting — say, f/16 or so — and start a shutter speed of 1 to 3 
seconds. From there, it’s simply a matter of experimenting with different 
shutter speeds.
Figure 7-13: To shoot through glass, place your 
lens flat against the glass.

210
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
  
 Be especially gentle when you press the shutter button — with a very 
slow shutter, you can easily create enough camera movement to blur 
the image. If you purchased the accessory remote control for your 
camera, this is a good situation in which to use it.
 
 You also may want to enable your camera’s Long Exposure Noise 
Reduction feature because a long exposure also increases the chances 
of noise defects. See Chapter 5 for details. (Keep the ISO setting low to 
further dampen noise.)
 
✓ Shooting reflective surfaces: In outdoor shots taken in bright sun, 
you can reduce glare from reflective surfaces such as glass and metal 
by using a circular polarizing filter, which you can buy for about $60. A 
polarizing filter can also help out when you’re shooting through glass.
 
 But know that in order for the filter to work, the sun, your subject, and 
your camera lens must be precisely positioned. Your lens must be at a 
certain angle from the sun, for example, and the light source must also 
reflect off the surface at a certain angle and direction. In addition, a 
polarizing filter also intensifies blue skies in some scenarios, which may 
or may not be to your liking. In other words, a polarizing filter isn’t a 
surefire cure-all.
 
 A more reliable option for shooting small reflective objects is to invest 
in a light cube or light tent such as the ones shown in Figure 7-15, from 
Cloud Dome (www.clouddome.com) and Lastolite (www.lastolite.com), 
respectively. You place the reflective object inside the tent or cube and 
then position your lights around the outside. The cube or tent acts as a 
light diffuser, reducing reflections. Prices range from about $50 to $200, 
depending on size and features.

ou’ve got a memory card full of pictures. 
Now what? Now you turn to the ﬁ rst chapter 
in this part, which explains how to get those pic-
tures out of your camera and onto your computer 
and, just as important, how to safeguard them 
from future digital destruction. After downloading

Downloading, Organizing, and 
Archiving Your Photos
In This Chapter
▶ Transferring pictures to your computer
▶ Using the free Canon software to download and organize photos
▶ Looking at other photo-management and editing programs
▶ Processing Raw (CR2) files
▶ Keeping your picture files safe from harm
F
or many novice digital photographers (and even some experienced 
ones), the task of moving pictures to the computer and then 
keeping track of all of those image files is one of the more 
confusing aspects of the art form. In fact, students in my 
classes have more questions about this subject than just 
about anything else.
Frankly, writing about the download and organizing 
process isn’t all that easy, either. (I know, poor me!) 
The problem is that providing you with detailed 
instructions is pretty much impossible because the 
steps you need to take vary widely depending on 
what software you have installed on your computer 
and whether you use the Windows or Macintosh 
operating system.
To give you as much help as possible, however, this 
chapter shows you how to transfer and organize pictures 
using the free software that came in your camera box. After 
exploring these discussions, you should be able to adapt the steps to 
any other photo program you may prefer.

214
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
This chapter also covers a few other aspects of handling your picture files, 
including converting pictures taken in the Raw format to a standard image 
format. Finally — and perhaps most important — this chapter explains how 
to ensure that your digital images stay safe after they leave the camera.
Sending Pictures to the Computer
You can take two approaches to moving pictures from your camera memory 
card to your computer:
 
✓ Connect the camera directly to 
the computer. For this option, 
you need to dig out the USB cable 
that came in your camera box. 
(The camera manual refers to 
the cable as the interface cable.) 
Your computer must also have 
a free USB slot, or port, in techie 
talk. If you aren’t sure what these 
gadgets look like, Figure 8-1 gives 
you a look.
 
 The little three-pronged icon you 
see on the plug and to the left of 
the two ports in Figure 8-1 is the 
universal symbol for USB. Be sure 
to check for this symbol because 
a different type of slot, called a 
FireWire slot, looks very similar to a USB slot, and your USB cable can 
even seem to fit (sort of) into a FireWire slot.
 
✓ Transfer images using a memory card reader. Many computers now 
also have built-in memory card readers. If yours has one that accepts 
a Secure Digital (SD) card, you can simply pop the card out of your 
camera and into the card reader instead of hooking the camera up to the 
computer. Note that if you’re using the new SDHC (high capacity) cards, 
the reader must specifically support that type.
 
 As another option, you can buy stand-alone card readers such as the 
SanDisk model shown in Figure 8-2. This particular model accepts a vari-
ety of memory cards. Check your photo printer, too; many printers now 
have card readers that accept the most popular types of cards.
 
I prefer to use a card reader, for three reasons: First, when you transfer via the 
camera, the camera must be turned on during the process, wasting battery 
power. Second, with a card reader, I don’t have to keep track of that elusive 
camera cable. And third, when I copy photos to my desktop system, transfer-
ring via the camera requires that I get down on all fours to plug the cable into 
USB symbol
Figure 8-1: You can connect the camera to 
the computer using the supplied USB cable.

215
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Photos
the computer’s USB slot, which 
is of course located in the least 
convenient spot possible. The card 
reader, by contrast, stays perched 
on my desk, connected to my com-
puter at all times, so there’s very 
little physical activity involved in 
transferring pictures, which is how 
I prefer to live my life.
If you want to transfer directly 
from the camera, however, the 
next section explains some impor-
tant steps you need to take to 
make that option work. If you 
choose to use a card reader, skip 
ahead to the section “Starting the 
transfer process” to get an over-
view of what happens after you 
insert the card into the reader.
Connecting camera 
and computer
 
You need to follow a specific set of steps when connecting the camera to 
your computer. Otherwise, you can damage the camera or the memory card.
Also note that in order for the process to work smoothly, Canon suggests 
that your computer be running one of the following operating systems:
 
✓ Windows Vista
 
✓ Windows XP with Service Pack 2
 
✓ Windows 2000 with Service Pack 4 or later
 
✓ Mac OS X 10.3 and higher
If you use another OS (operating system, in case you’re a non-geek), check 
the support pages on the Canon Web site (www.canon.com) for the latest 
news about any updates to system compatibility. You can always simply 
transfer images with a card reader, too.
With that preamble out of the way, the next steps show you how to get your 
camera to talk to your computer:

method of image transfer.

216
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
1. Assess the level of the camera battery.
 
 Just look at the little battery-status indicator at the bottom of the Shooting 
Settings display. If the battery is low, charge it before continuing. Running 
out of battery power during the transfer process can cause problems, 
including lost picture data. Alternatively, if you purchased the optional AC 
adapter, use that to power the camera during picture transfers.
 
2. Turn on the computer and give it 
time to finish its normal startup 
routine.
 
3. Turn off the camera.
 
4. Insert the smaller of the two plugs 
on the USB cable into the USB port 
on the side of the camera.
 
 The slot is hidden under a little 
rubber door just around the corner 
from the buttons that flank the left 
side of the monitor, as shown in 
Figure 8-3. Gently pry open the little 
door and insert the cable end into 
the slot.
 
5. Plug the other end of the cable into 
the computer’s USB port.
 
 Be sure to plug the cable into a port 
that’s actually built into the com-
puter, as opposed to one that’s on 
your keyboard or part of an external 
USB hub. Those accessory-type con-
nections can sometimes foul up the 
transfer process.
 
6. Turn on the camera.
 
 The Shooting Settings screen appears briefly on the camera monitor, 
displaying a “Busy” message. Then the monitor goes black, and the card 
access lamp (just to the right of the Erase button) begins flickering, let-
ting you know that the camera is communicating with the computer. 
After a few moments (or minutes, depending on the speed of your com-
puter), the Direct Transfer screen appears on the camera monitor, as 
shown in Figure 8-4, and the Print/Share light, in the center of the WB 
button, glows blue.
 
 For details about the next step in the downloading routine, move on to 
the next section.
USB port
Figure 8-3: The USB port is hidden under 
the little rubber door on the left rear side 
of the camera.

217
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Photos
 
The options you see on the Direct 
Transfer screen relate to a method 
of image downloading that requires 
you to handle everything through 
the camera menus. I don’t cover this 
download technique because I think 
that most people will find the alterna-
tive methods I discuss here easier and 
more user-friendly. Nor do I cover the 
Transfer Order item on the Playback 
menu, which is related to the process. 
However, if you’re curious about 
the Wallpaper option on the Direct 
Transfer screen, turn to Chapter 11, 
which explains it. Your camera manual 
also includes specifics about the other 
download technique.
Starting the transfer process
After you connect the camera to the computer (be sure to carefully follow 
the steps in the preceding section) or insert a memory card into your card 
reader, your next step depends, again, on the software installed on your com-
puter and the computer operating system.
Here are the most common possibilities and how to move forward:
 
✓ On a Windows-based computer, 
a Windows message box like 
the one in Figure 8-5 appears. 
The box suggests different pro-
grams that you can use to down-
load your picture files. Which 
programs appear depend on 
what you have installed on your 
system; if you installed the Canon 
software, for example, one or 
more of those programs should 
appear in the list. To proceed, 
just click the transfer program 
that you want to use and then 
click OK. (The figure features the 
Windows XP Home Edition ver-
sion of the dialog box.)
Figure 8-4: When the camera is ready to 
download images, the Direct Transfer screen 
appears.
Figure 8-5: Windows may display this initial 
boxful of transfer options.

218
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
 If you want to use the same program for all of your transfers, select 
the Always Use This Program for This Action check box, as I did in 
Figure 8-5. The next time you connect your camera or insert a memory 
card, Windows will automatically launch your program of choice instead 
of displaying the message box.
 
✓ An installed photo program automatically displays a photo-download 
wizard. For example, if you installed the Canon software, the EOS Utility 
window or MemoryCard Utility window may leap to the forefront. Or, 
if you installed some other program, such as Photoshop Elements, its 
downloader may pop up instead. On the Mac, the built-in iPhoto soft-
ware may display its auto downloader. (Apple’s Web site, www.apple.
com, offers excellent video tutorials on using iPhoto, by the way.)
 
 Usually, the downloader that appears is associated with the software 
that you most recently installed. Each new program that you add to your 
system tries to wrestle control over your image downloads away from 
the previous program.
 
 If you don’t want a program’s auto downloader to launch whenever you 
insert a memory card or connect your camera, you should be able to 
turn off that feature. Check the software manual to find out how to dis-
able the auto launch.
 
✓ Nothing happens. Don’t panic; assuming that your card reader or 
camera is properly connected, all is probably well. Someone — maybe 
even you — simply may have disabled all the automatic downloaders 
on your system. Just launch your photo software and then transfer your 
pictures using whatever command starts that process. (I show you how 
to do it with the Canon software tools later in the chapter; for other pro-
grams, consult the software manual.)
 
 As another option, you can use Windows Explorer or the Mac Finder to 
simply drag and drop files from your memory card to your computer’s 
hard drive. The process is exactly the same as when you move any other 
file from a CD, DVD, or other storage device onto your hard drive.
As I say in the introduction to this chapter, it’s impossible to give step-by-
step instructions for using all the various photo downloaders that may be 
sprinkled over your hard drive. So in the next sections, I provide details on 
using Canon software to download and organize your files.
If you use some other software, the concepts are the same, but check your 
program manual to get the small details. In most programs, you also can find 
lots of information by simply opening the Help menu.

219
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Photos
Downloading images with Canon tools
The software CD that shipped with your Rebel XS/1000D includes several pro-
grams for transferring, organizing, and editing your photos. For downloading 
images, I suggest that you use the tools discussed in the next two sections.
Before you try the download steps, however, you may want to visit the Canon 
Web site and download the latest versions of the software in the suite. Even if 
you recently bought your camera, the shipping CD may be a little out of date. 
Just go to www.canon.com and follow the links to locate the software for 
your camera. (You can also download updated manuals.)
 
In this book, the steps relate to version 2.4 of the EOS Utility and version 6.1.1 
for ZoomBrowser EX (Windows) and ImageBrowser (Mac). As I write this, 
those versions are the most recent available.
After taking care of the software download and installation chores, see the 
next two sections for details on how to transfer your images.
Safeguarding your digital photo files
To make sure that your digital photos enjoy a long, 
healthy life, follow these storage guidelines:
 ✓ Don’t rely on your computer’s hard drive 
for long-term, archival storage. Hard drives 
occasionally fail, wiping out all files in the 
process. This warning applies to both inter-
nal and external hard drives.
 ✓ Camera memory cards, flash memory 
keys, and other portable storage devices 
are similarly risky. All are easily damaged 
if dropped or otherwise mishandled. And 
being of diminutive stature, these portable 
storage options also are easily lost.
 ✓ The best way to store important files is 
to copy them to nonrewritable CDs. (The 
label should say CD-R, not CD-RW.) Look 
for brand-name CDs that have a gold coat-
ing and are advertised as archival quality, 
which offer a higher level of security than 
other coatings.
 ✓ Recordable DVDs offer the advantage of 
holding lots more data than a CD. However, 
as of today, the industry still hasn’t settled 
on a single, standard DVD format, and the 
archival-level gold coating isn’t available for 
all of those formats. For those reasons, I’m 
not quite as comfortable with DVDs as I am 
with CDs. So I use DVDs only for noncritical 
images; precious family photos go on CDs.
 ✓ Online photo-sharing sites such as 
Shutterfly, Kodak Gallery, and the like aren’t 
designed to be long-term storage tanks for 
your images. Consider them only a backup 
to your backup, and read the site terms 
carefully so that you understand how long 
the site will hold onto your files if you stop 
buying prints and other products.

220
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Using EOS Utility to transfer images from your camera
Follow these steps to transfer images directly from your camera to the com-
puter using the Canon EOS Utility software:
 
1. Connect your camera to the computer.
 
 See the first part of this chapter for specifics.
 
2. Turn on the camera.
 
 After a few moments, the EOS Utility window should appear automati-
cally. If it doesn’t, just launch the program as you would any other on 
your system. Figure 8-6 shows the Windows version of the screen; the 
Mac version looks the same.
 
Figure 8-6: EOS Utility is designed for sending pictures from the 
camera to the computer.
 
3. Click the option named Lets You Select and Download Images.
 
 With this option, you can specify which pictures you want to download 
from the camera. After you click the option, you see a browser window 
that looks similar to the one in Figure 8-7. The figure shows the Windows 
version, but the Mac version contains the same components.
 
 Along the right third of the window, you see thumbnails of the images 
currently on your camera or card. (Click the magnifying glass icons in 
the lower-right corner of the window to enlarge or reduce the thumbnail 
size.)

221
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Photos
 
 
Figure 8-7: Select the thumbnails of the images you want to transfer.
 
4. Select the images that you want to copy to the computer.
 
 Each thumbnail contains a check box in its lower-left corner. To select 
an image for downloading, click the box to put a check mark in it.
 
 For a quick way to select all images, press Ctrl+A (Windows) or Ô+A 
(Mac). Or choose Edit➪Select Image➪Select All.
 
5. Click the Download button at the bottom of the window.
 
 Now you see a screen that tells you where the program wants to store 
your downloaded pictures. Figure 8-8 shows the Windows version of this 
notice; the Mac version contains the same options.
 
 By default, pictures are stored in the My Pictures or Pictures folder in 
Windows (depending on the version of Windows you use) and in the 
Pictures folder on a Mac. You can put your images anywhere you like; 
however, most photo editing programs look first for photos in those 
folders, so sticking with this universally accepted setup makes some 
sense.
 
6. Verify or change the storage location for your pictures.
 
 If you want to put the pictures in a location different from what the 
program suggests, click the Destination Folder button and specify the 
storage location and folder name you prefer. You also can choose to 

222
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
have the picture files renamed when they’re copied; click the File Name 
button to access the renaming options.
 
 
Figure 8-8: You can specify where you want to store the photos.
 
7. Click OK to begin the download.
 
 A progress window appears, showing you the status of the download. As 
the images are downloaded, each one appears for a brief moment in a 
preview window.
 
8. When the download is complete, turn off the camera.
 
 You can then safely remove the cables connecting it to the computer.
That’s the basic process, but I need to share a couple of fine points:
 
✓ Setting download preferences: While the camera is still connected and 
turned on, you can click the Preferences button at the bottom of the 
EOS Utility browser (refer to Figure 8-7) to open a dialog box where you 
can specify many aspects of how the transfer program works. Figure 8-9 
shows the Windows version; Figure 8-10, the Mac version.
 
 In Windows, click the tabs at the top of the Preferences dialog box to 
reveal all your options. (You may need to use the scroll arrows at the 
right side of the tabs to access hidden tabs.) On a Mac, display the vari-
ous panels by choosing them from the drop-down list at the top of the 
dialog box.
 
✓ Auto-launching the other Canon programs: After the download is com-
plete, the EOS Utility may automatically launch Canon Digital Photo 
Professional or ZoomBrowser EX (Windows) or ImageBrowser (Mac) so 
that you can immediately start working with your pictures. (You must 
have installed the programs for this to occur.)

 If you want to change the program that’s launched, visit the Linked 
Software panel of the EOS Utility’s Preferences dialog box. You then can 
select the program that you want to use or choose None to disable auto-
launch altogether.
 
✓ Closing the EOS Utility: The utility browser window doesn’t close auto-
matically after the download is complete. So you must return to it and 
click the Quit button to shut it down. (Refer to Figure 8-7.)
Using MemoryCard Utility for card-to-computer transfers
Transferring images from a memory card reader involves a different Canon 
tool, MemoryCard Utility. This tool is actually a component of ZoomBrowser 
EX (Windows) and ImageBrowser (Mac). To try it out, take these steps:
 
1. Put your card in your card reader.
 
 If all the planets are aligned — meaning that the Canon software was the 
last photo software you installed, and some other program doesn’t try 
to handle the job for you — the MemoryCard Utility window shown in 
Figure 8-11 appears automatically when you put your memory card into 
the card reader. The figure shows the Windows version of the window; 
the Mac version is identical except that the top of the window refers to 
ImageBrowser, which is the Mac version of ZoomBrowser EX.
 
Figure 8-11: The MemoryCard Utility enables you to transfer pictures 
using a card reader.
 
 If the window doesn’t appear, you can access it as follows:
 
• Windows: Open the program called ZoomBrowser EX MemoryCard 
Utility, using the steps you usually take to start a program.

225
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Photos
 
• Mac: Start the program called Canon Camera Window. The 
program should detect your memory card and display the 
MemoryCard Utility window.
 
2. Click Lets You Select and Download Images.
 
 You then see the browser window shown in Figure 8-12. The figure 
shows the Windows version; the Mac version contains the same basic 
components but follows conventional Mac design rules. Either way, 
thumbnails of the images on your memory card are displayed in the 
window.
 
 
Figure 8-12: Select the images that you want to download.
 
3. Select the images that you want to download.
 
 Use these techniques:
 
• To select the first photo, click its thumbnail.
 
• To select additional pictures, Ctrl+click (Windows) or Ô+click 
(Mac) their thumbnails.
 
• To quickly select all images in Windows, choose Select All from 
the Select drop-down list, located on the toolbar near the top of 
the window. On a Mac, the list is called Select Image and is located 
at the bottom of the window. (You also can just press Ctrl+A in 
Windows or Ô+A on a Mac.)

226
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
4. Click the Image Download 
button.
 
 In Windows, the button is 
near the top-left corner of the 
browser window; on a Mac, 
it’s in the bottom-left corner.
 
 Either way, a new window 
appears to show you where 
the downloader wants to put 
your files and the name it 
plans to assign the storage 
folder, as shown in Figure 8-13.
 
 If you’re not happy with the 
program’s choices, click the 
Change Settings button to 
open a dialog box where you 
can select a different storage 
location. In the same dialog 
box, you can also choose 
to have the picture files 
renamed when they’re copied. Click OK to close the Change Settings 
dialog box when you finish.
 
 Most programs look first for photos stored in the location suggested 
initially by the downloader. In Windows, that folder is named either My 
Pictures or Pictures, depending on what version of Windows you use. 
On a Mac, the folder is named Pictures. Sticking with these default stor-
age locations can simplify your life down the road, but of course, you’re 
free to set up whatever image-organization system works best for you.
 
5. Click the Starts Download button.
 
 Your files start making their way to your computer. When the down-
load is finished, the MemoryCard Utility window closes, and either 
ZoomBrowser EX (Windows) or ImageBrowser (Mac) appears, display-
ing your downloaded files. See the next section for details on using that 
program.
Using ZoomBrowser EX/ImageBrowser
In addition to the aforementioned software tools, your Canon CD contains two 
additional programs: ZoomBrowser EX (Windows) or ImageBrowser (Mac), 
plus Digital Photo Professional. In this section, you can find out how to orga-
nize your photos using the ZoomBrowser EX/ImageBrowser tool. Although you 
can view thumbnails of your images in Digital Photo Professional, that tool is 
designed for advanced users, so I don’t cover it in this book.
Figure 8-13: Click the Change Settings button to 
specify a different download folder.

227
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Photos
The next sections give you the most basic of introductions to ZoomBrowser 
EX/ImageBrowser, which, in the interest of saving type, I may refer to from 
here on in as just “the browser.” If you want more details, the CD that ships 
with the program offers a very good online manual.
 
Before you move on, though, I want to clear up one common point of confu-
sion: You can use Canon’s software to download and organize your photos 
and still use any photo editing software you prefer. And to do your editing, 
you don’t need to re-download photos — after you transfer photos to your 
computer, you can access them from any program, just as you can any file 
that you put on your system.
Getting acquainted with the program
Figure 8-14 offers a look at the ZoomBrowser EX window; Figure 8-15, the 
ImageBrowser window. As you can see, the windows contain most of the same 
basic components, although the Mac version of the browser is lacking the row 
of task buttons found in the upper-left corner of the Windows version. The two 
versions also offer a different set of image-viewing modes — Preview Mode and 
List mode on the Mac, and Zoom, Scroll, and Preview modes in Windows.

Figure 8-15: Click a thumbnail to view that image in the main preview area.
Whichever version you use, you can customize the window layout via the 
View menu. The arrangement you see in the figures is the Preview mode 
setup. I prefer this mode because it provides easy access not just to your 
images, but also to details about the camera settings you used to shoot the 
picture. Note that in Windows, you can display and hide the Explore and 
Information panels by clicking the little vertical buttons that border the 
preview area (the “Information panel” label in Figure 8-14 points to one of 
the little guys.) On a Mac, choose View➪View Settings to display a submenu 
where you can toggle the panels on and off.
Here’s a quick guide to viewing your photos in Preview mode:
 
✓ Select the folder you want to view. Click the folder’s icon in the Explore 
panel, found on the left side of the window and labeled in Figures 8-14 
and 8-15. If you click the Favorite Folders tab, you see only the My 
Pictures or Pictures (Windows) or Pictures folder (Mac) along with any 
custom Favorites folders that you create, a topic that you can visit in the 
upcoming section “Organizing your photos.” By default, picture files that 
you transfer from your camera or memory card using the Canon soft-
ware go into these folders. To view all folders on your computer, click 
the All Folders button.

229
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Photos
 
✓ Preview the images in the selected folder. In Preview mode, the cur-
rent image appears at a large size in the middle of the window, as shown 
in the figures, and a “filmstrip” of smaller thumbnails appears beneath.
 
 To view the next image in the filmstrip, click its thumbnail. On a Mac, 
you then can press the right and left arrow keys on your keyboard to 
view your photos one by one. In Windows, the same technique works 
on some keyboards; if not, click the Next and Previous buttons (under 
the large preview) instead. Drag the scroll bar under the thumbnails to 
scroll the thumbnail display as needed.
 
✓ View an image in full-screen mode. For a larger view of a photo, double-
click its thumbnail. (You must double-click the thumbnail, not the larger 
preview image.) Doing so opens the image in its own browser window, 
displaying the image as large as possible to fit the available screen 
space. This full-screen window is the Viewer window. The next section 
explains more about the controls therein. To exit the Viewer window 
and return to the main browser, just click the window’s close button.
 
✓ View shooting information. Check out the Information panel, located 
on the right side of the window. If you click the Shooting Information 
button, you display all the settings that you used to capture the selected 
image, as shown in Figures 8-14 and 8-15. Reviewing this data — known 
as metadata — is a great way to better understand what settings work 
best for different types of pictures, especially when you’re just getting 
up to speed with aperture, shutter speed, white balance, and all the 
other digital photography basics. (Note that you may need to scroll the 
Information panel display to access the Shooting Information button, 
depending on the size of the program window.
Those are the basics of navigating through your images. In the next section, 
you can find some hints about viewing your photos in full-screen mode, 
inside the Viewer window. After that, the section “Organizing your photos” 
explains how to customize the folder setup that the Canon software creates 
for you.
Viewing photos in full-screen mode
Double-clicking a thumbnail in the main browser window displays the image 
inside the Viewer window. Figure 8-16 shows the Windows version of the 
Viewer; Figure 8-17 shows the Mac alternative.
After opening an image in the Viewer window, use these tricks to inspect it 
more closely:
 
✓ Magnify the image. You can zoom in on your image for a closer look by 
using these techniques:
 
• In ZoomBrowser EX (Windows): Drag the Zoom slider or click the 
preview with the Zoom In tool, both labeled in Figure 8-16.

• In ImageBrowser (Mac): Choose a specific magnification level from 
the Display Size drop-down list, labeled in Figure 8-17.
 
✓ Scroll a magnified image. After you magnify the photo, a tiny Navigator 
window appears in the top-left corner of the screen, as shown in the 
figures. The little red triangles in the Navigator window indicate the area 
that you’re viewing in the main preview. To scroll the display to see 
another portion of the image, put your cursor in the Navigator window, 
within the area bounded by those little red triangles, and drag.

 In Windows, you also can click the Hand tool, labeled in Figure 8-16, 
and drag in the preview itself. On a Mac, just drag in the preview; your 
cursor automatically sets itself to Hand-tool mode as soon as you 
enlarge the image display.
 
✓ Reduce the view size. In Windows, click the preview with the Zoom Out 
tool or use the Zoom slider. (Refer to Figure 8-16.) On a Mac, choose a 
smaller zoom size from the Display Size drop-down list.
 
 To zoom out so that you can see the entire image, click the Fit to 
Window button in Windows. (Refer to Figure 8-16.) On a Mac, choose Fit 
to Window from the Display Size list instead.
 
✓ View the next image in the folder. If you want to inspect more images in 
the Viewer, just click the Previous and Next buttons, labeled in Figure 8-16, 
if you use Windows. On a Mac, click the Back or Next button located under 
the preview.

232
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
✓ Edit the photo. To use the editing tools provided with the program, 
open the Edit drop-down list, found above the preview in Windows and 
beneath it on a Mac. Then select the editing task you want to perform. 
Chapter 10 provides more details about shifting into Editing mode and 
using the available tools.
Keep in mind that the preceding tidbits just give you the basics of using the 
Viewer window; for additional tips, check out the program manual.
Organizing your photos
By default, the Canon download software puts 
your picture files into either the My Pictures 
or Pictures folder in Windows and the Pictures 
folder on a Mac. Within that folder, the down-
loading tools organize the images by their 
shooting dates, creating a new folder for each 
date found on the memory card, as shown 
in Figure 8-18. Each folder contains only the 
images shot on that particular day.
If you don’t like this organizational structure, 
you can change it. For example, you may want 
to organize images by category — family, 
travel, work, and so on. I took this approach to 
customize my folder collection in Figure 8-18.
To keep things simple, I suggest that you add 
these custom folders within the My Pictures or 
Pictures folder (Windows) or Pictures folder 
(Mac). That way, you’ll always know where to look for images on your com-
puter’s hard drive. And programs that default to looking to those folders for 
photos will be able to find them as well. The next mini-sections show you the 
basics you need to create custom folders and then organize images in them.
Creating custom folders
Take these steps to add a folder to the My Pictures or Pictures list. (Again, 
which folder is the default image-storage tank depends on your computer’s 
operating system.)
 
1. Click the Favorite Folders tab of the Explore panel, if it isn’t already 
visible.
 
2. Click My Pictures or Pictures.
 
 The folder should appear highlighted.
Figure 8-18: You can create custom 
folders to organize images by 
category.

233
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Photos
 
3. Choose File➪New Folder.
 
 The New Folder dialog box appears.
 
4. Type the name of the folder in the text box and click OK.
 
 Your folder appears as a subfolder under the My Pictures or Pictures 
folder.
To create a subfolder within your new folder, follow the same process, but 
click the new folder in Step 2. For example, I created two subfolders within 
my Travel folder in Figure 8-18.
Managing your image collection
After you create your folders, you can place images into them in two ways:
 
✓ Move an image from one folder to another. Display the image thumb-
nail and then drag it to the desired folder. The program moves the image 
file to the new folder and removes it from the old one.
 
✓ Download new images directly to your desired folder. You can specify 
a custom folder as the download destination when you use the EOS 
Utility and MemoryCard Utility software to transfer images. See the ear-
lier sections of this chapter for details.
Use these techniques to maintain and further organize your image collection:
 
✓ Delete a folder. First, click the folder name to select it. Then, in 
Windows, choose File➪Delete. On a Mac, choose File➪Send to Trash. In 
both cases, the program displays a message asking you to confirm that 
you want to get rid of the folder; click Yes (Windows) or OK (Mac) to 
proceed.
 
 Be careful: This step deletes both the folder and all images inside it!
 
✓ Rename a folder. Click the folder and choose File➪Rename. In the 
dialog box that appears, type the new folder name and then click OK.
 
✓ Rename a picture file. Click the image thumbnail and choose File➪
Rename. Type the new name in the dialog box that appears and then 
click OK. Note: Do not type the three-letter file extension (.jpg or .CR2) 
at the end of the new filename. The program adds that data automati-
cally to the filename for you.
 
✓ Delete a picture. Click the image thumbnail to select it. Then, in 
Windows, choose File➪Delete; on a Mac, choose File➪Send to Trash. 
As with deleting a folder, you’re presented with a dialog box asking you 
whether you really, really want to dump that image. Respond in the affir-
mative to do so.

Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Exploring Other Software Options
The Canon browser software is a nifty tool for viewing and organizing your 
photos. And it enables you to perform basic retouching: You can crop your 
image and make some adjustments to color, exposure, and sharpness. 
Chapter 10 shows you how.
But the program isn’t designed for serious photo editing. For one thing, you 
can’t perform selective editing — changing only the part of your image that 
needs help. And you don’t get any tools for removing flaws such as blemishes 
in portraits and the like.
So my recommendation is that you consider the browser as a good, free tool 
for organizing your photos and doing simple picture fixes. But if you find 
yourself doing a lot of photo editing, invest in something more capable. Here 
are just some of the products to consider:
 
✓ Beginning/consumer programs: Unless you’re retouching photos for 
professional purposes or want to get into photo editing at a serious 
level for other reasons, a program such as Adobe Photoshop Elements 
($100, www.adobe.com) is a good fit. Elements has been the best-selling 
consumer photo editor for some time, and for good reason. With a full 
complement of retouching tools, onscreen guidance for novices, a built-
in photo organizer, and an assortment of tools and templates for creat-
ing artistic photo projects, Elements offers all the features that most 
consumers need.
 
 Figure 8-19 offers a look at Elements 6 for Windows; the program is also 
available in a Mac version. (By the time this book is published, Elements 7 
for Windows will also be available.)
 
 For other candidates in this category and price range, visit the Web sites 
of Corel (www.corel.com) and ArcSoft (www.arcsoft.com). Both compa-
nies offer multiple programs aimed at the beginner-to-intermediate user.
 
✓ Advanced/professional tools: The best-known option in this category is 
Adobe Photoshop, shown in Figure 8-20. Photoshop offers professional-
grade photo editing tools, a built-in photo organizer, and features 
needed by people preparing images for commercial printing, Web 
design, and other high-end uses.
 
 Of course, all that power comes at a price: $650. And expect to spend lots of 
time getting up to speed with the program, too, because you don’t get the 
friendly interfaces and guidance offered by the beginner-level programs. 
Nor does Photoshop offer the automated photo-creation features, such as 
greeting card templates and clip art, that you find in consumer programs.
 
 Other programs aimed at the professional market include Apple 
Aperture ($200, www.apple.com) and Adobe Lightroom ($300). These 
two programs are geared toward users who routinely need to process 
lots of images but who typically do only light retouching work.

Figure 8-19: Adobe Photoshop Elements offers a good balance of power and ease-of-use.
A few important tips before you buy:
 
✓ Check the software’s system requirements to make sure that your com-
puter can run the program. Some of the products I mention here aren’t 
available for Macintosh computers; Apple Aperture, on the other hand, 
isn’t available for Windows-based systems. Also make sure that your 
computer offers the system memory (RAM), processor speed, and other 
components that the software requires.
 
✓ You also can buy stand-alone photo organizing programs if you aren’t 
interested in serious photo editing but want a more powerful image-
management tool than you get with the Canon software. Check out the 
offerings in this category from ACDSee (www.acdsee.com), ThumbsPlus 
(www.thumbsplus.com), and Extensis (www.extensis.com).
 
 You may be amused, as I am, to know that the photo industry uses the 
term DAM software — for digital asset management — to refer to the 
function provided by image-organizing programs. (I dare you to walk 
into your local computer store and ask where you can find the DAM soft-
ware. Wait; I double-dare you.)
 
✓ Many software companies enable you to download free trials from their 
Web sites so that you can actually use the software for a short period to 
make sure that it fits your needs.

Using your mouse as a shutter button
Along with providing a convenient way for you 
to download images, the EOS Utility software 
enables you to use your computer to actually 
shoot pictures.
While your camera is connected to your com-
puter, clicking the Camera Settings/Remote 
Shooting button in the main EOS Utility window 
displays a panel containing clickable controls 
for adjusting the major camera settings, such 
as aperture, white balance, ISO, and metering 
mode. After you establish those settings, you 
click another button to record whatever scene 
is in front of your camera lens.
What’s the point? Well, this feature is great 
in scenarios that make having a live photog-
rapher close to the subject either difficult or 
dangerous — for example, trying to get a shot 
of a chemical reaction in a science lab or cap-
ture an image of an animal that’s shy around 
humans. Additionally, the software enables 
easy time-lapse photography, enabling you to 
set the camera to take pictures automatically 
at specified intervals over a period of minutes, 
hours, or even days.
 
 
Figure 8-20: Adobe Photoshop is designed for advanced users and imaging professionals.

 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Photos
Processing Raw (CR2) Files
Chapter 3 introduces you to the Camera Raw file format, which enables you 
to capture images as raw data. The advantage of capturing Raw files, which 
are called CR2 files on your Rebel XS/1000D, is that you make the decisions 
about how to translate the raw data into an actual photograph. You can 
specify attributes such as color intensity, image sharpening, contrast, and 
so on — all of which are handled automatically by the camera if you use its 
other file format, JPEG.
 
The bad news: You have to specify attributes such as color intensity, image 
sharpening, contrast, and so on before you can do anything with your pic-
tures. Although you can print them immediately if you use the Canon soft-
ware, you can’t take them to a photo lab for printing, share them online, or 
edit them in your photo software until you process them using a tool known 
as a raw converter. At the end of the conversion process, you save the fin-
ished file in a standard file format, such as JPEG or TIFF.
If you decide to shoot in the Raw format, you can process your images with 
ZoomBrowser EX (Windows) or ImageBrowser (Mac). Follow these steps:
 
1. Click the image thumbnail in the browser window.
 
2. In Windows, choose Tools➪Processing Raw Images; on a Mac, choose 
File➪Processing Raw Image.
 
 A message window may appear in order to provide you with general 
instructions about the conversion. Just click OK to close the window 
and move on. (If you don’t want to be bothered with it each time you 
want to process a Raw image, select the Don’t Show This Message Again 
check box before you close the window.)
 
 Now your photo appears inside the Raw Image Task window, shown in 
Figure 8-21. (The window may appear slightly different, depending on 
the options you choose from the View menu.)
 
3. Use the controls on the Image Quality adjustment panel to adjust the 
image as needed.
 
 Figure 8-22 gives you a look at the Windows version of the panel; the 
Mac version contains the same components but is arranged a little dif-
ferently. Drag the scroll bar on the right side of the panel if necessary to 
scroll the display as needed to access all the controls.
 
 The panel offers the following controls:
 
• Digital Exposure Compensation: Drag this slider to adjust image 
brightness.

238
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
 
Figure 8-21: You can convert Raw images using the browser’s Raw Image Task tool.
 
• White Balance: These controls, based on the white balance options 
discussed in Chapter 6, adjust color. You can click one of the white 
balance icons in the large panel, or you can drag the A/B (amber/
blue) and M/G (magenta/green) sliders to tweak the colors. Or 
click the little white balance eyedropper, labeled in Figure 8-22, 
and then click an area of the image that should be white, black, or 
gray to remove any color cast.
 
• Picture Style: Here, you can actually apply one of the camera’s 
Picture Style options to the photo. Or you can customize the style 
by dragging the Sharpness, Contrast, Color Saturation, and Color 
Tone sliders. (If you select Monochrome as the Picture Style, the 
Color Saturation and Color Tone sliders are replaced by the Filter 
Effect and Toning Effect sliders.) Chapter 6 talks about Picture 
Styles.
 
• Color Space: You can select either sRGB or Adobe RGB as the 
image color space. As discussed in Chapter 6, the latter offers a 
broader range of colors, although some of them may be beyond 
the printable range.
 
• Noise Reduction: If you select On for this option, the converter applies 
a filter designed to soften noise, a defect that gives the image a grainy 

239
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Photos
look. The filter works by applying a 
slight blur to the photo, so use with 
caution.
 
 At any time, you can revert the image to the 
original settings by clicking the Shot Settings 
button underneath the Image Adjustment 
panel. (See Figure 8-21; the button is just 
above the Preview check box.)
 
4. Choose File➪Save Image.
 
 You see the Save dialog box shown in 
Figure 8-23.
 
5. Set the Save options.
 
 Here’s the rundown on the options that 
may be foreign to you:
 
•  Conversion Target (Windows) or 
Images to Save (Mac): These options 
matter only if you are processing 
multiple images at a time. If you want 
to do this, the Help system available 
in the Raw Image Task window pro-
vides how-to’s.
 
• Image Type: This one is the critical 
setting. Choose EXIF-Tiff (8 bits/
channel). This saves your image in 
the TIFF file format, which preserves 
all image data. Don’t choose the JPEG 
format; doing so is destructive to the 
photo because of the lossy compres-
sion that is applied. Chapter 3 has details.
 
• Resolution: This option does not adjust the pixel count of your 
image, as you might imagine. It only sets the default output reso-
lution that will be used if you send the photo to a printer. Most 
photo editing programs enable you to adjust this value before 
printing. The Canon software does not, however, so if you plan 
to print through the browser, I suggest you set this value to 300. 
Chapter 9 talks more about printing.
 
• Save Folder and Rename File: Use these options to specify a stor-
age folder and filename for your converted image.
 
6. Click Save.
 
 A progress box appears in order to let you know that the conversion and 
file-saving is going forward.
 
7. Close the Raw Image Task window to return to the browser.

Figure 8-23: Always save your processed files in the TIFF format.
As you can probably tell from looking at the Raw Image Task window in 
Figure 8-21, these steps give you only a basic overview of the process. If 
you regularly shoot in the Raw format, take the time to explore the Raw 
Image Task window Help system so that you can take advantage of its 
other features.
Also know that this raw processor isn’t your only option. Digital Photo 
Professional, provided in the Canon software suite, offers its own raw con-
version tools. Because that program is designed for the more advanced 
user, the conversion tools are slightly more complex, but they’re also a little 
more powerful in some regards. Additionally, both Adobe Photoshop and 
Photoshop Elements offer excellent raw converters.
Whichever converter you choose, keep these final pointers in mind:
 
✓ Always save your processed files in a nondestructive format, such as 
TIFF. (If you use Adobe Photoshop Elements or Photoshop, its format, 
PSD, is also nondestructive.) If you need a JPEG image to share online, 
Chapter 9 shows you how to create a duplicate of your original, con-
verted image in that format.

241
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Photos
 
✓ Some raw converters, including the ones in the Canon programs, give 
you the option of creating a 16-bit image file. A bit is a unit of computer 
data; the more bits you have, the more colors your image can contain. 
Many photo editing programs either can’t open 16-bit files or limit you 
to a few editing tools, so I suggest you stick with the standard, 8-bit 
image option unless you know your software can handle the higher bit 
depth. (If you do prefer 16-bit files, choose the TIFF (16bit/ch) option in 
Step 5 of the preceding steps.)
 
✓ Resist the temptation to crank up color saturation too much. Doing so 
can actually destroy image detail. Likewise, be careful about overdoing 
sharpening, or else you can create noticeable image defects. Chapter 10 
offers some additional information about sharpening and saturation to 
help you find the right amounts of each.

W
hen my first digital photography book was published, way back in the 
1990s, consumer digital cameras didn’t offer the resolution needed to 
produce good prints at anything more than postage-stamp size — and even 
then, the operative word was good, not great. And if you did want a 
print, it was a pretty much a do-it-yourself proposition unless 
you paid sky-high prices at a professional imaging lab. In 
those days, retail photo labs didn’t offer digital printing, 
and online printing services hadn’t arrived yet, either.
Well, time and technology march on, and, at least 
in the case of digital photo printing, to a very 
good outcome. Your Rebel XS/1000D can produce 
dynamic prints even at large sizes, and getting 
those prints made is easy and economical, thanks 
to an abundance of digital printing services now in 
stores and online. And for home printing, today’s 
printers are better and cheaper than ever, too.

244
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
That said, getting the best prints from your picture files still requires a little 
bit of knowledge and prep work on your part. To that end, this chapter tells 
you exactly how to ensure that your pictures will look as good on paper as 
they do in your camera monitor.
In addition, this chapter explores ways to share your pictures electronically. 
First, I show you how to prepare your picture for e-mail — an important step 
if you don’t want to annoy friends and family by cluttering their inboxes with 
ginormous, too-large-to-view photos. Following that, you can find out how to 
create a digital slide show, view your pictures on a television, and more.
Avoiding Printing Problems
Although digital printing has come a long way in the past couple of years, a 
few issues still can cause hiccups in the process. So before you print your 
photos, whether you want to do it on your own printer or send them to a lab, 
read through the next three sections, which show you how to avoid the most 
common trouble spots.
Check the pixel count before you print
Resolution, or the number of pixels in your digital image, plays a huge role in 
how large you can print your photos and still maintain good picture quality. 
You can get the complete story on resolution in Chapter 3, but here’s a quick 
recap as it relates to printing:
 
✓ On your Rebel XS/1000D, you set picture resolution via the Quality 
option, found on Shooting Menu 1. You must select this option before 
you capture an image, which means that you need some idea of your 
ultimate print size before you shoot. And remember that if you crop 
your image, you eliminate some pixels, so take that factor into account 
when you do the resolution math.
 
✓ For good print quality, the minimum pixel count (in my experience, 
anyway) is 200 pixels per linear inch, or 200 ppi. That means that if you 
want a 4-x-6-inch print, you need at least 800 x 1200 pixels.
 
✓ Depending on your printer, you may get even better results at 200+ ppi. 
Some printers do their best work when fed 300 ppi, and a few (notably 
those from Epson) request 360 ppi as the optimum resolution. However, 
going higher than that typically doesn’t produce any better prints.

245
 Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Photos
 
 Unfortunately, because most printer manuals don’t bother to tell you 
what image resolution produces the best results, finding the right pixel 
level is a matter of experimentation. (Don’t confuse the manual’s state-
ments related to the printer’s dpi with ppi. DPI refers to how many dots 
of color the printer can lay down per inch; many printers use multiple 
dots to reproduce one image pixel.)
 
✓ If you’re printing your photos at a retail kiosk or at an online site, the 
software that you use to order your prints should determine the resolu-
tion of your files and then suggest appropriate print sizes. But if you’re 
printing on a home printer, you need to be the resolution cop.
So what do you do if you find that you don’t have enough pixels for the print 
size you have in mind? You just have to decide what’s more important — 
print size or print quality.
If your print size exceeds your pixel supply, you have the following two 
choices, neither of which provides a good outcome:
 
✓ Keep the existing pixel count, in which case pixels simply grow in 
size to fill the requested print size. And if pixels get too large, you get 
a defect known as pixelation. The picture starts to appear jagged, or 
stairstepped, along curved or digital lines. Or at worst, your eye can 
actually make out the individual pixels, and your photo begins to look 
more like a mosaic than, well, a photograph.
 
✓ Add more pixels, also known as resampling the image. Some photo pro-
grams enable you to do so, and some programs resample the photo 
automatically for you, depending on the print settings you choose. 
Although this option sounds good, it really doesn’t solve your problem. 
You’re asking the software to make up photo information out of thin air, 
and the resulting image usually looks worse than the original. You don’t 
get pixelation, but details turn muddy, giving the image a blurry, poorly 
rendered appearance.
Just to hammer home the point and remind you one more time of the impact 
of resolution picture quality, Figures 9-1 and 9-2 show you the same image as 
it appears at 300 ppi (the resolution required by the publisher of this book), 
at 50 ppi, and resampled from 50 ppi to 300 ppi. As you can see, there’s just 
no way around the rule: If you want the best-quality prints, you need the right 
pixel count from the get-go.

Allow for different print proportions
Unlike many digital cameras, yours produces images that have an aspect 
ratio of 3:2. That is, images are 3 units wide by 2 units tall — just like a 35mm 
film negative — which means that they translate perfectly to the standard 
4-x-6-inch print size. (Most digital cameras produce 4:3 images, which means 
the pictures must be cropped to fit a 4-x-6-inch piece of paper.)
 
If you want to print your digital original at other standard sizes — 5 x 7, 
8 x 10, 11 x 14, and so on — you need to crop the photo to match those pro-
portions. Alternatively, you can reduce the photo size slightly and leave an 
empty margin along the edges of the print as needed.
As a point of reference, both images in Figure 9-3 show you an original, 3:2 
image. The blue outlines indicate how much of the original can fit within a 
5-x-7-inch frame and an 8-x-10-inch frame.

247
 Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Photos
Chapter 10 shows you how to 
crop your image using the free 
Canon software that shipped 
with your camera. You also can 
usually crop your photo using 
the software provided at online 
printing sites and at retail print 
kiosks. But if you plan to simply 
drop off your memory card for 
printing at a lab, be sure to find 
out whether the printer automat-
ically crops the image without 
your input. If so, use your photo 
software to crop the photo, 
save the cropped image to your 
memory card, and deliver that 
version of the file to the printer.
 
To allow yourself printing flex-
ibility, leave at least a little 
margin of background around 
your subject when you shoot, 
as I did for the example in 
Figure 9-3. Then you don’t clip 
off the edges of the subject 
no matter what print size you 
choose. (Some people refer to 
this margin padding as head 
room, especially when describ-
ing portrait composition.)
Get print and monitor colors in sync
Your photo colors look perfect on your computer monitor. But when you 
print the picture, the image is too red, or too green, or has some other nasty 
color tint. This problem, which is probably the most prevalent printing issue, 
can occur because of any or all of the following factors:
 
✓ Your monitor needs to be calibrated. When print colors don’t match 
what you see on your computer monitor, the most likely culprit is 
actually the monitor, not the printer. If the monitor isn’t accurately 
calibrated, the colors it displays aren’t a true reflection of your image 
colors. The same caveat applies with regard to monitor brightness: You 
can’t accurately gauge the exposure of a photo if the brightness of the 
monitor is cranked way up or down.

 To ensure that your monitor is displaying photos on a neutral canvas, 
you can start with a software-based calibration utility, which is just a 
small program that guides you through the process of adjusting your 
monitor. The program displays various color swatches and other graph-
ics and then asks you to provide feedback about what you see on the 
screen.
 
 If you use a Mac, the operating system offers a built-in calibration utility, 
the Display Calibrator Assistant; Figure 9-4 shows the welcome screen 
that appears when you run the program. (Access it by opening the System 
Preferences dialog box, clicking the Displays icon, clicking the Color button, 
and then clicking the Calibrate button.) You also can find free calibration 
software for both Mac and Windows systems online; just enter the term 
free monitor calibration software into your favorite search engine.

249
 Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Photos
 
 
 Figure 9-4: Mac users can take advantage of the operating system’s built-in 
calibration tool.
 
 Software-based tools, though, depend on your eyes to make decisions 
during the calibration process. For a more reliable calibration, you may 
want to invest in a hardware solution, such as the Pantone Huey ($90, 
www.pantone.com) or the ColorVision Spyder2express ($70, www. 
colorvision.com). These products use a device known as a colorimeter to 
accurately measure your display colors.
 
 
Whichever route you go, the calibration process produces a monitor 
profile, which is simply a data file that tells your computer how to adjust 
the display to compensate for any monitor color casts. Your Windows or 
Mac operating system loads this file automatically when you start your 
computer. Your only responsibility is to perform the calibration every 
month or so, as monitor colors drift over time.
 
✓ One of your printer cartridges is empty or clogged. If your prints 
look great one day but are way off the next, the number-one suspect is 
an empty ink cartridge or a clogged print nozzle or head. Check your 
manual to find out how to perform the necessary maintenance to keep 
the nozzles or print heads in good shape.
 
 If black-and-white prints have a color tint, you might assume that your black 
ink cartridge is to blame, if your printer has one. But the problem is usually 
a color cartridge instead. Most printers use both color and black inks even 
for black-and-white prints, and if one color is missing, a tint results.

250
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
 When you buy replacement ink, by the way, keep in mind that third-
party brands, while they may save you money, may not deliver the 
performance you get from the cartridges made by your printer manu-
facturer. A lot of science goes into getting ink formulas to mesh with the 
printer’s ink-delivery system, and the printer manufacturer obviously 
knows most about that delivery system.
 
✓ You chose the wrong paper setting in your printer software. When you 
set up your print job, be sure to select the right setting from the paper-
type option — glossy, matte, and so on. This setting affects how the 
printer lays down ink on the paper.
 
✓ Your photo paper is low quality. Sad but true: The cheap, store-brand 
photo papers usually don’t render colors as well as the higher-priced, 
name-brand papers. For best results, try papers from your printer manu-
facturer; again, those papers are engineered to provide top performance 
with the printer’s specific inks and ink-delivery system.
 
✓ Your printer and photo software are fighting over color management 
duties. Some photo programs offer color management tools, which are 
features that enable the user to control how colors are handled as an 
image passes from camera to monitor to printer. Most printer software 
also offers color management features. The problem is, if you enable color 
management controls both in your photo software and your printer soft-
ware, you can create conflicts that lead to wacky colors. So check your 
photo software and printer manuals to find out what color management 
options are available to you and how to turn them on and off.
 
Even if all the aforementioned issues are resolved, however, don’t expect perfect 
color matching between printer and monitor. Printers simply can’t reproduce 
the entire spectrum of colors that a monitor can display. In addition, monitor 
colors always appear brighter because they are, after all, generated with light.
Finally, be sure to evaluate your print colors and monitor colors in the same 
ambient light — daylight, office light, whatever — because that light source 
has its own influence on the colors you see. Also allow your prints to dry for 
15 minutes or so before you make any final judgments.
Printing Online or In-Store
Normally, I’m a do-it-yourself type of gal. I mow my own lawn, check my own 
tire pressure, hang my own screen doors. I am woman; hear me roar. Unless, 
that is, I discover that I can have someone else do the job in less time and for 
less money than I can — which just happens to be the case for digital photo 
printing. Although I occasionally make my own prints for fine-art images that 
I plan to sell or exhibit, I have everyday snapshots made at my local retail 
photo lab.

251
 Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Photos
 
Unless you’re already very comfortable with computers and photo printing, I 
suggest that you do the same. Compare the cost of retail digital printing with 
the cost of using a home or office photo printer — remember to factor in the 
required ink, paper, and your precious time — and you’ll no doubt come out 
ahead if you delegate the job.
You can choose from a variety of retail printing options:
 
✓ Drop-off printing services: Just as you used to leave a roll of film at the 
photo lab in your corner drugstore or camera store, you can drop off 
your memory card, order prints, and then pick up your prints in as little 
as an hour.
 
✓ Self-serve print kiosks: Many photo labs, big-box stores, and other retail 
outlets also offer self-serve print kiosks. You insert your memory card 
into the appropriate slot, follow the onscreen directions, and wait for 
your prints to slide out of the print chute.
 
✓ Online with mail-order delivery: You can upload your photo files to 
online printing sites and have prints mailed directly to your house. 
Photo-sharing sites such as Shutterfly, Kodak Gallery, and Snapfish are 
well-known players in this market. But many national retail chains, such 
as Ritz Camera, Wal-Mart, and others also offer this service.
 
✓ Online with local pickup: Here’s my favorite option. Many national 
chains enable you to upload your picture files for easy ordering but pick 
up your prints at a local store.
 
 
This service is a great way to share prints with friends and family 
who don’t live nearby. I can upload and order prints from my desk in 
Indianapolis, for example, and have them printed at a store located a few 
miles from my parents’ home in Texas.
Printing from ZoomBrowser EX/ImageBrowser
If you prefer to print your own pictures on a home or office printer, the pro-
cess is much the same as printing anything from your computer: You open 
the picture file in your photo software of choice, choose File➪Print, and spec-
ify the print size, paper size, paper type, and so on, as usual.
The following steps show you how to get the job done using Canon 
ZoomBrowser EX (Windows) or ImageBrowser (Mac). Chapter 8 introduces 
you to this free software, so you may want to pop over to that chapter to find 
out how to browse your images using the program, if you haven’t already 
done so. Then walk this way:

252
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
1. Click the thumbnail for the image that you want to print.
 
2. Choose File➪Print➪Photo Print.
 
 Your image then appears inside the Photo Print window, shown in 
Figure 9-5. The figure shows the Windows XP version of the Photo Print 
features. If you’re a Mac user, your window lacks the gray task panel 
that appears on the left in Windows, but don’t fret: The critical printing 
settings remain the same, albeit with a slightly different look.
 
 
Figure 9-5: Your first step is to select a printer and paper size.
 
3. Select a printer.
 
 In Windows, choose the printer from the Name drop-down list. On a 
Mac, select your printer from the Printer drop-down list.
 
4. Specify your printer settings.
 
• Windows: Click the Properties button.
 
• Mac: Click the Page Setup button.
 
 Either way, you’re taken to the standard print-setup dialog box for your 
printer. The options therein depend on your printer, so check your 
manual for guidance. But be sure to specify the following settings:

253
 Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Photos
 
• Paper size
 
• Paper type (glossy, plain paper, and so on)
 
• Borderless printing on or off (if your printer offers this feature)
 
 The browser software automatically chooses the print orientation (por-
trait or landscape) that best fits the image on the page. Even though you 
can select an orientation option in your printer setup dialog box, the 
program overrides you later if it deems necessary.
 
 When you finish establishing the printer settings, click OK to return to 
the Photo Print window.
 
5. Adjust the image cropping as necessary.
 
 
By default, the browser automatically enlarges and/or crops your image 
to fit your chosen paper size if necessary. To see exactly what has been 
cropped in Windows, click the Trim Image button. On a Mac, click the 
button labeled Remove Unwanted Regions of Your Photo.
 
 In both cases, your image opens in the Trim Image editing window, 
shown in Figure 9-6, which contains some of the controls that you see 
when you use the program’s editing functions.
 
Crop box
 
Figure 9-6: You can adjust the image cropping if needed.

254
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
 Chapter 10 details the Trim Image editing controls, but here’s the short 
story:
 
• The box with the little white squares around it indicates the crop 
box. Anything outside the box isn’t printed.
 
• Drag any of those squares to adjust the size of the crop box. You’re 
limited to setting the box to the same proportions as your selected 
paper size.
 
• Drag inside the box to move it over a different part of the photo.
 
• Click the Orientation icons (Windows) or Trimming Frame buttons 
(Mac) if you want to change the layout of the cropping box (hori-
zontal or vertical).
 
• Click OK to apply the new cropping and return to the Photo Print 
window.
 
 
If you don’t want your photo to be cropped or enlarged, you need to exit 
the printing process and adjust a program preference. See the end of 
these steps for details.
 
6. Add the shooting date/time (optional).
 
 You can print the date and time that the photo was taken by choosing 
an option from the Shooting Date/Time drop-down list in the Photo Print 
window (refer to Figure 9-5). The program determines the date and time 
from data in the image file.
 
 If you choose to print the date and time, click the Properties button that 
appears underneath the Shooting Date/Time drop-down list to set the 
font, size, and placement of the type.
 
7. Add a caption to the photo (optional).
 
 To add more type to your photo, click the Insert Text button (Windows) 
or the Add or Modify Text to Print with This Photo button (Mac). Either 
way, you’re taken to the Insert Text window, which offers most of the 
same text tools as the regular Insert Text window, which I cover at 
the end of Chapter 10. If you add text, click OK to close the Insert Text 
window and return to the Photo Print window when you’re finished.
 
8. Click the Print button.
 
 Your photo file is shipped to the printer.
As I mentioned in Step 5, you can choose to turn off the automatic cropping 
that occurs by default. First, close the Photo Print window if it’s open. Then 
take these steps:
 
✓ Windows: Choose Tools➪Preferences to open the Preferences dialog 
box. Click the Printing tab and select the Do Not Allow Trimming of the 
Image option. Click OK to close the dialog box.

255
 Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Photos
 
✓ Mac: Choose ImageBrowser➪Preferences. Select Photo Print from the 
drop-down list at the top of the dialog box that appears. Then select Do 
Not Trim and click OK.
 
If you take this step, the Trim function inside the Photo Print dialog box 
becomes disabled, so you must do any cropping before you print.
Although it’s fine for casual printing, Photo Print lacks some features that 
are typically found in most photo editors and even in the software that ships 
with most photo printers. You can’t print multiple images on the same page, 
for example, or even multiple copies of the same photo. So if you own other 
software, you may find it more convenient than using the browser’s print 
functions.
 
Whatever software you use, be sure to follow the resolution guidelines set out 
near the beginning of this chapter. And note that the Photo Print window doesn’t 
warn you if your image doesn’t contain enough pixels to produce a good print at 
the size you select. So before you begin printing, check that pixel count by dis-
playing the Shooting Information panel in the main browser window. The Image 
Size listing, highlighted in Figure 9-7, shows you the pixel count.

Preparing Pictures for E-Mail
How many times have you received an e-mail message that looks like the 
one in Figure 9-8? Some well-meaning friend or relative has sent you a digital 
photo that is so large that it’s impossible to view the whole thing on your 
monitor.
The problem is that computer monitors can display only a limited number 
of pixels. The exact number depends on the monitor’s resolution setting and 
the capabilities of the computer’s video card, but suffice it to say that the 
DPOF, PictBridge, and computerless printing
Your Rebel XS/1000D offers two features that 
enable you to print directly from your camera or 
memory card — without using the computer as 
middle-machine — assuming that your printer 
offers the required options.
The first of these features, DPOF, stands for 
Digital Print Order Format. With this option, 
accessed via the Print Order option on your 
camera’s Playback menu, you select the pic-
tures on your memory card that you want to 
print, and you specify how many copies you 
want of each image. Then, if your photo printer 
has a Secure Digital (SD) memory card slot 
and supports DPOF, you just pop the memory 
card into that slot. The printer reads your “print 
order” and outputs just the requested copies 
of your selected images. (You use the printer’s 
own controls to set paper size, print orientation, 
and other print settings.)
A second direct-printing feature, PictBridge, 
works a little differently. If you have a 
PictBridge-enabled photo printer, you can con-
nect the camera to the printer using the USB 
cable supplied with your camera. A PictBridge 
interface appears on the camera monitor, and 
you use the camera controls to select the pic-
tures you want to print. With PictBridge, you 
specify additional print options, such as page 
size and whether you want to print a border 
around the photo, from the camera.
Both DPOF and PictBridge are especially useful 
in scenarios where you need fast printing. For 
example, if you shoot pictures at a party and 
want to deliver prints to guests before they go 
home, DPOF offers a quicker option than firing 
up your computer, downloading pictures, and 
so on. And if you invest in one of the tiny por-
table photo printers on the market today, you 
can easily make prints away from your home or 
office — you can take both your portable printer 
and camera along to your regional sales meet-
ing, for example.
For the record, I prefer DPOF to PictBridge 
because with PictBridge, you have to deal with 
cabling the printer and camera together. Also, 
the camera must be turned on for the whole 
printing process, wasting battery power. But 
if you’re interested in exploring either printing 
feature, your camera manual provides complete 
details.

257
 Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Photos
average photo from one of today’s digital cameras has a pixel count in excess 
of what the monitor can handle.
In general, a good rule is to limit a photo to no more than 450 pixels at its lon-
gest dimension. That ensures that people can view your entire picture with-
out scrolling, as in Figure 9-9. This image measures 450 x 300 pixels.
This recommendation means that even if you shoot at your camera’s lowest-
resolution setting (1936 x 1288 pixels), you need to dump pixels from your 
images before sending them to the cyber post office. You can take care 
of that task and then send the resized image right from ZoomBrowser EX 
(Windows) or ImageBrowser (Mac).
 
As a first step, however, you need to check the file format of the photos 
you want to share; they must be in the JPEG format. If they are Raw (CR2) 
or TIFF images, the next section shows you how to create JPEG copies for 
online sharing. If the pictures are already JPEGs, skip ahead to the section 
“E-mailing photos from the browser.”
 
 
Figure 9-8: The attached image has too many pixels to be viewed without scrolling.

258
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
 
Figure 9-9: Keep e-mail pictures to no larger than 450 pixels wide or tall.
Creating Web-friendly copies of Raw and TIFF photos
In Chapter 8, I advise you to save Raw files in the TIFF format after you 
process them in a raw converter. TIFF is ideal because it is a nondestructive 
format — that is, it retains all your picture data, resulting in the highest image 
quality. But there’s one problem with TIFF files: E-mail programs and Web 
browsers can’t display them. If you want to share your converted raw files 
online, you need to create a copy of the file in the standard online format, 
JPEG.
 
Why not just save your converted raw files as JPEG images at the processing 
stage? Because JPEG is a destructive format, eliminating some image data as 
a tradeoff for producing smaller file sizes. So the best practice is to save 
your original raw conversions as TIFF files and then create JPEG copies for 
online use.
In ZoomBrowser EX (Windows) or ImageBrowser (Mac), you can use the 
Export command to create a JPEG copy and reduce the pixel count to a reso-
lution suitable for onscreen display at the same time. Follow these steps:

259
 Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Photos
 
1. Select the image by clicking its thumbnail in the browser.
 
2. Choose File➪Export➪Export Still Images (Windows) or File➪Export 
Image (Mac).
 
 
Export is the geekspeak way of saying “save this file in a different 
format.”
 
 In Windows, you next see a window that contains the file-saving options, 
as shown in Figure 9-10. On a Mac, you see the Write a Still Image box 
instead; click Edit and Save Image and then click the Next button to get 
to the file-saving options. They’re arranged a little differently on the Mac 
than in Figure 9-10, but the basic controls are the same.
 
 
Figure 9-10: Use the Export command to create a JPEG copy of a TIFF photo.
 
3. Set the image size.
 
 To keep the original pixel count, deselect the Resize Images During 
Export check box (Windows) or Resize the Image box (Mac). If you want 
to resample the image (trim the pixel count), select the box, as shown 
in the figure. Then click the Long Side option (Windows) or Specify the 

260
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Length Dimension (Mac) and type a value in the neighboring box. The 
value you enter determines the number of pixels the image contains 
along its longest side. The program automatically sets the pixel count of 
the shortest side to retain the original image proportions.
 
 For e-mail images, I suggest setting the long side of the image to 450 
pixels or less. This ensures that the recipient can view the entire image 
without scrolling the e-mail window.
 
4. Select the Change Image Type check box.
 
5. Select the JPEG format from the drop-down list under the check box.
 
6. Use the Quality slider to set the desired image quality.
 
 At the highest Quality setting, the program applies the least amount 
of JPEG compression, which is the process that reduces file sizes by 
dumping image data. For the best image quality, set the slider to either 
Highest or High. (Your file size is already pretty small because of the 
reduced pixel count.)
 
7. Specify a filename.
 
 You have two options: If you deselect the Add a Prefix check box 
(Windows) or the Rename the File box (Mac), the program gives your 
JPEG copy the same name as the original — for example, IMG_7813.TIF 
becomes IMG_7813.JPG.
 
 You also can assign a new filename. First, select the Add a Prefix check 
box (Windows) or the Rename the File box (Mac). Then type the text 
in the adjacent text box. Note that the program automatically adds the 
numbers 0001 to the end of whatever text you enter. For example, if you 
type Web in the box, the filename of your JPEG copy will be Web0001.
jpg. If you stick with the text that the program enters in the box for you 
automatically — IMG_ — the filename will be IMG_0001.jpg.
 
8. Choose the folder where you want to store the JPEG file.
 
 In Windows, you do this by using the Save to Folder option. Click 
Current Folder to put the copy in the same folder as the original. Click 
My Pictures (or Pictures, depending on the version of Windows you use) 
to put the copy in that folder instead, or click Browse to select another 
folder.
 
 
In Windows, you may need to scroll the window display to access the 
Save to Folder option, as shown in Figure 9-11.
 
 On a Mac, the current folder destination appears at the bottom of the 
dialog box; click the Browse button to select a different storage bin.
 
9. Click Finish to save the copy.
After creating your Web-ready image, you can attach it to an e-mail message 
just as you do any file.

E-mailing photos from the browser
You can resize and e-mail JPEG photos directly from ZoomBrowser EX 
(Windows) or ImageBrowser (Mac). Follow these steps:
 
1. In the browser, select the images that you want to share.
 
 Click the first image and then either Ctrl+click (Windows) or Ô+click 
(Mac) additional images.
 
2. Start the e-mail tool.
 
 How you do it depends on your operating system:
 
• Windows: Choose Internet➪Send Images by Email.
 
• Mac: Choose Internet➪Create Image for Email.
 
 In Windows, you see the dialog box shown in Figure 9-12. The Mac ver-
sion looks a little different, but it contains the same critical controls.
 
3. Click the Using Custom Settings button.
 
 
Why not use the program’s recommended settings? Because if you 
do, your e-mail image is sized to 640 x 480 pixels. On some computer 
screens, even that size is too large to be viewed without scrolling.

Figure 9-12: Select Using Custom Settings and click Custom Settings to specify the pixel count.
 
4. Click the Custom Settings 
button.
 
 In Windows, you see the dialog 
box shown in Figure 9-13. The 
Mac version contains the same 
basic options, plus a couple addi-
tional options related to digital 
movies, which you can ignore. 
In both versions, the dialog box 
enables you to specify the width 
or height of your picture and 
then preview the resulting file 
size and onscreen display size.
 
5. Open the Image Size (Windows) 
or Still Image Size (Mac) drop-
down list and click Custom Size.
 
 Now a second dialog box opens, 
offering the options shown in 
Figure 9-14. Here, you can specify 
the exact pixel count you want 
the photo to have.
Figure 9-13: You can create a custom setting 
to apply to all your e-mail photos.

 Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Photos
 
6. Click the Long Side button and 
enter a size value in the adja-
cent box.
 
 This value determines the maxi-
mum height of a vertically ori-
ented picture or the maximum 
width of a horizontally oriented 
picture. Again, I recommend 
a value of 450 pixels, but you 
make the call.
 
 Whatever value you enter, the 
program will handle setting the 
value for the shortest side when 
it resizes the image.
 
7. Click OK to close the dialog 
box.
 
 
The image size you specified now appears as an option in the drop-down 
list. So the next time you send an image, you can skip Steps 5 and 6 and 
simply select that size from the list.
 
8. Specify the picture quality by dragging the Quality slider.
 
 This setting determines how much JPEG compression is applied. As 
Chapter 3 explains, JPEG compression reduces the size of a picture file 
by getting rid of some image data. The more compression you apply, the 
smaller the file and the lower the picture quality.
 
 After you drag the slider, click the Calculate button. The program does 
a quick calculation, and the Modified File Size value then shows you the 
file size that will result from the chosen Quality setting. And if you click 
the Preview button, you can view a preview of how the image will look at 
the selected setting.
 
 
Because the new pixel count of your photo already results in a very 
small file, you can use a high Quality setting without worrying too much 
about download times. The exception is if you are sending a picture to 
someone who uses a dial-up connection, in which case I would bump the 
Quality slider down a notch. You also may want to reduce the Quality 
slightly if you are attaching multiple pictures to the same e-mail message 
so that the combined download time isn’t excessive.
 
9. Tell the program to automatically fire up your e-mail program after it 
resizes the photo.
 
• Windows: Select the Attach to Email option.
 
• Mac: Select the Start Email Application After Closing option.
 
10. Click OK to close the Custom Settings dialog box.
 
 You return to the main e-mail utility window.
Figure 9-14: Set the pixel count for the 
picture’s longest side.

264
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
11. Click the arrow labeled Confirm Current to review the image size 
settings.
 
 If anything is amiss, click the Custom Settings button to adjust the 
settings.
 
12. Click Attach to Email (Windows) or Finish (Mac).
 
 The program creates your e-mail copy, fires up your e-mail program, and 
creates a new message window. The images are automatically attached 
to the message, so all you have to do is enter the recipient’s e-mail 
address and any message you want to include. Then just send the mes-
sage as you normally do.
 
The software does not save a copy of the resized e-mail image on your com-
puter’s hard drive. If you do want to create and save a small copy of the 
photo, follow Steps 1 through 8 and then proceed like so:
 
✓ Windows: Select the Save to Folder button and then click the Browse 
button to select the folder where you want to store the resized copy of 
the photo. In Step 12, click the Save to Folder button.
 
✓ Mac: Deselect the Attach to Email button in Step 9. Click OK to close the 
Custom Settings box and then click the Finish button. You can’t specify 
a different folder location; the copy is automatically placed in the same 
folder as the original.
Windows or Mac, the program gives the resized image the same name as the 
original but tags the characters “_1” onto the end of the name so that you 
don’t overwrite the original. Your e-mail program isn’t started automatically, 
but you can take care of that step yourself, creating your message and attach-
ing the picture files just as you do any file that you want to share by e-mail.
Online photo sharing: Read the fine print
If you want to share more than a couple of 
photos, consider posting your images at an 
online photo-album site instead of attaching 
them to e-mail messages. Photo-sharing sites 
such as Shutterfly, Kodak Gallery, and Picasa all 
enable you to create digital photo albums and 
then invite friends and family to view your pic-
tures and order prints of their favorites.
At most sites, picture-sharing is free, but your 
albums and images are deleted if you don’t 
order prints or make some other purchase 
from the site within a specified amount of time. 
Additionally, many free sites enable you to 
upload high-resolution files for printing but then 
don’t let you retrieve those files from the site. (In 
other words, don’t think of album sites as archi-
val storage solutions.) And here’s another little 
bit of fine print to investigate: The membership 
agreement at some sites states that you agree 
to let the site use your photos, for free, for any 
purpose that it sees fit.

 Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Photos
Creating an In-Camera Slide Show
Many photo-editing and cataloging programs offer a tool for creating digital 
slide shows that can be viewed on a computer or, if copied to a DVD, on a 
DVD player. You can even add music, special transition effects, and the like 
to jazz up your presentations.
But if you just want a simple slide show — that is, one that just displays all 
the photos on the camera memory card one by one — you don’t need a com-
puter or any photo software. You can create and run the slide show right on 
your camera. And by connecting your camera to a television, as outlined in 
the next section, you can present your show to a whole roomful of people.
Follow these steps:
 
1. Display the Playback menu and 
highlight Auto Play, as shown in 
Figure 9-15.
 
2. Press Set.
 
 The images are displayed sequen-
tially on the monitor, with each 
image appearing for about four 
seconds. After the last image is 
displayed, the show automati-
cally begins again.
During auto playback, you can control 
the display as follows:
 
✓ Pause playback. Press the Set 
button. Press the button again to 
restart playback.
 
✓ Change the information display style. Press the DISP button. (See 
Chapter 4 for details about the available display styles.)
 
✓ Exit Auto playback mode. Press the Menu button.
Viewing Your Photos on a Television
Your camera is equipped with a video-out port, which is tucked under the 
little rubber cover on the left rear side of the camera, as shown in Figure 9-16. 
That feature means that you can output your pictures for display on a televi-
sion screen.
Figure 9-15: Choose Auto Play to set up 
automatic playback of all pictures on your 
memory card.

266
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Video out port
Video in port
Figure 9-16: You can connect your camera to a television, VCR, or DVD player.
To take advantage of this option, dig through your camera box until you find 
the video cable. One end of the cable has a yellow plug; the other end has a 
black plug. Then, making sure that the camera is off, plug the black end into 
the camera’s video-out port, and plug the yellow end into the video-in port on 
your television, as shown on the right in Figure 9-16. You can also insert the 
yellow plug into the video-in port on a VCR or DVD player that’s connected to 
your TV, as shown in the figure.
When the two devices are connected, turn the camera and TV (or VCR or 
DVD) on. At this point, you need to consult your TV/VCR/DVD manual to 
find out what channel to select for playback of signals from auxiliary input 
devices. After you sort out that issue, you can control playback using the 
same camera controls as you normally do to view pictures on your camera 
monitor. (See Chapter 4 for help.) You can also run a slide show by following 
the steps outlined in the preceding section.
 
Note that you may need to adjust one camera setting, Video System, which is 
found on Setup Menu 2. You get just two options here: NTSC and PAL. Select 
the video mode that’s used by your part of the world. (In the United States, 
Canada, and Mexico, NTSC is the standard).

Part IV
The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
I
n time-honored For Dummies tradition, this 
part of the book contains additional tidbits of 
information presented in the always popular “Top 
Ten” list format.
Chapter 10 shows you how to do some minor 
picture touchups, such as cropping and adjusting 
exposure, by using the free software that shipped 
with your camera. Following that, Chapter 11 
introduces you to ten camera functions that I 
consider specialty tools — bonus options that, 
while not at the top of the list of the features I 
suggest you study, are nonetheless interesting to 
explore when you have a free moment or two.

Ten Fast Photo-Editing Tricks
In This Chapter
▶ Using the editing tools in Canon ZoomBrowser EX and ImageBrowser
▶ Removing red-eye
▶ Cropping your photos
▶ Correcting exposure and color problems
▶ Creating the illusion of sharper focus
▶ Adding text
▶ Saving your edited masterpieces
E
very photographer produces a clunker image now and then. When it 
happens to you, don’t be too quick to reach for the Erase button on 
your camera. Many common problems are surprisingly easy to 
fix using the tools found in most photo editing programs.
In fact, you can perform many common retouching 
tasks using one of the free programs provided with 
your camera. Called ZoomBrowser EX in Windows 
and ImageBrowser on the Mac, this software offers 
tools for removing red-eye, adjusting exposure, 
tweaking colors, sharpening focus, and more.
Chapter 8 introduces you to these programs, show-
ing you how to use them to download, view, and 
organize your pictures. This chapter lays out the 
step-by-step instructions for using the editing tools to 
repair and enhance your photos.
 
A few other notes before you start:
 
✓ If you shot your pictures using the Raw file format, you must process 
them using the raw-conversion instructions laid out in Chapter 8 before 
you can edit them.
 
✓ Although the tools provided in the free software are pretty good, they 
don’t allow selective editing. That is, you can’t apply them just to the 

270
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
part of your photo that needs help. For that kind of retouching work, 
you need a more sophisticated photo editor. Chapter 8 offers some 
recommendations.
 
✓ Most figures in this chapter feature the Windows versions of the Canon 
software. Although the Mac version looks different, the retouching steps 
are the same unless I state otherwise.
 
✓ For simplicity’s sake, I refer to ZoomBrowser EX and ImageBrowser 
generically in the instructions here as just “the browser.”
 
✓ Finally, Canon occasionally posts updates to its software on its Web 
site (www.canon.com). So if you’ve owned your camera for a while, 
check the Web site to make sure that you’re using the most current 
versions of the available programs. This book features version 6.1.1 of 
ZoomBrowser EX and ImageBrowser.
Removing Red-Eye
From my experience, red-eye is not a major problem with the Rebel 
XS/1000D. But if you spot red-eye in your flash pictures, take these steps to 
fix the problem:
 
1. In the main browser window, double-click the image thumbnail.
 
 Again, Chapter 8 shows you how to get your images into the browser 
and keep track of your picture files.
 
 After you double-click a thumbnail, the picture opens in its own 
Viewer window. Figure 10-1 offers a look at how the window appears in 
Windows; Figure 10-2 shows the Mac version.
 
2. Open the Edit drop-down list, as shown in Figures 10-1 and 10-2.
 
3. Choose Red Eye Correction from the Edit list.
 
 Your photo appears in the Red Eye Correction retouching window. 
Figure 10-3 shows the Windows version; Figure 10-4, the Mac version.
 
4. Zoom in on your photo so that you can get a good view of the eyes.
 
• Windows: Zoom and scroll the display using the controls labeled 
in Figure 10-3, which work the same way as they do when you view 
your photo in the initial Viewer window. Chapter 8 details all the 
controls, but here’s a quick reminder: The fastest way to zoom 
in and out is to drag the Zoom slider; to scroll the display, just 
drag in the Navigator window, which appears whenever the entire 
image isn’t visible at the current preview size. Or click the Hand 
tool, labeled in Figure 10-3, and drag in the preview itself.

• Mac: Zoom by choosing a magnification level from the Display Size 
drop-down list, labeled in Figure 10-4, or by clicking the Zoom In 
and Zoom Out buttons. The Mac version of the retouching window 
does not sport a Navigator window — instead, you use the scroll 
bars to scroll the display.

5. Click the Manual Mode option.
 
 In Auto mode, the red-eye correction tool can sometimes trip up, “cor-
recting” red pixels that aren’t actually in the eye, so stick with Manual 
mode, which enables you to specify exactly where you want the pro-
gram to do its retouching work.
 
6. In Windows, select the Red Eye tool, labeled in Figure 10-5.
 
 The tool is ready to go if it appears highlighted, as in the figure. If not, 
click the tool icon. Mac users can ignore this step.
 
Red Eye tool
 
Figure 10-5: The little green circle indicates the eye area that will be replaced.
 
7. Position your mouse cursor over one of the red eyes.
 
 If the program detects fixable red pixels, a green circle appears, as shown 
in Figure 10-5. The circle indicates the area that the tool will try to correct. 
As you move your cursor around the eye, the circle may change size as 
the program searches for pixels that meet its red-eye criteria.
 
8. Click to initiate the repair.
 
 If you like what you see, move on to the next eye. Or click Undo to get 
rid of the correction and then try again.

274
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
9. After you finish all eye repairs, click OK.
 
 The Red Eye Correction window closes, and your repaired photo 
appears in the Viewer window.
 
10. Save your picture in the TIFF file format.
 
 The last section of this chapter provides details.
 
Like most red-eye removal tools, the Canon version can do a good job in the 
right circumstances. But if the eyes are very bright, the tool may not be able 
to make the repair. In addition, no red-eye remover works on animal eyes; red-
eye tools detect and replace only red-eye pixels, and animal eyes typically turn 
yellow, white, or green in response to a flash. The best solution is to simply 
paint in the correct eye colors. For that type of retouching, you need a more 
capable photo-editing program; see Chapter 8 for a look at some options.
Cropping Your Photo
To crop a photo simply means to trim away some of its perimeter. Removing 
excess background can often improve an image, as illustrated by my original 
frog scene, shown on the left in Figure 10-6, and its cropped cousin, shown on 
the right. In the original image, there’s just too much going on — the eye has 
a hard time figuring out what’s important. Eliminating all but a little of the 
surrounding foliage returned emphasis to the subject and created a stronger 
composition.
 
You may also want to crop an image so that it fits a specific frame size. As 
Chapter 8 explains, the original images from your camera fit perfectly in 4-x-6-
inch frames, but if you want a 5 x 7, 8 x 10, or other standard print size, you 
need to crop your image to those new proportions. (If you don’t, the photo 
printer software or retail print lab will crop for you, and the result may not 
be the composition that you’d choose.)
Follow these steps to get the job done:
 
1. In the main browser window, double-click the image thumbnail.
 
 Your photo appears all by its lonesome in a new Viewer window.
 
2. Choose Trim (Windows) or Trimming Image (Mac) from the Edit drop-
down list.
 
 Refer to Figures 10-1 and 10-2, in the preceding section, if you need help 
finding the list.
 
 Your image appears in the Trim Image retouching window, and a dotted 
outline, called a crop box, appears around your photo, as shown in 
Figure 10-7.

275
 Chapter 10: Ten Fast Photo-Editing Tricks
 
 
Figure 10-6: Cropping creates a better composition, eliminating background clutter.
 
3. Click the Advanced Options button to display all the crop-size controls.
 
 Figure 10-7 labels the button and shows the controls that appear when 
you click it. (On a Mac, the control panel pops out of the side of the 
dialog box instead of appearing within it.)
 
4. Choose an option from the Aspect Ratio drop-down list.
 
 Your selection determines the proportions of the cropped image. You 
can go in three directions:
 
• Manual: This option enables you to crop the image to any propor-
tions. I chose this setting for my frog photo.
 
• Maintain Original: The program restricts you to cropping to the 
same proportions as your original, which is 3:2.
 
• Specific Aspect Ratios: You also can select from six specific aspect 
ratios: 2:3, 3:2, 3:4, 4:3, 9:16, and 16:9. The first number in the pair 
indicates the width, and the second indicates the height.
 
5. In Windows, make sure that the Trim button is selected (refer to 
Figure 10-7).
 
 It should already be selected unless you used the adjacent controls to 
zoom or scroll the preview. Just click the button to select it if needed. 
Mac users can skip this step.

Handle

Figure 10-7: You can specify a crop size via the Advanced Options controls.
 
6. Adjust the size and position of the crop box as needed.
 
 Use these techniques:
 
• Move the crop box. Drag inside the box.
 
• Resize the crop box. Drag any of the handles — those little squares 
around the perimeter of the crop box. I labeled one of the handles 
in Figure 10-7.
 
 As you drag the handles, the W and H boxes in the Size of Trimming 
Area portion of the dialog box reflect the new dimensions of the 
crop box, with the measurement shown in pixels. Keep in mind that 
pixel count is critical to print quality. Chapters 3 and 9 provide 
details, but the short story is that you need roughly 200 to 300 pixels 
per linear inch of your print. So if you have a finished print size in 
mind, monitor the W and H values as you adjust the crop box size to 
make sure that you aren’t clipping away too many pixels.

277
 Chapter 10: Ten Fast Photo-Editing Tricks
 
• Set a specific crop size. You also can enter specific pixel dimen-
sions in the W and H boxes. The crop box automatically adjusts to 
the dimensions you enter.
 
 Using the third option is the easiest way to crop your photo to a size 
that doesn’t mesh with any of the specific aspect ratio choices. Say that 
you want to produce a 5-x-7-inch print from your cropped photo, and 
you want an image resolution of 300 pixels per inch. Just multiply the 
print dimensions by the desired resolution and then enter those values 
into the W and H boxes. For the 5 x 7 at 300 ppi example, the W and H 
values are 1500 and 2100, respectively. If the resulting crop boundary 
encompasses too much or too little of your photo, just keep adjusting 
the W and H values, making sure to always keep the two at the same pro-
portions you originally entered.
 
7. Turn on the Use the Rule of Thirds gridlines (optional).
 
 A classic composition rule is to imagine that your image is divided into 
thirds vertically and horizontally and then position the subject at a spot 
where two dividing lines intersect. To help you visualize that concept, 
the Trim box can display those horizontal and vertical grid lines as 
shown in Figure 10-8. Just click the Use the Rule of Thirds check box to 
toggle the grid on and off.
 
Display grid
 
Figure 10-8: The Rule of Thirds gridlines offer a compositional guide.
 
8. When you’re happy with the crop box, click the Trim Image button.
 
 The cropped photo appears in the preview. If you don’t like the results, 
click the Undo button and try again.
 
9. Click OK to close the retouching window.
 
10. Choose File➪Save As to save your cropped image.
 
 The last section of this chapter has details.

Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Adjusting Color Saturation
Saturation refers to the intensity and purity of color. A fully saturated color 
contains no black, white, or gray. In other words, saturated colors are deep, 
rich, and bold.
On occasion, an image can benefit from a little saturation bump. Figure 10-9 
offers an example. I was drawn to this scene by the mix of colors, and the 
original photo, shown on the left, seemed a little lackluster in that regard. So 
I increased the saturation ever so slightly to produce the image shown on 
the right.
 
Original
Increased saturation
 
Figure 10-9: I slightly increased saturation to make the colors pop a little more.
 
Be careful about increasing saturation too much, however. Doing so actually 
can destroy picture detail as areas that previously contained a range of satu-
ration levels all shift to the fully saturated state. 
Whichever direction you want to go, take these steps to adjust saturation:
 
1. In the main browser window, double-click the image thumbnail.
 
 Your photo opens inside its own Viewer window.
 
2. Click the Edit drop-down list.
 
 The list appears above the image preview in Windows; it appears below 
the preview on a Mac.

279
 Chapter 10: Ten Fast Photo-Editing Tricks
 
3. Choose Color/Brightness Adjustment from the list.
 
 Your image appears in the Color/Brightness Adjustment retouching 
window. The window contents vary depending whether you’re using the 
Windows or Mac version of the program; Figures 10-10 and 10-11 show 
you both versions.

Figure 10-11: In Windows, select Color Adjustment from the top drop-down list.

280
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
4. Set the Retouching mode to Color Adjustment.
 
• Windows: Select Color Adjustment from the drop-down list at the 
top of the window (refer to Figure 10-10). After you do so, the 
window offers three sliders: Brightness, Saturation, and Contrast.
 
• Mac: Click the Color Adjustment button. The Mac version of the 
tool offers just a Saturation and Brightness slider.
 
 One note about the Brightness and Contrast controls: These tools 
aren’t the best options for adjusting exposure and contrast. You can 
get much better results by using the Level Adjustment and Tone Curve 
Adjustment tools, both explained later in this chapter.
 
5. Drag the Saturation slider to adjust the image as desired.
 
6. Click OK to apply the change and close the retouching window.
 
7. Save the edited image, following the steps provided at the end of this 
chapter.
Tweaking Color Balance
Chapter 6 explains how to use your camera’s white balance and Picture 
Style controls to manipulate the colors in your pictures. If you can’t get the 
results you want by using those features, you may be able to do the job using 
the RGB Adjustment filter offered by the Canon browser. In Figure 10-12, for 
example, I used the filter to tone down the amount of blue in the image and 
bring out the warm yellow tones of the building instead.
Follow these steps to use the filter:
 
1. Open the image in its own Viewer window.
 
 You do this by double-clicking the image thumbnail in the main browser 
window.
 
2. Choose Color/Brightness Adjustment from the Edit drop-down list.
 
 Look for the list above the image preview if you’re a Windows user; on a 
Mac, the list is below the preview. After you choose the command, your 
photo appears in a retouching window. Figure 10-13 shows you both the 
Windows and Mac versions of the window.
 
3. Select RGB Adjustment as the edit mode.
 
 In Windows, select that option from the drop-down list at the top of the 
window, as shown in the top image in Figure 10-13. On a Mac, just click 
the RGB Adjustment button, as shown in the lower image. Either way, 
you gain access to three sliders: Red, Green, and Blue.
 
4. Drag the sliders to adjust image colors.

Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
 The filter is based on three color pairs: red-cyan; green-magenta; and 
blue-yellow. (Those six colors happen to be the primary and secondary 
colors of the RGB color world, which is the one in which all digital 
images reside.) As you move the sliders, you affect both the primary 
color and its secondary opposite, as follows:
 
• Red slider: As you drag the slider to the right, you increase red 
and decrease cyan. Drag the slider to the left to diminish reds and 
embolden cyans.
 
• Green slider: Drag this slider to the right to add green and reduce 
magenta. Drag to the left to produce the opposite result.
 
• Blue slider: Dragging this slider to the right increases the amount of 
blue and reduces the amount of yellow. Go the other direction to 
increase yellow and tone down blues.
 
 In imaging lingo, tools of this type are known as color balancing filters 
because they shift the balance between the two opposite colors.
 
 I used the slider settings shown in the figure for my photo.

Adjusting Exposure
Getting exposure just right is one of the trickiest aspects of photogra-
phy. Fortunately, the Canon software gives you several tools for tweaking 
exposure. The next sections introduce the two most capable: the Level 
Adjustment filter and the Tone Curve Adjustment filter.
 
Stay away from the exposure options that appear when you open the Color 
Adjustment filter (shown in Figures 10-10 and 10-11, however. In Windows, 
the filter offers a Brightness and Contrast slider; on a Mac, you get just the 
Brightness slider. The problem is that both sliders affect all pixels in your 
image; you can’t brighten just the shadows, for example, without also bright-
ening the midtones (areas of medium brightness) and highlights. For that 
reason, these sliders rarely produce good results.
Three-point exposure control with 
the Level Adjustment filter
With this filter, you can adjust shadows, midtones, and highlights individu-
ally. Figure 10-14 shows the filter as it appears in Windows; the Mac version 
contains the same options in a slightly different layout.

 Chapter 10: Ten Fast Photo-Editing Tricks
 
 
Figure 10-14: The Level Adjustment tool isn’t nearly as difficult to use as it appears.
Now, I know what you’re thinking: “Wow, that looks way too complicated 
for me.” Trust me, though, that this filter is actually pretty easy to use. First, 
ignore everything but the graph in the middle of the box, known as a his-
togram, and the three sliders underneath, labeled Shadows, Midtones, and 
Highlights in Figure 10-15. See? Easier already.
 
Shadows
Midtones
Highlights
 
Figure 10-15: All you need to worry about are these three sliders.

Part IV: The Part of Tens 
The histogram works just like the Brightness histogram that you can display 
while reviewing your images on your camera monitor, a topic that I discuss in 
Chapter 4. To recap, the horizontal axis of the graph represents the possible 
brightness values in an image, ranging from black on the left side to white 
on the right. The vertical axis shows you how many pixels fall at a particular 
brightness value. So if you have a tall spike, you have lots of pixels at that 
brightness value.
To adjust exposure, you just drag the three sliders underneath the histo-
gram, depending on whether you want to shift shadows, midtones, or high-
lights. Take these steps to try it out:
 
1. In the main browser window, double-click the image thumbnail to 
open it in a new Viewer window.
 
2. Open the Level Adjustment retouching window.
 
• In Windows: Choose Color/Brightness Adjustment from the Edit 
drop-down list, found above the image preview. Then select Level 
Adjustment from the drop-down list at the top of the retouching 
window, as shown in Figure 10-14.
 
• On a Mac: Choose Level Adjustment from the Edit drop-down list, 
which appears underneath the image preview.
 
3. Set the Channel option to RGB.
 
 On a Mac, the option is unlabeled; it’s the pop-up list above the histogram.
 
4. Drag the sliders underneath the histogram to adjust exposure.
 
• To darken shadows: Drag the Shadows slider to the right.
 
• To adjust midtones: Drag the middle slider to the right to darken 
midtones; drag it to the left to brighten them.
 
• To brighten highlights: Drag the Highlights slider to the left.
 
 As you drag the Shadows or Highlights slider, the Midtones slider moves 
in tandem. So you may need to readjust that slider after you set the 
other two.
 
 You can compare your original image with the adjusted one by toggling 
the dialog box preview on and off. In Windows, click the Show Original 
Image box to turn off the preview; click again to return to the preview. 
On a Mac, click the Preview box instead.
 
 I dragged the sliders to the positions shown in Figure 10-16 to produce 
the results you see in the preview.
 
5. Click OK to accept the changes and close the dialog box.
 
6. Save your image in the TIFF file format.
 
 See the last section of this chapter to find out how.

 Chapter 10: Ten Fast Photo-Editing Tricks
 
 
Figure 10-16: I brightened highlights and midtones but darkened shadows slightly.
Gaining more control with the 
Tone Curve Adjustment filter
With the Level Adjustment filter, you get three points of exposure-correction 
control — highlights, shadows, and midtones. The Tone Curve Adjustment 
filter takes things a step further, enabling you to manipulate specific values 
along the entire brightness spectrum.
Figure 10-17 offers a look at the Windows version of the Tone Curve 
Adjustment retouching window. The Mac version is slightly different in 
appearance, but it contains the same main components.
Again, the controls inside the window seem mighty perplexing at first. But 
here’s all you need to know to take advantage of the filter:
 
✓ See that line that runs diagonally through the white grid? That’s just 
another representation of the possible brightness values in a digital 
image. Black falls at the lower end of the line; white, at the top. (The 
shaded bars that run alongside the left and lower edges of the grid remind 
you of that orientation.) Medium brightness falls dead center on the line.
 
✓ To adjust exposure, click and drag at the spot on the line that corresponds 
to the brightness value you want to change. Drag up to brighten the image; 
drag down to darken it. For example, in Figure 10-18, I dragged the center of 
the line up. The resulting curve — tone curve, in imaging parlance — 
produced the exposure change shown in the preview.

286
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
 
Figure 10-17: With the Tone Curve Adjustment filter, you get even greater exposure 
 
control.
 
✓ After a drag, a control point appears at the spot on the line you dragged 
to anchor that part of the tone curve, as shown in Figure 10-18.
 
✓ You can bend the tone curve as much as you want, in any direction you 
want. Just keep clicking and dragging to add control points. But be 
careful — extreme curves or curves with tons of points can produce 
really ugly results and odd breaks in color and brightness. I usually aim 
for a gentle curve that has no more than six points, including the ones 
that are provided automatically at the black and white ends of the curve.
 
✓ To increase contrast, create an s-shaped curve; to decrease contrast, 
create a reverse-s shape. I used the gentle s-shaped curve, shown in 
Figure 10-19, to produce the finished mushroom photo that you see in 
the preview. The curve resulted in a slight bump in exposure to medium 
and medium bright pixels and a slight darkening of medium dark and 
dark pixels. The white and black areas of the image remain unchanged.
The best way to understand this filter is to try it for yourself. So take these steps:
 
1. Open the image in its own Viewer window.
 
 You know the drill: Just double-click the thumbnail in the main browser 
window. (See Chapter 8 if you need help.)

2. Open the Tone Curve Adjustment retouching window.
 
• Windows: Click the Edit drop-down list at the top of the browser 
window and choose Adjust Color/Brightness. When the retouching 
window appears, select Tone Curve Adjustment from the drop-
down list at the top.
 
• Mac: Click the Edit drop-down list underneath the image preview 
and choose Tone Curve Adjustment.
 
3. Set the Channel option to RGB.
 
 On a Mac, the option is the unlabeled pop-up list just above the grid.
 
4. Bend the tone curve by adding and dragging control points.
 
 See the preceding list for details on this step. If you need to delete a 
point, click it to select it and then press Delete. (The selected control 
point appears black.)
 
 If your image doesn’t appear to change in the preview, check the status 
of the box labeled Show Original Image. Deselect the box to turn on the 
dialog box preview.
 
5. Click OK to apply the adjustment and close the retouching window.
 
6. Save your image in the TIFF file format, following the steps at the end 
of this chapter.
Sharpening Focus (Sort Of)
Have you ever seen one of those spy-movie thrillers where the good guys 
capture a photo of the villain’s face — only the picture is so blurry that it 
could just as easily be a picture of pudding? The heroes ask the photo-lab 
experts to “enhance” the picture, and within seconds, it’s transformed into 
an image so clear you can make out individual hairs in the villain’s mustache.
It is with heavy heart that I tell you that this kind of image rescue is pure 
Hollywood fantasy. You simply can’t take a blurry image and turn it into a 
sharply focused photo, even with the most sophisticated photo software on 
the market. There is, however, a digital process called sharpening that can 
slightly enhance the apparent focus of pictures that are slightly blurry, as 
illustrated by the before and after images in Figure 10-20. Notice that I say 
“apparent” focus: Sharpening doesn’t really adjust focus but instead creates 
the illusion of sharper focus by increasing contrast in a special way.

289
 Chapter 10: Ten Fast Photo-Editing Tricks
 
Original
Sharpened
 
Figure 10-20: A slightly blurry image (left) can benefit from a sharpening filter (right).
Here’s how it works: Wherever pixels of different colors come together, the 
sharpening process boosts contrast along the border between them. The 
light side of the border gets lighter; the dark side gets darker. Photography 
experts refer to those light and dark strips as sharpening halos. You can get 
a close-up look at the halos in the right, sharpened example in Figure 10-21, 
which shows a tiny portion of the pencil image from Figure 10-20. Notice that 
in the sharpened example, the yellow side of the boundary between the pen-
cils received a light halo, and the blue side received a dark halo.
 
A little sharpening can go a long way toward improving a slightly soft image. 
But too much sharpening does more damage than good. The halos become 
so strong that they’re clearly visible, and the image takes on a sandpaper-like 
texture. And again, no amount of sharpening can repair a truly out-of-focus 
image, so all you do when you crank up sharpening is make matters worse.
Both the Windows and Mac versions of the Canon software offer a simple 
Sharpening tool, shown in its Mac incarnation in Figure 10-22. To use this 
tool, just follow the usual steps: Double-click the image thumbnail to open 
it in its own Viewer window and then choose Sharpness from the Edit drop-

290

down list. (See Figures 10-1 and 10-2 if you have trouble finding the list.) Drag 
the slider to the right to add sharpening and then click OK to finish the job.
 
Original
Sharpened
 
Figure 10-21: Sharpening adds light and dark halos along color boundaries.
 
 
Figure 10-22: The Mac version of the browser offers only a simple sharpening slider.
 
Windows users, however, have the option of using a more flexible sharpen-
ing tool, called an Unsharp Mask filter. To switch to this filter, just click the 
Unsharp Mask tab at the top of the Sharpness retouching window, as shown 
in Figure 10-23

291
 Chapter 10: Ten Fast Photo-Editing Tricks
 
 
Figure 10-23: The Unsharp Mask filter provides three levels of sharpening control.
The three sliders provided for the Unsharp Mask filter enable you to control 
where and how the sharpening halos are applied, as follows:
 
✓ Amount: This slider adjusts the intensity of the sharpening halos.
 
✓ Radius: This slider adjusts the width of the halos. Don’t go too high, or 
else the sharpening halos will become very noticeable.
 
✓ Threshold: With this slider, you can limit the sharpening effect just to 
high-contrast color boundaries. Try raising the value a few notches up 
from 0 when sharpening portraits to sharpen the image without adding 
unwanted texture to the skin. I also used this technique to keep the 
surface of the pencils smooth in my photo while sharpening the edges 
between them.
 
Whichever sharpening filter you use, don’t forget to save the altered image in 
the TIFF file format. The last section of this chapter explains this critical part 
of the retouching process.

292
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Shifting to AutoPilot
You may have noticed as you explored the Edit drop-down list an option 
called Auto Adjustment. If you select this option, the program opens your 
image in a retouching window, as usual. Figure 10-24 shows the Windows 
flavor of the window; the Mac version is virtually identical. After the window 
opens, you simply click the Auto Adjust Image button and sit back and wait. 
The program analyzes your image and then makes whatever changes it 
deems necessary. You can compare the “before” and “after” views of your 
photo by clicking the Show Original Image box on and off.
 
 
Figure 10-24: Click Auto Adjust Image to see what changes the program thinks are 
 
needed.
As a rule, I don’t recommend this type of automatic image correction tool 
because it so often doesn’t produce results as good as what you can do by 
using the manual filter controls. That said, if you aren’t working on important 
images or you just don’t have the time or interest in using the more sophis-
ticated tools, go ahead and give that Auto Adjust Image button a click. If you 
don’t like what you see, click the Cancel button and do the job yourself, using 
the tricks laid out elsewhere in this chapter.

293
 Chapter 10: Ten Fast Photo-Editing Tricks
Adding Text
You know that saying, “A picture is worth a thousand words.” Well, you can 
increase that count by adding text to your photo. You can do so as follows:
 
1. Open your photo in its own Viewer window by double-clicking the 
image thumbnail in the main browser window.
 
2. Choose Insert Text from the Edit drop-down list.
 
 Look for the list at the top of the window if you use the Windows version 
of the program and at the bottom if you’re a Mac user. Either way, you 
see your photo in the Insert Text retouching window. Figure 10-25 gives 
you a look at the Windows version of the window. (Again, the Mac ver-
sion is virtually identical except for sporting different controls for zoom-
ing and scrolling the display. See the first section of this chapter for help 
with those controls.)
 
 
Figure 10-25: You can add captions and other text information.

294
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
3. Click in the preview at the spot you want to add the text.
 
 (In Windows, be sure that the Text tool, located under the preview, next 
to the Zoom tools, is selected before you click.) After you click, a text 
box appears, as shown in the figure. At any time, you can resize the box 
as needed by dragging the little boxes that appear around its perimeter. 
To move the box (and any text inside), just drag inside the box.
 
4. Type your text.
 
 The text appears both in the image preview and in the Text area on the 
right side of the window.
 
 If you want to add the date and time you shot the picture, just click the 
Import Shooting Date/Time button, and the program finds the data in the 
image file and adds it to the text box for you. Similarly, if you added com-
ment text when organizing your pictures in the main browser, clicking the 
Import Comment button enters that text for you. (You can add comments 
via the Comment pane that appears when you browse images in Preview 
display mode. Chapter 8 explains the basics of browsing images.)
 
5. Use the controls at the top of the dialog box to set the type 
characteristics.
 
 You can specify a font (type design), size, and color and add bold, 
underline, or italic formatting.
 
 The Antialias option smoothes the jagged edges that can occur when 
letters contain diagonal or curved lines. As a rule, keeping this option 
enabled is a good idea.
 
6. When you finish creating your text, click OK.
 
 The retouching window closes.
 
7. Save your edited file as outlined in the next section.
Saving Your Edited Files
Whatever retouching task you do, the last step is to save your edited picture 
file. After you click OK to close the retouching window and return to the 
Viewer window, choose the Save As command from the File menu. You then 
see the standard Windows or Mac file-saving dialog box that appears when 
you save any type of file.

295
 Chapter 10: Ten Fast Photo-Editing Tricks
You need to take two critical steps inside the dialog box:
 
✓ Select TIFF as the file type. TIFF is an image file format that produces 
the best picture quality for saved images.
 
 Do not use JPEG as the file type. Every time you edit and save a picture 
in the JPEG format, you damage the picture quality slightly because of 
the lossy compression that is applied in that format. Chapter 3 has details 
on this issue. Should you need a JPEG version of your edited photo for 
online use, save it first as a TIFF file and then follow the steps provided 
in Chapter 9 to create a Web-sized copy of the picture in the JPEG 
format.
 
✓ Type a name for the picture in the File Name box (Windows) or the 
Save As box (Mac). The filename of the original image appears automati-
cally in the box. You don’t have to change the filename — you won’t 
overwrite the original file when you save because you aren’t saving it in 
the JPEG format (and you can’t save in the Raw format). But I like to add 
a tag to the filename that indicates the status of the image — for example, 
IMG_7582 retouched, or PencilsSharpened, or the like.
After taking care of those two pieces of business, specify where you want to 
store the file as you usually do. Then click the Save button to save the file 
and close the dialog box.

Ten Special-Purpose Features to 
Explore on a Rainy Day
In This Chapter
▶ Customizing the function of the Set button
▶ Changing the focus and exposure locking controls
▶ Disabling the autofocus-assist beam
▶ Using mirror lockup for shake-free shooting
▶ Recording Dust Delete Data
▶ Wallpapering your computer monitor with a favorite image
▶ Creating custom menus
C
onsider this chapter the literary equivalent of the end 
of one of those late-night infomercial offers — the 
part where the host exclaims, “But wait! There’s more!”
The ten features covered in these pages fit the cat-
egory of “interesting bonus.” They aren’t the sort 
of features that drive people to choose one camera 
over another, and they may come in handy only for 
certain users, on certain occasions. Still, they’re 
included at no extra charge with your camera, so 
check ’em out when you have a few spare moments. 
Who knows; you may discover that one of these 
bonus features is actually a hidden gem that provides 
just the solution you need for one of your photography 
problems.
 
Many of the features I discuss here involve Custom Functions, a 
group of 12 advanced options that you access via Setup Menu 3. If you’re not 
familiar with how to navigate the Custom Functions, the next section spells 
things out.

298
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Changing the Function of the Set Button
Normally, the Set button serves three functions: When a menu is displayed, 
you press the button to lock in menu selections. When a menu is not dis-
played, you can press the button to turn the monitor on and off instead of 
using the DISP button. And if you enable Live View shooting, a feature intro-
duced in Chapter 4, you press Set to switch from normal shooting to Live 
View mode.
 
To make the Set button more helpful when Live View is not enabled, you can 
change the function of the button so that pressing it displays the Quality 
options or the Flash Exposure Compensation options. Doing so enables you 
to access those settings more quickly than by using the menus.
You also can assign the Set button the same function as the Menu button, in 
which case you can use either button to display the menus. You can also dis-
able the button entirely so that it works only when you’re choosing options 
from menus. I don’t think either of these options is terribly useful, but you be 
the judge.
To customize the button, take these steps:
 
1. Set your camera to one of the advanced exposure modes (P, Tv, Av, M, 
or A-DEP).
 
 You can’t adjust the performance of the Set button in the fully automatic 
exposure modes. Nor does the button perform whatever alternative 
function you may assign when the camera is set to those modes.
 
2. Display Setup Menu 3 and highlight Custom Functions, as shown on 
the left in Figure 11-1.
 
 This menu item enables you to customize 12 aspects of the camera’s 
performance.
 
3. Press Set.
 
 The screen should look something like the one on the right in Figure 11-1, 
at least along the bottom of the screen. What appears in the rest of the 
screen depends on which Custom Function is selected.
 
 The Custom Functions are grouped into four categories. The category 
number and name appear in the top-left corner of the screen; the 
number of the selected function appears in the top-right corner and is 
marked with a bar at the bottom of the screen. And the blue text indi-
cates the current setting of the selected Custom Function. You also can 
see the number of the option that’s selected at the bottom of the screen, 
underneath the Custom Function number. A zero represents the default 
setting.

Figure 11-1: The Custom Function menu item provides access to 12 customization options.
 
4. If needed, press the right or left 
cross key to display Custom 
Function 10.
 
 Now you should see the options 
shown on the right in Figure 11-1.
 
5. Press the Set button.
 
 Now the list of options for 
Custom Function 10 becomes 
accessible, and a yellow high-
light box appears around one 
of the options, as shown in 
Figure 11-2. Again, the option 
that appears in blue is the 
selected setting; 0 represents 
the default setting.
 
6. Press the up or down cross keys to highlight your choice.
 
 I highlighted the Flash Exposure Compensation option in Figure 11-2.
 
7. Press the Set button.
Now whenever you shoot in the advanced exposure modes and press Set 
while no menus are displayed, the button takes on the function you just 
assigned to it. To go back to the default setting, repeat these steps and select 
option 0 in Step 6. The button then turns the monitor on and off when no 
menu is displayed, just like the DISP button.
Figure 11-2: You can use the Set button 
to access Flash Exposure Compensation 
settings.

Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
Again, though, your custom Set button is available only when Live View is 
disabled (through Setup Menu 2) and only when you set the Mode dial to one 
of the advanced exposure modes (P, Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP). In Live View mode, 
the button always toggles the Live View preview on and off.
Customizing Exposure and Focus Lock Options
By default, pressing your shutter button 
halfway establishes and locks focus when 
you use autofocusing. When you shoot in 
the advanced autoexposure modes, you 
also can lock in the exposure settings 
the camera selects by pressing and hold-
ing the AE (autoexposure) Lock button, 
labeled in Figure 11-3.
You can customize the locking behaviors 
of the two buttons via Custom Function 
9. Here’s how:
 
1. Set the Mode dial to an advanced 
exposure setting.
 
 
As with all Custom Functions, you 
can take advantage of this option 
only in the P, Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP 
exposure mode. Additionally, the 
locking setup you specify applies only to those modes.
 
2. Display Setup Menu 3, highlight Custom Functions, and press Set.
 
3. Select Custom Function 9.
 
 Press the right or left cross key 
to scroll through the Custom 
Functions.
 
4. Press Set to activate the list of 
settings, as shown in Figure 11-4.
 
 
A highlight box appears, as 
shown in the figure. The option 
that appears in blue text is the 
current setting; option number 0 
represents the default setting.
 
5. Press the up and down cross 
keys to highlight the option you 
want to use.

 You have the following four choices. (The first part of the setting name 
indicates what happens with a half-press of the shutter button; the 
second part indicates the function of the AE Lock button.)
 
• AF/AE Lock: This is the default setting. Pressing the shutter button 
halfway establishes and locks autofocus; pressing the AE Lock 
button locks autoexposure.
 
• AE Lock/AF: With this option, pressing the shutter button halfway 
locks autoexposure instead of focus. To initiate autofocusing, you 
instead press the AE Lock button. In other words, this mode is the 
exact opposite of the default setup.
 
• AF/AF Lock, no AE Lock: This mode is designed to prevent focusing 
mishaps when you use AI Servo autofocusing, explained in Chapter 
6. Here’s the deal: In the AI Servo mode, the autofocus motor con-
tinually adjusts focus from the time you press the shutter button 
halfway until the time you actually take the image. This feature 
helps you keep moving objects sharply focused. But if something 
moves in front of your subject, the camera may mistakenly focus 
on that object, which may leave your subject blurry.
 
 To cope with that possibility, this locking option enables you to 
initiate autofocusing as usual, by pressing the shutter button half-
way. But at any time before you take the picture, you can press 
the AE Lock button to temporarily stop the autofocusing motor 
from adjusting focus if an intruder moves into the frame. When you 
release the button, the autofocusing mechanism starts up again.
 
 If you choose this option, autoexposure is set when you press the 
shutter button all the way. You can’t lock autoexposure.
 
• AE/AF, no AE Lock: Similar to the preceding mode, this one also 
is designed to help you capture moving subjects in the AI Servo 
mode. Pressing the shutter button halfway initiates autoexposure 
metering, which is adjusted continuously as needed until the time 
you snap the picture. Pressing the AE Lock button starts the auto-
focusing servo system; releasing the button stops it. You cannot 
lock autoexposure in this mode.
 
6. Press the Set button to finalize your choice.
 
 Now when you shoot in an advanced exposure mode, the camera locks 
focus and exposure according to the option you selected. In the fully 
automatic modes, the settings have no effect; you still press the shutter 
button halfway to focus, and you can’t lock autoexposure.

302
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Disabling the AF-Assist Beam
In dim lighting, your camera may emit an AF (autofocus)-assist beam from 
the built-in flash when you press the shutter button halfway — assuming that 
the flash unit is open, of course. This pulse of light helps the camera “see” its 
target better, improving the performance of the autofocusing system.
If you’re shooting in a situation where the AF-assist beam may be distracting 
to your subject or to others in the room, you can disable it. Take these steps 
to control this aspect of your camera:
 
1. Set the Mode dial to P, Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP.
 
 As with the other customization options discussed in preceding sec-
tions, this one is available only in these advanced exposure modes.
 
2. Display Setup Menu 3, highlight Custom Functions, and press Set.
 
 You’re taken to the main launching pad for adjusting all the Custom 
Functions.
 
3. Press the right or left cross key as needed to select Custom Function 6.
 
4. Press the Set button.
 
 Now the options shown in Figure 
11-5 become accessible.
 
5. Press the up or down cross key 
to highlight your desired setting.
 
 Setting 1 disables the AF-assist 
beam of both the built-in flash 
and compatible Canon EX-series 
Speedlite external flash units. 
Setting 2 disables the beam of the 
built-in flash while allowing the 
beam of a compatible EX-series 
Speedlite to function normally.
 
6. Press the Set button.
 
 Your chosen setting affects all 
the advanced exposure modes. In fully automatic modes, the autofocus 
assist beam continues to light from the built-in flash when the camera 
deems it necessary.
 
Without the aid of the assist beam, the camera may have trouble autofocus-
ing in dim lighting. The easiest solution is to simply focus manually; Chapter 
1 shows you how.
Figure 11-5: You can disable the 
autofocus-assist beam.

303
 Chapter 11: Ten Special-Purpose Features to Explore on a Rainy Day
Enabling Mirror Lockup
One of the components involved in the optical system of an SLR camera is a 
tiny mirror that moves when you press the shutter button. The small vibra-
tion caused by the movement of the mirror can result in slight blurring of 
the image when you use a very slow shutter speed, shoot with a long tele-
photo lens, or take extreme close-up shots. To eliminate the possibility, your 
camera offers a feature called mirror lockup. When you enable this feature, 
the mirror movement is completed well before the shot is recorded, thus pre-
venting any camera shake.
To try out this feature, take these steps:
 
1. Set the Mode dial to an advanced exposure mode.
 
 Mirror lockup isn’t available in the fully automatic exposure modes. So 
set that dial to P, Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP.
 
2. Display Setup Menu 3, highlight Custom Functions, and press Set.
 
3. Press the right or left cross key to scroll to Custom Function 8.
 
4. Press Set to access the options 
shown in Figure 11-6.
 
5. Press the up or down cross key 
to highlight the Enable option, 
as shown in the figure.
 
6. Press the Set button.
 
After you enable mirror lockup, you 
take a slightly different approach to 
picture-taking than usual. Use this 
technique:
 
1. Frame your shot.
 
2. If using autofocus, press and 
hold the shutter button halfway 
to lock focus.
 
 Or, if you prefer manual focusing, twist the focusing ring as needed to 
focus the image.
 
3. Press the shutter button all the way down to lock up the mirror. Then 
release the button.
 
 At this point, you can no longer see anything through the viewfinder. 
Don’t panic — that’s normal. The mirror’s function is to enable you to 
see in the viewfinder the scene that the lens will capture, and mirror 
lockup prevents it from serving that purpose.
Figure 11-6: Mirror lockup prevents camera 
shake caused by the movement of the optical 
system’s mirror.

Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
4. Press the shutter button all the way again.
 
 The camera then takes the picture.
 
Using a tripod or other support is critical to getting a shake-free shot in situ-
ations that call for mirror lockup. For even more protection, set your camera 
to the 2-second self-timer mode, introduced in Chapter 2, and take your 
hands completely off the camera after you press the shutter button in Step 3. 
The picture is taken two seconds after the mirror lockup occurs. If you pur-
chased the remote-control unit for your camera, you instead can trigger the 
shutter button using it.
Adding Cleaning Instructions to Images
You’ve no doubt noticed that your camera displays a message that says 
“Sensor Cleaning” every time you turn off the camera. And when you turn on 
the camera, a little “cleaning” icon flickers in the lower-right corner of the 
Shooting Settings display. These alerts tell you that the camera is performing 
a self-maintenance step that is designed to remove from the sensor any dust 
particles that may have made their way into the camera interior.
 
If you don’t see these alerts, open Setup Menu 2, choose the Sensor Cleaning 
option, and then press Set. Next, set the Auto Cleaning option to Enable. 
(There’s really no reason to disable this feature, although Canon gives you 
the choice to do so.)
The automated sensor cleaning normally is all that’s necessary to keep the 
sensor dust-free. But if you notice that small spots are appearing consistently 
on your images, you may need to step in and take action on your own.
The best solution, of course, is to take your camera to a good repair shop 
and have the sensor professionally cleaned. I do not recommend that you 
take on this job yourself; it’s a delicate procedure, and you can easily ruin 
your camera.
Until you can have the camera cleaned, however, you can use a feature on 
Shooting Menu 2 to create a custom dust-removal filter that you can apply in 
Digital Photo Professional, which is one of the free programs that ships with 
your camera.
The first step in creating the filter is to record a data file that maps the loca-
tion of the dust spots on the sensor. To do this, you need a white piece of 
paper or other white surface and a lens that can achieve a focal length of 
55mm or greater. (The kit lens on the Rebel XS/1000D qualifies.) Then take 
these steps:

305
 Chapter 11: Ten Special-Purpose Features to Explore on a Rainy Day
 
1. Set the lens focal length at 55mm or longer.
 
 If you own the kit lens, just zoom in as far as possible, which sets the 
focal length at 55mm.
 
2. Switch the camera to manual focusing.
 
 On the kit lens, move the focus switch on the lens from AF to MF.
 
3. Set focus at infinity.
 
 Some lenses have a marking that indicates the infinity position — the 
symbol looks like a number 8 lying on its side. If your lens doesn’t have 
the marking, hold the camera so that the lens is facing you and then turn 
the lens focusing ring clockwise until it stops.
 
4. Set the camera to one of the advanced exposure modes (P, Tv, Av, M, 
or A-DEP).
 
 You can create the dust data file only in these modes.
 
5. Display Shooting Menu 2 and highlight Dust Delete Data, as shown on 
the left in Figure 11-7.
 
 
Figure 11-7: You can record dust-removal data that can be read by Digital Photo Professional.
 
6. Press the Set button.
 
 Now you see the Dust Delete Data message shown on the right in 
Figure 11-7.
 
7. Press the right cross key to highlight OK and then press Set.
 
 The camera performs its normal automatic sensor-cleaning ritual, which 
takes a second or two. Then you see the instruction screen shown on 
the left in Figure 11-8.

306
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
 
Figure 11-8: The Dust Delete Data is recorded when you press the shutter button all the way.
 
8. Position the camera so that it’s about 8 to 12 inches from your white 
card or piece of paper.
 
 Your card or paper needs to be large enough to completely fill the view-
finder at this distance.
 
9. Press the shutter button all the way to record the Dust Delete Data.
 
 No picture is taken; the camera just records the Dust Delete Data in its 
internal memory. If the process was successful, you see the congratula-
tory message shown on the right in Figure 11-8.
 
 If the camera tells you that it couldn’t record the data, the lighting con-
ditions are likely to blame. Make sure that the lighting is even across 
the entire surface of your white card or paper and that the paper is suf-
ficiently illuminated and then try again.
 
10. Press the Set button.
 
 The current date now appears on the initial Dust Delete Data screen 
(shown on the right in Figure 11-7).
After you create your Dust Delete Data file, the camera attaches the data to 
every subsequent image, regardless of whether you shoot in the fully auto-
matic or advanced exposure modes.
To clean a photo, open it in Digital Photo Professional and choose Start 
Stamp Tool from the Tools menu. Your photo then appears in an editing 
window; click the Apply Dust Delete Data button to start the automated dust-
busting feature. The program’s manual and Help system offer details about 
this process; look for the Help entry related to using the Copy Stamp tool.

Turning Off the Shooting Settings Screen
When you turn on your camera, the monitor automatically turns on and 
displays the Shooting Settings screen. At least, it does if you stick with the 
default setting selected for Custom Function 11, which bears the lengthy 
name LCD Display When Power On.
You can prevent the monitor from displaying the screen every time you 
power up the camera, if you choose. The monitor is one of the biggest drains 
on the camera battery, so limiting it to displaying information only when you 
need it can extend the time between battery charges.
 
As with other Custom Functions, this option works only when the camera is 
set to one of the advanced exposure modes — in other modes, the screen 
still appears automatically. Still, any battery savings can be helpful when 
you’re running low on juice.
To take advantage of this feature, take these steps:
 
1. Set the camera to P, Tv, Av, M, or A-DEP mode.
 
2. Display Setup Menu 3, highlight Custom Functions, and press Set.
 
3. Use the cross keys to select Custom Function 11 and then press Set.
 
 You see the screen shown in 
Figure 11-9.
 
4. Press the up or down cross key 
to highlight Retain Power Off 
Status.
 
5. Press Set.
 
6. Press the DISP button to turn off 
the monitor.
 
7. Turn off the camera.
 
When you turn on the camera again, the 
monitor will not automatically display 
the Shooting Settings screen — as long 
as the Mode dial is set to an advanced 
shooting mode, that is. Nor will the screen appear when you press the shutter 
button halfway, as it normally does.
Figure 11-9: You can prevent the monitor 
from turning on automatically when you 
power up the camera.

308
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
To view the screen, press the DISP button; press the button again to return 
to monitor-off status. Alternatively, you can press the Set button to turn the 
monitor on and off, but only if you stick with the default setting for Custom 
Function 10, explained at the start of this chapter.
 
Note that if you turn off the camera while the Shooting Settings screen is 
displayed, it will appear again automatically the next time you power up the 
camera. So if you really want the monitor to retain its “power off status,” be 
sure to press DISP (or Set) to shut off the monitor before you turn off the 
camera.
Creating Desktop Wallpaper
You can quickly turn an image on your camera memory card into desktop 
wallpaper — a background image that appears on your monitor, behind any 
icons or program windows. For example, I plastered my Windows desktop 
with a water lily image, as shown in Figure 11-10.
 
 
Figure 11-10: You can use a favorite image as your monitor background.

309
 Chapter 11: Ten Special-Purpose Features to Explore on a Rainy Day
To decorate your monitor, follow these steps:
 
1. Connect the camera to the computer, following the instructions in 
Chapter 8.
 
 After a short time, the Direct 
Transfer screen appears on the 
camera monitor, as shown in 
Figure 11-11.
 
2. Highlight Wallpaper and then 
press the Set button.
 
 The camera monitor displays 
your most recent image.
 
3. Press the right or left cross key 
to scroll to the image you want 
to use as wallpaper.
 
4. Press the Set button to start the 
transfer.
 
 The camera downloads the image to your hard drive and then saves 
a copy of it in the correct format to use for wallpaper. The wallpaper 
image then appears on the computer desktop.
 
If you prefer, you also can turn an image that’s already on your computer’s 
hard drive into wallpaper by using Canon ZoomBrowser EX (Windows) or 
ImageBrowser (Mac). See the Help system in those programs for instructions. 
Also note that because the images your Canon creates have an aspect ratio 
of 3:2, they won’t fully cover the desktop of most monitors, which typically 
have an aspect ratio of either 4:3 or 16:9. If you want the image to fully fill the 
screen, you must edit it to the correct proportions and then use the Windows 
or Mac display customization tools to turn the edited file into wallpaper. 
Chapter 10 shows you how to crop to specific proportions.
Adding Original Decision Data
Now that photo editing has gone mainstream, determining whether a digital 
photo has been altered from its original state is difficult. However, through 
Custom Function 12, you now have a way to prove that a picture file hasn’t 
been edited.
If you enable this Custom Function, as shown in Figure 11-12, the camera 
adds to the image file a tag that verifies the photo as original. There’s a catch, 
though: To make use of that tag when the file is opened on your computer, 
you must use a special piece of software, the Original Data Decision Security 
Kit OSK-E3. You can buy that product for about $650.

press Set to select the image.

whole issue, visit the Canon Web site.
Creating Your Very Own 
Camera Menu
Canon does a good job of making it 
easy to change the most commonly 
used camera settings. You can access 
many critical options by pressing 
the buttons on the camera body, and 
others require only a quick trip to the 
camera menus.
To make things even simpler for you, 
the Rebel XS/1000D enables you to 
create your own, custom menu con-
taining up to six items from the cam-
era’s other six menus. For example, I 
created a custom menu that contains 
the options shown in Figure 11-13. 
(The last item, My Menu Settings, is 
always on the menu; more about that 
later.) Logically enough, the custom 
menu goes by the name My Menu and 
is represented by the green star icon, 
as shown in the figure.
To create your menu, take these steps:
 
1. Set the camera Mode dial to an advanced exposure mode.
 
 Sadly, you can create and order from your custom menu only in P, Tv, 
Av, M, and A-DEP exposure modes.
 
2. Press the Menu button and display the My Menu screen, shown on the 
left in Figure 11-14.
 
3. Highlight My Menu Settings, as shown in the figure, and press Set.
 
 Now you see the second screen in Figure 11-14.
 
4. Highlight Register and press Set.
 
 You’re presented with a scrolling list that contains each and every item 
found on the camera’s other six menus, as shown on the left in Figure 11-15.
Figure 11-12: This Custom Function is 
relevant only if you buy a $650 accessory 
software kit.
Figure 11-13: Group your favorite menu items 
together with the My Menu feature.

Figure 11-14: To add items to your menu, select Register and press Set.
 
 
Figure 11-15: Highlight an item to put on your menu and press Set.
 
5. Highlight the first item that you want to include on your custom menu.
 
 If you want to add a specific Custom Function to your menu, scroll past 
the item named Custom Functions to find and highlight the individual 
function. (The item named Custom Functions simply puts the Custom 
Functions menu item on your menu, and you still have to wade through 
the multiple levels of steps to get to your function.)
 
6. Press Set.
 
 You see a confirmation screen like the one shown on the right in 
Figure 11-15.
 
7. Highlight OK and press Set.
 
 You return to the list of menu options. The option you just added to 
your menu is dimmed in the list.

312
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
8. Repeat Steps 5 through 7 to add up to five additional items to your 
menu.
 
9. Press the Menu button.
 
 You then see the My Menu screen, where the items you added to the 
menu should appear.
After creating your menu, you can further customize and manage it as follows:
 
✓ Give your menu priority. You can tell the camera that you want it to 
automatically display your menu anytime you press the Menu button. 
To do so, select My Menu Settings on the main My Menu screen and 
then press Set. You see the screen shown on the right in Figure 11-14. 
Highlight Display from My Menu and press Set. Highlight Enable and 
press Set again.
 
✓ Change the order of the list of menu items. Once again, highlight My 
Menu Settings and press Set. Then highlight the Sort option (refer to 
the right screen in Figure 11-14) and press Set. Highlight a menu item, 
press Set, and then use the up or down cross keys to move the item up 
or down in the list. Press Set to glue the menu item in its new position. 
Press Menu to return to the My Menu Settings screen; press again to 
return to your custom menu.
 
✓ Delete menu items. Display your menu, highlight My Menu Settings, 
and press Set. Then, to delete a single item, highlight Delete and press 
Set. Highlight the menu item you want to remove and press Set again. 
Highlight OK and press Set again to confirm your decision. To remove all 
items from your custom menu, choose Delete All Items, press Set, high-
light OK, and press Set again.
Getting Free Help and Creative Ideas
Okay, so this last tip is a bit of a cheat: It isn’t actually found on your camera, 
but it will help you better understand the features that are. I speak of the 
Canon Web site, which you can access at www.canon.com.
If you haven’t yet visited the site, I encourage you to do so. In the Support 
section of the site, you can get free technical support for camera problems 
and even download an electronic copy of your camera manual, should you 
happen to misplace the one that shipped in the camera box. Most impor-
tantly, check periodically to make sure that your camera is running the latest 
firmware, which is the geekspeak term for the camera’s internal software.
Be sure to also check out the Learning Center section of the site. There, you 
can find loads of tutorials and other great instructional offerings not only 
about your camera but also about the software that ships with it.
