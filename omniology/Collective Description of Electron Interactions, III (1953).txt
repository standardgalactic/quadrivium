The behavior of the electrons in a dense electron gas is analyzed
quantum-mechanically
by a series of canonical
transformations.
The usual
Hamiltonian
corresponding
to a system
of individual
electrons with Coulomb interactions
is 6rst re-expressed
in such a
way that
the long-range
part
of the
Coulomb
interactions
be-
tween
the
electrons
is described
in terms
of collective
fields,
representing
organized
"plasma"
oscillation
of the system
as a
whole. The Hamiltonian
then describes these collective 6elds plus
a set of individual
electrons
which
interact
with
the collective
6elds and
with
one another
via short-range
screened
Coulomb
interactions.
There is, in addition,
a set of subsidiary
conditions
on the system
wave function
which relate the field and particle
variables.
The 6eld-particle
interaction
is eliminated
to a high
degree of approximation
by a further
canonical transformation
to
a new
representation
in which
the Hamiltonian
describes
inde-
pendent
collective
fields,
with e'
degrees
of freedom,
plus
the
system
of electrons interacting
via screened
Coulomb
forces with
a range
of the order
of the inter
electronic
distance.
The new
subsidiary
conditions
act only on the electronic
wave functions;
they strongly
inhibit
long wavelength
electronic
density
Quctua-
tions and act to reduce
the number
of individual
electronic
de-
grees of freedom by e'. The general properties
of this system are
discussed, and the methods and results obtained are related to the
classical
density
fluctuation
approach
and
Tomonaga's
one-
dimensional
treatment
of the degenerate
Fermi gas.
' 'N this paper we wish to develop a collective descrip-
- t tion of the behavior
of the
electrons
in a dense
electron
gas which
will be appropriate
when a quan-
tum-mechanical
treatment
of the electronic
motion
is
required,
as is the case for the electrons in a metal. Our
collective
description
is based
on the
organized
be-
havior
of the electrons
brought
about
by their
long-
range
Coulomb
interactions,
which act to couple
to-
gether the motion of many e1ectrons. In the 6rst paper
of this series' hereafter
referred to as I, we developed a
collective
description
of the organized
behavior
in an
electron
gas
due
to
the
transverse
electromagnetic
interactions
between
the electrons.
This was done by
means of a canonical
transforms, tion to a set of trans-
verse collective coordinates
which were appropriate
for
a description
of this organized
behavior.
Here we shall
develop an analogous
canonical
transformation
to a set
of longitudinal
collective coordinates
which are appro-
priate
for a description
of the organization
brought
about by the Coulomb
interactions.
In the preceding
paper'
hereafter
referred
to as II,
we developed.
a detailed
physical
picture
of the elec-
tronic
behavior
(due
to the
Coulomb
interactions).
A1though
the electron
gas was treated
classically,
we
shall see that most of the conclusions
reached there are
also appropriate
(with
certain
modifications)
in the
quantum
domain.
Let us review
briefty
the physical
picture we developed
in II, since we shall have occasion
to make frequent
use of it in this paper.
We found that, in general,
the electron gas displays
both
collective
and
individual
particle
aspects.
The
primary
manifestations
of the collective
behavior
are

organized
oscillatipn
of the system as a whole, the so-
called "plasma"
oscillation,
and the screening
of the
Geld of any individual
electron within a Debye length
by the remainder
of the electron
gas. In a collectiv|;
oscillation,
each
individual
electron
suffers
a
small
periodic perturbation
of its velocity and position due to
the combined
potential
of all the other particles. The
cumula'tive
potential
of all the electrons
may be quite
large since the long range of the Coulomb
interaction
permits a very large number
of electrons to contribute
to the potential at a given point. The screening
of the
electronic
fields
may
be viewed
as arising
from
the
Coulomb
repulsion,
which causes the electrons to stay
apart, and so leads to a de6ciency of negative
.charge
in the immediate
neighborhood
of a given electron. The
collective
behavior
of the electron
gas is decisive
for
phenomena
involving
distances greater than the Debye
length,
while for smaller
distances
the electron
gas is
best considered
as a collection
of individual
particles-
which interact weakly by means of a screened Coulomb
force.
These
conclusions
were
reached
by
analyzing
the
behavior
of the
electrons
in terms
of their
density
Quctuations. It was found that these
density
Quctua-
tions could be split into two approximately
independent
components,
associated
with
collective
and individual
particle aspects of the electronic motion. The collective
component
is present
only
for wavelengths
greater
than
the Debye
length
and
represents
the "plasma"
oscillation. It may be regarded
as including
the eBects
of the long range of the Coulomb
force which leads to
the
simultaneous
interaction
of many
particles.
The
individual
particles
component
is associated. with
the
random
thermal
motion of the electrons
and shows no
collective
behavior;
it represents
a collection
of in-
dividual
electrons
surrounded
by co-moving
clouds of
09

charge
which
act to screen
their
fields
as described
above.
The
individual
particles
component
thus
in-
cludes the effects of the residual
short-range
screened
Coulomb force, which leads only to two-body
collisions.
A quantum-mechanical
generalization
of the density
Quctuation
method
is
quite
straightforward
and
is
sketched
brieQy
in Appendix I. However,
we do not
choose to adopt this point of view, because although
it
is quite useful in establishing
the existence of collective
oscillations
and describing
certain
related
phenomena,
it does not enable one to obtain. a satisfactory
over-all
description
of the electron
gas. Quantum-mechanical
calculations
aimed at solving
for the wave
functions
and
the energy
levels
of the system
are much
more
conveniently
done
in
terms
of a Hamiltonian
for-
malism
through
the
use
of
appropriate
canonical
transformations.
Our general approach
in this series of papers has been
to analyze
the collective oscillatory
motion erst, since
this is associated
with
the long-range
aspects
of the
interaction
which,
in a sense, are responsible
for the
major
complications
in
the
many-electron
problem.
Once the collective
motion
is accounted
for, we then
investigate
the aspects of the electronic behavior
which
are independent
of the collective behavior,
and which,
if our method is successful, should turn out to be simple.
Thus we are led to seek a canonical transformation
to a
representation
in which
the existence of the collective
oscillations
is explicitly
recognized,
and in which these
oscillations are independent
of the individual
electronic
behavior.
In this representation,
which
we shall
call
the collective representation,
we do not expect that the
electron
gas can be described
entirely
in terms of the
collective
coordinates
which
describe
the
organized
oscillations,
since we know that the gas also displays
individual
particle
behavior.
We shall
see that
in the
collective
representation,
the individual
electronic
co-
ordinates
correspond
to the electrons
plus their associ-
ated screening
fields, and that as might be anticipated
from II, these screened electrons interact rather weakly
via a screened
Coulomb force.
In this paper
we shall be primarily
concerned
with
obtaining
the canonical transformation
to the collective
representation.
We shall
discuss
the
approximations
involved
and,
in a general
way,
the resultant
wave
functions
of our electron system in the collective repre-
sentation.
Our d'evelopment
of a quantum-mechanical
description
of the electron
assembly
makes
possible a
treatment
of the effects of electron
interaction
in me-
tallic phenomena
which
utilizes at the outset the sim-
plicity brought
about by the organized
oscillatory
be-
' havior.
The
detailed
application
of
the
collective
description
to the electrons
in a metal
is given
in the
following
paper, ' hereafter
referred to as IV.
Historically,
the 6rst utilization
of the 'plasma'
as-
pects of the electron
gas in a metal
is due to Kronig
' D. Pines, following paper LPhys. Rev. 92, 626 (1953lg.
and
Korringa, 4 who
treated
the
eQ'ect
of electron-
electron
interaction
on the stopping
power of a metal
for fast charged particles.
However,
their treatment
is
open to objection,
in that
they
describe
the electron
gas as a classical
Quid, with an artificially
introduced
coefIicient
of internal
friction.
A
more
satisfactory
treatment
of electron-electron
interaction
in the stop-
ping
power
problem
is due
to Kr'amers4
and
Bohr. 4
The quantum
treatment
of this problem
from the view-
point of the collective description
is given in Paper IV.
Tomonaga'
has independently
investigated
the ex-
tent to which a degenerate
Fermi gas can be described
in term. s of longitudinal
oscillations.
Tomonaga's
treat-
ment is, however,
con6ned to a one-dimensional
system,
and as we shall see, there are certain essential difhculties
associated with its generalization
to a three-dimensional
system
which
make
the direct
extension
of this ap-
proach to three dimensions
impossible. The relationship
between
our approach
and that of Tomonaga
is dis-
cussed in Appendix II.
We consider
an aggregate
of electrons
embedded
in
a background
of uniform positive charge, whose density
is equal to that of the electrons. The Hamiltonian
for
our system may be written

6 We shall drop this prime in the remainder
of this paper since
we have no further
occasion to make explicit use of the fact that
the term with k=0 is excluded.
where
the 6rst term corresponds
to the kinetic energy
of the electrons, the second to their Coulomb interaction
and the third to a subtraction
of their self energy. The
prime in the summations
over k denotes a sum in which
k=o is excluded,
and this takes into account
the uni-
form
background
of positive
charge,
and
hence
the
over-all

to introduce

which is expressed
in terms of

equations
of motion.
QI, is proportional
to the
kth
fourier
component
of
divE(x) —4trp(x),
and
hence
these
subsidiary
condi-
tions guarantee
that Maxwell's
equations
are satisGed.
It may easily be veriGed that the subsidiary
condition
operator
Qs commutes
with
the Hamiltonian
(6), so
that if the subsidiary
condition
(7) is satisfted at some
initial time, it will be true at all subsequent
times.
The equivalence
of our Hamiltonian
(6) with
the
Hamiltonian
expressed by (1) may be seen by applying
the unitary
transformations
C =Sf, where,
If we choose a f which is independent
of q&, we may
satisfy
the
new
subsidiary
condition
identically,
the
terms
involving
ps in the Hamiltonian
will drop out,
and K is seen to be equivalent
to (1).We note that the
term —2ztte'Qs(1/k')
was included
in (6) so that this
Hamiltonian
might
be numerically
equivalent
to (1),
as well as leading
to equivalent
equations
of motion,
since this term is just what is needed to cancel the terms
withi= j in the Coulomb
energy.
The introduction
of the longitudinal
decrees of free-
dom,
q&, and the subsidiary
conditions
(7) provides
a
convenient
means
of introducing
the concept of inde-
pendent
collective oscillation
within
the framework
of
the Hamiltonian
formalism.
The utility
of this repre-
sentation
lies in the fact that (7) introduces
in a simple
way a relationship
between
the fourier
components
of
the electronic
density, p&=P;e '~'*', and a set of field
variables
p&. We shall see that there is, in consequence,
a very
close parallel
between
the behavior
of the
p~,
as analyzed
in II, and the behavior
of our
Geld co-
ordinates. In this representation
we Gnd that the Geld
variables
(just as did the p&) oscillate with a frequency
equal to the plasma
frequency,
provided
we neglect a
. small
coupling
between
the collective
motion
and the
individual
electronic
behavior
(characterized
by their
random
thermal
motion).
Furthermore,
just
as
we
found it-possible
in II to Gnd a purely oscillatory
com-
ponent
of the density
Quctuations,
which
is approxi-
mately
independent
of the
individual
electronic
be-
havior, so we shall here be able to carry out a canonical
transformation
to a new set of Geld variables,
which
describe
pure
collective
behavior
and do not interact
with the individual
electrons
to a good degree of ap-
proximation.
In this section we shall
analyze
the ap-
proximate
oscillatory
behavior
of the (qs, ps), while in
the next section we carry out the canonical transforma-
tion to the pure collective coordinates.
Before beginning
our analysis,
we find it desirable
to modify
somewhat
our Hamiltonian
(6). We found
in Paper II that in the classical theory there is a mini-
mum
wavelength
X, (which
classically
is the
Debye
length), and hence a maximum
wave vector k„beyond
which
organized
oscillation
is not possible.
We may
anticipate
that
in the quantum
theory a similar
(but
not
identical)
limit
arises,
so that
there
is a corre-
sponding
limit on the extent to which we can introduce
collective
coordinates
to
describe
the
electron
gas.

The modification

carried out
by applying

dency for the various

Gnd it convenient,
in dealing
with

to split up the third term into two parts.
That part for which k+ 1=0 is independent

values
of y, so that B,., describes

the long-range
part of the
Coulomb
interactions
be-
tween
the electrons
in terms of the collective
oscilla-
tions
(16), which
interact
with

via Zz,

has now been reduced
to one quite
analogous
to that encountered

ticles interacting
with
collective
6elds; the only
new
complications
are the short-range
interaction H, , , and
the subsidiary

to what extent it applies,

us to eliminate
the
p& in terms of
the x;.
(b) They
permit
us to eliminate
io' of the x; in
terms of the po.
Let us begin with the first way. Our wave function
(22)
then becomes

of this correla-

tends to keep apart from the

similar
to that obtained

the classical treatment

by Tomonaga
in his one-dimensional
treat-
ment.
Let us now consider method
(b), in which we seek to
eliminate
n' of the particle
variables
in terms of the
field variables
po. As is clear from the form of (12), this
is a much more formidable
task, one which we are not
able to carry out explicitly.
However,
as we shall see
throughout
this paper,
we can still draw a number
of
useful
conclusions
concerning
the
eGect of such
an
elimination
without
actually
solving for the x; in terms
of the po. In particular,
we shall see in Sec. III how one
may
use a canonical
transformation
to replace
(to
lowest order in the field-particle
coupling
constant)
N'
of the
individual
particle
degrees
of freedom
by as
many collective degrees of freedom.
We now wish to justify our neglect of U and to in-
vestigate
to what
extent
corrections
arising
from the
inclusion of Hz will be of importance.
In the remainder
of this section we confine our attention
to the lowest
state of the system. We Grst show that the exact lowest
state eigenfunction
fo of our Hamiltonian

matically
satisfies
the subsidiary
conditions
(12). For
as we have noted
the subsidiary
condition
operators
01, commute
with the Hamiltonian
B, so that the wave
function
gp can, in general,
be expressed
in terms of a
series of simultaneous
eigenfunctions
of II and the QI,.
The lowest state of the system
is nondegenerate
and
hence corresponds
to a single eigenvalue
of the operator
QI„which
we may call 0.1,. To determine
the value of
el„we consider
a space
displacement
of the
entire
system
(Geld plus
electrons)
through
a distance
hx,
so that
where
hU= —Q

corrections
arising
from U and Hr. We estimate
these
terms using perturbation
theory. With the wave func-
tion (22) the average values of U and Hz vanish.
U, in
fact, has non-vanishing
matrix
elements
only between
the lowest state (with zero quanta)
and a two-quantum
state,
while Br connects
the lowest state and a one-
quantum
state. From second-order
perturbation
theory,
we have
x~x +Ax,
p,~p;,
x,~x +Ax.

From Eqs. (2) and (3) we see that the effect of this dis-

The Hamiltonian
is thus invariant
under
this displace-
ment,
while
the
subsidiary
condition
applied
to our
lowest state wave function
becomes
e '"' *&a'Pp=zzg4
However,
since the lowest state is nondegenerate,
it is
not changed
by this displacement,
and we must have
Qk'fp=nkiPp.
Thus we find zzk=zzke'"'e*, which can only
be satisfied if aI, ——0.
Thus, if we could obtain
an exact solution
for the
lowest state eigenfunction
fp, we would
automatically
satisfy
the subsidiary
condition
Q&fp —
—0. We may,
in
general,
expect that if we obtain an approximate
solu-
tion for fp, we will not be able to satisfy the subsidiary
condition,
but that any error we make in determining
the energy of the lowest state will not be increased by
our failure
to satisfy
this
subsidiary
condition,
since
an exact solution satisles the subsidiary
condition
and
leads to the lowest possible energy state. The situation
with regard to the excited states of the system
will be
somewhat
different,
and we will return to this question
later.
Let us take as our approximate
it p, the wave function
(22). In this approximation
the energy
of the lowest
state is given by
if the electron in the initial state has momentum
p;. In
(28) we may, for the purpose
of this rough
estimate,

Thus
AU introduces
a fractional

in the zero

per oscillator, of (1/48)(n'/n),
and since
n' is never greater than n (and is, in fact, often quite a
bit smaller),
this
change
is negligible.
Thus,
we are
justified
in neglecting
completely
the term U.
We may estimate
the corrections

from II'r in

We then find

and (H, , )A„ is the exchange

from
the screened

Since, as we shall
see, k,&ko, the wave vector of an
electron at the top of the Fermi
distribution,
we see
that
the
second
term
in the
parenthesis
in
(33) is
generally
somewhat
smaller
than the first, and the 6rst
term corresponds
to a fractional correction in the kinetic
energy
per electron
(and thus
in its effective mass) of
n'/3n. This may be appreciable
if n'~n but otherwise
is small. This term implies a similar order of magnitude
correction
for the frequency
of the collective
oscilla-
tions,
since g,p,o/2m
and
n'koo~/2
are roughly
of the
same order of magnitude.
Thus
we find that
we are
justified in neglecting
H& in order to obtain a qualitative
and rough
quantitative
understanding
of the behavior
of our system,
but that
the effects arising
from
H&
should
definitely
be taken
into account
in a careful
quantitative-
treatment.
This we shall give in Sec. III.
Thus far we have not specified the value of k„and
hence the number
of collective
degrees of freedom
we
-find it desirable to introduce
in our treatment.
We may
obtain a rough qualitative
estimate of e' by minimizing
our approximate
expression
for the lowest state energy
(25) with respect to k. (or n'). For the purpose
of this
rough
estimate,
let
us
neglect
the
dependence
of
(H, ., )Ay on k,. We then note. that the second term in
(25) will be negative
for those k for which
(2~ne'/k')

value for (25)
if we include
in this summation,
only those k for which
this inequality
is satisfied. This criterion yields

The energy —
—', (ne'/m. )k, represents
a long-range
corre-
lation
energy,
i.e., that
energy
associated
with
the
long-range
correlations
in electronic positions
described
by the wave function
(23). In contrast to the exchange
energy,
this term represents
Coulomb
correlations
be-
tween electrons of both kinds of spin. For Na it is, per
and ao is the Bohr radius.
.For a typical metal like Na,
we have
(r,/ao)

hence k,

(10) we
see that
in this case n'~n/2.
In Paper IV where
we
give a more detailed treatment
of that choice of k, which
minimizes
the energy,
including
the eGects of Hi, and
(H.., )~„we find for Na, k,~0.68ko, and n'~n/8
in fair
agreement
with this rough estimate.
Finally
we
may

a more careful
estimate
of the long-range

energy.
In this section we wish to consider
the eGect of the
Geld particle interaction
term Hz on the motion of the
electrons
and
the
collective
oscillations.
We do this
with
.the aid of a canonical
transformation
which
is
chosen to eliminate
Hi in first approximation.
Thus we
seek a canonical
transformation
to a new representa-
tion in which
the coupling
between
the Gelds and the
electrons
is described
by a term Hii, which is appreci-
ably
smaller
than
Bi, and
may
consequently
be
neglected
to a good
degree
of approximation
(com-
parable,
say, with our neglect of V). We shall then see
that the eGects of the coupling
between
the electrons
and the collective
field variables,
as described
by H&,
are threefold:
there
is an
increase
in the
electronic
eGective mass, the frequency
of the collective
oscilla-
tions is increased
and becomes
k dependent,
and the
eGective
electron-electron
interaction
is modified.
As
we anticipated
on the basis of our perturbation-theo-
retic estimate
of Hi in the preceding
section,
none of
these effects is so large as to destroy
the qualitative
conclusions
we reached there, although
the quantitative
estimates
of the energy and wave functions
of our sys-
tem are somewhat
altered.
The measure
of 'the smallness
of Biz, and hence the
extent to which
we are successful
in carrying
out our
canonical
transformation,
is the expansion
parameter
(38)
where
we average
over the particle
momenta
and the
collective field wave vectors, and
co is the frequency
of
the collective oscillations. We find

It is clear that by choosing P or k, small
enough,

as we
like. We shall assume throughout
the remainder
of this
paper
that
such a choice has
been
made,
i.e., that
0,«1.In Paper IV we show that this criterion is satisGed
in that n

in metals,
if we take for P that value which minimizes
the total energy. Another parameter
of whose smallness

AND

number of collective degrees of freedom, e', to the total
number
of degrees
of freedom,

with the above choice of P, we find (n'/3n)
1/25
%e shall make the further
approximation
of neglect-
ing the sects of our canonical transformation
on B,, ,
the short-range
Coulomb
interaction
between
the elec-
trons. From Eq. (11), we see that
if we neglect
H'z,
the
collective
oscillations
are not affected at all by
H, , . Thus B', , can inRuence
the
q& only
indirectly
through
Hy. But, as we shall see, the direct eGects of
Hi on the collective
oscillations
are small.
Thus,
it
may be expected
that
the ieChrect
eGects of II,., on
the
q~ through
Hq are an order of magnitude
smaller
and may be neglected
in our treatment
which
is aimed
at approximating
the eGects of Bz. We will justify this
procedure
in greater detail in the following
section.
With
regard
to the subsidiary
conditions
(11), we
shall find that to order e, the subsidiary
conditions
in
our new representation
involve
only the new particle
coordinates
(X;, P~), Thus we may write our new wave
function
in terms of products
like
Cz;,(~(Xz . X„),
and the subsidiary
conditions
will only act on the y(x;).
The e' subsidiary
conditions
may
thus
be viewed
as
consisting
of m
relationships
among
the particle
vari-
ables, which electively reduce the number of individual
electronic
degrees of freedom
from 3e to 3m—e'. This
reduction
is necessary,
since in this new representation
the e' collective
degrees
of freedom
must be regarded
as independent.
For the 6eld
coordinates
no longer
appear in the subsidiary
conditions,
and hence describe
real collective
oscillation,
which
is independent
of the
electronic motion
in this new representation.
There is a close resemblance
between our Hamiltonian
(11), which describes a collection of electrons
interact-
ing via
longitudinal
6elds,
and
the Hamiltonian
we
considered
in I, which
described
a collection
of elec-
trons
interacting
via
the
transverse
electromagnetic
6elds. In fact, we shall see that our desired
canonical
transformation
is just the longitudinal
analog
of that
used in Paper I to treat the organized
aspects of the
transverse
magnetic
interactions
in an electron gas. In
order to point
up this similarity
and to simplify
the
commutator
calculus,
we introduce
the creation
and
destruction
operators
for our longitudinal
photon

We note that Hs, ~e takes the form

we

%e now consider
a transformation
from our opera-
tors (x,, p;, az, az*) to a new set of operators
(X,, P,,
Az, AI,*), which
possess
the
same
eigenvalues
and
satisfy the same commutation
rules as our original set."
The relation
between
these two sets may be written
as
s(hX e+is/A
(with similar
equations
for p,, a&, and a&*); (45) may
be viewed
as an operator
equation,
and we may take
5 the generating
function of our canonical
transforma-
tion to be a function
of the
new
operators
(X;, P;,
A&, AI,*) only. The operator
relationship
between
the
old and new Hamiltonians
is
in virtue of (41). In terms of these variables,
we then
write
our Hamiltonian

conditions

as

to giving

that it leads to the desired

On comparison
with Eq. (45) of I, this generating
func-
tion may be seen to be just the longitudinal
analog of
the "transverse"
generating
function
given there. [The
additional
term
in hk/2
arises because k P, does not
commute
with exp(ik X,).] Since H;„„,„and Hs, zd are
also analogous
to the transverse
terms encountered
in
I, we may expect that
many
of the results
obtained
there may be directly
transposed
to this longitudinal
case. The differences
in the treatments
will arise from a
consideration
of H,h„t„„g, and
the
subsidiary
con-
ditions.
We Gnd it convenient
to write
the relationship
be-
tween
any
old operator, 0,&d and
the
corresponding
new operator 0„, as
~—1 P,/m+fzP/2m
exp(ik. X;)+,
(51)
and we shall use these relationships
in determining II„,
We now proceed
in a manner
directly
analogous
to
that of Paper I. We classify terms in II„, by consider-
ing the corresponding
schematic terms in H [Eq. (44a)-
(44d)] from
which
they
may be considered
to arise.
Every term,
K, in H, leads to a zero-order
(commutator)
term,
W, which is the same function of the new variables
as it was of the old variables,
and in addition,
a 6rst
order commutator, + (i/fz) [E,S], a second-order
term,
—(1/25')[9", [E,S]], etc. A convenient
grouping
of
the terms in II exists which considerably
simplifies
the
calculation
of H„, . To demonstrate
this grouping,
we

and we will classify terms in this series according to the
power of S they contain; i.e., [0,S] is the first-order
commutator
of 0 and S. We then
find, keeping
only
first-order
commutators,
that

(52)
By Eq. (44c) we see that the above term is just the
negative of Hi, expressed in terms of the new variables.
Thus, the first-order
commutator
of K, with S cancels
the term
arising
from
the zero-order
commutator
of
Ki. K~ and K are thus "connected" in that a simple
relationship
exists
between
the
various
order
com-
mutators
arising
from
these
terms;
in fact, the nth
order commutator
of K, with S is equal to the negative
of the
(n—1)th-order
commutator
of Xz with S. The
terms in H„,„arising from the connected terms H,+Hz,
may consequently
be written

The physical
consequences
of our canonical
trans-
formation
follow
from the lowest-order
Hamiltonian,
P„,
&'& [Eq. (59)] and the associated set of subsidiary
conditions
on our system
wave
function
[Eq. (65)].
We
discuss
these
brieQy
and
then
show
that
the
higher-order
terms
in P„,
and
(Qi,)„,
are actually
negligible. We first note that our field coordinates
occur
only
in H„&&,, and
thus
describe
a set of uncoupled
fields
which
carry
out real
independent
longitudinal
oscillations,
since the subsidiary
conditions
no longer
relate
fmld and particle
variables,
and since there are
no Geld-particle
interaction
terms
in H„, . The fre-
quency
of these collective
oscillations
is given by the
dispersion
relation [Eq. (57)], which is the appropriate
quantum-mechanical
generalization
of
the
classical
dispersion
relation
derived
in II, as well as being the
longitudinal
analog of the quantum-dispersion
relation
for
organized
transverse
oscillation,
which
we
ob-
tained in I.
This dispersion
relation plays a key role in our collec-
tive description,
since it is orily for ~ (k) which satisfy it
that
we
can
eliminate
the
unwanted
terms
in
the
Hamiltdnian
[Eq. (54)] and the unwanted
Geld terms
in the subsidiary
condition.
For sufBciently
small
k,
we may
expand
(57) in
powers
of (k P;/mar)
and
(kk'/mo)
and so always obtain a solution for ~(k). If we
do this, and assume an isotropic distribution
of P;, we
find

(Q&)„,„ is considerably
simplified
when
we note that
the first two terms vanish when we apply the dispersion
relation [Eq. (57)] for both plus
and
minus
k. The
fourth
term
consists of a linear
term
in the field co-
ordinates
multiplied
by a nonvanishing
phase factor,
and the eGect of such a term in the subsidiary
condition
is the same as that of a term like (55) in the Hamil-
tonian.
Since there
is no point
in obtaining
the sub-
sidiary
condition
to a higher
order of accuracy than is
maintained
in our Hamiltonian,
we may neglect
this
term.
Wi.th this approximation,
our subsidiary
condi-
tion reduces to one which
does not involve
(in lowest
These
appropriate
dispersion
relations
are,
in fact,
quite
sufhcient
for our purpose,
since the expansions
involved
in obtaining
them are the same that we have
used in obtaining H„, .
We have treated
& as a pure
number
thus far, al-
though
we see from (57) or (67) that
&o is, in fact, an
operator,
since it contains
P;. We have
ignored
this
fact, for instance,
in working
out our commutation
relations
and obtaining
H„, . This treatment
of co as
a pure number
is only strictly
justified
if our system
wave function
is an eigenfunction
of P;, which
is not
the case. Thus
co contains and, in turn, can contribute
to the
Hamiltonian,
oG-diagonal
terms
which
cause
transitions
between
states
of diGerent
energy.
These
terms could then, in principle,
be eliminated
from the

620
D. BOB M
AND
D.
P I NES
where
zz is given by (39) and p by (40). Since p&1, we
see that the eGect of the k4 term is small compared
to
the k' term. This result
holds true quite
generally,
in
that
where
an
expansion
in
powers
of n=((k P;/
mo)2)2„ is justified,
the terms of order
(k'k'/4m'a&2)
are
negligible.
The average
fractional
increase
in the fre-
quency
is thus of order 3n. As we have remarked,
for
the electronic
densities
encountered
in metals,
n turns
out to be
1/16, so that this constitutes
at most a 20
percent correction in the collective oscillation frequency.
22'„'The effect 'on
the
electrons
of the
elimination
(in
lowest
order)
of the electron-field
interaction
may be
seen by considering
the second
term
in H,&„t„„and
H
p
t.
We first note that
in the approximation
of
small o., the second term in H,~„t„„becomes

(69)
Thus
the "new" electrons
behave
as if they
had
an
effective mass m*, which is given by (69), and which is
slightly
greater than the "bare" electron
mass ns. This
increase
in the eQ'ective
electronic
mass has a simple
physical
interpretation.
For we note that according to
Hamiltonian
by a further
canonical
transformation.
However
because the dependence
of cv on I'; is already
or order
o., this
elimination
would
produce
terms
of
order o.' which
are truly
negligible.
We are justi6ed in
neglecting
the oG-diagonal
elements
of the operator ~.
According
to (67), in consequence
of the electron-
field interaction
the frequency
of the collective oscilla-
tions has become k dependent.
We may obtain an order-
of-magnitude
estimate
of the fractional
change
in this
frequency
by averaging
the
dispersion
relation
(67)
over all k&k, and carrying
out the indicated
sum over
particle
momenta.
In obtaining
this
mean
value
of
P;P,2, we should use the appropriate
eigenfunctions
of
our new Hamiltonian
(59). However,
as we shall
see
later,
the
correct
particle
eigenfunctions
can be re-
placed for many
applications
by plane
waves,
so that
P;P;2 may be approximately
evaluated
by assuming
a
Fermi
distribution
of electrons

zero. We

H, , in considering

such as [S,[S,Xz)$. {The higher-order
com-
mutators
arising
from
Ks,~d—pa &z;,(Rr/2) (A2 A2

from this term cancelled part of [S,Kzf.)
The calculation
of [S, [S,Kzj] is quite
straightfor-
ward,
but
scarcely
worth
going
into
here,
since by
comparison
of Eqs. (49), (50), (51), and (44), it may
easily be seen that the lowest order non-negligible
terms

noted by Hzz could be eliminated
by a further
trans-
formation. However,
since as we have seen, the elimina-
tion of Hz led to effects of order
zz (or e'/3N), the effects
so obtained
would
then
be of order
n2, and
we may
neglect them entirely
in our approximation
of small n.
Exactly
the
same
conclusions
apply
with
respect
to
the higher-order
commutators
of the subsidiary
con-
dition operator,
(Qz,)„, , since it is not fruitful
for us to
evaluate
(0&)„,„to any greater accuracy than that ob-
taining for H„, .
It is interesting
to note that included
in these higher-
order terms is the inhuence
of our eGective mass cor-
rection, Eq. (69), on the frequency
of the collective
oscillations.
Thus, on evaluating
these terms, one 6nds

instead
of the
dispersion
relation
(66). This
is,
of
course,
just what
might
be expected,
since
the suc-
cessive elimination
of the 6eld-particle
interaction
terms
leads to a mass renormalization,
familiar
from quan-
tum
electrodynamics,
in that
everywhere
m appears,
it s'hould properly
be replaced by m*."This correction
is here quite negligible,
usually
leading
to a fractional
change
in the collective
oscillation
frequency
of less
than
1 percent. For this change
is
(o.e'/zz),
and for
the electronic densities
encountered
in metals,
zz(zz'/n) —(1/16) (3/25) = (3/400).
Our only other
approximation
has been to neglect
the
eGect of the
canonical
transformation
on H...
which
will lead, indirectly,
to the eGect of H, , on the
collective
oscillations.
Suppose
we consider
a typical
first-order
term arising from [S,H, ,].This will be like

These
terms
thus
consist
of a nonvanishing
phase
factor multiplying
a 6eld variable
and a short-wave-
length
density
fluctuation.
The structure
of (74) is
quite
similar
to that of U [Eq. (15)], the di6erence
being
that
the
shogt-wavelength
density
Quctuation
P; exp( —ik X;) here plays the same role as the col-
lective
field
variable
(which
is
essentially
a
long-
wavelength
density
fluctuation)
did in U. If we had a
term for which k= 1, (74) would reduce to a term like
Hz, just as the third
term in (11) reduced
to ~„2+i
X(qzq z/2). Thus
we might
expect
that
(74) bears
about the same relationship
to Hz, as U does to (zo„'/2)
X+zqiq
z;. However,
it is quite a bit more dificult
to
establish
the smallness
of (74) mathematically
than it
was for U, since a perturbation
theoretic
estimate
in-
volves the consideration
of intermediate
states in which
two electrons are excited. We note that the main effect
of H, , is to produce
short-range
correlations
in par-
ticle positions,
analogous
to the long-range
correlations
produced
by the long-range
part of the Coulomb
po-
tential,
in. the
sense that
the particles
tend to keep
apart and thus tend to reduce the eGectiveness
of H, ,
Because
of the
analytical
difhculties
involved
in a
justi6cation
along these lines we prefer to justify
our
neglect
of P4)
in a more
qualitative
and
physical
fashion.
We see that (74) describes the effect of the collective
oscillations
on the short
range
collisions
between
the
electrons,
and conversely,
the effect of the short-range
collisions on the collective oscillations.
We may expect
that these eGects will be quite small, since H, , is itself
a comparatively
weak
interaction.
The
short-range
electron-electron
collisions
arising
from H, .,
will act
to
damp
the
collective
oscillations,
a phenomenon
which
has been treated
in some detail
classically
by
Bohm and Gross." A test for the validity
of our ap-
proximation
in neglecting
terms
like (74) is that
the
damping
time from the collisions
be small
compared
with the period of a collective oscillation. In this con-
nection we may make the following remarks:
(1) Electron-electron
collisions are comparatively
in-
eGective
in damping
the oscillations,
since mo-
mentum
is conserved
in such collisions,
so that
to a first approximation
such collisions
produce
no damping.
[Such collisions
produce
damping
only
in powers
of (k P;/neo)
higher
than
the
first.]
(2) The exclusion
principle
will further
reduce
the
cross section for electron-electron
collision.
(3) If Hz is neglected,
collisions have no effect on the
collective oscillations. This means that the major
part of the collective energy is unaGected by these
short-range
collisions, since only that part coming
from Hz, (which is of order n relative to h~~) can
possibly be influenced.
Thus at most 20 percent
of the
collective
energy
can be damped
in a
collision process.
All of these factors
combine
to reduce
the rate of
damping,
so that we believe this rate is not more than
I percent
per period of an oscillation
and probably
is
quite a bit less. A correspondingly
small broadening
of
the levels of collective oscillation
is to be expected. It
is for these reasons that we feel justi6ed in neglecting
the effects of our canonical
transformation
on H, , .
"Note, however, that m is not replaced by m* in our expression
for co„, Eq. (14), since the collective oscillations
are not affected
by the field-electron
interaction
in this order.

The motion of the electrons in our new representation
is considerably
more complicated
than that of the col-
lective fields. The major reason for this complication
is our set of subsidiary
conditions
(65), which
essen-
tially act to reduce the number
of individual
electron
degrees of freedom
from 3e to 3e—e', where e' is the
number
of collective degrees of freedom and is given by
k.'

(75)
Ke may obtain a better understanding
of the role of
these subsidiary
conditions
by making
use of the den-
sity fiuctuation
concept which we developed
in Paper II.
There we saw that classically
the collective component
of the density
Quctuation
pI, was proportional
to
R '=g
~ik. xi
'
id2—(k P;/m)'
In a quantum-theoretical
treatment
of the
density
fiuctuations,
the collective
component
is found
to be
proportional
to
Eg&=P
~it xg
(76)
' ~'—L(k P;/m) —$P/2m)'
This result
may be seen to follow
directly
from
the
quantum
generalization
of the methods
of II given in
Appendix I. In the preceding
expressions,
x; and pi of
course refer to the "original" position and momentum
of the electron, i.e., the Hamiltonian
in terms of these
variables
is given by Eq. (1). On the other hand, our
"new"
electron
variables
(X,, E;) describe
electron
motion
in the
absence
of any
collective
oscillation,
since there are no terms
in. our Hamiltonian
(59) which
couple the electrons and the collective oscillation.
Con-
sequently
we should
expect that
the collective
com-
ponent
of the density
fluctuation
when
expressed
in
terms
of these "new" variables
should
vanish,
since
these variables are chosen to describe "pure" individual
electron
motion
and
are incapable
of describing,
or
taking
part
in, collective
oscillation.
But this is just
what our subsidiary
conditions
assert, as may be seen
by comparing
(76) and (65). Thus,
if we carry out a
transformation
to "individual'
electron
variables,
we
must
expect a set of subsidiary
conditions
given
by
(65), since these guarantee
that
we have developed a
consistent
description
of the state of the electron gas in
the absence of collective oscillation.
The physical content of the subsidiary
condition
also
follows
from the density
Quctuation
concept. For we
may rewrite the subsidiary
condition, Eq. (65) as
g; exp(+ik X;)p
(k P;/nt
hk'/2m)
exp(ik
X—~)
(77)
aP—[(k P,/m) —kk'/2m)'
i
Since we are dealing
with k(k„ for which (k P;/mo)'
&(1, we see that the subsidiary
condition
asserts that
in terms
of our
new
coordinates
and
momenta,
the
density
Ructuations
of long
wavelength
are
greatly
reduced.
This reduction
is due
to the fact that
the
major portion
of the long-wavelength
density
Quctua-
tions is associated
with the. collective oscillations,
and
described in terms of these in our collective description.
I;n our new representation,
the subsidiary
conditions
(65) continue
to commute
with the Hamiltonian
(59).
This follows since. the commutation
relations
are un-
changed
by a canonical
transformation;
it may easily
be directly verified from (65) and (59) that these com-
mute within
the approximations
we have made. Conse-
quently,
just as was the case with
(11) and
(12), if
we correctly
solved
for the exact lowest
state
eigen-
function
of our
Hamiltonian
B„, , we would
auto-
matically
satisfy
the subsidiary
conditions
(65), since
the ground
state of our system
is nondegenerate.
For
this reason, the energy of the lowest state of our system
is relatively
insensitive
to whether
we satisfy the sub-
sidiary
conditions
or not. For since the lowest
state
wave
function
does satisfy
the
subsidiary
condition,
moderate
changes in this wave function,
involving
cor-
responding
failures to satisfy the subsidiary
conditions,
will provide
quite
small
changes
in the energy.
Con-
versely, because of this insensitivity
of the ground state
energy
to the degree of satisfaction
of the subsidiary
condition, it will take a quite good approximation
to the
lowest
eigenfunction
of II„, to satisfy
the subsidiary
conditions
to a fair degree of approximation.
It should be noted that the lowest state wave func-
tion satisfies
the subsidiary
condition
because
of the
eGects of the term II,.~
in the Hamiltonian.
For as
we have seen, the subsidiary
condition
describes a long
range
correlation
in the particle
positions,
which
is
independent
of the amplitude
of collective oscillation.
In the approximation
that we are using, this correlation
has to be due to the residual
interaction
between
the
particles,
since
the
subsidiary
conditions
will
auto-
matically
be satisfied
if we solve for the lowest state
wave function. At erst sight, it might be thought
that
the
short-range
potential
H, .,
might
also
play
an
important
role in establishing
these correlations,
since
it corresponds
to a fairly
strong
interaction
potential
when
the particles
are close to each other. However,
from the definition
of H, ., in Eq. (18), we see that it
has no Fourier components
corresponding
to 4&k,. As
a simple
perturbation
theoretical
calculation
shows,
the only eBect of H, ., in the erst approximation
is to
turn a plane wave function.

where C „is a suitable expansion
coeflicient, which can
be obtained
by a detailed
calculation. " But since the
sum is restricted
to k&k„B,., introduces
only short-
raege correlations,
which have nothing
to do with the
subsidiary
conditions.
On the other hand, H, .~. which
has
only
/ong-ralge
fourier
components
(i.e., k(k,)
introduces
only corresponding
long-range
correlations.
Thus,
in the present
approximation,
it is H, .~. that
is responsible
for the long-range
correlations
implied by
the subsidiary
condition.
On the basis of the above conclusions,
we may de-
duce
the
following
physical
picture.
The long
range
Coulomb
forces produce
a tendency
for electrons
to
keep apart,
as a result
of which
the Coulomb
force
itself tends
to be neutralized.
But this neutralization
could not be perfect; for if it were, then there would be
no force left to produce
the necessary
correlations
in
particle
positions.
Our calculations
show that II,.~. is
the
small
residual
part
of the
Coulomb
force which
must
remain
unneutralized
in order
to produce
the
long-range
correlations
needed
for agreeing.
Because
this force is so small, it will produce
only correspond-
ingly small changes in the particle momenta,
so that in
most applications
a set of plane
waves
will provide
a
good approximation
to the particle
wave function
(in
the new representation,
of course).
All of the above applies rigorously
only in the ground
state. In the excited states, similar
conclusions
apply;
but the application
of the subsidiary
conditions
is more
diflicult,
because
the
wave
functions
of the
excited
states are no longer now degenerate.
Here, we could in
general expand an arbitrary
eigenfunction
of B„, &" as
a series of eigenfunctions
of (Qz)„,„.To satisfy the sub-
sidiary
conditions,
we then retain
only those terms in
this series for which
(Qq)„,„=0.This reduction
in the
number
of possible
eigenfunctions
corresponds
to the
reduction
in the number
of individual
electron degrees
of freedom implied by (65). The exact treatment
of the
problem
of the excited states is quite complex and will
be reserved
for a later paper by one of us. However,
we may expect that if the reduction
in the number, of
individual
electron degrees of freedom is comparatively
small Pi.e., (n'/N)«1j,
then their effect on the energy
spectrum
of the electron
gas will be correspondingly
reduced.
W'e conclude this section by summing
up the results
of our canonical
transformation
to the collective
de-
scription. We have obtained a Hamiltonian
describing
collective
oscillation
plus a system
of individual
elec-
trons interacting
via a screened
Coulomb
force, with a
screening
radius
of the order
of the inner-electronic
distance.
Although
the individual
electron
wave func-
tions are restricted by a set of e' subsidiary
conditions,
which act to reduce the number
of individual
electron
degrees of freedom and to inhibit the long-range
density

associated
with
the

APPENDIX I
. In this appendix
we treat the collective Quctuations
in charge density by ending
the equations
of motion of
the
associated
operators,
thus
developing
a direct
quantum-mechanical
extension
of the methods
used in
Paper II. We use the electron held second-quantization
formalism,
in order to facilitate
comparison
with
the
work of Tomonaga
and to take into account explicitly
the fact that the electrons obey Fermi statistics.
Following
the
usual
treatments, '

P I NES
The second quantization
formalism
we are using here
is of course equivalent
to the use of an antisymmetrized
many-electron
wave function in the usual con6guration-
space representation
(which
we use
elsewhere
in this
paper). For instance,
the density
fluctuation
operator
pI, is equivalent
to the
configuration
space operator
P; exp( —ik X;) we introduce
earlier. Thus the results
obtained
in this appendix
may be directly compared to
those obtained
in the previous
sections of this paper,
and in Paper II.
In Paper II, we saw that classically
pI, could be split
into an oscillatory part gj„and an additional
part which
represented
the
charge
density
of a. set of screened
electrons moving at random.
W'e shall now show that a
similar
qI, can be introduced
quantum
mechanically,
and is proportional
to
We now split the sums over n and K into two parts.
In the second term
on the right
hand
side of (A12),
we see that those terms for which e= K give us a factor
of e, the total number
of particles,
while the remaining
terms, with n~E lead to nonlinear
contributions,
since
there appear here electively
two factors, each of order
pK. It can be shown
that
the neglect
of those
terms
for which
o./E
is equivalent
to the
"random
phase
approximation, " as applied
for instance
in the neglect
of U Eq. (15).Similarly,
in the third term on the right-
hand side of (A12) we find the terms for which n= —K
give us a factor of e, while those with nN —K may be
neglected
in the random
phase approximation.
With these approximations,
we then obtain

where Pq' here denotes the sum over all occupied elec-

This
dispersion
relation
is,
however,
identical
with that we found in Sec. II Fq. (57). Thus
we see that the same results can be obtained by solving
for the operator
equations
of motion
as can be ob-
tained by the canonical
transformation
method.
However,
a word of caution
should
be injected at
this point. For if one naively
diagonalizes
the terms on
the right-hand
side on (A12), assuming
the electrons
occupy a Fermi distribution
at T=O, one obtains addi-
tional
"exchange" terms
which
apparently
contribute
to order
kn in the dispersion
relation
(A14). This in
turn introduces
an apparent
contradiction
between
the
results herein obtained
and the dispersion
relation (57).
The resolution
of this contradiction
lies in the fact that
the
electrons
in consequence
of the
Coulomb
inter-
actions do not behave like a gas of free particles
(as is
tacitly
assumed
in diagonalizing
A12), but rather
ex-
hibit long-range
correlations
in positions
which act to
reduce the long-wavelength
density
Quctuations.
This
reduction
in the long-wavelength
density
fluctuations
has the result that no "exchange" contributions
to the
dispersion
relation appear up to order k4. Physically this
result follows from the fact that the long-range
correla-
tions act to keep the particles far apart,
so that they
have
less chance
to feel the eGects of the exclusion
principle.
This result follows quite simply
in our treat-
ment
in the body of this paper
where
we take into
account
the
exclusion
principle
by antisymmetrizing
the individual
electronic wave functions.
However, it is
rather dificult to establish
the equivalent
result in the
above
second-quantization
formalism,
so we do not
enter on this question farther here.

of the term P;(k. V;)2e 'k'*' appearing

this

different
electrons,
each moving

a diferent

locity

each therefore
contributing
differently
to
pK. Hence, for the same reasons given in Paper II, it is
necessary
to seek

oscillates
harmonically

wave vector of an electron at the top of the distribution.
We then get

in what follows.
APPENDIX II
Tomonaga~
has
developed
a very
interesting
one-
dimensional
treatment
of the degenerate
gas of Fermi
particles in which the excitations are described in terms
of a Bose 6eld, and in vrhich he obtains plasma oscilla-
tions
for the
degenerate
electron
gas. His
method,
hovrever,
appears
to be intrinsically
restricted
to this
one-dimensional
case. It also involves
the approxima-
tion that the wave function
of the electron
gas is not
very diferent
from that of a collection of free electrons
with
a Fermi
distribution
at absolute
zero. In this
appendix
we
shall
exhibit
the
relationship
between
Tomonaga's
methods
and ours.
To do this let us 6rst find the equation

the operator

to make

between
k and K for the electrons at the top of the

distribution.
Thus
the
various
terms
CI, K/2
XC~K/2 can no longer be given a common factor, and
the simple result (A18) can no longer be obtained. The
reason for this change may be given a simple physical
interpretation.
In a one-dimensional
problem,
the elec-
trons at the top of the Fermi distribution
have only
one
velocity,
and
therefore
all
electrons
contribute
approximately
in unison to pK. In the three-dimensional
case, each electron
contributes
di6'erently,
so that the
function
pK is altered
in time, and a new function
is
introduced
which
cannot
be
expressed
as a simple
function of pK.
It should
also be noted
that
our criterion
for the
validity
of the
collective
approximation
is difterent
from that of Tomonaga.

Tomonaga

the
ground

Finally,
we shall demonstrate
explicitly
the relation-
ship
between
Tomonaga's
variables
and
ours. From

that
the only
nonzero
contributions
are in a small region of vridth E near the
