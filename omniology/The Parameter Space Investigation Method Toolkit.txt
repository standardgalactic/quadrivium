Preface 
Real-Life Optimization Problems and Parameter Space Investigation 
Method
What Is This Book About? 
While searching for optimal solutions, two questions arise: where to search and 
how to search. Various optimization methods, to which an uncountable set 
of works is devoted, answer the second question. However, without correctly 
answering the first question, the search for optimal solutions can lead to unsat-
isfactory results. Usually such “optimization” is observed when solving real-life 
problems. Notice that, with the rare exception, very little attention is paid to 
a fundamental problem such as the determination of the feasible solution set 
or where to search for optimal solutions. Defining this set is directly related to 
the correct statement of the optimization problem. This usually represents the 
most significant difficulties for the expert. Therefore, in the majority of cases, 
the expert cannot state the problem correctly and ends up solving ill-posed 
problems. In this book, we will show how to define the feasible solution set and 
thus answer the fundamental question of where to search for optimal solutions. 
Difficulties in Stating an Optimization Problem
The majority of engineering problems (design, identification, design of con-
trolled systems, large-scale systems, predicting from observational data, and so 
on) are essentially multicriteria. These problems are encountered in all facets of 
human activity. The expert always wishes to optimize not one important crite-
rion, but all of the most important criteria, many of which are antagonistic. The 

xiv 
The Parameter Space Investigation Method Toolkit 
basic components of a problem statement are constraints on criteria, design 
variables, and so-called functional dependences. These constraints determine 
the feasible solution set, a region in the criteria and design variable spaces where 
optimal solutions should be sought. The determination of the feasible solution 
set is the essence of problem statement. An important subset of the feasible so-
lution set is referred to as the Pareto optimal solution set. A solution1 is Pareto 
optimal if value of one criterion can be improved only at the expense of worsen-
ing at least one of the other criteria. In order to solve the optimization problem, 
one has to identify the Pareto optimal set. Obviously, if the feasible solution set 
has been determined incorrectly or incompletely, the obtained Pareto solutions 
may not have practical value. Nowadays this situation is quite typical in the 
overwhelmingly majority of engineering problems. 
Nature of Constraints
Performance criteria (goal functions) (e.g., the fuel consumption, cost, efficien-
cy, and so on) should be optimized. It is desired that, with other things being 
equal, these criteria would have the extremal (e.g., maximum or minimum) 
values. Since criteria are contradictory, the definition of criteria constraints rep-
resents significant, sometimes insurmountable difficulties [1–5]. Furthermore, 
there are functional dependences. Unlike criteria, functional dependences do 
not need to be optimized. It is required that only their respective constraints 
are satisfied. We recognize two kinds of functional constraints: rigid and “soft” 
(nonrigid). For example, standards are rigid functional constraints. These con-
straints are not supposed to be changed—they are known a priori. On the other 
hand, “soft” functional constraints (e.g., overall dimensions) can be changed. 
Quite often the correct definition of these constraints is also difficult for the 
expert. If functional constraints are poorly defined, many interesting solutions 
become unreasonably unfeasible. As a result, the feasible solution set can be 
empty. 
Functional dependences and criteria depend on design variables (e.g., 
geometric sizes). Design variables are changed within some boundaries. Quite 
often these boundaries can be revised, if it leads to the improvement of values 
of the main criteria.
Notice that in real-life problems, the number of functional and criteria 
constraints can reach many dozens, if not hundreds, and the dimensionality of 
design variable vector can reach many hundreds and thousands. 
In the traditional statement of optimization problems, constraints are 
usually given a priori. However, it is unlikely that such constraints are correct, 
especially given the high dimensionality of the problems and the complexity of 
1. Vilfredo Pareto (1848–1923) was an Italian economist. A strong deﬁ nition of the Pareto op-
timal set is given in Section 1.1. From now on, we will be using the expression “Compromise 
solutions” to refer to “Pareto optimal solutions.”

 
Preface  
       xv                 
the mathematical model. That is why it is necessary to ensure the correctness 
of given constraints. Otherwise, the optimization can lead to the meaningless 
results or equally to the loss of important solutions. As mentioned earlier, es-
tablished optimization methods do not address the problem of defining the 
feasible solution set.
Taking into account the difficulties of determining constraints, the fea-
sible solution set can be poor or even empty. Therefore, it is very important to 
help the expert determine the constraints correctly. 
Now, let us turn to the example that illustrates the main topic of this 
book. These days it is impossible to imagine a doctor, even the most gifted one, 
working without diagnostic tools, such as X-ray, tomography, lab tests, and so 
on. Likewise, in engineering problems, it is difficult to imagine approaching the 
challenging tasks without the tools for constructing and analyzing the feasible 
solution set. The tools that an expert should use to state and solve real-life prob-
lems are discussed in our book. 
The Parameter Space Investigation (PSI) Method
In order to construct the feasible solution set, a method called the PSI method 
has been created and successfully integrated into various fields of industry, sci-
ence, and technology [1–5]. This method has been used in designing the space 
shuttle [3, 6–8], nuclear reactors [3], unmanned vehicles, [3, 9], aviation [3, 
10–13], cars [3, 14–17], pumping units [18], ships [2, 19–22], metal tools 
[2, 5, 23], bridges [24], wind power system [25, 26], wireless battlefield net-
works [27], energy efficient sensor networks [28], and robots [29]. The PSI 
method is based on the systematic investigation of the multidimensional do-
main [1–5, 30–36]. A computer generates multidimensional points (each point 
corresponds to a certain design). This is accomplished by uniformly distributed 
sequences, nets, and quasi-random points. Then the computer defines the val-
ues of criteria in these points. In a continuing dialogue between an expert and 
a computer, the constraints are repeatedly revised, and, as a result, the feasible 
and Pareto optimal solutions are determined. Thus, an expert can assess the 
price of making concessions in various constraints (i.e., what are the losses and 
the gains). Prior experience has shown that the expert is often ready to change 
constraints by having information on a sufficient improvement of the values of 
the main criteria. An expert obtains such information on the basis of the PSI 
method. 
In the PSI method, stating and solving problems is a single process. Such 
an interactive mode allows us to take into account the experience and knowl-
edge of the expert. As a rule, using the PSI method leads to the correction of the 
initial problem statement, including the correction of constraints and the math-

xvi 
The Parameter Space Investigation Method Toolkit 
ematical model. From our point of view, all real-life optimization problems 
have to be stated and solved in an interactive mode. 
Sometimes using the PSI method can demand carrying out computation-
ally expensive experiments. In these cases most of computer time is spent on 
determining the feasible solution set, the correction of the problem statement 
that eventually leads to obtaining the justified optimal solutions, and there is 
no way around it. 
To the best of our knowledge, the PSI method is the only available method 
for solving the fundamental problem of constructing the feasible solution set. 
The PSI method is implemented in the MOVI (Multicriteria Optimiza-
tion and Vector Identification) software system [37]. The PSI method and the 
MOVI software system can be universally applied to many problems and only 
require access to the mathematical model of the system or object under consid-
eration. Even when a model is not available, the PSI method can still be applied 
to an approximate mathematical model that can be derived from observational 
data using statistical machine learning classification and regression algorithms 
[38–42]. 
The PSI method and MOVI system provide tools for constructing and 
analyzing the feasible solution set. First of all, these are the test tables. Other 
tools are tables of feasible and Pareto optimal solutions, histograms, tables of 
functional failures, and graphs of criterion versus design variable and criterion 
versus criterion. All of these tools provide us with unique information about: 
(1) the distribution of feasible solutions in the design variable and criteria spac-
es, (2) the work of all constraints, (3) the expediency of their modification, and 
(4) resources for improvement of the object.
The Number of Criteria
Consider the important issue of the number of criteria in a real-life problem. 
This number must be no less than necessary. The greater the number of cri-
teria taken into account, the greater the information obtained about: (1) the 
resources of improving the object (ship, car, nuclear reactor, aircraft, machine 
tool, robot, submarine), (2) the performance of a mathematical model and con-
straints, and (3) the accuracy with which the criteria are calculated and how 
much one can trust them. 
The PSI method allows us to consider as many criteria as necessary. For 
example, in the problems of vector identification, the number of criteria reaches 
many dozens [5, 28, 29].
Using Single-Criterion Methods to Solve Real-Life Problems
In the overwhelming majority of cases, attempts are made to present real-life 
multicriteria problems as single-criterion problems. In this case, the expert op-

 
Preface  
       xvii                 
timizes only one criterion and imposes constraints on other criteria. This ap-
proach is appealing because of the apparent simplicity of solving a complex 
problem. However, there is something else more important that calls in ques-
tion the competence of this decision.
Above all, the complex problem of determining the feasible solution set is 
shifted onto the expert’s shoulders. Unfortunately, the expert is usually unable 
to do this. As a result of substituting a single-criterion problem for a real-life 
one, we end up with a problem that has little to do with real life. Therefore, 
the numerous attempts to reduce a multicriteria problem to a single-criterion 
problem result in “throwing out the baby with the bathwater.” The search for 
optimal solutions without determining the feasible solution set is substituting 
myth for reality. In other words, there are two alternatives: do it simply, or do 
it right.
Using single-criterion methods without substantiation of the feasible so-
lution set does not guarantee that the obtained optimal solutions are feasible 
ones. Furthermore, the expert does not have information about compromise 
solutions considering all criteria. 
Multicriteria Identification
Usually in optimization problems we assume by default that the adequacy of the 
mathematical model is beyond question (i.e., performance criteria adequately 
describe the investigated object). However, in the majority of cases it is not true. 
For this reason multicriteria identification of mathematical models is of fun-
damental importance in real-life problems. The central point is the construc-
tion of the feasible solution set in multicriteria identification problems. These 
problems are encountered in the production of machine tools, automobiles, 
ships, and aircraft, where enormous amounts of money are spent on operational 
development of a prototype. Questions of the multicriteria identification and 
adequacy of the mathematical model will be discussed in our book.
After the PSI method was developed and used successfully, it became nec-
essary to write a new book where we synthesized the extensive experience of 
applying the PSI method to a variety of engineering problems. We used it as the 
basis for a lecture course “Multicriteria Analysis,” which is taught in the United 
States and Russia. The material of the book is set out in a popular, concise form, 
with a large number of illustrations. The book is intended for a wide circle of 
readers, from undergraduate to graduate students, to researchers and experts 
involved in solving applied optimization problems. Reading this book does not 
require any special mathematical education. 
This book is organized as follows. Part I gives an overview of the PSI 
method and MOVI software system. Specifically, Chapter 1 provides an in-
troduction to multicriteria analysis. Chapter 2 discusses the PSI method that 

xviii 
The Parameter Space Investigation Method Toolkit 
allows us to construct the feasible and Pareto sets and provides an example of 
a typical engineering optimization problem. In Chapters 3 and 4 the visualiza-
tion tools for multicriteria analysis are demonstrated by means of this example 
where the main possibilities of the MOVI software are illustrated. We show the 
most general case, when an expert requires help for the definition of the feasible 
solution set. 
In Part II, we describe the statement and solution of real-life optimization 
problems2. The choice of real-life examples is motivated by the following con-
siderations: it is desirable to briefly show the process of searching for optimal 
solutions in real problems without going into details of describing the models. 
Part II has the following organization:
• In Chapter 5 we demonstrate examples of improving prototypes of a 
ship, a truck frame, a rear axle housing, and an orthotropic bridge. The 
application of the PSI method in combination with the ﬁ nite element 
analysis is discussed in Sections 5.3 through 5.5. 
• As already noted, one of the major aspects in engineering optimization 
is the adequacy of the mathematical model to the actual object. This 
problem is discussed in Chapter 6. In some cases, in order to identify 
one object, it is necessary to work with several models simultaneously 
(see Section 6.3).
• In Chapter 7 we discuss other multicriteria problems and related issues. 
We often face an important problem where the desired solution is unat-
tainable. The search for the compromise solution for parametric optimi-
zation problem is shown in Section 7.1. The problem of the design of 
controlled engineering systems is presented in Section 7.2. In many cases 
there are no a priori mathematical models. However, there are available 
observations in the form of tables that give an indication of the behavior 
of the system under investigation. Multicriteria analysis from observa-
tional data is considered in Section 7.3. For many applied optimization 
problems, it is necessary to carry out a large-scale numerical experiment 
in order to construct the feasible set. Multicriteria optimization of large-
scale systems in the parallel mode is illustrated in Section 7.4. We also 
discuss the number of trials necessary for the statement and the solution 
of the real-life problems in Section 7.5.
• Chapter 8 considers the new paradigm of database search [43]. The ad-
vent of the World Wide Web made search engines the most essential 
component of our everyday life. However, the analysis of information 
2. If the descriptions of experiments presented in some chapters of Part II are not relevant for 
some readers, you can skip the corresponding chapters.

 
Preface  
       xix                 
provided by current search engines often presents a significant challenge 
to the client. This is, to a large extent, because the client has to deal with 
many alternatives (solutions) described by contradictory criteria when 
selecting the most preferable (optimal) solutions. In such situations, the 
construction of the feasible solution set has a fundamental value. We 
propose a new methodology for systematically constructing the feasible 
solution set for a database search. This allows us to significantly improve 
the quality of the search results. 
• Chapter 9 presents preliminary results of the application of the PSI 
method for the design of the L1 ﬂ ight control system implemented on 
the two-turbine-powered dynamically scaled Generic Transport Model 
(GTM), which is part of the Airborne Subscale Transport Aircraft Re-
search aircraft at the NASA Langley Research Center [12]. In particular, 
the study addresses the construction of the feasible solution set and the 
improvement of a nominal prototype design, obtained using the sys-
tematic design procedures of the L1 adaptive control theory. On one 
hand, the results of this chapter demonstrate the beneﬁ ts of L1 adaptive 
control as a veriﬁ able robust adaptive control architecture by validating 
the theoretical claims in terms of robustness and performance, as well 
as illustrating its systematic design procedures. On the other hand, the 
developed procedure conﬁ rms the suitability of the PSI method for the 
multicriteria design optimization of a ﬂ ight control system subject to 
multiple control speciﬁ cations. Furthermore, in order to facilitate the 
multicriteria analysis process, this study takes advantage of the MOVI 
package, which was designed to apply the PSI method to engineering 
problems. The results and conclusions of this chapter have contributed 
to the improvement of the (predicted) ﬂ ying qualities and the robust-
ness margins of the all-adaptive L1-augmented GTM AirSTAR aircraft.

Dobrokhodov.
Again, in Part II, our goal was to demonstrate multicriteria analysis of 
different real-life problems and to show how the expert controls constraints to 
find the optimal solution. All of these problems are united by the necessity of 
constructing the feasible solution set. 
Examples of calculation of the approximate compromise curves are de-
scribed in the appendix. The appendix considers two simple problems where 
compromise curves can be found by an analytical procedure; the calculated 
approximate compromise curves are compared to the exact ones.

The Parameter Space Investigation Method Toolkit 
In summary, the main idea of this book is to demonstrate that the con-
struction and analysis of the feasible solution set are of primary importance in 
real-life optimization problems. The application of the PSI method and the 
MOVI software has allowed us to solve many problems that, until recently, 
appeared to be intractable. The expediency of further applications of various 
optimization methods, including stochastic, genetic, and other algorithms, de-
pends first on the results of the analysis of feasible and Pareto optimal solutions 
obtained on the basis of the PSI method. 
The application area of the PSI method is fairly large. In our book, we will 
be limiting ourselves to the construction and analysis of the feasible solution set 
as a basis of engineering optimization problems. We also address our book to 
all those who deal with real-life optimization in various areas of human activity, 
including biology, geology, chemistry, and physics [1–3, 5].

Part I
The Parameter Space Investigation 
Method Toolkit
For the correct formulation and solution of real-life optimization problems, 
a method called the parameter space investigation (PSI) has been created and 
widely integrated into various fields of human activity. The PSI method is im-
plemented in the Multicriteria Optimization and Vector Identification (MOVI) 
software system.

Introduction 
1.1 Some Basic Features of Real-Life Optimization Problems
Let us start by enumerating some basic features of real-life optimization 
problems. 
• These problems are essentially multicriteria ones. Numerous attempts to 
reduce multicriteria problems to single-criterion problems have proved 
to be fruitless. By presenting a multicriteria problem in the form of a 
single-criterion problem, we replace the initial problem with a different 
problem that has little in common with the original one. Obviously, 
one should always try to take into account all basic performance criteria 
simultaneously. 
• The determination of the feasible solution set is one of the fundamental 
issues of the real-life problems. The construction of the feasible set is an 
importance step in the formulation and solution of such problems. 
• As a rule, the feasible solution set may be obtained only in the process 
of solving a problem and analysis of results. Analysis of the feasible set 
allows one to not only correct the initial constraints, but also to revise 
the original mathematical models and list of criteria. The multicriteria 
problems should be formulated and solved in the interactive mode. The 
formulation and solution of a real-life problem should be a single pro-
cess [1].

The Parameter Space Investigation Method Toolkit 
• Mathematical models can be complex systems of equations (including 
differential and other types of equations) that may be linear or nonlin-
ear, deterministic, or stochastic, with distributed or lumped parameters. 
Sometimes mathematical models have to be derived from observational 
data using statistical machine learning techniques. 
• The feasible solution set can be multiply connected, and its volume may 
be several orders of magnitude smaller than that of the domain within 
which the optimal solution is sought. 
• Both the feasible solution set and the Pareto optimal set are nonconvex 
in the general case. As a rule, information about the smoothness of ob-
jective functions and functional dependences is absent. These functions 
are usually nonlinear; they may be nondifferentiable as well.
• A real-life optimization problem may contain a large number of con-
straints, and the dimensionality can reach: (1) many hundreds and thou-
sands for the design variable vector, and (2) many dozens, if not hun-
dreds, for the criterion vector. 
• Very often experts do not encounter serious difﬁ culties in analyzing the 
Pareto optimal set and in choosing the most preferred solution [1–5]. 
This is because experts have a sufﬁ ciently well-deﬁ ned system of prefer-
ences1 in this type of problems and the Pareto optimal set often contains 
a small number of solutions due to stringent constraints. 
To formulate and solve real-life optimization problems, a method called the  
parameter space investigation (the PSI method) has been developed. A systematic 
and comprehensive description of this method can be found in [1, 5]. 
1.2 Generalized Formulation of Multicriteria Optimization Problems 
We assume that an object depends on r design variables α1, ..., αr representing 
a point α = (α1, ..., α r) in the r-dimensional space. Generally, an expert has to 
take into account the design variable, functional, and criteria constraints. 
The design variable constraints have the form α

**
j

j , j = 1, …, r. In 
the case of mechanical systems, the αj represent stiffness coefficients, the mo-
ments of inertia, damping factors, geometric sizes, and so forth. 
The functional constraints can be written as follows:

are

not necessarily stable, are discussed in [6].

some constants. Functional constraints can be the standards, allowable stress in 
structural elements, and other requirements to the system. 
The design variable constraints single out a parallelepiped Π in the r-
dimensional design variable space (space of design variables); see Figure 1.1. In 
turn, design variable and functional constraints together define a certain subset 
G in Π; see Figure 1.2. 
There also exist particular performance criteria, such as fuel consumption, 
efficiency, cost, and so on. It is desired that, with other things being equal, these 
criteria, denoted by Φv(α), v = 1, ..., k, would reach extremal values. We assume 
that Φv(α) are to be minimized.

Figure 1.2 Subset G in Π.

The Parameter Space Investigation Method Toolkit 
Unlike criteria, functional dependences do not need to be optimized. 
To avoid situations in which the expert regards the values of some criteria 
as unacceptable, we introduce criteria constraints in the form 
( )
α
Φ
≤Φ**,
v
v
 v = 
1, ..., k, where Φ**
v  is the worst value of criterion Φv(α) acceptable to an expert. 
The choice of Φ**
v  is discussed in the Chapter 2.
The design variable, functional, and criteria constraints define the feasible 
solution set D ⊂ G ⊂ Π; see Figure 1.3. 
If functions fl(α) and Φv(α) are continuous in Π, then the sets G and D 
are closed.
Let us formulate one of the basic problems of multicriteria optimization. 
It is necessary to define the feasible solution set D and find a set P ⊂ D such 
that

where Φ(α) = (Φ1(α), ..., Φk(α)) is the criterion vector and P is the Pareto op-
timal set. We mean that Φ(α) < Φ(β) if for all v = 1, …, k, Φv (α)  Φv(β) and 
for at least one v0  {1, ...,k},

When solving this problem, one has to determine the vector of design 
variables αO ∈ P, which is the most preferable one among the vectors belonging 
to set P.
Let us give an alternative definition of the Pareto optimal set.

of Pareto optimal points.
The Pareto optimal set plays an important role in multicriteria optimiza-
tion problems because it can be analyzed more easily than the feasible solution 
set and because the most preferable solution always belongs to the Pareto opti-
mal set, irrespective of the system of preferences used by the expert for compar-
ing vectors belonging to the feasible solution set [1–5, 7–10].
1.3 Applying Single-Criterion Methods for Solving Multicriteria 
Problems
As already noted, the real-life problems are essentially multicriteria. However, 
in an overwhelming majority of cases, these problems are solved as single ones. 
Consider two widespread approaches. 
1.3.1 
Substitution of a Multitude of Criteria by a Single One
For instance, in this case one needs to choose weight coefficients βv ≥ 0 (usually, 
β1 + … + βk = 1) so that the function

( )

integrates all criteria Φ1,…, Φk and to consider Φ(α) as the only performance 
criterion. The coefficient βv reflects the relative “importance” of the criterion 
Φv, v = 1,…, k.
In practice, the values of βv are usually unknown beforehand, especially if 
these criteria are of different natures and reflect different aspects of the system’s 
behavior. 
To use this approach we should answer the most challenging questions: 
• How do we deﬁ ne a decision rule (or how do we convolute the criteria)? 
In other words, why should we sum the criteria instead of multiplying 
them or carrying out other operations? 
• How do we deﬁ ne the weight coefﬁ cients?

8 
The Parameter Space Investigation Method Toolkit 
Also, before convoluting the criteria, we should normalize them (i.e., 
make dimensionless). Notice that normalization of criteria for solving a specific 
problem is a difficult task. 
1.3.2 
Optimization of the Most Important Criterion
In this case the criterion Φ1(α) considered by the expert to be the most im-
portant is optimized, while all the others are replaced by constraints. We have 
to choose constraints Φ

In this approach we should answer the challenging question: What is the 
most important criterion? Notice that the majority of real-life problems contain 
several meaningful criteria, and some of them are conflicting. This is a charac-
teristic feature of real-life problems.
In general, in cases 1.3.1 and 1.3.2 it is difficult, sometimes even im-
possible to answer the above-mentioned questions correctly. However, if we 
even answer these questions, the main question, namely, how to construct the 
feasible solution set D (to define constraints α α

), still remains 
open, that is, there is no guarantee that we will search for the optimal solutions 
in the right place. With it we do not exclude an opportunity of representation 
of multicriteria problems as single-criterion ones. However, preliminarily it is 
necessary to define the feasible solution set. The problem of correct construct-
ing the feasible solution set will be discussed in the Chapters 2 and 3. 
We will revisit and cover in greater detail the substitution of a multitude 
of criteria by a single one in Sections 2.2 and 2.3. 

 
Introduction  
       9                 
1.4 Systematic Search in Multidimensional Domains by Using 
Uniformly Distributed Sequences
The features of the problems under consideration make it necessary to represent 
vectors α by points of uniformly distributed sequences in the design variable 
space [2, 4, 5]. We briefly summarize this approach next. 
For many applied problems the following situation is typical. There ex-
ists a multidimensional domain in which a function (or a system of functions) 
is considered whose values may be calculated at certain points. Suppose we 
wish to get some information on the behavior of the function in the entire do-
main or in any subdomain. Then, in the absence of any additional information 
about the function, it is natural to wish that the points at which the function 
is calculated would be uniformly distributed within the domain. However, the 
following question arises: What meaning should be assigned to the notion of a 
uniform distribution? This concept is quite evident only in the case of a single 
variable. By dividing the range of the variable into N equal parts and locating 
a point within each of the parts, we arrive at a sequence of N points (a net) 
uniformly distributed over the domain under consideration. Unfortunately, in 
the case of several variables the concept of uniformity is not so evident. If for 
each of the variables we make a partition similar to that done in the case of a 
single variable, then for n variables we get N n points (a cubic net). However, the 
concept of uniformity should be independent of the number of points, and, in 
addition, the use of nets containing so many points seriously complicates the 
solution of practical problems.
Weyl was the first to give the definition of uniformity [5, 7]. Let us con-
sider a sequence of points P1, P2, ..., Pi, ... belonging to a unit r-dimensional 
cube K r. We denote by G an arbitrary domain in K r and we denote by SN (G) 
the number of points Pi belonging to G (l ≤ i ≤ N ). The sequence Pi is called 
uniformly distributed in K r, if

where VG is the volume of the r-dimensional domain G. 
The meaning of the definition is the following [1, 5, 7]: for large values of 
N, the number of points of a given sequence belonging to an arbitrary domain 
G is proportional to volume VG:

In solving real-life problems, one must commonly deal not with K r, but 
with a certain parallelepiped Π, and, hence, move from the coordinates of the 
points uniformly distributed in K r to those in Π. 
Let us formulate the following statements [5]. If points Qi with Carte-
sian coordinates (qi1, ..., qir) form a uniformly distributed sequence in K r, then 
points αi with Cartesian coordinates

Let α1,..., αi, ...  be a sequence of points uniformly distributed in Π, and 
G ⊂ Π be an arbitrary domain with volume VG > 0. If among the points αi, one 
chooses all the points belonging to G, then one obtains the sequence of points 
uniformly distributed in G [5]. 
1.4.1 
Quantitative Characteristics of Uniformity 
Let us fix a net consisting of the points P1, ..., PN ∈ K. To estimate the uniformi-
ty of distribution of these points quantitatively, we introduce the quantity D(P1, 
..., PN), called the discrepancy, implying the discrepancy between the “ideal” and 
actual uniformities.
Let P be an arbitrary point belonging to K and GP be an n-dimensional 
parallelepiped with the diagonal OP and faces parallel to the coordinate planes 
(Figure 1.4). Denote by 
P

 the volume of GP and by SN(GP), the number of 
points Pi that enter GP and whose subscripts satisfy the inequalities 1 ≤ i ≤ N.

where the supremum is taken over all possible positions of the point P in the 
cube. It is natural to consider that the smaller D(P1, ..., PN) is, the more uni-
formly the points P1, ..., PN are arranged. We mention here works by Halton 
[11], Hammersley [12], Hlawka [13], Faure [14], and Kuipers and Niederreiter 
[15, 16], in which uniformly distributed sequences and nets (in the sense of the 
uniformity estimates) have been constructed.

Parameter Space Investigation Method 
as a Tool for Formulation and Solution of 
Real-Life Problems
The PSI method fully meets most important features of engineering optimiza-
tion problems, including problems with “soft” functional constraints. 
We will consider why correct statement of optimization problem is very 
important and why an expert requires help for definition of the feasible solu-
tion set (constraints on design variables, functional dependences, and criteria).
The greater the number of criteria taken into account, the greater the in-
formation obtained about: (1) the resources of improving the object (ship, car, 
nuclear reactor, aircraft, machine tool, robot, submarine); (2) the performance 
of a mathematical model and constraints; and (3) the accuracy with which the 
criteria are calculated and how much one can trust them. 
The PSI method allows us to consider as many criteria as necessary. 
The material described in this chapter is provided in full detail in many 
references [1–9]. That is why we confined ourselves to the brief description of 
the basis of the PSI method.
2.1 The Parameter Space Investigation Method
In Section 1.2 we formulated the problem of multicriteria optimization and 
defined the feasible solution set D, which is constructed using the values of Φ**
v , 
v = 1,…, k and other constraints. Now we proceed by describing the parameter 
space investigation (PSI) method that allows us to determine Φ**
v  and, hence, 
the feasible solution set.

14 
The Parameter Space Investigation Method Toolkit 
The method consists of three stages (see Figure 2.1). 
Stage 1: Compilation of Test Tables Via Computer
First, N trial points α1, ..., αN that satisfy the functional constraints are gener-
ated. Then all the particular criteria Φv(αi ) are calculated at each of the points 
αi; for each of the criteria a test table is compiled so that the values of Φv(α1), 
..., Φv(αN) are arranged in increasing order; that is,

where i1, i2 ,..., iN are the numbers of trials (a separate set for each v). Taken 
together, the k tables form complete test tables. In other words, all values of 
each criterion are arranged in a test table in order (from best to worst values).
Stage 2: Selection of Criterion Constraints
This stage includes dialogs of an expert with computer. By analyzing inequali-
ties (2.1), an expert specifies the criteria constraints Φ**
v . Actually, an expert has 
to consider one criterion at a time and specify the respective constraints. He 
analyzes one test table and imposes the criterion constraint. Then he proceeds 
to the next test table, and so on. Note that the revision of the criteria constraints 
does not lead to any difficulties for an expert. 
Since we want to minimize all criteria, Φ**
v  should be the maximum val-
ues of the criteria Φv(α) which guarantee an acceptable level of the object’s 
operation. 
If the selected values of Φ**
v  are not a maximum, then many interesting 
solutions may be lost, since some of the criteria are contradictory. Moreover, in 
some cases, the feasible solution set may be empty. 
In practice the expert imposes the criteria constraints in order to improve 
a prototype by all criteria simultaneously. If it is impossible, he or she improves 
a prototype by the most important criteria. In process of dialogues with com-
puter, the expert repeatedly revises criteria constraints and carries out the mul-
ticriteria analysis. The PSI method gives the expert valuable information on the 
advisability of revising various criteria constraints with the aim of improving 
the basic criteria. The expert sees what price one pays for making concessions in 
various criteria (i.e., what one loses and what one gains).
Stage 3: Verification of the Solvability of Problem Via Computer
Let us fix a criterion, for example, 
α
Φ
1( )

, and consider the corresponding test 
table (2.1). Let S1 be the number of the values in the table satisfying the selected 
criterion constraint:

ried out for each criterion. Then if at least one point can be found for which 
all criteria constraints are valid simultaneously, then the set D is nonempty and 
problem (1.1) is solvable. Otherwise, the expert should return to Stage 2 and 
make certain concessions in criteria constraints Φ**
v . However, if the conces-
sions are highly undesirable, then one may return to Stage 1 and increase the 
number of points N in order to repeat Stage 2 and Stage 3. 
The procedure is iterated until D is nonempty. Then the Pareto optimal 
set is constructed in accordance with the definition presented above. This is 
done by removing those feasible points that can be improved with respect to all 
criteria simultaneously. 
Thus, in accordance with the PSI method, the criteria constraints are de-
termined in the dialogue of an expert with a computer. Then an expert should 
determine the Pareto set P and after analyzing P, find the most preferred solu-
tion Φ(αO). As already noted, for discussed problems experts do not encounter 
serious difficulties in analyzing the Pareto optimal set and in choosing the most 
preferred solution.
The approximation of the feasible solution and Pareto optimal sets with 
a given accuracy is considered in [1, 2, 4]. In the appendix examples of calcula-
tion of the approximate compromise curves are shown. The definition of the 
feasible solution set in multicriteria problems with discrete and mixed design 
variables on the basis of PSI method is described in [6]. 
2.1.1 
The Complexity of the Investigation
The property of uniform distribution of points implies that γ = V(D)/V(Π) ≈ 
ND /N for sufficiently large N. Here N is the number of points αi ∈ Π; ND is the 
number of points that have entered the feasible solution set; V(D) is a volume 
of the feasible solution set; V(Π) is a volume of the parallelepiped Π. The ratio 
of the volumes γ in the Monte Carlo theory is called the selection efficiency. For 
many engineering problems γ << 0.001; thus the search for feasible solution is 
like looking for a needle in a haystack. In fact, γ characterizes the complexity 
of solving problems. Very often after correction of constraints, the value of γ is 
vastly increased. The number of tests in the real-life problems strongly depends 
on a correctness of the initial statement of a problem. Using the PSI method, 
most of the computer time is spent on determining the feasible solution set, 
the correction of the problem statement that eventually leads to obtaining the 
justified optimal solutions. The number of trials in the real-life problems will 
be considered in Chapter 7.
The PSI method has proved to be a very convenient and effective tool for 
the expert, primarily because this method can be used for the statement and 
solution of the problem in an interactive mode.

2.1.2 
Definition of the Feasible Solution in Parallel Mode
In some cases the time necessary for construction of the feasible solution set 
is one of the most important factors (e.g., in investigating high-dimensional 
problems). The use of the MOVI allows us to carry out optimization on many 
computers simultaneously, which obviously takes far less time than if we had 
tried to solve these problems on a single computer. In this case, the number 
of tests N can be distributed between k computers. So each computer finds a 
feasible solution set for its own subproblem. Then it is necessary to combine 
feasible solutions and construct a combined Pareto optimal set (see Section 4.2 
and Chapter 7).
2.1.3 
Number Generators for Systematic Search in the Design Variable Space
To investigate design variable space, we use uniformly distributed sequences. 
We often prefer the LPτ sequences. The points of LPτ sequences Qi = (qi,1, qi,2, 
..., qi,50), belonging to a unit cube K 50, 
= 1,
i
N  for N = 256, 2,048, 4,096, 
and 8,192 are shown in Figure 2.2. (These projections were constructed using 
MOVI.)
LPτ sequences are used to compute N test points α1,..., αN in the design 
variable space during Stage 1 of the PSI method. Other uniformly distributed 
sequences and nets [4, 10–15] can be also successfully used in the PSI method, 
see scheme presented in Figure 2.1. 
However, prior to solving a specific problem, one cannot say with cer-
tainty which uniformly distributed sequences or nets are the most suitable. 
Much depends on the behavior of the criteria, the form of the functional and 
design variable constraints, the number of tests, and the geometry of the fea-
sible solution set. Steuer and Sun indicated an opportunity of using random 
number generators in the PSI method [16]. Based on these recommendations, 
we have successfully applied random number generators in the PSI method to 
solve multicriteria problems with very high-dimensional design variable vectors 
(dimensionality = 1,000) and to also solve the problems in the parallel mode 
[7, 8]. The experiments with various random number generators in the PSI 
method are described in [9]. 
2.2 “Soft” Functional Constraints and Pseudo-Criteria
Using the traditional approach to multicriteria problems, one tries to reduce the 
number of criteria. The criticism of such approach is described in Section 1.2. 
From the standpoint of our technique, it is necessary to act on the con-
trary. As indicated in the preface, we have two kinds of functional constraints: 
rigid and “soft.” Usually “soft” functional constraints can be changed, if these 

18 
The Parameter Space Investigation Method Toolkit 
revisions lead to the improvement of criteria values. Next we show how to de-
fine “soft” constraints. 
In the case of unjustifiably strong constraints

 on functional de-
pendences, many solutions can become unfeasible (i.e., do not satisfy criteria 
constraints Φ**
v ). For this reason the feasible solution set can be poor or even 
empty. Therefore, it is very important to help the expert determine the “soft” 
functional constraints correctly.
Let us assume that

straints. The concept of pseudo-criteria is presented as the following. Instead of 
the function fl(α), we introduce an additional criterion Φk+l(α) = fl(α), which 
we call a pseudo-criterion. To find the value of the constraint

compile a test table containing Φk+l(α). By using the PSI method, one can de-
fine 
+

k l  in a way that prevents the loss of interesting solutions. (Obviously, if 
rigid constraints under certain conditions can be changed, then the correspond-
ing functional dependences should be also presented as pseudo-criteria.) In gen-
eral, when solving a problem with “soft” functional constraints, one has to find 
the set D, taking all performance criteria and pseudo-criteria into account. In 
other words, one must solve the problem with the constraints

Thus, to define the feasible solution set, we consider a multicriteria prob-
lem with k + t criteria (and pseudo-criteria). Notice, however, that the pseudo-
criteria are not considered when constructing the Pareto optimal set. 
It is worthwhile to mention that many single-criterion problems have 
“soft” functional constraints (e.g., weight, dimensions, longevity, and so on). 
In these cases the definition of the feasible solution set is also very important. 
For determining this set, it is necessary to represent functional dependences 
as pseudo-criteria. In other words, we have to consider such single-criterion 
problems as multicriteria ones. In these cases, the test tables contain one perfor-
mance criterion and the rest are pseudo-criteria.
2.3 More About Applying Single-Criterion Methods for Solving 
Multicriteria Problems
When an expert optimizes a single criterion from the set of criteria, he or she 
frequently does not know what the values of other important criteria are. Quite 
often, they turn out to be incorrect because of the imperfection of the math-
ematical models. Using single-criterion methods, the expert does not have suf-
ficient information about the feasible solution set. 
Often constraints that should define the feasible solution set in single-
criteria problems are not feasible. As a result, there is no guarantee that the 
found optimal solution is feasible. In addition to this, single-criterion methods 
are not intended to search for compromise solutions or to determine the prefer-
able solution among them. 
The more criteria are optimized, the more information the expert obtains 
about compromise solutions, the model’s work, and the correctness of calculat-
ing criteria. The expert obtains this information using the PSI method.
As noted earlier, in the case of optimizing a convolution of criteria, the 
expert is facing intractable problems of: (1) a substantiation of convolution, (2) 
normalization of criteria, and (3) definition of weight factors. However, we do 
not have to deal with these problems when using the PSI method. In our case 

20 
The Parameter Space Investigation Method Toolkit 
the expert uses nonnormalized values of criteria (in pounds, dollars, inches, 
gallons, hours, mph, and so on) in the test table, so it is easy to analyze the 
obtained results and make decisions. 
In Section 1.3 we considered the two typical statements of single-criterion 
problem. As indicated earlier, in these cases the complex problem of determin-
ing the feasible solution set is shifted onto the expert’s shoulders. Unfortunately, 
the expert is usually unable to do this. The PSI method gives the opportunity 
to define the feasible solution set. Only after constructing and analyzing the 
feasible solution set and Pareto optimal set the expert can consider applying 
single-criterion optimization methods for the further improvement of the ob-
tained results (e.g., the value of any criterion).
2.4 An Example of Optimization Problem Statement and Significant 
Challenge That It Presents
Here we consider optimization problem statement and the typical difficulties 
encountered at this stage. 
The vibratory system consists of two bodies with masses M1 and K2 (see 
Figure 2.3).
• The mass M1 is attached to a ﬁ xed base by a spring with stiffness coef-
ﬁ cient K1.
• A spring-and-dashpot1 element with stiffness coefficient K2 and damp-
ing coefficient C is located between masses M1 and M2.
• The harmonic force acts upon mass M1.
• The amplitude and frequency of the exciting force are identiﬁ ed as P = 
2,000 (N) and ω = 30 (s−1). 
1. A dashpot is a mechanical device, a damper that resists motion via friction. The resulting force 
is proportional to the velocity, but acts in the opposite direction, slowing the motion and absorb-
ing energy. It is commonly used in conjunction with a spring (which acts to resist displacement).

The upper limits on the functions f2 and f3 are defined approximately and 
can be significantly modified. In other words, we have two “soft” functional 
constraints f2(α) ≤ 42.0, f3(α)  32.0; the rest of functional constraints  f1(α) ≤ 
1,100.0, 33.0 ≤ f2(α), 27.0  f3(α) are rigid. According to Section 2.2, in order 
to define “soft” constraints on functional relations f2 and f3, the latter should be 
interpreted as the pseudo-criteria, that is, Φ1= f2 and Φ2= f3. 
The system is to be minimized with respect to the following four perfor-
mance criteria: 
• Φ3 = X1∂ (mm): vibration amplitude of the ﬁ rst mass;
• Φ4 = M1 + M2 (kg): metal consumption of the system;

22 
The Parameter Space Investigation Method Toolkit 
• Φ5 = X1∂ /X1st: dimensionless dynamical characteristic of the system, 
where X1st is the static displacement of mass M1 under the action of the 
force P;
• Φ6 =  ω/p1: dimensionless dynamical characteristic of the system.
Taking the above into account, we formulate the optimization problem.

2.4.1 
Expert’s Difficulties
Because criteria are antagonistic, it is necessary to help the expert define the 
criteria constraints correctly. As a rule, the expert is ready to change a priori 
given functional and design variable constraints if it leads to sufficiently im-
proved values of main criteria. Hence, it is necessary to help the expert obtain 
this information.
Using this example, we will:
1. Show how to deﬁ ne criteria constraints in the interactive mode.
2. Estimate given design variable constraints and show how to correct 
them.
3. Discuss validity of the given functional constraints.
4. Determine the feasible solution set and the Pareto optimal set.
5. Consider various tools for multicriteria analysis. 
The issues 1–4 are particularly relevant because they are always encoun-
tered by experts while solving real-life problems.
Thus, the main issue of real-life optimization problem is how to define 
the feasible solution set. We described a typical statement of optimization prob-
lem and the challenge it presents to the expert. By providing this example, we 
will consider the construction of feasible solutions and the Pareto optimal set 
when the expert requires help to define the constraints.

In Chapters 3 and 4 we will demonstrate how to correctly state and solve 
this example using the PSI method and the MOVI software.

Using the PSI Method and MOVI 
Software System for Multicriteria 
Analysis and Visualization 
The PSI method is implemented in the MOVI (Multicriteria Optimization and 
Vector Identification) software package1 [1]. Various elements of the MOVI 
software package allow an expert to: (1) correctly construct the feasible solu-
tion set, (2) analyze obtained results, and (3) make a decision about the most 
preferable solution on the Pareto set. Once the feasible solution set is defined, 
an expert can use well-known optimization methods for a further search of the 
optimal solution. 
Next we describe visualization tools that are particularly useful for multi-
criteria analysis. All tools are implemented in the software system MOVI [2–7]:
• Test tables; 
• Tables of feasible and Pareto optimal solutions (tables of criteria and 
design variables); 
• Two kinds of histograms: “Design Variable Histograms” (histograms of 
the distribution of feasible and Pareto optimal solutions) and “Criteria 
Histograms”;
• Two kinds of graphs “Criterion versus Design Variable”; 
• Graphs “Criterion versus Criterion”;
• Tables of functional failures for correcting functional constraints.
1. In this chapter and Chapter 4, all ﬁ gures were produced using the MOVI software, with the 
exception of Figure 4.19.

We will give only brief comments on tools since numerous illustrations 
provided in this chapter are self-explanatory.
Using these techniques developed on the basis of the PSI method, an ex-
pert can correctly state and solve the problem under consideration in a series of 
dialogues with the computer.
3.1 Performing Tests 
We consider the example described in Section 2.4. We carry out N = 1,024 
tests (see Figure 3.1). N1 = 789 solutions entered test table; these solutions 
satisfy rigid functional constraints (2.6) and design variable constraints (2.4). 
Two hundred thirty-five out of 1,024 vectors did not satisfy rigid functional 
constraints. Generally, it is desirable to check the feasibility of rigid constraints. 
During the analysis, an expert can revise some of the constraints. In Section 3.4 
we will analyze the work of functional constraints.
3.2 Construction of Feasible and Pareto Optimal Sets
3.2.1 
Constructing Test Tables
Criteria constraints are determined on the basis of investigation of the test table 
that is constructed for each criterion. All vectors are arranged in order of de-
creasing quality. The best solution is located on the top of the test table. For 
the first criterion, the three best vectors are 480, 608, and 160. For the second 
criterion, the best vectors are 901, 222, and 476. These solutions are shown and 
circled in Figure 3.2.
The worst solution is located on the bottom of the test table (see Figure 
3.3). The worst vectors for the first criterion are 63, 671, and 959; for the sec-
ond criterion they are 552, 475, and 889. These solutions are circled; min Φ1
i  
= 33.01 corresponds to vector #480 (Figure 3.2), max Φ1
i  = 45.60 corresponds 
to vector #63 (Figure 3.3), min Φ2
i  = 27.00 corresponds to vector #901 (Figure 
3.2), max Φ2
i  = 40.64 corresponds to vector #552 (Figure 3.3). 
In Figures 3.2 through 3.6 and later on, the following notations are used:
• N is the number of performed tests.
• N1 is the number of tests that entered the test table (that satisfied all 
design variable and functional constraints).
• NF is the number of feasible solutions (that satisfied all constraints).

            Using the PSI Method and MOVI for Multicriteria Analysis and Visualization            27
• NP is the number of Pareto optimal solutions.
• Min and max are the minimum and maximum values of the ith crite-
rion in the test table (after N tests).
• Nf is the number of solutions that satisﬁ ed the constraint on the ith 
criterion and all previous criteria constraints simultaneously.

3.2.2 
Constructing the Feasible Solution Set: Dialogues of an Expert with a 
Computer
First, an expert imposes constraints on each criterion. After that, the computer 
searches for the common vectors that satisfy all criteria constraints. These vec-
tors are called the feasible solutions. If the obtained results are not satisfactory 
for an expert, he or she revises constraints and/or increases the number of tests.
• First dialogue (see Figure 3.2): We have imposed criteria constraints cor-
respondingly to the best solutions by the ﬁ rst criterion (vector 480) and 
the second criterion (vector 901). As a result, we have obtained an empty 
feasible solution set, NF = 0. What should we do next? We need to revise 
constraints, for example, relax some of them. Therefore, we make con-
cessions. The case where the criteria constraints have not been imposed 
at all is shown in Figure 3.3. Therefore, all solutions that satisfy func-
tional constraints are feasible, NF = 789. 
• Second dialogue (see Figure 3.4): By comparison with the first dialogue, 
we made concessions in all criteria. The first criterion constraint is satis-
fied by 10 solutions, Nf = 10. However, the feasible solution set is empty 
again, NF = 0. We need to make more concessions.
• Last dialogue (see Figures 3.5 and 3.6).

worst solutions are circled.

• First criterion (see Figure 3.5): We imposed the constraint Φ1
** = 
35.200. This value corresponds to the vector 56. One can see that Nf 
= 120 out of 789 vectors satisfy the first criterion constraint. 
• Second criterion (see Figure 3.5): We imposed the constraint Φ2
** = 
37.02. This value corresponds to the vector 381. Nf = 109 vectors 
satisfy the constraints on the first and second criteria.

• Third criterion (see Figure 3.5): We imposed the constraint Φ3
** = 
8.567. This value corresponds to the vector 492. Nf = 62 vectors sat-
isfy the constraints on the first, second, and third criteria. 
• Fourth criterion (see Figure 3.5): We imposed the constraint Φ4
** = 
1,021.93. This value corresponds to the vector 695. Nf = 8 vectors 
satisfy the constraints on the first, second, third, and fourth criteria.
• Fifth criterion (see Figure 3.6): We imposed the constraint Φ5
** = 
18.794. This value corresponds to the vector 656. Nf = 8 vectors 
satisfy the constraints on the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth 
criteria.
• Sixth criterion (see Figure 3.6): We imposed constraint Φ6
** = 0.908. 
This value corresponds to the vector 480. Nf = 8 vectors satisfy all 
constraints. A feasible solution set contains eight vectors, NF = 8.
The results are shown in Figure 3.7. After 1,024 tests, we obtained eight 
feasible solutions that satisfy all constraints. Four out of these solutions are Pa-
reto optimal (corresponding to the vectors 520, 336, 672, 288).
3.2.3 
Tables of Feasible and Pareto Optimal Solutions
These tables allow an expert to obtain information about the values of crite-
ria and design variables of feasible and Pareto optimal solutions (Figures 3.8 
through 3.11).

3.2.4 
Selecting the Most Preferable Solution 
An expert has obtained the Pareto optimal solutions (see Figures 3.7 and 3.8). 
Then he or she needs to analyze the Pareto optimal solutions (see Figures 3.8 
and 3.10) and define the best solution. As indicated in the Section 1.1, the anal-
ysis of the Pareto optimal set to determine the most preferable solution does not 
pose a challenge to an expert in our type of problems. This is because experts 
have a sufficiently well-defined system of preferences and the Pareto optimal set 
often contains only a few solutions due to stringent constraints.
In our case we have two pseudo-criteria (Criteria 1 and 2) and four perfor-
mance criteria (Criteria 3–6). We have obtained four Pareto optimal solutions 
520, 336, 672, and 288 (see Figures 3.7 and 3.8). 
It is follows from Figure 3.8:
• The minimum value of Criterion 3 (equal to 2.932) corresponds to 
solution 288.
• The minimum value of Criterion 4 (equal to 1,002.77) corresponds to 
solution 336.

• The minimum value of Criterion 5 (equal to 1.636) corresponds to 
solution 288.
• The minimum value of Criterion 6 (equal to 0.86) corresponds to solu-
tion 520. 
In Figure 3.8 these solutions are circled. 
An expert may prefer solution 336 with a minimum of metal consump-
tion, or solution 288 with the best values of the amplitude of the first mass 
and dynamical characteristic X1d /X1st, or solution 520 with a minimum of the 
dynamical characteristic ω/p1, or a compromise solution 672.
3.3 Histograms and Graphs
So an expert has defined the feasible and Pareto optimal sets. Several important 
questions arise: 
• How reasonable were the design variable constraints given in the initial 
problem? 
• Is it possible to improve obtained Pareto optimal solutions? 
Analysis of test tables and tables of feasible and Pareto optimal solutions, 
histograms, and graphs allows us to answer these questions.

Design Variable Histograms: Histograms of the Distribution of Feasible 
Solutions

 j = 1, …, r is divided into 10 iden-
tical subintervals (see Figures 3.12 through 3.16). Above each subinterval, the 
number of feasible solutions entering this subinterval is indicated. Analyzing 
the histograms as well as tables of feasible solutions reveals how these solutions 
are distributed in design variable space. The histograms and tables of feasible 
solutions play an important role in correcting the design variable and other 
constraints.
The regions of the feasible and Pareto optimal solutions are circled in Fig-
ures 3.12, 3.14, and 3.15. All eight feasible solutions are located on the left end 
of the range of change for the first and third design variables (Figures 3.12 and 
3.14). In these cases it can be recommended to decrease the values of the left 
and right borders for these design variables. The feasible solutions for the fourth 
design variable are located in the middle of the interval (Figure 3.15). Here the 
value of the left border can be increased and the right border decreased.

On the other hand, the feasible solutions for the second and the fifth de-
sign variables are more or less uniformly distributed along the interval. 
The analysis of the histograms allows us to see the work of constraints and 
is helpful for the correction of the initial design variable constraints.

3.3.2 
Criteria Histograms: Visualization of Contradictory Criteria
Criteria histograms are constructed on the basis of criteria tables (Figure 3.9). 
The next criteria histograms are given taking into account pseudo-criteria and 
criteria (Figures 3.17 through 3.22). Eight feasible solutions, #288, #336, #520, 
#544, #560, #672, #896, and #968, are located in corresponding intervals: 
[33.81; 34.87] for the first pseudo-criterion; [27.1; 31.19] for the second pseu-
do-criterion; [2.93; 7.47] for the third criterion; [1,003; 1,018] for the fourth 
criterion; [1.63; 4.27] for the fifth criterion; and [0.860; 0.887] for the sixth 
criterion. The feasible solutions are shown with color bars on the histograms. 
Using our simple mathematical model (2.3), (2.4), and (2.6), we show 
that the relations between criteria are very complex. This situation is typical 
to real-life problems. Therefore, finding all the feasible and Pareto optimal 
solutions is an important problem for correct decision-making. On the basis 
of the PSI method and multicriteria analysis, an expert obtains this relevant 
information.

Graphs “Criterion Versus Design Variable II”
We consider projections of the multidimensional points Φv(αi), v = 1, …, k, i 
= 1, …, N1 onto the plane Φvαj. These projections provide information about

eight feasible solutions (blue and green points) and four Pareto optimal solu-
tions (green points). Unfeasible solutions are shown with magenta. One can see 
that the first and sixth criteria are antagonistic with respect to the first design 
variable and strongly depend on this parameter (Figures 3.23 and 3.26). It is 
not obvious whether the second criterion depends on the first design variable. 
The third criterion weakly depends on the first design variable.

between criteria and localization of the feasible solution and Pareto optimal 
sets in the criteria space. This information helps to improve the statement and 
solution of optimization problem and finally to estimate a correctness of the 
mathematical model and its shortcomings.

 The 
sensitivity of criteria to parameters for the Pareto optimal solution 288 (which 
is one of the four solutions that were found previously) is illustrated in Figures 
3.32 through 3.34. In Figures 3.32 and 3.33 we investigated the influence of 
the third design variable on the first and sixth criteria. All the other design 
variables of the Pareto optimal solution 288, except the third design variable, 
were unchanged. One can see that the first and sixth criteria are antagonistic 
with respect to the third design variable and strongly depend on this parameter. 
Complex dependences between the fifth criterion and fourth design variable are 
shown in the Figure 3.34. In this case all design variables were fixed, except for 
the fourth design variable. In Figures 3.32, 3.33, and 3.34, the Pareto optimal 
solution 288 plays the role of the prototype; the prototype is denoted as a red 
circle with a yellow filling.

3.4 Weakening Functional Constraints
In Section 2.2 we considered an approach for determining “soft” functional 
constraints. In order to do this, we presented functional dependences as pseu-
do-criteria. In this section, we will discuss another approach used to revise func-
tional constraints. This approach is based on tables of functional failures [1]. 
It allows us to assess how reasonable the constraints are and how they actually 
work. This problem is especially important if the feasible solution set is very 
poor or empty. In our case an expert can weaken functional constraints based 
on the analysis of functional failures tables. 
3.4.1 
Tables of Functional Failures
Recall that only those solutions that satisfy all functional constraints enter the 
test table. Solutions that fail to satisfy these constraints enter the table of func-
tional failures [1]. This table contains information about all the design variable 
vectors that do not satisfy the functional constraints; information includes the 
total number of tests conducted, the total number of functional failures, and 
the number of functional failures for each functional constraint cj.
Earlier we solved our problem with three rigid functional constraints (2.6) 
and obtained only eight feasible solutions after 1,024 tests (see Section 3.2.2 
and Figure 3.7). Next we show how to correct these constraints using tables of 
Figure 3.34 Fifth criterion versus fourth design variable, N = 32, NF = 13, NP = 4. The area of 
feasible solutions (blue and green points) including Pareto optimal solutions (green points) is 
circled.

            Using the PSI Method and MOVI for Multicriteria Analysis and Visualization            47
functional failures. Consider the table of functional failures for the first func-
tional constraint (see Figure 3.35). 
We see that after 1,024 tests, 235 solutions did not satisfy all functional 
constraints:
• Fifty-two solutions did not satisfy the ﬁ rst functional constraint.
• Seven solutions did not satisfy the second functional constraint. 
• One hundred seventy-six solutions did not satisfy the last functional 
constraint. This constraint rejected the largest number of solutions. 
The upper and lower parts of the table of functional failures for the first 
functional constraint are shown in Figure 3.35. These are 52 unfeasible vec-
tors 162, 976, 53, …, 157, 860, and 479 that did not satisfy the first criterion 
Figure 3.35 Table of functional failures for the ﬁ rst functional constraint (fragment).

The Parameter Space Investigation Method Toolkit 
constraint, f1 ≤ 1,100. All vectors are arranged in decreasing order of the value 
f1. So the “worst” vector is 162 (f1 equal to 1,117.89) and the “best” vector is 
479 (f1 equal to 1,100.35). 
The obtained information allows an expert to estimate the values assumed 
by the design variable vectors that do not satisfy the jth functional constraint 
and to find out whether it is advisable to change this constraint so that as many 
solutions as possible will satisfy it. 
To do this, an expert selects the functional dependency fj. Then, using the 
table, an expert determines the values assumed by the function fj and estimates 
to what extent one can change the corresponding value cj so that a number of 
solutions will meet this constraint. Next, one introduces a new (relaxed) value 
cj. The solutions that satisfy this new constraint will then be tested to find out 
if they satisfy all subsequent constraints, if the latest exist. The solutions that 
satisfy all functional constraints enter the test table. Taking into account a pos-
sible shortage of computer time for calculating the functional dependences, it 
is advisable to relax the functional constraints, beginning with the last one, cp. 
Then, if necessary and possible, the constraint cp1 can be relaxed, and so on. 
When relaxing functional constraints, an expert can also proceed as follows. 
First, one identifies all functional dependences on which the constraints can be 
relaxed and then, using the table of functional failures, defines a new (relaxed) 
value of the functional constraint and enters this change in the tables of func-
tional failures.
Using the tables of functional failures, an expert obtains all the informa-
tion required to correct the functional constraints. The analysis of the tables of 
functional failures generally does not cause any difficulties. 
One hundred seventy-six vectors do not satisfy the third functional con-
straint, 27.0 ≤ f3(α) (see Figure 3.36). It is evident from Figure 3.36 that the 
“best” vector is 278 (f3 equal to 26.98). If we relax this constraint a little, for 
example, from 27 to 26.835, 12 vectors (278, 551, 833, 907, 545, 452, 81, 
948, 649, 507, 973, and 112) will not only satisfy the new constraint but also 
enter the test table. This is because this constraint is the last one. These vectors 
are circled in the figure.
Seven vectors do not satisfy the second functional constraint, 33.0 ≤ f2(α) 
(see Figure 3.37). One can see from Figure 3.37 that the “best” vector is 384 
(f2 equal to 32.99), and the “worst” vector is 640 (f2 equal to 32.46). If we relax 
this constraint a little, for example, from 33 to 32.85, three vectors (384, 80, 
and 192) will satisfy the new constraint. These vectors are circled in the figure. 
Furthermore, solutions 384 and 80 will enter the test table, because 27.0 ≤ 
f3(384) = 32.99 and 27.0 ≤ f3(80) = 30.625.
If we relax the first functional constraint a little (e.g., from 1,100 to 
1,102.6), 14 vectors (479, 860, 157, 705, 971, 183, 899, 741, 501, 134, 32, 
185, 292, and 4) will satisfy the new constraint (see Figure 3.35). These vectors

are circled in the figure. Furthermore, nine solutions (157, 705, 971, 183, 899, 
741, 134, 185, and 292) will enter the test table, because these vectors satisfy 
constraints 33.0 ≤ f2(α) and 27.0 ≤ f3(α).
Unjustifiably rigid functional constraints can lead to a loss of interesting 
solutions and sometimes to an empty feasible solution set. We have shown how 
one can correct functional constraints using the tables of functional failures.

Improving Optimal Solutions
In Chapters 2 and 3 we defined criteria constraints and functional constraints 
and constructed the feasible solution and Pareto optimal solution sets [1, 2]. In 
this chapter, we will consider a question how optimization results can be im-
proved owing to the correction of the design variable constraints [2–7].
4.1 Solving a New Optimization Problem
4.1.1 
New Design Variable Constraints
From the tables of feasible solutions (Figure 3.11) and histograms of the first 
(Figure 3.12), third (Figure 3.14), and fourth (Figure 3.15) design variables, it 
follows that we can formulate new boundaries for these design variables (see 
Table 4.1). The ranges of change for the second and fifth design variables are 
kept unchanged (4.0 ⋅ 104  α2  5.0 ⋅ 104; 80  α5   120). The former rigid 
functional constraints and criteria constraints are preserved as well. As a result 
of the correction of design variable constraints, 194 feasible solutions and 25 
Pareto optimal solutions were obtained.
Previously in the problem Oscillator, we obtained eight feasible solutions 
and four Pareto optimal solutions (see Figure 3.7). At the expense of the cor-
rection of the specified design variable constraints in problem Oscillator 1, the 
number of feasible solutions and Pareto optimal solutions has increased to 194 
and 25, respectively. Some results of solving this problem are shown in Figures 
4.1 through 4.18.
Chapter 3 and this chapter include tables, histograms, and graphs. In 
Chapter 3, material is presented considering the initial constraints on design

The Parameter Space Investigation Method Toolkit 
variables (problem Oscillator), and in this chapter, material is presented after 
correcting these constraints (problem Oscillator 1). In both cases the function-
al constraints and criteria constraints are identical. The reader can compare 
the respective tables, histograms, and graphs in Chapter 3 and this chapter 
and see how the correction of the initial constraints improved the results of 
optimization. 
4.1.2 
Tables of Feasible and Pareto Optimal Solutions 
Tables of feasible solutions as well as histograms are important in the following 
correction of all constraints, particularly design variable constraints. Next we 
demonstrate tables of criteria and design variables (Figures 4.1 through 4.4).
4.1.3 
Histograms of the Distribution of the Feasible Solutions
In comparison with histograms of the initial problem (Figures 3.12 through 
3.16), histograms of the corrected problem (Figures 4.5 through 4.9) show uni-
form distribution of the feasible solutions.

In comparison with the initial graphs (Figures 3.23 through 3.31), only feasible 
solutions, including the Pareto optimal solutions, are displayed in the graphs

Criterion (see Section 4.1.5). One hundred ninety-four feasible solutions and 
25 Pareto optimal solutions are shown in these graphs.

4.2 Construction of the Combined Pareto Optimal Set
4.2.1 
Basic Principles 
Quite often the analysis of test tables points to advisability of correcting the 
boundaries of the initial parallelepiped (i.e., redefining the constraints on the 
design variables) and constructing a new parallelepiped. Suppose that appropri-
ate investigations have been performed in the new parallelepiped, and that the 
corresponding feasible set has been constructed. Now it is necessary to combine 
the feasible sets constructed in both these parallelepipeds and define the Pareto 
optimal solutions in the combined feasible set. The procedure of the repeated 
correction of parallelepipeds and construction of the combined feasible and Pa-
reto optimal sets is essential for real-life problems. Constructing the combined 
Pareto optimal set allows us to estimate the contribution of each problem to this 
set and the expediency of correcting the initial problem.
Assume that the Pareto optimal set P corresponds to the initial statement 
of the problem (parallelepiped Π) (see Figure 4.19). After correcting the initial 
statement of problem, we have constructed the new parallelepiped Π1 and have 
Figure 4.14 First criterion versus sixth criterion. Green and blue points are feasible solutions; 
green points are Pareto optimal solutions.

obtained a Pareto optimal set P1. After analyzing results, we have constructed 
another new parallelepiped Π2 and have obtained a Pareto optimal set P2. Then 
we have constructed the combined Pareto optimal set presented by two curves 
AB and BC. One can see that the initial Pareto optimal set P was improved.
There is another situation where construction of the combined feasible 
and Pareto sets is needed. These are the problems where calculation of the crite-
ria vector for one test requires a significant amount of computer time. Similarly, 
these are problems that require us to perform a very large number of tests. In 
these cases, for the construction of the combined Pareto optimal set, we use 
several computers. For more details, see Chapters 5 and 7.
4.2.2  Tables of Combined Pareto Optimal Solutions
In our cases we have obtained the Pareto optimal solutions in the problem oscil-
lator and problem oscillator 1. The results of constructing the combined Pareto 
optimal set are shown in Figures 4.20 through 4.22.
4.2.3 
Analysis of the Combined Pareto Optimal Set
Generally, to improve the statement and solution of an optimization problem, 
we use test tables and other tools for multicriteria analysis such as tables of cri-
teria and design variables, tables of functional failures, the histograms, and the 
graphs of Criterion versus Design Variable II, Criterion versus Criterion, and 
Criterion versus Design Variable I. 
We have obtained the combined Pareto optimal set (Figures 4.20 through 
4.22). This set contains 25 Pareto solutions. Then we should perform analysis 
of the criteria table (see Figure 4.21) and define the best solution. The best solu-
tions by each criterion are marked in Figure 4.21.
In our case the combined Pareto optimal set contains 25 solutions belong-
ing only to the new problem. Thus, all Pareto optimal solutions belonging to 
Figure 4.19 Improving the Pareto optimal solutions after correcting the parallelepipeds.

62 
The Parameter Space Investigation Method Toolkit 
the initial problem were improved. As can be seen from Table 4.2, the values 
of criteria are essentially improved in result of correcting the initial problem. 
Recall that we seek to minimize all criteria Φ3, Φ4, Φ5, Φ6. Since Φ1, Φ2 are 
pseudo-criteria, they are not presented in Table 4.2. We have improved former 
the Pareto optimal solutions on the basis of the correction of the design variable 
constraints.
4.2.4 
Conclusions for Chapters 2 Through 4
Part I gave an overview of the PSI method and MOVI software system. We 
have also analyzed typical difficulties accompanying the statement of real-life 
optimization problems. To briefly summarize:
1. We have shown how to correctly state and solve real-life optimization 
problems. We have considered the determination of criteria constraints 
and constraints on design variables and functional dependences.
Figure 4.20 The combined Pareto optimal set contains 25 vectors: 117(0), 126(0), 1,130(0), 
…, 986(0) belonging to the new problem Oscillator 1. Designations Task #0 and Task #1 cor-
respond to the new problem Oscillator 1 and the initial problem Oscillator, respectively.

 
Improving Optimal Solutions 
       63                 
2. We have demonstrated that the formulation and solution of the real-
life problem constitute a single process; this process should be interac-
tive. 
3. Multicriteria analysis tools such as test tables, tables of feasible and 
Pareto optimal solutions, design variable histograms and criteria his-
tograms, graphs Criterion versus Design Variable, graphs Criterion 
versus Criterion, and tables of functional failures for correcting func-
tional constraints have been described. 
4. For a deﬁ nition of the “soft” constraints on functional dependences, 
these dependences have been presented in the form of pseudo-criteria. 
5. We have shown that the analysis of test tables and tables of functional 
failures allows one to understand how the functional constraints work 
and, if necessary, to correct them.

tions via an analysis of the feasible solution set and following the cor-
rection of the design variable constraints.

8. Examples have demonstrated the sensitivity of the feasible solution 
and Pareto optimal sets to the change of constraints. 
9. Finally, we have discussed that after the construction of feasible so-
lution set, an expert can consider employing single-criterion optimi-
zation methods for the further improvement of the obtained results 
(e.g., the value of any criterion [6]).
In Part II, we focus on the formulation and solution of real-life problems 
such as multicriteria design, multicriteria identification, mutlicriteria design of 
controlled engineering systems, the search for the compromise solution when 
the desired solution is unattainable, the multicriteria analysis from observa-
tional data, the multicriteria optimization of large-scale systems, adopting PSI 
methods for a database search, and the multicriteria analysis of an adaptive 
control system. For each of these problems, we describe the value proposition of 
using multicriteria analysis with the PSI method and provide empirical results.

Part II
Applications to Real-Life Problems
In this part we will show the statement and solution of the main engineering 
optimization problems such as design, identification, operational development, 
and multicriteria analysis from observational data. 
A crucial question in engineering optimization is the adequacy of the 
mathematical model to the actual object. Without estimating the model’s ad-
equacy, the search for optimal design variables has no applied sense, but what is 
the measure of adequacy? To what extent can we trust one model or another? In 
this connection we will discuss identification problems.
One of the basic engineering optimization problems is the improvement 
of the prototype. This problem is often encountered by industrial and academic 
organizations that produce and design various objects (e.g., motor vehicles, ma-
chine tools, ships, bridges, and aircraft).
For many applied optimization problems, it is necessary to carry out a 
large-scale numerical experiment in order to construct the feasible set. For this 
reason, a search for optimal solutions is often not carried out at all. We will 
mention the main types of computationally expensive problems and show how 
to solve them.

Multicriteria Design
Applying the PSI method in multicriteria design has been described in numer-
ous publications [1–22]. In this chapter we demonstrate examples of multi-
criteria design: improving the ship prototype, truck frame prototype, rear axle 
housing, and orthotropic bridge.
5.1 Multicriteria Analysis of the Ship Design Prototype 
5.1.1 
Improvement Problem 
The mathematical model described next is based on the references [2, 14–16, 
19–21]. The problem has eight criteria that are defined implicitly. Two of the 
eight are performance criteria: resistance performance defined using Fung’s re-
sistance prediction algorithm (bare hull residuary resistance coefficient) [20] 
and the seakeeping performance defined by Bales formula (Bales seakeeping 
rank) [19]. The other six criteria are pseudo-criteria. 
5.1.1.1 Initial (or the First) Statement of the Optimization Problem: Parallelepiped 
Π1
The model is based on 14 design variables:
• α1: Length of the design water line (assumed to be equal to the length 
between perpendiculars), m;
• α2: Beam of the design water line (assumed to be equal to the beam 
amid ships), m;
• α3: Draft (assumed to be equal to the draft amid ships), m;

70 
The Parameter Space Investigation Method Toolkit 
• α4: Distance from station 0 (FP) to the cut-up point, m;
• α5: Water plane area forward of amid ships, m2;
• α6: Water plane area aft of amid ships, m2;
• α7: Displaced volume forward of amid ships, m3;
• α8: Displaced volume aft of amid ships, m3;
• α9: Prismatic coefficient;
• α10: Projected transom area, m2; 
• α11: Projected transom width, m;
• α12: Projected transom depth, m;
• α13: Half entrance angle, degrees;
•  α14: Longitudinal center of buoyancy from the fore perpendicular, m.
Thus, the design variable vector is α = (α1, …, α14). Values of the proto-
type design variables α p and initial design variable constraints (i.e., parallelepi-
ped Π 1) are provided in Table 5.1. 
We want to maximize the performance criterion Φ1 (seakeeping rank) and 
to minimize the performance criterion Φ2 (residuary resistance coefficient). The 
vector of performance criteria of prototype is Φp = (8.608; 1.968) (see Table 
5.2). 
There are 10 functional relations:
• f1: Displacement, metric ton;
• f2: Block coefficient;
• f3: Maximum section area coefficient (assumed to be equal to the mid-
ship section coefficient, cm);
• f4: Water plane area coefficient;
• f5: Water plane area coefficient forward of amidships;
• f6: Water plane area coefficient aft of amidships;
• f7: Draft-to-length ratio;
• f8: Cut-up ratio;
• f9: Vertical prismatic coefficient forward of amidships;
• f10: Vertical prismatic coefﬁ cient aft of amidships.
The following rigid constraints are imposed on the above four functional 
relations:

 
Multicriteria Design 
       71                 
• f1 ≤ 2,100;
• f2 ≤ 0.51;
• f3 ≥ 0.77;
• f4 ≤ 0.84;
• f4 ≥ 0.80. 
The other functional constraints on f5, …, f10 are “soft” (i.e., they can be 
changed in some limits); however, it is difficult to formulate these constraints a 
priori. According to the PSI method, the functional relations with “soft” con-
straints should be interpreted as the pseudo-criteria (i.e., Φ3 = f5, Φ4 = f6, Φ5 = 
f7, Φ6 = f8, Φ7 = f9, and Φ8 = f10). In this case, the constraints are defined dur-
ing solution of the problem (on the basis of the analysis of the test table). Values 
Φ3, Φ4, Φ5,Φ6 Φ7, Φ8 for the prototype are shown in Table 5.2.

The Parameter Space Investigation Method Toolkit 
Therefore, to determine the feasible solution set we solve the problem 
with criteria vector Φ = (Φ1, Φ2, Φ3, Φ4, Φ5,Φ6 Φ7, Φ8). The vector of func-
tional relations is (f1, f2, f3, f4).
The analysis process summarized in the next section is based on the ap-
plication of the PSI method with LPτ sequences. 
We should construct the Pareto set taking into account only the perfor-
mance criteria Φ1 and Φ2 because Φ3, Φ4, Φ5, Φ6, Φ7, Φ8 are pseudo-criteria. 
Since we are solving the problem of improving the prototype, the criteria 
constraints equal to the values of the prototype criteria (

In summary, we want to investigate the problem with a 14-dimensional 
design variable space and an eight-dimensional criteria space, keeping in mind 
complex constraints, which we need to correct in order to construct feasible 
solution set.

Next we will show how to solve this problem.
5.1.1.2 Solution of the Initial Statement of the Optimization Problem
We performed N = 131,072 tests in parallelepiped Π1 and only N1 = 1,487 vec-
tors entered the test table. The 129,585 solutions did not satisfy the functional 
constraints. Since we are solving the problem of improving the prototype, the 
performance criteria constraints equal to the values of the prototype (
**

Φ = Φ  
= 8.608 and 
**

Φ = Φ  = 1.968) were accepted. Based on the analysis of the 
test tables, an expert weakened the constraints on the pseudo-criteria Φ4, Φ6, 
and Φ8 in comparison with the prototype. As a result, NF = 240 vectors (includ-
ing the prototype) entered the feasible set, and NP = 3 vectors are the Pareto 
optimal solution set (the remaining 1,247 vectors did not satisfy the criteria 
constraints). The coefficient of the efficiency of searching the feasible solution 
set is γF = 240/131,072 = 0.0018 (for the Pareto optimal set it is γp = 0.00002). 
Very low values of the coefficient γF point out the difficulties in searching the 
feasible solutions. 
These vectors in the criteria space and design variable space are denoted as 
Φ26087, Φ81087, Φ75527 and α26087, α81087, α75527, respectively. To simplify the nota-
tion, we will denote the vectors of criteria corresponding to the ith test (i.e., Φi) 
simply as #i. Therefore, Φ26087, Φ81087, Φ75527 are written as #26087, #81087, 
and #75527 (see Table 5.2). The values of the design variables and the criteria 
of Pareto optimal solutions are given in Tables 5.1 and 5.2. 
Next we briefly show some multicriteria tools that led to an improvement 
of the present results.
Graphs: Criterion Versus Criterion
Figure 5.11 shows dependency between the first criterion (seakeeping rank) and 
the second criterion (residuary resistance coefficient)2.
Examples of the dependences between criterion Φ1 versus pseudo-crite-
rion Φ3 and criterion Φ1 versus pseudo-criterion Φ4 are shown in Figures 5.2 
and 5.3. 
Graphs: Criterion Versus Design Variable
Figures 5.4 and 5.5 show the dependency of the criterion Φ1 versus the design 
variable α5 and Φ2 versus the design variable α10. Here we see a linear depen-
dency between the criterion Φ1 and the design variable α5 and a more complex 
relationship between the criterion Φ2 and the design variable α10.

2. On the graphs criterion versus criterion and criterion versus design variable, the feasible solu-
tions (blue and green points), the Pareto optimal solutions (green points), the prototype (red  
or yellow triangle), and the unfeasible solutions (magenta) are shown (see Figures 5.1 through

Histograms of Feasible Solutions
The distributions of feasible solutions for the range of the second and tenth 
design variables in the initial parallelepiped Π1 are shown in Figure 5.6(a). We 
can see that there are large “gaps” that do not contain any feasible solutions. 
Similar distributions with “gaps” are observed for the fifth, sixth, and ninth 
design variables.
5.1.1.3 Second Statement and Solution of the Optimization Problem: 
Parallelepiped Π2
The analysis of the feasible solutions has pointed ways for the correction of the 
initial problem statement. The reasoning for construction of the parallelepiped 
Π2 is given next:
• From the histogram of the second design variable [Figure 5.6(a)], it fol-
lows that the value of the upper boundary can be decreased to 
**
2
α  = 
13.5 (recall that in the initial parallelepiped Π1 we had 
**
2
α  = 14.67).
• From the graph criterion versus design variable (Figure 5.5) and the 
histogram of the tenth design variable [Figure 5.6(a)], it follows that the 
value of the upper boundary can be decreased to 
**
10
α  = 13.0 (recall that 
in the initial parallelepiped Π1 we had 
**
10
α  = 13.74).

• The other boundaries of the parallelepiped Π2 were determined simi-
larly. In the process of the deﬁ nition of boundaries of parallelepiped Π2, 
the values of the prototype design variables and Pareto optimal solutions 
#26087, #75527, and #81087 were also considered. 
Again, N = 131,072 tests were conducted. N1 = 18,270 vectors entered 
the test table. The pseudo-criteria constraints were defined based on the analy-
sis of the test tables, while constraints on performance criteria were kept un-
changed. This time NF = 17,302 vectors (including the prototype) entered 
the feasible solution set, and NP = 14 Pareto optimal solutions were identified 
(#87511, #21855, #63919, #49109, #106467, #90819, #78907, #116871, 
#31819, #64407, #74223, #80159, #105823, and #22671). It follows that the 
coefficient of the efficiency of searching the feasible solutions (γF) was increased 
more than 70 times. Furthermore, the histograms in Π2 have much better distri-
butions of the feasible solutions than in Π1 [see Figure 5.6(b)]. Table 5.2 shows 
3 out of 14 Pareto optimal solutions.
Figure 5.7 shows the dependency between the criterion Φ1 and the cri-
terion Φ2 and the new feasible and Pareto optimal solutions. Recall that in the 
initial statement there were only NF = 240 and NP = 3 feasible and Pareto op-
timal solutions, respectively. A reader may compare Figure 5.7 with Figure 5.1 
for the initial statement of the problem.

Multicriteria Design 
       79                 
After combining the feasible sets in both problem statements, we have 
constructed a combined Pareto set. No solution belonging to the initial state-
ment has entered into the combined Pareto set. In other words, all the results 
of optimization in the initial statement have been improved. The preference of 
the expert was given to the vector #74223. This vector surpassed all solutions 
in the initial statement by two performance criteria simultaneously (see Table 
5.2 and Figure 5.7).
5.1.1.4 Final (Third) Statement and Solution of the Optimization Problem: 
Parallelepiped Π3
By analyzing the feasible solutions from Π 2, a new parallelepiped Π3 was con-
structed. After N = 131,072 tests, N1 = 34,986 vectors entered the test table. 
Compared to the initial and second statements of the problem, all criteria con-
straints now were determined on the basis of analysis of the test tables. In par-
ticular, more rigid criteria constraints (
**
1
Φ = 14.342 and 
**
2
Φ = 1.711) were 
formulated. The pseudo-criteria constraints were also revised. As a results, we 
obtained NF = 847 feasible solutions and NP = 7 Pareto optimal solutions. 
The smaller number of the feasible solutions compared to the previous 
problem statement can be explained by much stronger performance criteria 
constraints. The Pareto optimal solutions (#113487, #4145, #68410, #39801, 
#53988, #72461, #75110) are shown in Figure 5.8. The values of criteria of 
these solutions are given in Table 5.2. 
The analysis of Pareto optimal solutions revealed that solution #75110 
surpassed seven solutions from the second statement (#80159, #87511, 
#78907, #31819, #64407, #63919, #74223) by two criteria simultaneously. 
Solution #113487 surpasses five solutions from the second statement (#22671, 
#90819, #105823, #116871, #21855) by two criteria simultaneously. The ex-
pert’s preference was given to solution #113487.
Using the feasible solutions from the second and final statement, the 
combined Pareto set was constructed. The combined Pareto set includes all 
seven Pareto optimal solutions from the final statement and only two solutions 
#106467, #49109 belonging to the second statement (see Figure 5.9). Further 
attempts to improve the obtained solutions have not yielded any new interest-
ing results. 
The stability of the most interesting Pareto optimal solutions was investi-
gated with respect to small variations of the parameters in the vicinity of these 
solutions. To this end, we constructed parallelepipeds centered in the Pareto 
optimal solutions and performed 1,024 tests in each parallelepiped. The corre-
sponding variations in the criteria were small and insignificant, which indicated 
the stability of the solutions. 
The overall dynamics of improving a prototype on the basis of two correc-
tions of the problem statement is shown in Figure 5.9.

In summary, the problem of improving a preliminary ship design proto-
type has been solved. To achieve the goal, we corrected the problem statement 
twice. Each time, analyzing the results allowed us to formulate the improved 
statement. This process included changing the range of variation of design vari-
ables and revising all criteria constraints. As a result of multicriteria analysis, 
the parallelepiped Π2 was constructed. The volume of parallelepiped Π2 was 
considerably decreased in comparison with the volume of parallelepiped Π1. 
Similarly, the parallelepiped Π3 was constructed with a smaller volume than of 
parallelepiped Π2. This allowed a more careful and efficient investigation of the 
design variable and criteria spaces. 
5.2 Problem with the High Dimensionality of the Design Variable 
Vector
Multicriteria analysis of a ship design model using the PSI method was first 
performed by O. M. Berezanskii and Y. N. Semenov from the State Sea Techni-
cal University, Saint Petersburg [21]. The study was intended to improve the 
performance criteria of a prototype ship, UT-704, which was built by the UL-
STEIN Group in Norway for the oil and gas industry fleet. The performance 
criteria were tonnage, speed, capital investments, and operational costs. The 
statistical data on this type of ship was used to choose the design variable con-
straints. As a result, the prototype has been considerably improved.

Multicriteria Design 
       81                 
Consider a problem of improving the prototype with high dimensionality 
of the design variable vector that is described in detail in [2, 14, 15]. Among the 
particular features of the problem there are the high dimensionality of the de-
sign variable vector (45 design variables) and the difficulties of improving a rea-
sonably good prototype under strong constraints (7 functional constraints and 
15 performance criteria and pseudo-criteria). Six criteria were optimized: Φ1 
is the propulsion power factor (%) (min); Φ2 is the electrical power factor (%) 
(min); Φ3 is the volume factor (%) (max), Φ4 is the region factor (%) (max), Φ5 
is the weight factor (%) (max), and Φ6 is the cost (min). After solving the initial 
problem, we repeatedly corrected constraints. We refer to these investigations 
as experiments. Since the purpose of this section is to show the iterative process 
of the initial data correction, we will omit a description of the mathematical 
model and briefly illustrate some elements of multicriteria analysis.

In view of the high dimensionality of the design variable vector, 200,000 
tests were conducted in each of the first five experiments3 and 500,000 tests 
were conducted in the sixth experiment. 
Each subsequent experiment was carried out on the basis of the previous 
one (step by step). In the first two experiments (in parallelepipeds Π1 and Π2), 
no feasible solutions were found; in the third experiment (parallelepiped Π 3), 
a few feasible solutions were obtained: #17311, #108455, and #71279. These 
solutions attracted the attention of the expert. For example, design #108455 
proved to be better than the prototype in five of the six criteria. Some depen-
dencies between criteria (third experiment) are shown in Figures 5.10 through 
3. LPτ sequences were used in experiments 1–4 and 6, and a random number generator in ex-
periment 5. We will restrict ourselves to describing the experiment with the LPτ  sequences.
Figure 5.10 Criterion 1 versus criterion 6: third experiment (the scale is increased in the 
lower sub-ﬁ gure). Each point has a dimensionality equal to 6 in the criteria space and equal to 
45 in the design variable space. Three Pareto optimal solutions (#108455, #171279, and #17311) 
have been obtained after 200,000 trails. Pareto optimal solutions are green. Unfeasible solu-
tions are magenta.

of an analysis of the third experiment, the search region in the fourth experi-
ment was limited by the design variable values of the three specified designs. 
Thus, parallelepiped Π4 was constructed. In the fourth experiment, the criteria 
constraints were strengthened in comparison with the third experiment (the 
first dialogue of the expert with the computer). The number of the feasible 
and Pareto optimal solutions turned out to be rather high (2,161 and 208, 
respectively). This is due to the fact that the search region in parallelepiped 
Π4 was substantially smaller than in parallelepiped Π3 for the same number of 
tests. Many solutions of interest to the expert were found. After analyzing the 
obtained solutions, an attempt was made to improve the prototype in all criteria

simultaneously. Therefore, in the second dialogue, the criteria constraints cor-
responded to the values of the prototype criteria. As a result, 20 Pareto optimal 
solutions surpassing the prototype in all criteria were found. The improvement 
of the feasible solution set at the expense of correcting constraints is demon-
strated in Figures 5.14 through 5.17 (fourth experiment). The analysis of these 
dependencies and the location of the feasible solution set has been of significant 
interest for experts. 
In the sixth experiment (parallelepiped Π4) criteria constraints on the 
second and sixth criteria were strengthened in comparison with the first dia-
logue in the fourth experiment. A total of 500,000 trials were conducted, and 
627 feasible and 138 Pareto optimal solutions, respectively, were found. Six 
Pareto optimal solutions surpassing the prototype in all criteria were found.

A combined set of Pareto optimal solutions surpassing the prototype in all six 
criteria contains 26 solutions, five of which are given in Table 5.3.
In summary, we draw attention once again to some features and strategies 
of problem solving: 
• The dimensionality of the design variable vector was high. Therefore, it 
was necessary to carry out a large number of trials. 
• Multicriteria analysis showed the necessity of the repeated correction 
of the constraints, and, because of this, a series of experiments was per-
formed. 
• The prototype was improved by six criteria simultaneously.

5.3 Rear Axle Housing for a Truck: PSI Method with the Finite 
Element Method 
The application of the PSI method in combination with the finite element 
method (FEM) is discussed in this section through Section 5.5. The approach 
of combining the finite element method (FEM) with the PSI method consists 
of the following stages. At the first stage, the PSI method (with LPτ or another 
generator) is used to define N vectors of parameters (N projects). At this stage 
geometrical parameters and types of materials are most often varied. At the sec-
ond stage, FEM is used to select NFEM projects (NFEM  N). NFEM projects should 
satisfy the standards and other rigid requirements (rigid functional constraints). 
At the third stage, the PSI method is used to form a test stable for these NFEM 
projects. The criteria constraints are imposed in the interactive mode on the 
basis of the analysis of the test table. Then the feasible solutions and the Pareto 
optimal solutions, NP (NP ≤ NFEM), are constructed and analyzed, and next the 
most preferable solution is defined [8].
We briefly consider the rear axle housing for a truck rated at 2.5 tons. 
The objective of the investigation is to reduce the housing mass and improve its 
strength and other characteristics. 
5.3.1 
General Statement of the Problem
We consider static loading of the rear axle housing by the forces transmitted 
from the rear suspension and drive wheels. By solving the static problem, we 
determine the equivalent stresses in the structure, the housing displacements, 
and the angular deviations of the half-axles from the final drive axis [1, 17].

The finite element model of the housing is shown in Figure 5.18(a, b). It 
contains 1,456 elements and 1,238 nodes. In modeling the housing, we used 
three- and four-node shell elements. 
Consider the following problem statement. The design variables to be var-
ied are the thicknesses of different parts of the structure:
• α1 is the thickness of the housing walls;
• α2 is the thickness of the bearing housings;

In our case the functional dependences fl(α) are the equivalent stresses in 
the structure. These stresses are investigated at the 12 most dangerous places of 
the structure, and thus 
1,12
l =
. The housing material is high-strength cast iron. 
The maximum allowable value of the equivalent stress calculated according to 
the Huber-Mises theory was set at [σ]max = 15 kgf/mm2 (147 N/mm2), and thus 
the functional constraints are

The performance criteria to be optimized involve:
• The total mass of the structure Φ1 (kg);
• The maximum deflection in the structure Φ2 (mm);
• The maximum equivalent stresses in the structure Φ3 (kgf/mm2), which 
must not exceed the maximum allowable value [σ]max.
Since we are dealing with a mass production of trucks, it is desirable to 
minimize the rear axle housing mass. The reduction in the structure deflection 
increases its durability. Moreover, it is necessary to minimize the peak equiva-
lent stresses. 
Two additional performance criteria, Φ16 and Φ17 (in degrees), character-
ize the change (as a result of the housing deformation) in the angular positions 
of the half-axles with respect to the final drive axis. These two criteria should 
also be minimized. This would improve the working conditions for the differ-
ential by reducing tooth wear and increasing the contact and bending endur-
ance of the teeth. All five criteria also characterize the working conditions of 
the bearings. 

 
Multicriteria Design 
       91                 
In order to solve this problem, two approaches are possible. The first ap-
proach is to solve the problem with five performance criteria (Φ1, Φ2, Φ3, Φ16, 
and Φ17) and 12 rigid functional constraints. 
As has already been said, the more criteria are optimized, the more in-
formation the expert obtains about the work of the mathematical model. In 
connection with this, we represented all functional relations as pseudo-criteria. 
Thus, the second approach is to solve the problem with criteria and pseudo-
criteria. According to what has been said earlier, instead of the functional re-
lations fl( α), 
1,12
l =
, which describe the equivalent stresses in the 12 most 
dangerous points of the structure, we introduce pseudo-criteria Φ4, ..., Φ15. The 
value of Φ3 is determined as the maximum over the values Φ4, …, Φ15 for some 
fixed design variable vectors αi,

. Three of the 12 
points, A, B, and C, are shown in Figure 5.18(b). The pseudo-criteria Φ4(α), 
Φ7(α), and Φ13(α) determine the equivalent stress values at the points A, B, and 
C, respectively. As will be shown next, the stress is a maximum at these points. 
Thus, the vector of criteria contains Φv, 
1,17
v =
. 
We preferred the second approach for following reasons. In process of the 
analysis of test tables, the expert obtains interesting information about distri-
butions of stresses at the 12 most dangerous places, depending on the housing 
geometry (wall thickness). It allows us to define how much these points are 
dangerous in reality.

The feasible set comprised 22 designs, of which 14 were Pareto optimal 
designs: 21, 43, 62, 67, 79, 110, 113, 158, 174, 181, 229, 233, 246, and 254. 
Table 5.4 (the unordered test table) gives the values of the performance 
criteria. For designs 38, 62, 110, 129, 158, 174, 206, 233, and 242 the stress 
attains its maximum value at point A (pseudo-criterion Φ4), where the bearing 
is located [see Figure 5.18(b)]. The record 13.45 (A) in the column Φ3 of Table 
5.4 means that for design 38 the maximum stress is equal to 13.45 kgf/mm2 
(point A). 
For designs 21, 23, 43, 77, 79, 113, 121, 181, 189, 229, 246, and 254, 
the stresses attain their maximum values at point B (pseudo-criterion Φ7), at the 
bush-housing contact [see Figure 5.18(b)]. In the column Φ3 of Table 5.4, the 
record 13.11 (B) means that to design 21 there corresponds a maximum stress 
equal to 13.11 kgf/mm2 at point B. 

92 
The Parameter Space Investigation Method Toolkit 
It follows from Table 5.4 that, of all the feasible designs, only design 67 
has the maximum stress at point C (the horizontal stiffening rib, pseudo-crite-
rion Φ13) [see Figure 5.18(b)]. This stress is equal to 11.50 kgf/mm2. 
Pareto optimal designs 67 and 233, which are characterized by compara-
tively low maximum stresses, were of particular interest to the experts. Moreo-
ver, design 233 is one of the best with respect to mass and deflection. It is not 
surprising that design 233 was chosen as the most preferable solution. For this 
solution the design variable vector is α233 = (5.77; 12.19; 4.46; 7.85; 4.3; 4.27; 
6.07). 
The antagonism of criteria Φ1 and Φ2 is obvious from Figure 5.19.
In order to visualize the action of stresses (pseudo-criteria) in the most 
dangerous places of the housing, we present Figure 5.20. This figure shows

Conclusions
After analyzing the results obtained, taking into account the housing’s mass, 
maximum deflections, and maximum stresses at various places in the structure, 
and the change in the angular position of the half-axles with respect to the fi-
nal drive axis, the experts preferred design 233, as was mentioned earlier. This 
design is characterized by practically identical and comparatively low stresses at 
the most dangerous places of the structure.
Compared with the prototype, the design was improved in all criteria; 
in particular, the mass was reduced by 5 kg and the maximum deflection was 
reduced by 15%. Note that the optimal design 233 is the best for neither of the 
particular criteria. Nevertheless, the experts unanimously adopted design 233 as 
the optimal solution, and this choice caused no difficulties.
In many engineering structures, including machines, we encounter a typi-
cal situation where there are several very highly loaded places in which stresses 
are high and damage is possible. In the other places, which make up the ma-
jority, the stresses are substantially lower. The analysis of the pseudo-criterion 
values shows that the maximum stresses occur in the housing points that are 
marked by the letters A, B, and C in Figure 5.18(b). For the feasible designs 23, 
113, 129, 189, 242, and 246, the maximum stresses at points A and B approach 
the maximum allowable value of 15 kgf/mm2.
5.4 Improving the Truck Frame Prototype 
As the major structure of a truck, the frame is subjected to the influences of 
both the roughness of the road and the units mounted on the truck itself. In 
turn, the properties of the frame strongly affect many significant characteristics 
of a truck, such as its controllability, smoothness of motion, vibration loads, 
stability, and so forth. Furthermore, the mass of the frame makes up a consider-
able portion of the overall mass of a truck.
A frame is designed subject to conflicting requirements. One has to de-
crease its mass and at the same time enhance its strength and ensure the speci-
fied level of a number of operational characteristics.

 
Multicriteria Design 
       95                 
Here we consider the problem of designing an optimal truck frame, for-
mulated as follows: It is necessary to design a frame whose mass is smaller than 
that of the prototype and whose strength properties are improved compared 
with the latter. In addition, the stiffness characteristics of the optimal frame 
must be close to those of a prototype whose dynamic properties are sufficiently 
high. 
5.4.1 
History of This Project
During World War II the United States granted the Soviet Union invaluable 
help that included various advanced technical equipment and food (by Lend-
Lease). Studebaker trucks were specifically involved and appreciated by many. 
In Russia in the 1990s the most popular trucks were ZIL. One of the best ZIL 
modifications used the Studebaker frame. Since the Russian truck was created 
to carry less cargo, compared with the U.S. truck, it was necessary to reduce the 
weight of the frame. The PSI method was used in conjunction with the finite 
element method (FEM). The latter was presented as the TPS–10 software. 
5.4.2 
Finite Element Model of a Truck Frame
Figure 5.21 shows a model composed of platelike elements possessing both 
membrane and flexural stiffness. By using these elements, one can take into ac-
count the effects of stiffened torsion in the joints of the frame and in the zones

where the cross beams (cross pieces) are fastened to the longitudinal beam (side 
rail) in the most natural way and analyze the stressed state of the structure under 
study in sufficient detail [1, 8]. 
Numerous bench and road tests confirmed the adequacy of the model. 
The calculated and experimental results were compared for the major loading 
modes resulting in torsion and bending in the vertical and horizontal planes. 
The loading modes were chosen taking into account the statistics of truck frame 
failures. The model allows estimation of a stress strain state taking into account 
the specific features of interaction of the frame’s elements. It proved to be highly 
efficient in determining the dynamic characteristics of a truck. 
5.4.3 
Criteria and Pseudo-Criteria
As previously mentioned, we chose as a prototype the frame that showed good 
performance in a number of criteria under the long-term operation of the 
truck. Therefore, the experts wanted to preserve in the new structure the twist-
ing angle of the frame, as well as the bending stiffness in the vertical and hori-
zontal planes, if possible. In other words, we faced the problem of functional 
relations subjected to “soft” constraints. The experts were ready to revise these 
constraints, depending on the results achieved. That is precisely why these func-
tional constraints are represented in the form of three pseudo-criteria.
The first pseudo-criterion, Φ1(α ), is the relative difference between the 
twisting angles of the frame being designed and those of the prototype.
Let ϕi be the twisting angle of the frame being designed in the ith trial  
(
1,
)
i
N
=
and ϕp be the twisting angle of the prototype frame. Then Φ1(α) = 
(ϕi − ϕp)/ϕp. Usually, Φ1(α) is expressed in percent; in this case, Φ1(α) = [(ϕi 
− ϕp)/ϕp] ⋅ 100% The other pseudo-criteria, Φ2(α) and Φ3(α), which take into 
account the difference between the maximum deflections in the horizontal and 
vertical planes in the frame being designed and in the prototype, are defined in 
a similar way.
The following four performance criteria were minimized:
• Φ4(α) is the longitudinal beam mass (in kilograms).
• Φ5(α) is the thickness of the rolled metal sheet from which the longitu-
dinal beam is manufactured (in millimeters). This criterion is simultane-
ously a design variable.
• Φ6(α) and Φ7(α) are the maximum stresses under torsion and horizontal 
bending (in kgf/cm2).
All criteria are to be minimized. Three hundred trials were carried out.

       97                 
5.4.4 
Design Variables
Twenty-one design variables describing the longitudinal beam geometry and 
stiffness properties of the cross beam were varied. One of the most important 
variables is the thickness of the rolled metal sheet from which the longitudinal 
beam is manufactured. This design variable to a large extent determines the 
mass of the longitudinal beam, as well as the stiffness characteristics and stresses 
in the structure.
Earlier, in the example with an oscillator (Chapters 2 through 4), we de-
scribed in detail the construction and analysis of the histograms, the correction 
of the initial parallelepiped, and the construction of a new one. In the example 
of the rear axle housing, we sketched the analysis of the feasible set. We do 
not consider it worthwhile to describe similar investigations for the example in 
question, and we confine ourselves to the final results presented in Table 5.5.
In this table, Φ1−Φ3 are the pseudo-criteria, where the + and − signs 
stand, respectively, for increasing and decreasing deviations (in percent) from 
the corresponding values for the prototype; Φ4−Φ7 are the performance criteria; 
Φ5 is the calculated thickness of the rolled metal sheet; and D is the correspond-
ing standard thickness. For D = 5.5 mm, the best designs are 244, 168, 176, 
20, and 36; for D = 5.6 mm, the best designs are 74, 2, 252, and 266; and so 
on. The last row in Table 5.5 presents the performance criteria values for the 
prototype; the thickness of the sheet is Φ5 = 6.35 mm.
In conclusion, we note the convenience and simplicity of analyzing the re-
sults of solving the problem using the table of feasible solutions. An analysis of 
this table showed that there are a number of designs that exceed the prototype 
in all performance criteria. 
In the optimal design 168, the mass is reduced by 28 kg compared with 
that of the prototype (the mass of each longitudinal beam is reduced by 14 kg) 
and the stress level in the most dangerous places is also decreased. The thickness 
of the rolled metal sheet is reduced from 6.35 to 5.5 mm, while the width of the 
longitudinal beam flange is increased within some allowable limits. 
5.5 Multicriteria Optimization of Orthotropic Bridges
5.5.1 
Introduction and Purposes
Issues such as construction of modern cable stayed and suspension bridges with 
large spans would be unachievable without using orthotropic deck systems. 
Moreover, the recent standards recommend using lightweight orthotropic deck 
in such structures. In construction of these bridges, not only are the simply 
open orthotropic plates used, but also the complex orthotropic closed form. 
Due to the heavy weight of complex orthotropic closed form comparable to the 
open one, the optimization of the closed form becomes essential to reduce its

self-weight. This section4 is concerned with the application of the multicriteria 
optimization technique for the closed orthotropic deck of Suez Canal Bridge 
in Egypt.

Multicriteria Design 
       99                 
The orthotropic closed form was used in the construction of the Suez Ca-
nal Bridge in Egypt (Figure 5.22), built in 2001, 45 km south of Port Said; this 
bridge connects the Sinai Peninsula with Egypt. It was planned that this design 
would make a significant contribution to the development of the Sinai Penin-
sula. The bridge belongs to a steel cable-stayed girder bridge with a box section, 
with a main span length of 404m and a total length of 730m. The navigation 
clearance under the bridge is 70m. 
Due to an increase in the cost of energy all over the world, the steel price 
goes up from time to time, which significantly raises the construction costs of 
these bridges. The multicriteria approach [22] considered in this section for the 
optimization of a complex orthotropic deck of the Suez Canal Bridge takes into 
account contradictory criteria: the mass and the deflection. The formulation 
and solution of the multicriteria problem in this study are based on the PSI 
method. 
5.5.2 
Mathematical Model and Parameters
The mathematical model and description of the software proposed for optimal 
structural solutions based on the PSI method were presented in [1, 23]. The 
program is presented as a book of Microsoft Excel using the Visual Basic for Ap-
plication (VBA) Language. The Microsoft Excel book consists of large numbers 
of sheets. Each sheet contains the necessary input information required for the 
preparation and formation of the model of the closed orthotropic deck analyzed 
by the software Femap-Nastran. In this study, the application of the developed 
multicriteria approach is considered for the structural optimization of three-pay 
deck of the Suez Canal Bridge (Figure 5.23).
Figure 5.22 Suez Canal Bridge in Egypt.

The Parameter Space Investigation Method Toolkit 
As shown in Figure 5.23, the physical model consists of a group of vertical 
and horizontal plates connected to each other and stiffened with longitudinal 
ribs and transverse beams. The cables are connected to the deck of the bridge 
at transverse beams. The distance between the anchors of cables in the longi-
tudinal direction of the bridge is 12m, and the distance between the transverse 
beams is 6m. Two diaphragms are located between the transverse beams and are 
each 2m.
The model is based on 12 design variables:
• α1: Thickness of longitudinal ribs, m;
• α2: Thickness of the transverse beams, m;
• α3: Thickness of the upper plate, m;
• α4: Thickness of the lower plate, m;
• α5: Thickness of the outer vertical plates, m;
• α6: Thickness of the inner vertical plates, m;
• α7–α12: The number of longitudinal ribs, which varies in different parts 
of the structure (1 & 3), (2), (4 & 8), (5 & 7), (6), (9 & 10), as shown 
in Figure 5.24. 
Values of the discrete design variables are shown in Table 5.6.
The previous design variables were used as input parameters for the LP τ 
generator that produced 500 possible combinations of these parameters. Some 
of these obtained combinations are presented in Table 5.7. This process is indi-
cated as stage I-input data as shown in the flowchart in Figure 5.25.

The previous generated combinations were stored in the Microsoft Excel 
sheet and were sent to the finite element program (FEP) Femap-Nastran us-
ing the Visual Basic for Application (VBA) language. The loads considered in 
the study were dead and live loads. The dead load represents the self-weight of 
plates, longitudinal ribs, and transverse beams. The vehicles A14 and NK80 
were considered according to SNiP 2.05.03-84* [24] as moving live loads.
Through VBA, the main sheet of Microsoft Excel automatically controls 
the input and output to and from the FEP Femap-Nastran. The obtained re-
sults display the values of internal forces and stresses for the longitudinal ribs, 
the transverse beams, and the plates. The most important output criteria in our 
case study are:
• Φ1: The deck self weight of the bridge, kg/m2;
• Φ2: The deck deﬂ ection, m.
The optimization process aims to minimize both of the deck self-weight 
(Φ1) and the deck deflection (Φ2). Table 5.8 shows all combination parameters 
and their corresponding output criteria. This stage of solution is indicated as 
stage II–FE analysis as shown in Figure 5.25.
5.5.3 
Results of Optimization
The last stage of the flowchart in Figure 5.25 shows the optimization stage for 
the results, in which the results are filtered in a separate Microsoft Excel sheet 
and as a last step in this stage the results will be optimized to get the optimal 
desirable solution. 
In the filtration process, the results will be automatically tested accord-
ing to SNiP 2.05.03-84* limitations. The 500 combinations and their output 
criteria are filtered to 161 combinations that achieved the SNiP 2.05.03-84* 
demands. Some of these filtered results are shown in Table 5.9. In other words, 
161 solutions satisfied all functional constraints. One can see that solution 
#196 has the minimum of self-weight and the maximum of deflection, while 
solution #445 has the maximum of self-weight and the minimum of deflection. 
At the end of this stage, the designer should take the decision according to the 
desirable objectives and field requirements. In the interactive mode the designer 
imposed the strong criteria constraints 
**
1
Φ  = 350 kg/m2 and 
**
2
Φ  = 0.0104 m2. 
In consequence of these constraints, four Pareto optimal solutions, #196, #302, 
#352, and #448, are determined (see Table 5.10). The preference is given to the 
project #196 that has the minimum of self-weight and the acceptable value of 
deflection.

Conclusion
The previous study concludes that there is a possibility to make an efficient 
combination between the PSI method and the finite element program. The 
efficiency of the new technique is proved through its application to the ortho-
tropic closed deck of the Suez Canal Bridge in Egypt. The optimal solution 
#196 shows a reduction of 7.2% in weight in comparison with the existing 
deck, while the deflection is reduced by 1.87%.

Multicriteria Identification
One of the major aspects in engineering optimization is the adequacy of the 
mathematical model to the actual object [1–6]. Without estimating the model’s 
adequacy, the search for optimal design variables has no applied sense, but what 
is the measure of adequacy? To what extent can we trust one model or another? 
The central point is the construction of the feasible solution set in multicriteria 
identification problems. These problems are of great importance for manufac-
turing motor vehicles, machine tools, ships, aircraft, and other mass-produced 
objects. In this connection we will also consider problems of the operational 
development of prototypes. This chapter presents approaches for improving 
a prototype by the construction of the feasible and Pareto optimal sets while 
performing multicriteria analysis. Applying the PSI method in multicriteria 
identification was described in works devoted to an operation development of a 
vehicle [1], a parafoil-load delivery system [5], a controllable descending system 
[4], and so on.
6.1 Adequacy of Mathematical Models
Multicriteria identification is a new direction that is of great value in applica-
tions. Earlier we solved a number of optimization problems (see Chapter 5). To 
a considerable extent, our success in this endeavor was owed to the adequacy 
of the corresponding mathematical models. To have constructed a model of a 
complex system such that all performance criteria (there may be many dozens 
of them) are determined with acceptable accuracy is a great success. As a rule, 
some of the criteria are calculated with comparatively high accuracy, while oth-
ers are determined with considerable errors. This is the typical situation when 

112 
The Parameter Space Investigation Method Toolkit 
investigating complex mathematical models. Therefore, it is very important to 
have complete information about the mathematical model. 
In the most common usage, the term “identification” means the construc-
tion of the mathematical model of a system and determination of the param-
eters (design variables) of the model by using the information about the system 
response to known external disturbances. In a sense, identification problems are 
inverse with respect to optimization problems. 
When constructing a mathematical model, one first defines the class and 
the structure of the model operator, that is, the law according to which distur-
bances (input variables) are transformed into the system response (output pro-
cesses or the so-called adequacy criteria). This problem is called structural iden-
tification. For mechanical systems, structural identification means determining 
the type and number of equations constituting the mathematical model. Struc-
tural identification is necessary if there is no preliminary information about 
the structure of the system or this information is not sufficient for compiling 
equations. In general, the structural identification problem is very difficult to 
solve. This apparently accounts for the absence of general methods for solving 
this problem. 
Parametric identification is reduced to finding numerical values of the 
equation coefficients (parameters of a model), based on the realization of the 
input and output processes. 
The construction of a good (adequate) mathematical model of a com-
plex system is a rare and great success for a researcher. Most often one has to 
represent the examined system by a set of mathematical models. For example, 
the planar rigid body model of a truck describes the behavior of the truck at 
low frequencies fairly well, whereas at high frequencies we have to use a three-
dimensional nonlinear model.
When solving optimization problems, we have used the concept of per-
formance criteria. In identification problems we will deal with adequacy (prox-
imity) criteria. By adequacy (proximity) criteria we mean the discrepancies be-
tween the experimental and computed data, the latter being determined on the 
basis of the mathematical model. For example, when identifying the parameters 
of the dynamical model of a truck, it is necessary to take into account such im-
portant particular criteria as vibration accelerations at all characteristic points 
of the driver’s seat, driver’s cab, frame, and engine; vertical dynamical reactions 
at contact areas between the wheels and the road; relative (with respect to the 
frame) displacements of the cab, wheels, engine, and so forth. 
Figure 6.1 shows the location of the characteristic points on a truck at 
which the experimental values 
exp
v
Φ
 of the cited criteria should be measured, 
as well as the arrangement of the vibration exciters. Modern test benches allow 
real-time simulation of the motion of a truck along roads with various micro-

 
Multicriteria Identiﬁ cation 
       113                 
profiles. Points 0–5 correspond to vertical vibrations; 0’ and 4’ correspond to 
lateral vibrations; and 0” and 1” correspond to longitudinal vibrations. 
The acceleration at the ith point was recorded in the x-, y-, and z-direc-
tions. Since the truck design is symmetric, the symmetric, skew-symmetric, 
torsional, lateral, and longitudinal vibrations are analyzed independently.
In all basic units of the structure under study, we experimentally measure 
the values of the characteristic quantities of interest (e.g., displacements, veloci-
ties, accelerations). At the same time, we calculate the corresponding quantities 
by using the mathematical model. As a result, particular adequacy (proximity) 
criteria are formed as functions of the difference between the experimental and 
computed data. Thus, we arrive at a multicriteria problem. By their nature, 
identification problems are multicriteria problems. However, as a rule, these 
problems have been treated as single-criterion problems [7–11]. The multi-
criteria consideration makes it possible to extend the application area of iden-
tification theory substantially. In Section 6.3 the problem of the multicriteria 
identification of a spindle unit for metal-cutting machines will be considered. 
6.2 Multicriteria Identification and Operational Development 
Let us discuss some basic features of multicriteria (or vector) identification 
problems.

1. In the majority of conventional problems, the system is tacitly as-
sumed to be in full agreement with its mathematical model. However, 
for complex engineering systems (e.g., machines), we generally cannot 
assert a sufﬁ cient correspondence between the model and the object. 
This does not permit us to use a single criterion to evaluate the ad-
equacy, because it is not corresponding to the physical essence of the 
problem. 
2. Unlike conventional identiﬁ cation approaches, the adequacy of the 
mathematical model must be evaluated by using a number of par-
ticular proximity criteria, as was already mentioned. This multicri-
teria approach is very important for determining to what extent the 
mathematical model corresponds to the physical system. For complex 
systems the number of particular proximity criteria used to evaluate 
the adequacy of the mathematical model can reach many dozens.
3. Very often, when solving identiﬁ cation problems, the researcher has 
no information about the limits of many design variables.
4. In structural identiﬁ cation, when we are investigating different math-
ematical models of the system, the number and limits of the vari-
ables to be identiﬁ ed, as well as the number of proximity criteria, can 
change sign iﬁ cantly. Therefore, the problem arises of how to make the 
identiﬁ cation results for different structures agree.

6.2.2 
The Search for the Identified Solutions
The formulation and solution of the identification problem are based on the 
PSI method. In accordance with the algorithm of the PSI method, we specify 
the values 
**
v
Φ  and find vectors meeting conditions (1.1), (1.2), and (6.1). The 
vectors 
i
id
α  belonging to the feasible solution set Dα will be called adequate 
vectors.
The restoration of the parameters of a specific model on the basis of (1.1), 
(1.2), and (6.1) is the main purpose and essence of multicriteria parametric 
identification. In performing this procedure for all structures (mathematical 
models), we thus carry out multicriteria structural identification.
The vectors 
i
id
α  that belong to the set of adequate vectors and have been 
chosen by using a special decision-making rule will be called identified vectors.
The role of the decision-making rule is often played by informal analysis 
of the set of adequate vectors. If this analysis separates out several equally ac-
ceptable vectors 
i
id
α , the solution of the identification problem is not unique.
The identified vectors 
i
id
α  form the identification domain 
i

. 
By carrying out additional physical experiments, revising constraints 
**
v
Φ , and 
so forth, one can sometimes reduce the domain Did and even obtain a domain 
that contains only one vector. Unfortunately, this is far from usual. The nonu-
nique restoration of variables is a compensation for the discrepancy between the 
physical object and its mathematical model, incompleteness of physical experi-
ments, and so forth.
If a mathematical model is sufficiently good (i.e., it correctly describes the 
behavior of the physical system), then multicriteria parametric identification 
leads to a nonempty set Dα. The most important factors that can lead to an 

116 
The Parameter Space Investigation Method Toolkit 
empty Dα are imperfection of the mathematical model and lack of information 
about the domain in which the desired solutions should be searched for.
The search for the set Dα is very important, even in the case where the 
results are not promising. It enables the researcher to judge the mathematical 
model objectively (not only intuitively), to analyze its advantages and draw-
backs on the basis of all proximity criteria, and to correct the problem formula-
tion. Thus, multicriteria identification includes the determination and informal 
analysis of the feasible solution set Dα with regard to all basic proximity criteria, 
as well as finding identified solutions 
i
id
α  belonging to this set.
Multicriteria identification is often the only way to evaluate the quality of 
the mathematical model and hence to optimize this model.
6.2.3 
Operational Development of Prototypes
We will discuss the problems of perfecting engineering systems (machines). 
These problems are mainly related to the operational development of a proto-
type of a machine designed for mass production. First, the machine is tested. 
The structure of the test is determined by the type of machine (airplane, auto-
mobile, ship, machine tool). For example, automobiles are subjected to labora-
tory (bench) tests including strength, fatigue, and vibration investigations of 
both individual units and the automobile as a whole. Much attention is paid to 
road tests. These are carried out on proving grounds where the automobile is 
tested on properly profiled road sections in different conditions depending on 
the load carried and the speed of the automobile. Apart from this, automobiles 
are tested on ordinary roads under conditions close to operational ones. Thus, 
automobiles are subjected to bench and road tests. These tests are aimed at 
detecting imperfections with subsequent operational development of the proto-
type so as to satisfy the customer’s demands. Operational development is aimed 
at increasing durability and reliability, reducing vibrations and noise, and so 
forth.
It is very important to make the process of operational development as 
short as possible. This is the main problem faced by experts of automobiles and 
other machines. We suggest carrying out the prototype’s operational develop-
ment in two stages. In the first stage, accelerated tests (for instance, bench tests) 
are performed. These tests make it possible to identify the mathematical model 
of the object and to determine its parameters.
In the second stage, after multicriteria identification, the expert formu-
lates and solves the multicriteria optimization problem. To do this, one uses the 
mathematical model whose adequacy was established in the first stage. Based on 
the optimization results, improvements to the prototype are made, and then the 
tests are reproduced. This cycle is repeated until the expert decides to terminate 
the operational development. Thus, in the first stage, the set Dα is found as a 

 
Multicriteria Identiﬁ cation 
       117                 
result of multicriteria identification. In the second stage, the optimization prob-
lem is solved: we construct the parallelepiped Π in Dα, determine the vector of 
performance criteria, and find the feasible solution set D.
A disadvantage of traditional optimization is the significant discrepancy 
between the mathematical model and the physical system, as well as improperly 
specified constraints. Therefore, the results of traditional optimization are very 
often of no practical value. In our approach, we obtain a confirmed model and 
the set Dα resulting from multicriteria identification. This, to a sufficient ex-
tent, justifies the optimization performed at the second stage and substantiates 
the recommendations for improving the prototype of a machine. In addition, 
this approach is expected to significantly reduce the number of expensive and 
time-consuming tests during the operational development of machines. 
6.2.4 
Conclusion
The formulation and solution of the multicriteria identification problem 
combined with informal analysis of the obtained results make it possible to 
determine:
• The adequacy of the mathematical model (how much it could be trusted);
• The sets of adequate and identified solutions;
• The advantages of one or another model.
6.3 Vector Identification of a Spindle Unit for Metal-Cutting 
Machines 
6.3.1 
Introduction
The precision, reliability, and chatter stability of metal-cutting machines de-
pend strongly on the characteristics of their spindle units. This calls on con-
ducting the dynamic and thermal analyses of the spindle units in the design 
and experimental development stages, using the data obtained by testing a pro-
totype. The dynamic and thermal analyses of spindle units that are carried out 
in the design stage include the determination of the frequency characteristics 
and the thermal field, which are used for calculating the dynamic and thermal 
displacements of the spindle. An accuracy of the calculated frequency and the 
thermal characteristics of spindle units depends on the reliability of the infor-
mation about the stiffness and damping characteristics of its supports and the 
coefficients of convective heat transfer between the surfaces of the spindle and 
its casing and the environment. An improvement in the reliability of the results 
in the design stage, obtained by optimizing the structure with the help of math-

118 
The Parameter Space Investigation Method Toolkit 
ematical models, can be attained by identifying the model parameters in testing 
the prototype. In so doing, the identification procedure includes a solution of 
the direct problems of the dynamics and the heat transfer of the spindle units 
[1, 6]. 
6.3.2 
Experimental Determination of the Characteristics of a Spindle Unit
Experimental measurements of the dynamic and thermal characteristics of 
the spindle unit of a multipurpose machine tool were conducted on a special 
test bed. In the front support of the spindle unit [Figure 6.2(a)], there were 
mounted three angular-contact ball bearings (#7016AC/P4, d = 80 mm, FAG, 
Sweden), and the rear support was equipped with a double-row plain roller bear-
ing (#3014, d = 75 mm, FAG) installed in the “triplex” scheme. The supports 
were lubricated with an NBUl5-like lubricant (Kluber, Germany). The spindle 
casing was rigidly attached to a massive measurement plate isolated from ex-
ternal dynamic disturbances. The spindle was driven by a regulated motor via 
a belt transmission. 
The dynamic characteristics of the spindle unit were determined in the 
form of amplitude-phase frequency characteristics, an artificial dynamic load 
being applied to the spindle with the help of a contactless electromagnetic 
vibrator. From the physical viewpoint, the method is based on the creation of a 
dynamic load P(t) = P0 + P1⋅cos(ωt), where P0 = const, P1 is a variable harmonic 
component, and ω is a regulated disturbance frequency. The load was applied

in the radial direction to the measuring mount 40 mm in diameter, which 
was inserted in the conical orifice of the spindle. The constant component P0 = 
700N was chosen to ensure operation on the linear portion of the spindle unit 
static characteristic. The amplitude of the vibrator variable force P1 = 250N 
was chosen so as to guarantee a stable display of the spindle vibration am-
plitude on the vibration analyzer screen (model 2031, B&K, Denmark) with 
the help of a contactless vortex-current transducer WSG69-5 via an amplifier 
WSM6983 (Roitlinger, Germany). The measuring system error is 1.0 μm. The 
studies showed that the use of contactless electromagnetic vibrators guaran-
tees stable results in determining the frequency characteristics. The tempera-
ture field of the spindle unit was measured with the help of a digital contact 
thermal probe (SKF, Sweden).
The temperature was measured to an accuracy of 1°C. Several points of 
the spindle and its casing were chosen for measuring vibration displacements 
and the temperature [Figure 6.2(a)]. To measure the temperature of the outer 
bearing rings, special through orifices were drilled in the zone of the supports.
Figure 6.3 shows the experimental (curve 1, averaged for 10 measure-
ments) and calculated (curve 2) amplitude-phase frequency characteristics for 
a point on the front of the spindle. The characteristic has a resonance at a 
frequency of 345 Hz, which corresponds to the first shape of lateral flexural 
vibrations of the spindle. The resonance at a frequency of 560 Hz is related 
to the spindle casing vibrations due to its insufficiently stiff attachment to the

of the spindle at node 1.

fixture. 
The stationary temperatures of the spindle unit (Figure 6.4) were mea-
sured after its 1-hour operation at a rotational frequency of 3,000 1/min (curves 
1 and 2 correspond to the experiment and calculation, respectively). 
6.3.3 
Construction of Mathematical Models
To solve the problem of identification, mathematical models of the dynamic 
and thermal systems of the spindle unit were developed on the basis of the 
finite element method. The experience of preceding studies indicates that the 
bar-structure design models are the most natural and appropriate dynamic and 
thermal models of spindles with a lined casing. Therefore, the dynamic system 
of the spindle is presented in Figure 6.2(b) as a linear bar system with distribut-
ed mass that rests on concentrated elastoviscous supports. The displacement of 
each cross-section of the spindle has two components: the radial displacement 
and the angle of inclination of the spindle axis in the plane of the drawing. 
Dynamic displacements of the spindle are described by the following system of 
linear differential equations in the matrix form

This expression (6.3) is used for calculating the frequency characteristic of 
the spindle’s dynamic system (curve 2 in Figure 6.3).
In developing the bar thermal model of the spindle unit [Figure 6.5(b)], 
it was assumed that heat is mostly generated due to friction in the supports 
[Figure 6.5(a)]. The power of the heat released in the supports is determined 
using the Palmgren technique [6] and depends on the type of the bearings 
mounted on the support, the reduced load acting on the support, the rotational 
frequency, and the lubricant viscosity. Since the heat release in the supports 
depends on the lubricant viscosity, which, in turn, depends on the temperature, 
the stationary temperature of the spindle and its supports is found by iteration. 
Numerical experiments showed that if the environmental temperature is used as 
the first approximation of the components of the vector of nodal temperatures, 
then six to eight iterations suffice.
The thermal interaction between the spindle unit and the environment is 
taken into account by using the coefficient of convective heat transfer between 
the spindle and casing surfaces and the environment. The temperature field of 
a lined spindle unit is found by solving the axisymmetric problem of heat trans-
fer under the assumptions: (1) the heat released by a bearing is distributed 
in equal parts between the races, (2) the rolling elements and the separator are

The Identified Parameters of the Models
Since inertial and stiffness parameters of a spindle can be easily expressed 
through its geometric dimensions, the values of the stiffness coefficients K7, K8, 
K9, and K12 (N/mm) and the damping factors D7, D8, D9, and D12 (N⋅mm/s) 
of the supports are the identified parameters of the dynamical model [Figure 
6.2(b)]. 
As far as solving the heat transfer problem, the greatest indefiniteness is 
related to the conditions of the thermal interaction between the spindle unit 
and the environment, and the identified parameters of the thermal model 
are the values of the coefficients of convective heat removal from the open 
spindle surface, C1, the spindle surface between the front and rear supports, 
C2, and the spindle casing surface, C3 [see Figure 6.5(a)]. Coefficients C1, C2, 
and C3 are given in Wt/(m2 ⋅ °C). 
6.3.5 
Adequacy Criteria
The set of criteria determining the static and dynamic behavior of the spindle 
over the range of frequencies from 0 to 600 Hz (criteria Φ1− Φ 13) was deter-
mined by analyzing the static elastic line of the spindle and its first shape of 
vibration (345 Hz). In the second problem, it is reasonable to estimate the cor-
respondence between the thermal model and the actual thermal characteristics 
of the spindle unit according to the temperature values at the structure points 
(criteria F1 − F23).

accuracy of their manufacture and assembly into account, and the constraints 
on the parameters of convective heat transfer were formulated taking the op-
eration conditions of the unit into account.

Solution of the Identification Problems
We performed 512 trials each in the initial parallelepipeds

responding to the dynamic and heat models, respectively. The calculations 
yielded acceptable discrepancies in static (5–10%) and dynamic (9–18%) cri-
teria. However, the discrepancies in thermal criteria turned out to be unaccept-
ably large (34–49%). Thus, the correctness of the specification of the limiting 
variation in the convective heat transfer coefficients of the thermal model was 
doubtful. 
Further modifications of the boundaries of the parallelepiped 
1
2
Π  for the 
thermal model were essentially based on an analysis of histograms of feasible so-
lutions and graphs of criterion versus design variable and criterion versus crite-
rion. Multicriteria analysis demonstrated a substantial effect of the heat removal 
from the surfaces of the spindle unit elements on the temperature field. In view 
of this, we analyzed and refined the values of the heat exchange coefficients with 
an allowance for the natural air cooling of the rotating spindle. As a result, we 
determined the boundaries of a new parallelepiped 
2
2
Π . After we refined the 
heat exchange coefficients, the discrepancies with respect to the thermal criteria 
did not exceed 19%. 
For adequacy criteria

 not exceeding 20%, we determined 
the feasible sets Dα for the dynamic and thermal models, which consisted of 
four and six vectors, respectively. After a informal analysis, the vector 
41
id
α  = (K7; 
D7; K8; D8; K9; D9; K12; D12) = (1.1 ⋅ 105; 3.5; 8.8 ⋅ 104; 3.9; 1.5 ⋅ 105; 4.2; 2.31 
⋅ 105; 7.8) for the dynamic model and the vector 
90
id
α  = (C1; C2; C3) = (137; 74; 
50) for the thermal model were adopted as the best ones. These vectors were 
chosen for the following reasons:
• The vector 
41
id
α  corresponds to minimum discrepancies with respect 
to the static displacement Φ2 (6%) and the dynamic displacement Φ3 
(11%) of node 1 of the spindle front end. These displacements are 
known to inﬂ uence the precision of machining most strongly.
• The vector 
90
id
α  most accurately reﬂ ects the thermal state of the spindle 
unit near the supports (the temperature discrepancies do not exceed 
13%), which is of great practical importance for properly choosing the 
type of lubricant. The node temperature of the spindel for vector 
90
id
α
 is 
shown in Figure 6.4, plot 2.
The obtained solutions were analyzed for stability with respect to small 
parameter variations in the vicinity of the identified vectors. This was done by 
constructing parallelepipeds centered at 
41
id
α  and 
90
id
α  and conducting 128 tri-
als. The stability of the solutions was demonstrated by small variations in the 
values of the criteria. Thus, having constructed reliable mathematical models, 

126 
The Parameter Space Investigation Method Toolkit 
we can pass to the next stage of the experimental development of the spindle, 
namely, its optimization.
6.3.7 
Solution of the Optimization Problem
To determine the feasible sets for the design variables, we analyzed the adequate 
vectors and constructed parallelepipeds 
1
1
1
Π ⊆Π  and 
2
2
2
Π ⊆Π  for the dy-
namic and the thermal models, respectively. The performance criteria to be 
minimized were Φ2, Φ3, F7, F8, F9, and F13 (see Tables 6.1 and 6.2). These 
criteria characterize the static and dynamic stiffness of the spindle unit and the 
thermal state of its supports. Optimization was accomplished by varying the 
support stiffness coefficients K7, K8, K9, and K12 and the heat exchange coef-
ficients C1, C2, and C3. We performed 256 trials in each of the parallelepipeds 
1
Π  and 
2
Π . 
The calculations revealed a set consisting of three Pareto optimal vec-
tors of the spindle unit. The expert makes a decision, taking into account the 
importance of the each criterion. In our case vector α114 was preferred, since it 
is close to the prototype as far as the temperature criteria are concerned and 
exceeds it in the static and dynamic stiffness by 8% and 12.5%, respectively.
6.3.8 
Conclusion
In practice, the stiffness of the bearing was attained by regulating the spindle 
supports preloading. Later, the results of the experimental development of the 
spindle unit prototype with the optimal design variables were checked experi-
mentally and proved to be true to an accuracy of measurements. 
Thus, in this study we have formulated and solved the problem of vector 
identification of the spindle unit in 36 static, dynamic, and thermal adequacy 
criteria. Eleven stiffness, damping, and thermophysical parameters were identi-
fied. As a result, the boundaries of the parameter variations in the identification 
problem were found. The vectors of the dynamic and thermal models, which 
provide the best possible representation of the static, dynamic, and thermal be-
havior of the prototype and agree satisfactorily with experimental results, were 
identified. The solution of the identification problem allowed us to: (1) esti-
mate the quality of the mathematical models of the spindle unit in all major 
proximity criteria, and (2) formulate and solve the optimal design problem on 
the basis of static, dynamic, and thermal criteria.

Other Multicriteria Problems and 
Related Issues
In this chapter, we present several additional multicriteria problems from dif-
ferent fields of human activity. The first problem considers the universal ques-
tion of how to search for the compromise solution when the desired solution 
is unattainable. The second problem delves into optimal design of controlled 
systems. The third problem focuses on multicriteria analysis when mathemati-
cal models are not available but can be approximated from observational data. 
The latter problem appeals to disciplines such as biology, economics, materi-
als science, and information science, where the exact mathematical models are 
unknown. Finally, we consider multicriteria optimization of large-scale systems 
in parallel mode and discuss issues related to choosing the number of trails in 
real-life problems. 
7.1 Search for the Compromise Solution When the Desired Solution 
Is Unattainable
This section can be considered as a special case of prototype improvement. An 
expert a priori defines desired values of criteria vector as

proaches in this situation: The first approach is that an expert can make conces-
sions and accept a compromise solution, taking into account the most impor-
tant criteria. In parametric optimization we can vary the object’s parameters and 
change the constraints on them. An example of searching for the compromise 
solution in parametric optimization problem is given next.

The Parameter Space Investigation Method Toolkit 
The second approach is to not accept a compromise solution within a 
given object. In structural optimization we can vary the structure of the object. 
In this case, it is possible that the expert’s wishes can be realized using the other 
structures, which are different from the structure of the prototype. A search for 
a better structure in the sense of proximity to the given goal W is the main 
problem of structure optimization. The multicriteria analysis can answer the 
important issue of how to improve the prototype and by how much it can be 
improved in order to get closer to the desired goal. 
Finally, we would like to mention that improvement of the prototype de-
pends on: (1) the constructive scheme (topology) of the object, (2) the physical 
and chemical properties of materials, and (3) the design variable, functional, 
and criteria constraints. Generally, the approach for prototype improvement is 
determined by the significance of the object. For example, in order to reduce 
the mass of the object, to increase its reliability and durability, it might be 
advisable to use new materials. On the other hand, the cost of the object may 
increase substantially.

Definition of the Solution That Is the Closest to the Unattainable Solution 
Consider the vibratory system within the limits of: (1) the equations (2.3) (Sec-
tion 2.4), and (2) the given design variable constraints (2.4), functional con-
straints (2.6), and criteria constraints (Section 3.2, Figure 3.7). Let the desired 
criteria vector W be

Obviously, the values of W cannot be reached: as follows from Table

Φ   920. It is necessary to identify the solution that is the closest to W. As 
mentioned in Section 3.2.2, we have obtained eight feasible solutions, includ-
ing four Pareto optimal solutions. Unattainable solution and Pareto optimal 
solutions are illustrated in Figure 7.1. In this figure vector W is designated as 0 
(blue). The graph fourth criterion versus third criterion is shown in Figure 7.2. 
The expert was not satisfied with the obtained solutions. However, the analysis 
of feasible solutions allowed the expert to correct the initial constraints on the 
design variables (Problem Oscillator 1, right column of Table 4.1). 
One hundred ninety-four feasible solutions, including 25 Pareto optimal 
solutions, were obtained in a new statement (see Sections 4.1.1 and 4.1.2). The 
fragment of the new table of Pareto optimal solutions is displayed in Figure 7.3. 
The analysis of this table allowed the expert to give preference to the 
compromise solution 273  (35.11; 30.196; 3.176; 949.9; 1.76; 8.54), red 
rectangle. Values of α273  (1.1  106; 4.53  104; 9.00  102; 49.71; 105) are

lution 273, and solutions 734, 260, 546 are shown in the graph fourth criterion 
versus third criterion (see Figure 7.5). The expert also accepted solutions 260, 
397, and 734. The values of criteria of these vectors are illustrated in Figure 4.2.

7.2 Design of Controlled Engineering Systems 
An aircraft engine represents a multimode object (i.e., indexes of its efficiency 
depend on an operating mode). For example, when the plane takes off, the 
maximal tractive force is necessary, and the engines work in a so-called maximal 
(take-off) mode. Sometimes this mode is named a design mode or a design 
point. In this mode we have the highest frequency of rotation of the rotors, the 
highest heat of gas (in front of the turbine), that is, the highest mechanical and 
thermal loadings. On an interval of rectilinear horizontal flight, the frequency 
of rotation and the temperature are decreased. As a rule, while designing the

engine, only a “maximal” mode is considered. Here the technique of search of 
optimum decisions is described, taking into account all modes. 
Consider an engineering system whose efficiency can be evaluated by a 
number of particular performance criteria v, v  1, …, k. The set of criteria 
v comprises both “pure design” criteria dv, v  1, …, k1 (mass, stiffness, safety 
margins of the structure) and control criteria cv, v  k1  1, …, k (efficiencies 
of various operating modes). Any particular performance criterion of an engi-
neering system can be represented as a function of the design variable vector αd 
and the control variable vector αc, so that v  v(αd, αc). 
It is important to emphasize an essential difference between design vari-
ables and control variables. Design variables mostly characterize the sizes of sep-
arate parts of a system. These variables cannot be changed purposefully in the 
course of operating the system (changes in the geometric characteristics caused 
by mechanical wear or as a result of repair are not considered). The control 
variables in modern engineering systems can be collected in databases stored in 
the computer memory. Therefore, in principle, a number of control laws can 
be implemented, each of which can be chosen depending on the specific task 
fulfilled by the engineering system. 
The traditional approach to the optimization of regulated engineering 
systems yields a single design variable vector αd (the design of the system) and 
Figure 7.5 Projections of the multidimensional points v(αi), v  1, …, 6; j  1, …, 5 onto 
the plane fourth criterion versus third criterion. Green and blue points are feasible solutions; 
green points are Pareto optimal solutions. The compromise solution is vector #273.

the corresponding single control variable vector αc (the set of control laws). 
However, rather often, this approach does not allow revealing all potential pos-
sibilities for improving the efficiency of a system with controlled variables. 
A more efficient approach [2–6] to the optimization of controlled engi-
neering systems employs, for a fixed design variable vector αd, not a single control 
variable vector, but a set of vectors, each of which determines the optimal set of 
control laws for each purpose (operating mode). All the control variable vectors 
are stored in the airborne computer’s memory and may be chosen in accordance 
with a concrete control purpose, thus implementing the optimal control. When 
using this approach, one has, first of all, to construct a set D of feasible solu-
tions

that is most preferable from the viewpoint of the expert. However, for problems 
of high dimensionality, in which the number of design variables and control 
variables can amount to many dozens, it is extremely difficult to construct the 
feasible set D. Therefore, the following algorithm is proposed for solving prac-
tical problems.
Stage 1
The determination of the feasible set D consists of design and control vectors, 
α  (αd, αc ). As a result, only one set of control laws (control variable vector αc) 
corresponds to each feasible design αd.
Stage 2
To estimate the ultimate possibilities of the system, one must solve the multi-
criteria problem of optimizing the control variables with respect to the control 
criteria

If the number of control or/and design variables is large, the construction

such an experiment is sometimes either complicated or impossible. In this case, 
in Stage 1, we select from the set P  D a subset of the most acceptable vec-

In this approach we construct the feasible and Pareto optimal sets taking

This approach that was used for solving the problem of optimal gas dy-
namic design of a four-stage axial flow compressor for an aircraft gas turbine 
engine is described next. 
7.2.1 
Multistage Axial Flow Compressor for an Aircraft Engine
7.2.2.1 Characteristics of the Object of Investigation
A multistage axial flow compressor is intended for increasing the gas pressure in 
aircraft or ground power plants [4–6]. A schematic diagram of the compressor 
passage is shown in Figure 7.6. Each stage of the compressor consists of two 
blade rows: the rotor blade (RB) row and the stator blade (SB) row. Each blade 
has a complex three-dimensional shape. The rotor blade is shown in Figure 7.7. 
The shape of the blades is specified by a number of design variables and cannot 
be purposefully changed in the course of operation. However, the stator blades 
of the first three stages of this compressor can be rotated about their axes, and, 
hence, one can control the angles of rotation depending on the operating mode 
in order to increase the compressor’s efficiency. The operating mode of the com-
pressor is characterized by the reduced rotation rate nr  
288
in
n
T
⋅
, where 
n is the ratio of the current rotation rate to the rotation rate at the maximum 
power mode and Tin is the inlet air temperature. 
The gas dynamic efficiency of the compressor depends on the air flow rate 
G(nr), the total pressure ratio π(nr), the efficiency η(nr), and the gas dynamic 
stability margin Ks(nr). All these characteristics depend on the operating mode. 
The values G(nr) and π(nr) are fixed; the function η(nr) is to be maximized, and 
the value of the Ks(nr) is bounded below, where Ks(nr)  Ks min.

We seek the laws of control for the angles of rotation of the first three sta-
tor blade rows in the form of linear functions of nr, so that αc  (αc1,,αc6). We 
consider as the design variables the inlet and outlet angles of all rotor blades and 
of the first three stator blades in three radial sections; hence, αd  (αd1,,αd42). 
We have normalized the nominal values and ranges of the parameters to be 
varied so that the values corresponding to the prototype are equal to 1.5 and 
the boundaries of the ranges are specified by

vη  of the prototype for four operat-
ing modes with nr  1.0; 0.9; 0.8; 0.7. It is desirable to increase the criteria v 
by optimizing the design variables and control variables of the compressor. 
The functional constraints were reduced to ensuring: (1) a given air flow 
rate, (2) a given increase in the pressure to an accuracy of 1%, and (3) the 
gas dynamic stability margin. In the case under consideration, no criteria con-
straints were imposed. Design variable and functional constraints form the fea-
sible solution set D.
The choice of the mathematical model of the object under consideration 
is one of the most important stages in optimizing complex engineering systems. 
After all, the usefulness of any optimization depends greatly on the adequacy 
of the mathematical model employed. This study used the two-dimensional 
axisymmetric model considered in [4]. Since it was identified using the results 
of an experimental study of the prototype compressor, the calculation of the 
main gas dynamic characteristics to an accuracy of no less than 0.5% (over the 
considered range of operating modes) is guaranteed.

The solution of this problem is described in detail in [2, 3, 5, 6]. In Table 
7.1 we present the values of the performance criteria in various operating modes 
for four Pareto optimal control laws obtained for one of the best designs. From 
Table 7.1 it follows that for the first mode the best value is 1  0.048% (Pa-
reto optimal control law 1), for the second mode 2  0.922% (Pareto optimal 
control law 4), for the third mode 3  1.34% (Pareto optimal control law 3), 
and for the fourth mode 4  2.212% (Pareto optimal control law 4). 
This table shows the limiting values of the criteria that can be provided 
by implementing several control laws obtained from the Pareto optimal set. In 
fact, in this case, each operating mode is most effective for a specific control law. 
An analysis of the obtained results indicates that, first, there exists a set of 
alternative control laws for each chosen design, and, second, the design variables 
determine the efficiency (that is captured by four criteria for different modes) 
of a compressor regulated in various operating modes. If one would work with 
only the first law, the efficiency will be 0.048%, 0.54%, 0.908%, and 1.315% 
for the first, second, third, and fourth modes, respectively. In our case, we have 
the following efficiencies (in order from the first to the fourth modes): 0.048%, 
0.922%, 1.34%, and 2.212%. This confirms the validity of the chosen strategy 
for optimizing a regulated multistage axial flow compressor.
Multicriteria control allows a considerable increase in the compressor ef-
ficiency over the entire range of operating modes. 
7.2.2 
Conclusion
The studies showed that the optimal design of regulated engineering systems 
should be carried out within the framework of a single optimization investi-
gation strategy, which includes simultaneous multicriteria optimization of the 
design variables and control laws. 
This approach makes it possible to realize the limiting possibilities for 
improving the efficiency of complex engineering systems by choosing the 
most preferable designs from the obtained set and realizing (on an on-board

7.3 Multicriteria Analysis from Observational Data
For this class of problems, there are no a priori specified mathematical models 
[7]. However, there are available observations in the form of tables that give an 
indication of the behavior of the system under investigation. These problems 
are often encountered in medicine, biology, economics, materials science, in-
formation science, and other fields. An approximate mathematical model is 
constructed on the basis of the observations with the use of classification and 
regression algorithms. Some algorithms for constructing approximate crite-
ria functions include regression by neural networks, Support Vector Machine 
(SVM) regression, and multiple linear regression [8–11]. Next we briefly de-
scribe a general strategy for multicriteria analysis from observational data:
• Step 1: Obtaining observational data and constructing an approximate 
model. Suppose we have an experiment with N observations represented 
by an N  M matrix, where M is the total number of observed variables 
(criteria and design variables). The approximate criteria functions are 
constructed using machine learning algorithms. The approximate cri-
teria functions are evaluated by statistical metrics, such as R2 (fraction 
of variance explained by a model) and absolute, relative, and squared 
errors. Then functions with the best evaluation performance are chosen 
for the approximate mathematical model. 
• Step 2: Multicriteria analysis: construction of a pseudo-feasible solution set 
and the search for the best solutions.
7.3.1 
Example
Here we illustrate the process of constructing the approximate feasible solution 
set in problems in which only observational data are present. We will consider 
an oscillatory system and imagine that we do not have access to its mathemati-
cal model.
The collection of observational data depends on the specifics of the prob-
lem being investigated. In the present case, in order to obtain observational 
data, we referred to the true model1 and, using the PSI method, conducted 
4,000 trials with a random number generator. As a result, we obtained a 4,000 
1. The true model is presented by the equations (2.3), design variable constraints (2.4), rigid 
functional constraints (2.6), and criteria constraints (see Figure 3.7).

 11 (M  6 criteria and 5 design variables) matrix of observations. See Figures 
7.8 and 7.9 for fragments of this matrix.
Using the observational data, we constructed approximate criteria func-
tions by means of machine learning algorithms. In our case, criteria 3 and 5 
were determined using generalized neural networks for regression [8], while 
the remaining four criteria were reconstructed using the SVMTorch algorithm 
[9–11]. This choice was based on statistical estimates of the criteria functions 
obtained; the estimates of the best approximate functions are given in Table 7.2. 
These criteria functions constitute the approximate mathematical model.

The Parameter Space Investigation Method Toolkit 
At this stage, we have an approximate model. We employed the PSI 
method to conduct 1,024 trials using LPτ sequences. We constructed test tables 
and obtained eight approximate feasible solutions 
(

 that satisfied all con-
straints. These were vectors #288, #336, #520, #544, #560, #672, #896, and 
#1008. Since in this example we knew the true model, the vectors 
piα  were 
checked for feasibility by the direct application of the true model and the calcu-
lation of the values 
(
)
piα
Φ
. Seven of these eight approximate feasible solutions 
were found to be feasible.2 The eighth approximate feasible solution #1008 was 
nonfeasible because of errors in the approximate model. 
After constructing and analyzing the approximate feasible solution set, we 
corrected the design variable constraints and determined a new approximate 
feasible set. After 1,024 trials with LPτ sequences, 311 approximate feasible so-
lutions were identified, 218 of which turned out to be feasible. We note that in 
the same experiment with the true model, there were 258 feasible solutions [7].
In order to analyze the efficiency of the employed approximate model, we 
can use a metric equal to the number of feasible solutions found with the ap-
proximate model over the number of feasible solutions obtained with the true 
model. In the cases described above, this metric is 7/8  0.875 and 218/258 
 0.85, respectively. Further improvement of the efficiency of an approximate 
model is possible by improving the approximate criteria, especially 3 and 5. 
However, it is worth noting that we have already approximated the true model 
fairly well, such that we have preserved the dependences of criteria on design 
variables and between criteria (see Figures 7.10 through 7.13). 
To summarize, multicriteria analysis can be carried out in problems 
from observational data by constructing an approximate model. This analysis

were found from the true model (see Figure 3.7).

Computationally Expensive Problems
For many applied optimization problems, it is necessary to carry out a large-
scale numerical experiment in order to construct the feasible set. For this rea-
son, a search for optimal solutions is often not carried out at all. We will men-
tion a few types of difficult problems.

the parallelepiped is a small value, e.g., << 0.0001). Even if the time for 
calculation of one criteria vector is fairly short, it takes a long time to 
ﬁ nd at least one feasible solution because of the need to carry out a large 
number of trials. 
• The second type: Problems with a high dimensionality of the design vari-
able vectors (e.g., thousands of design variables). It is obvious that these 
problems also require a large-scale numerical experiment with hundreds 
of thousands or millions of trials. 
• The third type: Problems with complex mathematical models, where cal-
culating one criteria vector requires a lot of computer time. For example, 
this includes many problems with ﬁ nite element models. 
The software package MOVI allows us to tackle computationally expen-
sive problems in parallel mode, so that the desired number of trials N is distrib-
uted among k computers [1, 7]. Thus, each computer finds a feasible solution 
set for its own subproblem (by conducting ~N/k trials). Next all feasible solu-
tion sets are combined and a single Pareto optimal solution set is constructed.

We investigated the design variable space and criteria space using four 
computers simultaneously (see Figure 7.14). Each computer conducted 50,000 
trials using a random number generator. Four computers conducted a total of 
200,000 trials, which resulted in 4,297 feasible solutions. The CPU time was 
approximately 8 hours per computer using an Intel Xeon 2.4 GHz with 2 GB 
of RAM. To solve this problem on one computer, 34 hours would be required. 
After we combined all 4,297 feasible solutions, we obtained 326 Pareto 
optimal ones. The efficiency coefficients for the Pareto optimal and feasible 
solutions are equal to γp  326/200,000  0.0016 and γf  4,297/200,000  
0.021, respectively.

100,001 to 150,000, and so forth. In general, when we use uniformly dis-
tributed sequences (e.g., LPτ), the values of design variables are guaranteed to 
be different for each test, while the criteria values may coincide. In this case, 
MOVI software will mark that these criteria vectors have been obtained, for 
example, on computers X and Y. 
The results of the investigation are presented in Table 7.3. 
The combined feasible set contains 87 solutions, and the combined Pare-
to optimal set contains 57 solutions. For example, data from the first computer 
are given in the first row: 23 feasible solutions, 20 of which are Pareto optimal 
solutions; the first computer contributes 14 vectors to the combined Pareto 
optimal solution set. The contribution of each computer to the combined Pa-
reto optimal solution set is shown in the last column. The coefficients γ for the 
Pareto optimal and feasible solutions are equal to γp  57/250000  0.000228 
and γf  87/250.000  0.000348, respectively. The dependences between crite-
ria obtained on the first computer after carrying out 50,000 trials are shown in 
Figure 7.15. This analysis shows the complex relationships between the criteria 
and the localization of the feasible solutions.

Conclusion
In many cases we have difficult optimization problems with stringent con-
straints, high dimensionality of design variables, and models that require a lot 
of time to calculate a criteria vector. The possibility of using the PSI method 
and the MOVI to carry out large-scale numerical experiment in parallel mode 
in order to construct the feasible set allows to solve many of the problems that 
until recently were considered impossible to optimize.

7.5 On the Number of Trails in the Real-Life Problems 
As known, the number of tests depends on constraints, dimensionality of de-
sign variable vectors, and the time of calculating one criteria vector for given de-
sign variable values. As already noted, when using the PSI method, stating and 
solving problems is a single process. When we mention the number of tests, we 
mean this particularly complicated process. Indeed, in order to obtain a feasible 
solution and Pareto optimal sets, we should repeatedly correct initial statements 
of problems on the basis of the PSI method. The necessity of correcting the 
statement of the problem is one of the important features of real-life problems. 
All the problems described in our book prove this fact. We will point to three

feasible solutions are magenta.

The Parameter Space Investigation Method Toolkit 
kinds of problems depending on the time of calculating one criteria vector and 
the number of performed tests [12].
1. Problem of a naval ship design (Section 5.2). Among the particular fea-
tures of this problem are the high dimensionality of the design variable 
vector (45 design variables) and the difﬁ culties in improving a rea-
sonably good prototype under strong constraints on six performance 
criteria, nine pseudo-criteria, and seven functional dependences. Since 
calculation of one criterion vector took less than 1 second, hundreds 
of thousands of trails were conducted. Notice that each subsequent 
experiment was carried out on the basis of the previous one. In the 
process of solving these problems, experts repeatedly corrected their 
statement. A similar large-scale experiment was also discussed in Sec-
tion 5.1. In the latter case, we corrected the problem statement twice. 
2. Problem of a design of a car for shock protection [13]. Unlike the previ-
ous problem where calculation of a criteria vector took less than 1 sec-
ond, the criteria in this problem are based on the ﬁ nite element model 
with thousands of elements and nodes, and it takes approximately 
several hours to compute one vector of criteria. This problem has 10 
criteria: the mass of structure and residual strains in the car body after 
impact in the nine most dangerous points of the rear panel. The num-
ber of design variables in this problem is 13; that at face value suggests 
a large computational experiment (with several thousand tests). How-
ever, since it requires such a large amount of computational time to 
compute one vector of criteria, the optimization of design variables is 
very difﬁ cult to implement. Therefore, the initial model was decom-
posed in two approximate models of the bumper and the real panel. It 
was necessary to deﬁ ne the consistent solutions between subsystems of 
the bumper and the real panel. For this purpose, 300 tests were carried 
out. Each test required no more than 10 minutes. The analysis of the 
obtained solutions has shown that the prototype cannot be improved. 
As a result, the problem has been reformulated (i.e., the designs of the 
bumper and the rear panel have been modiﬁ ed by introducing addi-
tional stiffening ribs). Fifteen consistent design variable vectors were 
deﬁ ned. For these vectors we have calculated all criteria using the orig-
inal model. The number of feasible solutions satisfying all constraints 
of the structure was nine. The number of Pareto optimal solutions was 
ﬁ ve. 
3. Problem of the operation development of a truck [2]. In terms of com-
putational time, this problem falls in between the previous two prob-

 
Other Multicriteria Problems and Related Issues 
       149                 
lems. The computation of a vector of criteria based on a system of 
complex differential equations took approximately 3 minutes. In the 
identiﬁ cation phase of this problem, we identiﬁ ed 16 parameters of 
the mathematical model using 65 adequacy criteria and deﬁ ned to 
what extent the model corresponds to the real system. In the initial 
problem statement, 4,096 tests were conducted. Only seven solutions 
met the criteria constraints and thus entered the feasible solution set. 
After analyzing the obtained results, new boundaries of the design 
variables were deﬁ ned. The same number of tests (4,096) was con-
ducted. As a result, 11 more feasible solutions were obtained. On the 
basis of solution of the identiﬁ cation problem and the deﬁ nition of 
the feasible solution set, the problem of optimization by 20 perfor-
mance criteria was solved next. These criteria were divided into the 
following groups: (1) comfort, (2) durability, (3) load preservation, 
and (4) safety. Twenty parameters were varied. Optimization was 
aimed to improve the prototype. 4,096 tests were conducted and 21 
solutions satisﬁ ed all constraints and entered the feasible solution set. 
The Pareto set consisted of 20 solutions. 
In addition, we provide below three more relevant examples:
4. In the problems of improving the rear axle housing for a truck (5 per-
formance criteria, 12 pseudo-criteria, and 7 design variables, Section 
5.3) and improving the truck frame prototype (4 performance criteria, 
3 pseudo-criteria, and 21 design variables, Section 5.4) 256 and 300 
trials are performed correspondingly. 
5. In the problem of vector identiﬁ cation of parameters of a spindle 
unit (Section 6.3), we considered dynamic and thermal mathemati-
cal models with 23 and 13 criteria adequacy correspondingly. 512 
trials are carried out in each problem. In the problems of optimiza-
tion of design variables of a spindle unit, 6 performance criteria were 
minimized and 256 trials were performed in each problem. (For the 
problems 4 and 5, calculation of one criterion vector requires up to 4 
minutes.)

Adopting the PSI Method for Database 
Search
8.1 Introduction
Database search engines are used in essentially all areas of modern life. There 
are two major types of information retrieval problems that are being solved by 
search engines. In the first type, a search engine matches a query of the client to 
a database and reports back results. For example, the client uses PubMed service 
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) to identify articles that talk about the 
BRCA1 gene in breast cancer using the query “BRCA1 breast cancer.” Another 
example is when the client uses the Google search engine (http://www.google.
com/) to identify a poem from the phrase “to whose immortal eyes.” Usually, 
this type of problem can be solved efficiently and automatically (i.e., without 
interaction with the client) given that the database contains a sought solution. 
In the second type of problem, the client uses a search engine to retrieve 
solutions (alternatives) from the database that are described by a set of con-
tradictory characteristics. For example, such problems are widespread when 
searching for an airline ticket, a matching partner, or real estate on the Web. 
In a typical scenario, the database contains a very large number of alternatives 
described by a set of characteristics. Because of the large number of alternatives, 
the search engine allows the client to impose constraints on characteristics such 
that the resulting filtered set of alternatives satisfies all requests of the client. If 
these constraints are defined correctly, they determine so-called the feasible so-
lution set where the most preferable solution should be then sought by the cli-
ent. However, in the majority of cases, the client defines constraints intuitively 

154 
The Parameter Space Investigation Method Toolkit 
and thus often incorrectly. As such, many interesting solutions that, under cer-
tain assumptions, could have been feasible will be lost. This results in the poor 
or even empty feasible solution set. This is especially the case when the client 
deals with many contradictory characteristics and many alternatives1. Current 
search engines do not provide tools for systematic construction of the feasible 
solution set. This is a major shortcoming of existing database search engines, 
because a search for the most preferable solution depends, to a large extent, on 
the definition of the constraints, and this insurmountable task is shifted to the 
client’s shoulders. 
The problem of database search involves many contradictory character-
istics and a large number of alternatives and necessitates decision-making [1]. 
The ultimate results also critically depend on the quality of database [2], the 
type of constraints on characteristics [3], and other factors. An important fea-
ture of the database search problem is that filtering of the number of solutions 
via the construction of the feasible solution set should precede decision-making.
That is why main thesis of this chapter is that systematic construction of 
the feasible solution set has a fundamental value for the client. In this chapter, 
we modify the PSI method to allow the construction of the feasible solution 
set specifically for the problems of database search. We propose a modified 
PSI method called DBS-PSI (DBS is an acronym for “database search”) that 
allows us to significantly improve the quality of the search results by explicitly 
constructing and analyzing the feasible solution set and identifying the most 
preferable solutions.
8.1.1 
Characteristics of Alternatives: Criteria and Pseudo-Criteria
We define a criterion as the characteristic of the alternative2 that is related to 
the alternative’s quality by monotonous dependence. In other words, all other 
things being equal, the more (or the less) the value of the criterion, the bet-
ter the alternative. Contrary to the criterion, a pseudo-criterion is not related 
to an alternative’s quality by monotonous dependence [4]. Pseudo-criteria do 
not need to be optimized; only their constraints have to be satisfied. These 
constraints are determined either by known and generally accepted standards 
or by the client’s preferences. In most cases, constraints on both criteria and 
pseudo-criteria are not rigidly set. An algorithm allowing us to determine these 
constraints is provided in [5]. Examples of criteria and pseudo-criteria are given 
next.
1.  In rare cases, when there are a few alternatives and characteristics, this task may be realistic 
for the client. 
2. Examples of alternatives in database search engines are airline tickets (travel search Web sites), 
women/men (online dating services), houses (real estate search Web sites), cars (online services 
to buy cars), and so on.

 
Adopting the PSI Method for Database Search 
       155                 
Let us consider four popular uses of database search engines and deter-
mine several criteria and pseudo-criteria to illustrate these definitions: 
• Using travel search Web sites to buy airline tickets, for example, Kay-
ak travel search engine (http://www.kayak.com). The criteria are cost, 
number of stops, and duration. The pseudo-criteria are takeoff time, 
landing time, airline, airport (see Figure 8.1). For example, the client 
most often speciﬁ es a range of constraints on takeoff time and landing 
time. However, if he or she wanted to depart/arrive as early/late as pos-
sible, takeoff time and landing time should be considered as criteria. 
The choice of destination airport may also be a criterion if the client has 
to hurry from the airport to work, and as a result he or she chooses the 
airport closest to his or her ofﬁ ce. 
• Using online dating services to look for a matching partner, for example, 
Yahoo! Personals (http://personals.yahoo.com/). The criteria are educa-

tion level and income level. The pseudo-criteria are appearance and life-
style. Appearance contains the subsets of more specific pseudo-criteria 
such as ethnicity, height, body type, eye color, and hair color. Lifestyle 
contains the subset of more specific pseudo-criteria such as marital sta-
tus, profession, religion, and interests. In general, when we talk about 
one’s height, weight, and age, it generally makes no sense to say that the 
higher (lower) the values of these characteristics, the better the alterna-
tive. These characteristics must lie within certain boundaries.
• Using real estate search websites to buy a house, for example, Realtor.
com (http://www.realtor.com/). The criteria are cost, distance to work, 
and school district (for school-age children). The pseudo-criteria are 
ceiling height and number of floors. If the client is handicapped and 
uses a wheelchair, the number of floors becomes a criterion.
• Using online services to buy cars, for example, Cars.com (http://www.
cars.com/). The criteria are cost, fuel consumption, and operating cost. 
The pseudo-criteria are wear resistance, durability, and the operating life 
of car parts. 
8.1.2 
General Statement of the Problem and Solution Approach
Assume that a database contains N alternatives (solutions), each of which is 
described by k characteristics3 (pseudo-criteria and criteria) 
j
v
Φ , for v = 1,…, 
k and j = 1, …, N. These characteristics can be contradictory, so improving 
some characteristics leads to the deterioration of the others. Also assume that 
the database contains so many alternatives that the client experiences significant 
difficulties while analyzing them and choosing the most preferable alternative. 
The problem is how to filter the set of alternatives without losing any alterna-
tives that are acceptable to the client. This can be accomplished by constructing 
the feasible and Pareto optimal sets.
We are given a vector of characteristics Φ = (Φ1, Φ2, …, Φk), where Φ1, 
Φ2, …, Φc are criteria that we want to minimize and Φc+1, Φc+2, …, Φk are 
pseudo-criteria. Alternatives Φj that: (1) satisfy all criteria constraints, that is,  
j
v
Φ  (v = 1, …, c) such that 
**
j
v
v
Φ ≤Φ  (or 
**
j
v
v
Φ ≥Φ  in the case of maximiza-
tion) and (2) satisfy constraints on pseudo-criteria, that is, 
j
v
Φ (v = c + 1, …, 
k) such that 
*
**
j
v
v
v
Φ ≤Φ ≤Φ , constitute the feasible solution set D. Here 
**
v
Φ  is 
the worst value of criteria which the client considers as acceptable; constraints 
3. It is worth noting that often client can a priori state “rigid” requirements to certain charac-
teristics that cannot be changed under any circumstances. In such cases, when searching for the 
most preferable solution, it is necessary to exclude alternatives that did not satisfy those require-
ments and then search for feasible solutions as described in this section.

on pseudo-criteria 
*
v
Φ  and 
**
v
Φ  correspond to the best and worst values, 
respectively.
We solve the general problem by first constructing the feasible solution 
set D by imposing constraints on these criteria and pseudo-criteria mentioned 
via dialogues of the client with the computer. Next, we define the Pareto op-
timal set P ⊆ D using only criteria Φ1, Φ2, …, Φc. Recall that an alternative 
0j

Φ

 is called a Pareto optimal if there exists no alternative Φj ∈ D such 
that

< Φ  for at least one v0 ∈ {1, …,

0j
Φ  cannot be improved by all criteria Φ1, Φ2, 
…, Φc simultaneously. A set P ⊆ D is called a Pareto optimal set if it consists 
of only Pareto optimal alternatives. Finally, the client determines the alternative 
0j

, which is the most preferable among the alternatives belonging to the 
set P.
8.1.3 
Motivation of the Problem Statement
Concessions 
*
v
Φ  and 
**
v
Φ  are something like a market where we have the op-
portunity to trade until we get what we need. Of course, not all concessions are 
possible, but that is outside the scope of our work. By investigating the set of 
Pareto solutions, the clients see what can and what cannot be achieved. They 
are able to choose the most preferable alternative in this set, 
0j
P
Φ
∈
. At the 
same time, they know that there exist no better alternatives in the database. 
The Pareto optimal set plays an important role in vector optimization problems 
because it can be analyzed more easily than the feasible solution set and because 
the optimal alternative always belongs to the Pareto optimal set, irrespective of 
the system of preferences used by the client for comparing alternatives belong-
ing to the feasible solution set.
8.1.3.1 Problem Considered by This Work
We primarily consider problems with the following features: 
• Characteristics are contradictory.
• The dimensionality of the characteristics vector may reach dozens.
• The number of alternatives may reach many thousands.
• The constraints on these characteristics are often stringent.
• The constraints on characteristics 
*
v
Φ  and 
**
v
Φ  can be deﬁ ned in an 
interactive mode, in the process of dialogues of the client with the com-
puter.

The Parameter Space Investigation Method Toolkit 
8.1.3.2 What Do the Client and Search Engine Developers Need to Know? 
Search engine developers must provide all necessary characteristics (criteria and 
pseudo-criteria). The client must understand which constraints on characteris-
tics are acceptable and which are not, without differentiating between criteria 
and pseudo-criteria when constructing the feasible set. After determining the 
feasible set (feasible alternatives), the client must decide personally which one 
of these characteristics is a criterion and which one is a pseudo-criterion. This 
is because the same characteristics may be a criterion for one client and pseudo-
criteria for another client. Next come the analysis of the obtained alternatives 
and the selection of the most preferable one. 
8.2 DBS-PSI Method
8.2.1 
DBS-PSI Method as a New Paradigm of a Database Search
We mentioned earlier difficulties in constructing the feasible solution set cor-
rectly. To do this, the client must see what concessions he or she should make 
on characteristics and what he or she will get in return4. We want to show the 
process of generating concessions to the client and to interactively engage him 
or her in it.
Recall that the PSI method was designed to help the client determine con-
straints on characteristics (criteria and pseudo-criteria) and thus to construct 
the feasible solution set. After determining the feasible solution set, the Pareto 
optimal set is constructed only with consideration of the criteria. Then the cli-
ent will search for the most preferable solution on the Pareto optimal set. The 
new DBS-PSI method [5] is designed to be used for a database search, and it 
consists of three main stages, presented next.
Stage 1: Compilation of Analysis Tables Via Computer
In this stage, the client transforms the database into analysis tables5 as fol-
lows. For each characteristic an analysis table is compiled so that the values of 
1,
,

v
v

 are arranged in increasing order; that is,

4. We note that in search engines it is possible to revise constraints. However, the client is ex-
pected to do this at a very intuitive level.
5. The foundation of the PSI method is test tables. The principal difference between test tables 
and analysis tables is that in the former case, solutions are obtained with the use of generators 
(e.g., uniformly distributed sequences), and in the latter case solutions are obtained from a da-
tabase. Also, the parameters are absent in the search engines that are discussed in this section.

 
Adopting the PSI Method for Database Search 
       159                 
where i1, i2, …, iN are the numbers of alternatives (a separate set for each v). 
Taken together, the k tables form complete analysis tables. In analysis tables, 
the list of nonnumerical criteria is arranged in order of the client’s preferences. 
Stage 2: Selection of Characteristic Constraints
This stage includes the dialogue of a client with the computer. Let minΦv and 
maxΦv be unfeasible solutions for the vth characteristic (pseudo-criterion and/
or criterion), and let 
*
v
Φ  and/or 
**
v
Φ , respectively, be the minimum possible 
concessions from minΦv and/or maxΦv, (min
*
**
j
v
v
v
Φ ≤Φ ≤Φ  maxΦv), where 
[minΦv;
*
v
Φ ) and (
**
v
Φ ; maxΦv] are unfeasible solution domains. Then the re-
mainder of table [
*
v
Φ ;
**
v
Φ ] is the maximum search interval for feasible solu-
tions. After examining the characteristics arranged in each of the analysis tables 
in increasing (decreasing) order, starting with minΦv and/or maxΦv, the client 
analyzes each value. The first feasible value found will be 
*
v
Φ (
**
v
Φ ). If minΦv 
and/or maxΦv are feasible values, there is no need to make the correspond-
ing concessions. In general, we will denote the feasible solution search interval 
as [
*
v
Φ ;
**
v
Φ ]. If the selected values of [
*
v
Φ ;
**
v
Φ ] are not a maximum, then 
many interesting solutions may be lost, since some of the characteristics are 
contradictory.
The client has to consider one characteristic (analysis table) at a time and 
specify the respective constraints 
*
v
Φ  and 
**
v
Φ . Then the client proceeds to the 
next analysis table, and so on. Note that the revision of the characteristic con-
straints does not cause any difficulties to the client.
It is important to emphasize that a human-computer dialogue is very con-
venient for the client: he or she does not have to change the values of some char-
acteristics at the expense of others. He or she sees one analysis table and sets the 
appropriate constraints; then he or she repeats the same process with another 
table, and so on. After the client defines the constraints, the computer searches 
for the feasible solutions. For example, if the client has defined the constraints 
on the first and second characteristics, he or she immediately obtains infor-
mation on feasible solutions based on these characteristics. After defining the 
constraints on the third characteristic, the client obtains feasible solutions based 
on three characteristics, and so on. In other words, the client sees what price 
he or she pays for making concessions on various characteristics (i.e., what the 
client loses and gains). Such an analysis gives the client valuable information on 
the advisability of revising various characteristic constraints with the aim of im-
proving the basic characteristics. Thus, in this method, the client imposes con-
straints on each characteristic in succession and follows the construction of the 
feasible solution set step by step. Moreover, the client can go back at any time 
and reexamine the constraints depending on the feasible solution set obtained.

160 
The Parameter Space Investigation Method Toolkit 
Stage 3: Verification of the Solvability of a Problem Via Computer
Let the client fix a characteristic (e.g.,
1v
Φ ), and consider the corresponding 
analysis table (8.1). Let S1 be the number of values in the table satisfying the 
selected characteristic constraints:

out for each characteristic. If at least one alternative can be found for which all 
characteristic constraints are valid simultaneously, then the feasible solution set 
is nonempty and our problem is solvable. Otherwise, the client should return 
to Stage 2 and make certain concessions on characteristic constraints
*
v
Φ and
**
v
Φ
. The procedure is iterated until the feasible solution set is nonempty. Now the 
Pareto optimal set is constructed. This is done by removing those feasible alter-
natives that can be improved with respect to all characteristics simultaneously.
As a rule, the client makes more concessions on the less important char-
acteristics. These concessions may allow him or her to obtain a substantial gain 
in the most significant characteristics.
Notice that the number of characteristics must be no less than neces-
sary. The client always wishes to optimize not one, but all of the most impor-
tant characteristics, many of which are antagonistic. The greater the number of 
characteristics taken into account, the richer the information obtained about 
alternatives. The DBS-PSI method allows us to consider as many characteristics 
as necessary.
8.3 Searching for a Matching Partner
The purpose of this example is to give readers an idea of how to construct 
feasible and Pareto optimal solutions on the basis of analysis tables. Earlier we 
mentioned the example of using online dating services to look for a matching 
partner. Let us show how a male client will search for a matching female part-
ner using the DBS-PSI method. Suppose the search characteristics are Height 
(Φ1), Weight (Φ2), Age (Φ3), Income (Φ4) and Education (Φ5). Let the client 
have access to a database with alternatives. According to Stage 1 of the DBS-
PSI method, the client should construct analysis tables (see Figure 8.2). From 
Figure 8.2 it can be seen that the database contains a large number of alterna-
tives6 and the values of the characteristics vary over fairly large ranges: from a 
6. For example, #12,089, #34,006, #95,175, #30,617, #88,945, and so on. Each of the women 
in the analysis tables is designated as an alternative #.

height of 4’11” (alternative #284) to 6’11” (alternative #76), from a weight of 
99.2 lbs (alternative #5,298) to 183 lbs (alternative #66), from 25 years of Age 
(alternative #971) to 65 years of Age (alternative #34,006), from an Income of 
$25,000 (alternative #1,021) to $150,000 (alternative #90,661), and from an 
Education of Some High School (alternative #12,907) to Postgraduate (alterna-
tive #95,175). The more alternatives there are in the analysis tables, the greater 
the client’s choice.

The Parameter Space Investigation Method Toolkit 
According to Stage 1, the client should construct search intervals for 
feasible solutions. After studying the analysis table for the first characteris-
tic (Height), the client has determined the search interval for feasible solutions 
[
*
**
1

;
Φ Φ ] = [5’2”; 5’6”] (see Figure 8.2). 
Alternatives #689, …, #27, …, #994 correspond to this interval. The cli-
ent then proceeds to the second analysis table, to Weight, and determines the 
search interval for feasible solutions [
*
**
2
2
;
Φ
Φ ] = [125.7 lbs; 150 lbs]. Alterna-
tives #88, …, #7,632, …, #30,617 correspond to this interval. When switch-
ing from one analysis table to another (from Height to Weight), the computer 
records the total number of alternatives that satisfy the constraints on these 
characteristics simultaneously. As it turns out, there are four of these alterna-
tives, #27, #894, #7,632 and #30,167. If there were no feasible alternatives, cli-
ent should revise the constraints on the first and/or second characteristics. The 
client then proceeds to the third analysis table (Age) and constructs the interval 
[
*
**
3
3
;
Φ Φ ] = [30 years; 40 years] that is satisfied by alternatives #472, …, #888, 
…, #300. The total number of alternatives that satisfies the constraints on three 
characteristics simultaneously is reduced to three, #27, #894 and #7,632. Then 
the client examines Income (the fourth analysis table). Not a single alternative 
has satisfied the constraints $150,000, and $100,000. After setting the con-
straint to $75,000, the alternative #7,632 is found that satisfies all constraints 
on four characteristics. Finally, the client reduces the constraint to $50,000. As 
a result, the total number of alternatives that satisfy constraints on four charac-
teristics is two, namely, #27 and #7,632 (see Figure 8.2). 
In the last analysis table (the “Education” characteristic), not a single al-
ternative satisfied the “Postgraduate” constraint. After setting the constraint to 
“Some College,” two feasible alternatives (matching partners) #27 and #7,632 
are obtained (shown with bold in the Figure 8.2). These alternatives satisfy 
all constraints on five characteristics. The values of characteristics of matching 
partners #27 and #7,632 also are given in Table 8.1. All constraints and match-
ing partners were determined in an interactive mode. 
In Figure 8.2, the areas of search for feasible alternatives are highlighted in 
tan (pseudo-criteria) and in light green (criteria) accordingly. Since our example 
is concerned with the construction of feasible solutions #27 and #7,632 only, 
some alternatives and their corresponding values of criteria have been replaced 
with “…” in the analysis table. 
8.3.1 
Conclusions of the Example
Constructing and studying analysis tables allowed the client to obtain two fea-
sible alternatives. After that the client may wish to determine the optimal alter-
native set with consideration of all or the most important criteria. For example, 
if the client had searched for the optimal solutions according to the criterion 

 
Adopting the PSI Method for Database Search 
       163                 
Income, the search engine would have given him alternative #7,632; alternative 
#27 would be better for the criterion Education. If two criteria, Income and 
Education, are considered simultaneously, the Pareto optimal solution set will 
contain the two specified solutions. 
However, according to Yahoo! Personals (http://personals.yahoo.com/), 
upon starting a search, the client should impose constraints on age and geo-
graphical area (see Figure 8.3). In our opinion, these recommendations are in-
correct, since the client can lose compromise solutions that are acceptable to 
him. These constraints should be defined in the process of studying the analysis 
tables; after finding the feasible alternatives (matching partners) in an interac-
tive mode, the remaining solutions will automatically become unfeasible. 
8.4 Summary
It is often the case that database search involves many contradictory criteria and 
many alternatives, and it is necessary to search for compromise solutions. This

can be efficiently accomplished by construction and analysis of the feasible so-
lution set. However, current search engines do not systematically construct the 
feasible solution set, thus “hiding” many potentially interesting solutions from 
the client. To address this problem, we introduced the DBS-PSI method, which 
allows the client to: 
1. Construct analysis tables.
2. Determine the feasible solution set in the process of dialogues with the 
computer.
3. Find the Pareto optimal set.
4. Identify the most preferable solution. 
The process of searching for the feasible solution set based on analysis 
tables is client-friendly: clients see what they lose and what they gain for every 
concession. The DBS-PSI method as a new paradigm of database search can be 
used in all areas of modern life and promises to increase efficiency of modern 
search engines. The relevancy of the proposed methodology is apparent given 
ongoing expansion of the World Wide Web and search engines.

Multicriteria Analysis of L1 Adaptive 
Flight Control System
9.1 Objective of the Research
Inner-loop adaptive flight control systems1 are seen as an appealing technology 
[1] to improve aircraft performance with reduced pilot compensation in adverse 
flight conditions or in the event of control surface failures and vehicle damage. 
Under these conditions, which are characterized by a high degree of uncertainty 
with respect to a nominal aircraft model, the achievable levels of performance 
and flying qualities (FQ) that a nonadaptive flight control system (FCS) can 
provide might be limited. However, in applications with stringent performance 
and robustness specifications [2], several limitations of conventional adap-
tive control architectures have been identified that render the design of these 
conventional adaptive controllers overly challenging. Among these limitations 
[2, 3], are of special relevance: (1) the lack of transient characterization of the 
closed-loop response, (2) the limited analysis framework for robustness and 
performance guarantees for closed-loop adaptive systems, and (3) the lack of 
systematic design guidelines to solve the trade-off between adaptation, perfor-
mance, and robustness.
The L1 adaptive control theory [4] appeared recently as a method for the 
design of robust adaptive control architectures using fast estimation schemes, 
with the potential to overcome the limitations mentioned above. The key fea-
ture of L1 adaptive control is the decoupling of adaptation and robustness. In 
fact, in L1 adaptive control architectures, the speed of adaptation is limited 
1. Chapter 9 is written in collaboration with Enrick Xargay (University of Illinois at Urbana-
Champaign) and Vladimir Dobrokhodov (Naval Postgraduate School).

only by the available hardware (computational power and high-frequency sen-
sor noise), while the trade-off between performance and robustness can be 
addressed via conventional methods from classical and robust control. Fast 
adaptation, which allows for the compensation of the undesirable effects of 
rapidly varying uncertainties and significant changes in system dynamics, is 
critical towards achieving guaranteed transient performance without enforcing 
persistency of excitation, applying gain scheduling of the control parameters, or 
resorting to control reconfiguration or high-gain feedback. Moreover, the sys-
tematic design procedures of the L1 adaptive control theory significantly reduce 
the tuning effort required to achieve a desired closed-loop performance, which 
translates into a reduction in both the design cycle time and the development 
costs. With these features, the L1 adaptive control architectures provide a suit-
able framework for the development of advanced flight critical systems.
In this chapter, we present the preliminary results of the application of 
the PSI method for the design optimization of the L1 flight control system 
implemented on the GTM AirSTAR [5, 6] aircraft’s current primary flight test 
vehicle, the GTM tail number T2. The T2 is a twin-engine jet-powered and 
dynamically-scaled (5.5%) civil transport aircraft, designed and instrumented 
to perform control law evaluation, experiment design and modeling research, 
in-flight failure emulation, and flight in upset conditions. The research control 
law developed for the NASA AirSTAR flight test vehicle has a primary objective 
of achieving tracking for a variety of tasks with guaranteed stability and robust-
ness in the presence of uncertain dynamics, such as changes due to rapidly 
varying flight conditions during standard maneuvers, and unexpected failures. 
Ideally, the flight control system should provide level 1 flying qualities under 
nominal as well as adverse flight conditions.
The L1 flight control system (L1 FCS) used for this application is a three-
axis angle of attack (α), roll rate (p), and sideslip angle (β) all-adaptive flight 
control system. The FCS consists of two decoupled L1 controllers, one for the 
longitudinal channel and another one for the control of the lateral-directional 
dynamics. On one hand, the longitudinal L1 controller is implemented as a 
single-input single-output controller and uses feedback in angle of attack and 
pitch rate to generate an elevator control signal in order to track angle of at-
tack reference signals; on the other hand, the lateral/directional L1 controller 
is a multiple-input multiple-output architecture and uses feedback in sideslip 
angle, roll rate, and yaw rate to generate aileron and rudder commands in order 
to track sideslip-angle and roll-rate reference signals with reduced coupling. In 
the current L1 FCS, the pilot directly adjusts the thrust level using the throttle 
lever. The reader is referred to [7–9] for a more detailed explanation of the L1 
FCS implemented on the NASA AirSTAR flight test vehicle.
The main challenge for the design of the L1 FCS is the optimal tuning 
of its elements to provide desired flying qualities with satisfactory robustness

margins. While the theory of L1 adaptive control provides partial systematic 
design guidelines to address the trade-off between performance and robust-
ness, the optimization of the design of the L1 adaptive controller is still largely 
open and hard to address. The main difficulty is the nonconvex and nonsmooth 
nature of the underlying optimization problem that involves the L1 norm of 
cascaded linear systems. Randomized algorithms have been proven to be useful 
in control-related nonconvex optimization problems, and therefore they appear 
as appealing methods for the optimal design of L1 adaptive controllers [4, 10].
The optimization design methodology proposed in this chapter unfolds in 
three sequential steps. First, we take advantage of the systematic design guide-
lines of the L1 adaptive control theory to find a nominal prototype solution 
satisfying a given set of control specifications. Then, taking the prototype solu-
tion as a reference design, the PSI method is used for the construction of the 
feasible solution set and for determining an initial direction of improvement for 
the design of the flight control system [11–13]. Finally, the PSI method is again 
used to determine an optimal design that satisfies performance and robustness 
constraints and improves the prototype design. In particular, this design meth-
odology demonstrates the suitability of the PSI method as a tool for formulat-
ing and solving multicriteria optimization problems for the design of adaptive 
FCS and also illustrates that the consistent application of the systematic design 
guidelines of L1 adaptive control becomes particularly beneficial for the con-
struction of the feasible solution set.
Following this approach, we next present preliminary results on the ap-
plication of the PSI method and the MOVI software [12] to the design opti-
mization of the L1 FCS for the NASA GTM. We notice that, although both 
the PSI and the software package MOVI were specially developed to address 
problems with design variable and the criteria spaces of high dimensionality, for 
the sake of clarity in the presentation and discussion of the results, we keep the 
design problem within a reasonable complexity, and the design procedure is ap-
plied to the design of the longitudinal channel only. Finally, we also notice that 
the results included in this study are obtained by the MOVI software package 
combined with the MATLAB environment and are based on the full nonlin-
ear simulation of the two-engine-powered, dynamically-scaled GTM AirSTAR 
system tail number T2, which was released by NASA in December 2009 [14].
The formulation of the design optimization of the L1 FCS of the NASA 
AirSTAR flight test vehicle is addressed in Section 9.2. In particular, this sec-
tion provides a detailed discussion of the workflow of the optimization process, 
including the identification of a nominal prototype design, the construction of 
the feasible solution set, and the improvement of the prototype. Finally, Sec-
tion 9.3 provides solution of the optimization problem and summarizes the key 
results and presents the main conclusions.

9.2 Prototype: Criteria and Design Variables
The design of the longitudinal L1 FCS is based on the linearized short-period 
dynamics of the GTM at the reference flight condition (80 kt, 1,000 ft). The L1 
FCS with its main elements and the design variables (DV) is represented in Fig-
ure 9.1 with a following corresponding explanation of the control architecture. 
The motivated choice of the DVs will be given in the following section. Since 
the airplane is level 1 FQ at this flight condition2, the desired dynamics of the 
state predictor are chosen to be close to those of the actual aircraft. 
For the nominal prototype design, the natural frequency of the poles of 
the system is reduced from 
rad
6 sec  to 
rad
5.5 sec , while the damping ratio is in-
creased from 0.47 to 0.85. A first-order lowpass filter with DC gain 1 and a 
bandwidth of 
rad
20 sec  was used in the matched contribution to the elevator 
command, while two cascaded first-order lowpass filters were used in the un-
matched channel, both having DC gain equal to 1 and bandwidths of 
rad
5 sec  
and 
rad
7 sec , respectively. Finally, the adaptation sampling time was set to 1
600 sec, 
which corresponds to the minimum integration step allowed in the AirSTAR 
flight control computer. A first-order prefilter with 
rad
20 sec  of bandwidth was 
added to shape the pilot command. This prototype design of the state predictor, 
2. This FQ rating is based on offset-landing tasks performed in the AirSTAR real-time simulator 
at NASA LARC in the absence of atmospheric turbulence.

the lowpass filters, the adaptation sampling rate, and the prefilter delivers the 
angle of attack α (AOA) response similar to the desired one; see Figure 9.2 
where αdes designates the desired angle-of-attack response.
It is worth noting here that this nominal design ensures a time-delay mar-
gin of the inner loop of approximately 85 ms and a gain margin of 7.2 dB, in 
wings-level flight at the flight condition of 80 knots and 1,000 ft. At this flight 
condition, the FQs are predicted to be level 1 and the FCS design has no pre-
dicted pilot induced oscillation (PIO) tendencies (for an acquisition time of 1.5 
seconds). Naturally, these metrics are the performance criteria, and their initial 
values provided above for the nominal design will serve as the guidelines for the 
motivated definition of the criteria constraints. 
We next present preliminary results of the application of the PSI method 
and the MOVI software to the design optimization of the L1 FCS for the NASA 
GTM airplane [11–13]. In particular, the objective of the optimization task 
is to minimize the difference between the desired and actual AOA responses, 
while ensuring satisfactory FQs and not overloading the elevator actuators. For 
this purpose, a number of criteria reflecting the differences were formulated. 
The corresponding discussion is presented in the following sections.
In what follows, we provide a description of the design variables alone 
with the performance and robustness metrics used for this study and obtain a 
prototype design that achieves desired flying qualities with satisfactory robust-
ness margins. Then we utilize the capability of the PSI method and the software 
package MOVI to improve the prototype design. 
9.2.1 
Design Variables
Next we define the set of design parameters of the flight control architecture 
considered for optimization. Since the primary objective is to improve the fly-
ing qualities of the prototype design while guaranteeing satisfactory robust-
ness margins, we include the natural frequency and the damping ratio of the 
poles of the state-predictor dynamics (which can speed up or slow down the 
response of the augmented aircraft), and the bandwidth of the lowpass filter in 
the matched channel (which can be used to adjust the time-delay margin of the 
inner loop) as optimization parameters; see Figure 9.1 illustrating their place in 
the L1 flight control architecture. In addition, we also consider the optimization 
of the bandwidth of the prefilter, which can be used to shape the pilot com-
mand as to prevent elevator rate limiting and avoid structural mode interaction. 
The following list summarizes the set of optimization parameters that define 
the design variable space: 
• DV1: Natural frequency of the state-predictor poles (rad/sec);
• DV2: Damping ratio of the state-predictor poles;

170 
The Parameter Space Investigation Method Toolkit 
• DV3: Bandwidth of the “matched” lowpass filter (rad/sec);
• DV4: Bandwidth of the pilot-command preﬁ lter (rad/sec).
Therefore, the design variable vector is DV  {DV1, DV2, DV3, DV4}. 
We notice that, consistent with the theory of L1 adaptive control, the adapta-
tion sampling time is set to match the minimum integration step allowed in 
the AirSTAR flight control computer, and therefore it is not included as an 
optimization parameter.
9.2.2 
List of Criteria and Pseudo-Criteria
The set of design criteria considered in this study is chosen to evaluate per-
formance and robustness properties of the GTM aircraft augmented with the 
L1 FCS. To provide an adequate assessment of the performance characteristics 
and flying qualities of the L1-augmented aircraft both pilot-off-the-loop and 
pilot-in-the-loop performance metrics are included in the design procedure. 
The metrics considered can thus be classified in three categories: 
1. Pilot-off-the-loop performance metrics;
2. Robustness metrics;
3. Flying qualities and PIO metrics.
Because the present material addresses only the design of the longitudinal 
channel of the L1 FCS, the set of metrics used in this study are mainly based on 
the (time-domain) longitudinal response of the GTM with the L1 FCS closing 
the inner loop. Further, we provide a detailed description of the specific metrics 
used for the design improvement of the adaptive control system. We note that 
some of the metrics used in this study were also proposed in [15] for the evalu-
ation of aircraft augmented with an adaptive FCS.
9.2.2.1 Pilot-off-the-Loop Performance Metrics
This first set of metrics evaluates the pilot-off-the-loop performance of the aug-
mented aircraft by characterizing its response to step inputs. In particular, the 
pilot-off-the-loop performance metrics are based on the time-domain response 
of the augmented aircraft to a step command of 3° held for 4 seconds in the 
AOA (see Figure 9.2), starting from a wings-level flight condition. The metrics 
capture the deviation of the actual response of the aircraft from a given desired 
response, which is defined to provide satisfactory flying qualities without reach-
ing the physical limits of the platform, as well as different measures of control 
activity, load factor, and cross-coupling.

       171                 
Next we provide a description of the metrics included in the study. First, 
however, we need to introduce some key notation to facilitate the definition 
of these metrics. Below, alone with the previously defined α (AOA) and αdes, 
the αcmd is the angle-of-attack pilot command; β is the angle of sideslip; βdes is 
the sideslip-angle desired response; p is the roll rate; pdes is the roll-rate desired 
response; Az is the vertical acceleration; δe is the elevator deflection command; 
and ( )

 is the L1 state predictor error.
Let t0 be the time instant at which the step command is applied, and de-
fine tf  as the final time instant considered for the performance evaluation (tf  
t0  4 seconds). With these notations, the metrics are defined as follows: 
• P1, ﬁ nal deviation: This metric captures the ﬁ nal deviation of the actual 
AOA response from the desired AOA response at 4 seconds after the 
application of the step command. This metric is set to zero if the actual 
response reaches the AOA reference command before the end of the 
4-second step:

mand (3°).
• P2, maximum deviation from desired AOA response: This metric captures 
the maximum deviation (in absolute value) of the actual AOA response 
from the desired AOA response:

normalized AOA responses.
The metrics P1 to P6 provide a good first characterization of the transient 
response of the augmented aircraft when compared to a given desired response. 
Next, we present a set of metrics that can be extracted from the same step 
response experiment utilizing different flight dynamics characteristics which 
complement the AOA-based metrics defined above.

a desired control objective. It is important to note, however, that a high 
control effort might just be the result of a faster AOA response, and 
therefore a large P8 might not always be an undesirable response char-
acteristic.

• P12, maximum deviation in cross-coupling dynamics: This metric cap-

We notice that this metric, which can also be normalized to the am-
plitude of the step command (3°), provides valuable information for the 
design of the lateral-directional FCS, rather than the longitudinal FCS. 
In fact, for the design of the longitudinal L1 FCS, this metric provides 
little information and it would be more convenient to analyze the cou-
pling in the AOA response induced by a command either in roll rate or 
sideslip angle. The analysis of the response of the system to commands 
in the lateral-directional channel and the design of the lateral-directional 
L1 FCS are left (deliberately) for future work.

only to illustrate a set of additional metrics that can be derived from the 
response of the augmented aircraft to a command in the longitudinal 
channel.
9.2.2.2 Robustness Margins
In this preliminary study, the only robustness metric considered for optimiza-
tion is the time-delay margin of the closed-loop adaptive system defined at the 
input of the aircraft (time delay inserted at the elevator deflection command), 
and it is also derived from the time-domain response of the augmented aircraft. 
For a given wings-level flight condition and with the pilot-off-the-loop, a small 
perturbation in the trim (initial) condition is introduced. The time-delay mar-
gin is determined as the minimum time delay that produces sustained oscilla-
tions in the AOA response as the L1 FCS tries to stabilize the aircraft at the given 
trim condition. In this chapter, this robustness metric will be denoted by R1.
We notice that the time delay introduced in the elevator control channel 
is in addition to any time delay that is already modeled in the AirSTAR simula-
tion environment, which amounts approximately to 25 ms. 
9.2.3 
Criteria Addressing FQ and PIO Characteristics
Finally, predictions for both flying qualities and PIO tendencies have also been 
included in order to complement the pilot-off-the-loop performance metrics 
presented above. For this study, we consider the time-domain Neal-Smith 
(TDNS) flying qualities and PIO criteria, which were specifically developed 
for nonlinear aircraft dynamics and nonlinear FCS. The TDNS criterion is the 
counterpart in the time domain of the frequency-domain Neal-Smith criterion, 
and it is based on a step-tracking task with different acquisition-time require-
ments. For a detailed description of this criterion, the reader is referred to [16]. 
The reader can also find in [17] a study on the prediction of flying qualities and 
adverse pilot interactions in the GTM augmented with the L1 FCS.

176 
The Parameter Space Investigation Method Toolkit 
We use four different metrics, extracting all of them from the TDNS cri-
terion for an acquisition time of 1.5 seconds, to characterize the FQ and PIO 
tendencies of the augmented aircraft: 
• FQ1, tracking performance: In the TDNS criterion, the root-mean-
squared tracking error is used to evaluate the closed-loop performance 
with the pilot in the loop. A value of zero means that the pilot is able to 
perfectly track (with zero error) the reference command after the speci-
ﬁ ed acquisition time.
• FQ2, pilot workload: In the TDNS criterion, the pilot workload is given 
by the pilot compensation phase angle (in degrees), which is derived 
from the optimal pilot model obtained from the criterion. A value of 
zero means that there is no need for either pilot lead compensation or 
lag compensation.
• FQ3, FQ level: The two metrics FQ1 and FQ2 are used to determine 
the predicted FQ level based on the FQ boundaries proposed in the 
criterion. FQ3 is a discrete metric, and it only admits the values 1, 2, 
and 3, which correspond to level 1, level 2, and level 3 flying qualities, 
respectively.
• FQ4, PIO tendency: The TDNS criterion also provides a prediction for 
the susceptibility of the augmented aircraft to PIO. This PIO-suscepti-
bility metric is used to complement the ﬂ ying qualities metrics discussed 
above. According to the TDNS criterion, a value above 100 implies that 
the augmented aircraft is PIO-prone, whereas a value below 100 indi-
cates a PIO-immune conﬁ guration.
The set of FQ metrics is used at the second step when improving a proto-
type design of the longitudinal channel of the L1 FCS. For the first step of the 
prototype design and the exploration of the feasible set, only a subset of these 
metrics is utilized. The full set of metrics is used in the last stage to optimize the 
design of the adaptive control system.
Based on the objectives of the task and previous flight control design ex-
pertise the following vectors of criteria {P1, P2 , P3 , P4 , P5 , P6 , FQ1, FQ2, 
FQ3, FQ4, R1 } and pseudo-criteria {P7, P8, P9, P10, P11, P12, P13} were 
defined. 
9.2.4 
Criteria Constraints
Based on the metrics defined, the final design of the L1 FCS should ideally 
verify the set of control objectives at the reference flight condition of 80 knots

of (equivalent) airspeed and 1,000 ft of altitude. Corresponding to this flight 
conditions a set of three criteria constraints were defined a priori:

The first and second conditions address directly the control specifications, 
namely, the final value of the step response within 10% of the desired, and the 
predicted level 1 FQ. The third inequality imposes a 20% constraint on the 
overshoot in the step response, establishing thus a (loose) bound on the accept-
able transient performance characteristics of the actual AOA response. Due to 
the significant difficulty of defining all criteria constraints consistent with the 
feasibility of the solution, the rest of the constraints were identified interactively 
while analyzing the test tables.
9.3 Solutions and Analysis
At this point the design optimization task and the nominal prototype solu-
tion were completely defined. This section presents last two steps of iterative 
application of the PSI method to the design improvement of the longitudinal 
channel of the L1 FCS. It is critical to mention that the objective of the first 
iteration is achieved utilizing a limited number of criteria consistent with the 
control metrics used by the L1 synthesis procedure. Numerical implementation 
of this first step is relatively efficient with the “computational price” of one so-
lution measured in minutes. At the second step, while utilizing an extended set 
of criteria involving complex numerical procedures, the efficiency of numerical 
implementation becomes critical; the “computational price” of one solution at 
this step is measured in tenth of minutes.
9.3.1 
First Iteration
For the purpose of constructing the feasible solution set, we consider the fol-
lowing initial intervals of design variables, which have been defined to include 
the initial prototype vector (see Table 9.1). 
This first step is used to find an initial direction of improvement for the 
design of the adaptive FCS. More precisely, we aim here at determining tight 
intervals for the design variables characterizing the state predictor (DV1 and 
DV2) that would provide level 1 FQ and would not deviate significantly from 
the desired response defined previously. To this end, the design is to be mini-
mized with respect to the following reduced number of criteria {P1, P2, P3, P4, 
P5, P6, FQ1, FQ2}, which is a subset of the metrics described earlier. 
The robustness metric R1 and the PIO metric FQ4 are not included 
in this first step because their evaluation is computationally expensive; these 

178 
The Parameter Space Investigation Method Toolkit 
metrics will be considered in the next step of the optimization process when the 
domain of the design variables becomes significantly refined. 
The metrics P7 through P10 are not included in the set of criteria to be 
minimized because improved flying qualities may require “high” values of these 
metrics. Nevertheless, including these metrics in the optimization process as 
pseudo-criteria may provide useful information regarding the dynamics of the 
augmented aircraft. They also provide additional performance characteristics of 
the set of Pareto optimal solutions. In particular, we note that the metric P9, 
which is subject to “soft” control specifications, is included as a pseudo-criteri-
on (see [11, 13] for a detailed justification of this choice). Similarly, the metric 
P11, which can be used to monitor the correct operation of the L1 adaptive con-
troller, does not need to be minimized as long as it remains a couple of orders 
of magnitude below the system state (truncated) L norm. Finally, as explained 
previously, the metrics P12 and P13 are included for the sake of completeness 
and should be considered only for the design of the lateral-directional control 
system. Therefore, they are not included as criteria in the current task.
Next we present the results obtained in this first iteration of the optimiza-
tion process, which are based on 1,024 tests [11–13]. Out of these 1,024 tests, 
427 vectors did not satisfy the a priori given criteria constraints. The solutions 
that did not satisfy the constraints entered the table of criteria failures [12]. 
In particular, 160 design variable vectors failed the 20% overshoot criterion 
constraint on P4, and 267 constraints failed the level 1 FQ criterion constraint 
FQ3, while the 10% overshoot constraint on P1 was not effective, therefore not 
rejecting any solutions. Analysis of the design variable vectors contained in the 
table of criteria failures indicates that: (1) solutions characterized by low natural 
frequencies and high damping ratios of the state-predictor poles (DV1  5 and 
0.95 < DV2) fail the level 1 FQ criterion constraint FQ3; and (2) solutions 
with very high natural frequencies of the state-predictor poles (7.6  DV1) or 
solutions with high natural frequencies and low damping ratios of the state-
predictor poles (7  DV1  7.6 and DV2  0.6) fail the overshoot criterion con-
straint P4. The first set of design variable vectors leads to slow responses of the

augmented aircraft to pilot commands, which require moderate or considerable 
pilot compensation and thus result in a predicted level 2 FQ that is inadmis-
sible. The second set corresponds to the solutions providing fast responses to 
step commands with big overshoots, which differ significantly from the desired 
response for the augmented aircraft. 
The remaining 597 vectors that did satisfy a priori given criteria con-
straints were used to construct the test table. While tightening the criteria con-
straints in the test table, the following criteria constraints were formulated (see 
Table 9.2). Note that while analyzing the test table, the constraint of P4 was 
significantly tightened to the value of 1.02. It is also worth mentioning that the 
response on criteria P1 is not presented in the table because all solutions of the 
test table provided identical response, P1  0.
Only 20 solutions were found to be feasible according to these criteria 
constraints, all of them contributing to the Pareto optimal solutions. A frag-
ment of the criteria table is given in Table 9.3. 
Analysis of the criteria table shows that solution #993 is the most prefer-
able one. This solution is equivalent to others with respect to criterion P4; it 
is superior to others over a set of five criteria {P2, P3, P6, FQ1, FQ2} and is 
weaker than the prototype only with respect to the criterion P5. Furthermore, 
the remaining 19 solutions are better than the prototype with respect to four 
criteria {P2, P3, FQ1, FQ2}. However, none of the solutions are more superior 
than the prototype with respect to criterion P5. In particular, this observation 
implies that if the prototype design vector was sampled by the system, then it 
would belong to the Pareto set. 
The analysis of the histograms demonstrates the filtering effect of the 
criteria constraints (see Figure 9.3). The feasible solutions for the design vari-
ables DV1 and DV2 are located in the middle of the interval, with no feasible 
solutions in the left and right ends of the intervals, and slightly shifted from the 
prototype design (marked with a yellow triangle ▽). These histograms clearly 
identify feasible intervals for the design variables DV1 and DV2 characterizing

design variables DV3 and DV4 are located at the right boundaries of the inter-
vals. These observations will be used in the next step of the optimization process 
to modify the initial intervals in the direction of higher density of feasible solu-
tions to improve richness of the feasible solution set.
It is also important to analyze the influence of the design variables on 
criteria and pseudo-criteria and to evaluate the degree of improvement (or

degradation) of the Pareto optimal solutions with respect to the prototype de-
sign. Figures 9.4 to 9.8 show some of these dependencies, which provide valu-
able insight into the effect of the design variables on the augmented aircraft 
dynamics. Preliminary conclusions that can be drawn from this analysis are 
detailed next.
Figure 9.4 shows a typical dependency of criteria P2 (P3 and P6 have 
the same trend) on the design variable DV1. First, we notice that there are no 
feasible solutions in the range 4  DV1  4.6, which indicates that such design 
variable vectors did not satisfy the constraints. Second, it can be seen that the 
deviations of the actual response (P2, P3, and P6) of the augmented aircraft 
from the desired model become large for big values of the design variable DV1. 
Third, all three dependencies show that the set of Pareto optimal solutions, 
when compared to the prototype design, provide step responses with reduced 
deviations in terms of both (truncated) L and L2 norms. The rate deviations 
for the Pareto optimal solutions are, however, larger than the rate deviations for 
the prototype design. 
Figure 9.5 presents the dependencies of the flying qualities criteria FQ2 
(FQ1 has the same trend) on the design variable DV1, which indicate that faster 
responses of the augmented aircraft (large DV1) result in improved (predicted) 
flying qualities. This trend is particularly evident in Figure 9.5, in which the 
reduced pilot (lead) compensation is limited to large values of the design vari-
able DV1. Also, when compared to the prototype design, the set of optimal 
solutions improve the criterion FQ1 by 20% to 50%, and the criterion FQ2 by 
15% to 30%.
As expected, a faster response of the augmented aircraft (large DV1) leads 
to an increase in the control effort (pseudo-criteria P8), as well as an increase 
in both the maximum elevator rate and the maximum elevator acceleration 
(pseudo-criteria P9 and P10).

Figure 9.6 illustrates the dependencies of criteria FQ1 on the design vari-
able DV2. (FQ2 has the same trend.) While the dependency of FQ2 on DV2 is 
not obvious, small values of DV2 seem to limit the achievable tracking perfor-
mance with the pilot in the loop (FQ1). This would imply that the augmented 
aircraft with low-damping characteristics result in degraded (predicted) flying 
qualities.
Finally, the dependencies of pseudo-criteria P9 and P10 on the design vari-
able DV4 show that the Pareto optimal solutions are located along a “straight” 
line with positive slope where high values of the criteria correspond to high 
values of the design variable DV4. This implies that the bandwidth of the com-
mand prefilter in the L1 FCS (DV4) can be set to limit the maximum elevator 
rate and the maximum elevator acceleration of the Pareto optimal solutions.
Dependencies between criteria provide useful information about the so-
lutions in the Pareto set and the trade-offs between criteria. The analysis of 
trade-offs becomes especially helpful in the final stages of the optimization pro-
cess, when a decision about the most preferable solution has to be made. These

The Parameter Space Investigation Method Toolkit 
dependencies are useful to explore the trade-offs in the design of the controller 
and to identify directions in the design variable space that may lead to improved 
L1 FCS design over the prototype design. 
Next we present and discuss a set of results showing dependencies be-
tween criteria illustrating these trade-offs and determining possible directions 
of improvement of the prototype solution: 
Figure 9.7 shows the dependency between P2 and P3 (maximum and in-
tegral deviations from the desired response) as well as the localization of the Pa-
reto optimal solutions with respect to the prototype design in the P2-P3 plane. 
It can be seen that the solutions of the Pareto set are located on a “straight” line 
passing through the prototype design, and all of them improve the prototype in 
terms of the metrics P2 and P3.
Figure 9.8 shows the location of the prototype as well as the Pareto op-
timal solutions in the FQ plane of the TDNS criteria, thus characterizing the 
(predicted) flying qualities of the solutions. The improvement with respect to 
the prototype design in terms of predicted FQ is evident in this FQ2-FQ1

graph. Also, the boundary for level 1 FQ of the TDNS criterion can be easily 
recognized in this figure (see [16]).
Finally, Figure 9.9 shows the dependency between the FQ criterion FQ2 
and the control effort P8. This figure shows that reduced pilot (lead) compensa-
tion is only possible for increased control effort. In fact, all of the solutions in 
the Pareto set present higher control efforts than the prototype solution.
The analysis of the obtained solutions allows us to define the direction 
of further search. In particular, the results have provided tight intervals for the 
design variables DV1 and DV2 characterizing the state-predictor dynamics, and 
have exposed the necessity of extending the initial intervals of initial intervals 
of variation of the design variables DV3 and DV4. It is worth emphasizing that 
this significant improvement of the prototype solution has been achieved utiliz-
ing a reduced number of criteria, {P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, FQ1, FQ2}. Based on 
these results and the conclusions drawn from them, a new experiment is carried 
out to: (1) improve the feasible solution set, and (2) determine an optimal solu-
tion of the L1 FCS design that improves the prototype with respect to extended 
set of criteria {P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, FQ1, FQ2, FQ4, R1}.
9.3.2 
Second Iteration
The improvement of the feasible solution set is based on the analysis of the 
histograms in Figure 9.3 and Table 9.3. The analysis of the histograms results in 
adjusting the initial problem statement by changing the intervals of variation of 
the design variables and is given in Table 9.4.  
The criteria constraints remain unchanged, whereas the design is now to 
be optimized with respect to the following new set of criteria {P2, P3, P4, P5, 
P6, FQ1, FQ2, FQ4, R1}. All these criteria are to be minimized except for R1, 
which is to be maximized. 
Next we present the results obtained in this second iteration of the optimi-
zation process, which are based on 512 tests. As mentioned previously, adding

criteria R1 and FQ4 in the optimization process results in a significant increase 
in the computational time. Approximately 124 vectors satisfied previously as-
signed criteria constraints (see Table 9.2). All these solutions are Pareto optimal. 
As might be expected, the coefficient of selection efficiency γ increased by more 
than 12 times. The histograms in the second iteration have better distributions 
(higher concentration) of the feasible solutions than in the first iteration. The 
top of Figure 9.10 represents the distribution of 124 solutions for DV1. 
After the analysis of the test table, stronger criteria and pseudo-criteria 
constraints were considered as presented in Table 9.5. According to these new 
constraints, only six solutions were found to be feasible, and all of them are

Pareto optimal. The values of design variables and criteria of the Pareto optimal 
solutions are given in Tables 9.6 and 9.7. The new distribution of the feasible 
solutions for these criteria and pseudo-criteria constraints is significantly tighter 
as expected and is shown in the bottom of Figure 9.10. These new histograms 
clearly identify tight intervals for all of the design variables in which the optimal 
solutions lie. 
Furthermore, from the analysis of Table 9.6, it follows that all solutions of 
second iteration as well as the #993 from the first iteration belong to the very 
tight intervals of the first and second design variables. The first three parameters 
(DV1–DV3) of #993 and #106 are almost identical. Observe that #993, while 
providing good response of many criteria, does not satisfy new constraints on 
criteria P9 and P10 (the elevator workload). Moreover, the analysis of the #993 
also shows that it fails to satisfy constraint of the flying qualities criteria FQ3.
The analysis of test tables, dependencies of criteria on design variables, 
and dependencies between criteria allows us to determine the most preferable 
solutions. In particular, Figure 9.11 shows the influence of the bandwidth of 
the “matched” lowpass filter (DV3) on the (pilot-off-the-loop) trade-off be-
tween performance criterion P2 (P3 shows the same trend) and robustness (R1) 
of the augmented aircraft. From this observation we can conclude that criteria 
P2 (P3) and R1 are contradictory with respect to the design variable DV3. This 
means that improvement of the tracking performance requires an increase in 
the bandwidth of the lowpass filter, which in turn results in degradation of the 
time delay margin of the augmented aircraft, as predicted by theory.
Figure 9.12 shows the dependencies of the flying qualities criterion FQ1 
(FQ2 shows a similar trend) on the design variable DV2. While in the first PSI 
iteration the dependency of the criterion FQ2 on the design variable DV2 was 
not obvious, now it becomes more apparent that a smaller damping ratio seems 
to result in reduced (lead) pilot compensation.

Dependency between P2 and P3 is analogous to those obtained in first 
iteration; therefore, the corresponding figure is not presented. All of the Pareto 
optimal solutions improve the prototype design in terms of peak and integral 
deviations from the desired response.
The dependency of flying qualities criteria FQ1 and FQ2 obtained in this 
iteration is also similar to those obtained in the first iteration, thus demonstrating

significant improvement of predicted flying qualities over the prototype design 
but now in the extended criteria space.
Finally, Figure 9.13 shows the dependency between criteria P3 and R1, 
which illustrates the trade-off between performance and robustness of the 
closed-loop adaptive system with the pilot-off-the-loop. While all of the opti-
mal solutions reduce the deviations from the desired response with respect to 
the prototype design, only three of these solutions exhibit a better time-delay 
margin than the prototype design (#202, #462), and two exhibit a similar mar-
gin (#106, #318)3.
As a result of the iterative two-step correction of initial constraints, the 
six Pareto optimal solutions have been found. Analyzing the criteria table shows 
that there are no solutions better than the prototype by all criteria simultane-
ously. This analysis revealed that four solutions, #106, #202, #358, and #462, 
surpassed the prototype by six criteria simultaneously.
Although all six solutions are practically equivalent, some advantage is 
given to the design vector #202 since it provides a better trade-off between 
the (predicted) flying qualities (FQ1, FQ2) and the time-delay margin (R1), 
while minimizing the difference with the desired response (see Figure 9.14). 
The comparative analysis of the AOA and the elevator workload demonstrates 
that the optimal solution provides faster response (rise time) to the commanded 
AOA command while minimally increasing the elevator workload that is natu-
rally expected. 
3. Notice that for the determination of the time-delay margin, metric R1, we insert incremental 
time delays of 5 ms in the elevator command channel. This choice was made for consis-
tency with the determination of the time-delay margin in the AirSTAR real-time simulator 
at NASA LARC. As a consequence, however, we cannot identify the time-delay margin with 
higher accuracy.

Conclusion
The construction of the feasible solutions of the L1 adaptive controller satis-
fying the desired performance and robustness specifications is a critical step 
for the optimal design of the L1 FCS. In particular, the eigenstructure of the 
state-predictor state matrix and the bandwidth of the lowpass filters are the 
key elements that characterize the performance of the L1 FCS. To optimize 
the design of these elements, a 16-criteria problem of improving a prototype 
solution was formulated and solved. The results presented demonstrate the ap-
plication of PSI method to the multicriteria design optimization of the L1 FCS 
implemented on the GTM AirSTAR aircraft. The study has addressed both 
the construction of the feasible solution set and the improvement of a nominal 
prototype design initially synthesized by the L1 theory. 
On one hand, the results have demonstrated that the consistent applica-
tion of the systematic design guidelines of L1 adaptive control becomes particu-
larly beneficial for the construction of the feasible solution set. Moreover, the 
results of this study are consistent with the theoretical claims of the theory of L1 
adaptive control in terms of robustness and performance. On the other hand, 
the developed procedure and the obtained results confirm the suitability of the 
PSI method and the MOVI software package for the multicriteria optimization 
of an adaptive FCS subject to desired control specifications.
The optimal design of the L1 FCS significantly improved understanding 
of the design trade-offs between adaptation and robustness. Finally, the design 
guidelines learned during the interaction with GTM model utilizing MOVI 
software contributed to the successful flight verification and validation of the 
designed all-adaptive control law at NASA LARC.

Conclusions
All real-life optimization problems, such as the design, identification, design of 
controlled systems, and operational development of prototypes, are essentially 
multicriteria. Constraints on the design variables, functional dependences, and 
criteria determine the feasible solution set. This set is the domain where one 
should be looking for the optimal solutions.
A statement of real-life optimization problem primarily involves justifica-
tion of the feasible set. It is usually assumed that the statement of the optimiza-
tion problem is the prerogative and skill of the expert. However, there are few 
who understand that the expert is practically unable to define the feasible set in 
the best way. The skill of the expert is a necessary, but by no means sufficient 
condition for the correct statement of the real-life problem. Since criteria are 
contradictory, the definition of the feasible solution set represents significant, 
sometimes insurmountable, difficulties. As a result, the expert solves the incor-
rectly stated optimization problem. If the problem has not been stated correctly, 
the application of optimization methods, however good they may be, is often 
ineffective. This situation is common today when solving real-life problems. 
Unfortunately, the expert will not be able to find the instructions on how to 
correctly determine the feasible solution set, and hence to state the optimization 
problem. All the numerous works devoted to real-life optimization discuss how 
to solve the problem but not how to state it correctly.
In order to construct the feasible solution set, a method called the param-
eter space investigation (PSI) has been created and successfully integrated into 
various fields of industry, science, and technology. 
On the basis of the PSI method and MOVI software, we have: (1) dem-
onstrated how to help an expert state and solve optimization problems and thus 
answered the fundamental question of where to search for optimal solutions; 
(2) explained the necessity of multicriteria analysis for constructing a feasible

solution set; (3) shown tools for multicriteria analysis; and (4) presented the 
statement and solution of real-life optimization problems.
The correct determination of the feasible solution set is a major challenge 
in real-life optimization problems. Multicriteria analysis of the feasible solution 
set always provides the valuable information for decision-making. This analysis 
demonstrates the work of all constraints; the cost of making concessions in vari-
ous constraints (i.e., what are the losses and the gains, expediency of modifica-
tion of constraints, and resources for improving the object in all criteria). 
The definition of the feasible solution set on the basis of the PSI method/
MOVI software has, for the first time, allowed the correct statement and solu-
tion of real-life problems.

Analytical Approach 
If two functions 1(α) and 2(α) are differentiable, then one can try to find 
the locus of contact of level surfaces 1(α)  b1 and 2(α)  b2 , see [1, 2]. In

If a segment of this curve, on which λ  0, belongs to the feasible set Dα, 
then it belongs to the Pareto optimal set Eα as well. For example, Figure A.1, 
which corresponds to Example A.1, shows arc AA, which consists of Pareto 
optimal points, and arc AA, which consists of points of contact, which are not 
Pareto optimal, although both arcs are described by the same equation:

these criteria need to be minimized.
Absolute minimums of the functions 1 and 2 are reached, respectively, 
at points (0, 0) and (−1, 1), which belong to Dα. Therefore, line Eα should 
link these points up. The above-mentioned analytical procedure gives a segment 
AA' of the hyperbola a2  4α1 (3α1  1)1 shown in Figure A.2(a).
Part of Dα, located to the right of the line AAA maps to the curvilinear 
figure BBBBBRat the criteria plane, while part of Dα located to the left of 
line AAA maps to BBBBL. Therefore, points located in the middle of DΦ 
have two prototypes in Dα. Line BBis the compromise curve [Figure A.2(b)].
The results of this problem’s calculation are shown in Figures A.3 and A.4. 
Figure A.3 shows the exact compromise curve 2  u(1) and the approximate 
line 2  uN(1). For N  511, exact and approximate curves coincide within 
0.01. Figure A.4 shows all trial points in Dα and in DΦ. Notice the increased 
density of these points in the middle part of DΦ.

In this problem set Dα is represented by square  with a strip-shaped cut-
out (Figure A.5). Set Eα consists of two segments AA1 and AA of the hyperbola 
α2  -α1(3α1  4)1, segment A3A4 of the border line α1  0.5, and segment 
A1A5 of the border line α2  α1  0.25. Figure A.5 also shows set DΦ on the 
criteria plane. However, those parts of DΦ that consist of points that have two 
prototypes in Dα are much smaller here than in Example A.1.
The exact compromise curve is also shown in Figure A.6. Figure A.7 shows 
trial points in DΦ. Results obtained for N  63 are not sufficient to conclude 
that set DΦ consists of two separate parts; however, results for N  255 make 
that certain. Here q is number of points that satisfy the functional constraint 
α2  α1  0.375  0.125. 
The computation above was performed using the LPτ generator. Below we 
also show Example A.2 for  64, 256, 512, and 1,024 trials1 (Figures A.8 through 
A.11) performed using a random number generator. In these figures the Pareto 
optimal set is marked in red in the criteria space.

Set Eα consists of two segments AA1A5 and A2A3A4, while set EΦ consists of segments BB1B5 
and B2B3B4.
