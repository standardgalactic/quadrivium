Introduction
B
iometric technology is a HOT topic. The most recent (ISC)2 Global 
Workforce Survey of over 7,500 security professionals from around 
the world have cited biometrics as the number one security project for 
organizations in North America, and the number two security project in the 
world overall.
Most companies aren’t using any form of biometrics yet, but many are look-
ing into biometrics now. Security regulation, negative publicity about secu-
rity breaches, and the desire to avoid being the next security-breach scandal 
are prompting many organizations to take a first serious look at biometrics.
About This Book
Our objective for this book is simple: to help you become familiar with bio-
metrics in a hurry by giving you all the information you need to be able to 
start looking at biometric solutions. Biometrics For Dummies will help you to 
be a smart shopper and know what you are looking for — and what to avoid.
This book isn’t the encyclopedia of biometrics. You don’t need that right 
now. Given the broad base of information you need, this book is the best way 
to jump-start your own knowledge, which will help you and your company 
become critical, informed customers. You’ll learn what biometrics are all 
about, all the general categories of biometrics (plus a few of the oddities), 
and everything you need to know to get started with an evaluation and even-
tual implementation of biometrics.
As a technology professional or a business manager, you’ll find that biomet-
rics are a bit tricky, especially with respect to privacy and legal issues, but 
not really all that hard to learn. Learning about biometrics isn’t any more 
difficult than learning any new hobby or skill. And as you proceed down the 
road to evaluating, selecting, and using biometrics, you and your organiza-
tion will be far better off for all the insight this book imparts. You’ll probably 
get some kudos for helping your organization successfully embrace and use 
biometrics. We have confidence in you!

Biometrics For Dummies 
Foolish Assumptions
We make two broad presumptions when we wrote this book:
 
 You understand your business. You know what your business’s prod-
ucts and services are, and how it develops, sells, and supports them. 
You don’t need to understand every minute detail, but just have a good 
overall view of what your business is in the business of doing.
 
 You understand technology. We aren’t saying you’re a rocket sur-
geonist (say what?), but we figure you know the basics of how comput-
ers, networks, and applications work — and what’s going on when you 
type in your user ID and password or swipe your card when you enter 
the building.
Conventions Used in This Book
This isn’t a book about computer programming or acupuncture, so we’ve 
spared you a lot of tricky diagrams and lines of computer code. We’ve writ-
ten Biometrics For Dummies in plain English, and that’s about all you need to 
know! (Okay, we have used one convention: We’ve italicized jargon-y terms 
as a heads-up to you that the jargon-y term’s definition — as it pertains to 
biometrics — is nearby.)
What You Don’t Have to Read
If your organization already has a biometrics system and you need to know 
more about how it works, then you can probably skip the chapters on 
selection and implementation, unless you’d like some insight into how the 
decision-making process probably went in your company.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is organized in four parts. Although the chapters don’t necessarily

cal progression that an organization would follow as it explores its security 
issues and proceeds down the road to Biometric City.

 Introduction
Part I: Getting Started with Biometrics
In Part I, we first introduce biometrics and give you some sweeping over-
views on how biometrics help to protect organization assets. We also discuss 
the impact that biometrics are having on data security and privacy laws, as 
well as professional ethics. The chapters in this part give you a solid busi-
ness background on what biometric technology is all about — and the impact 
it’s having on business and society.
Part II: Types of Biometrics
Part II explains all the types of biometrics that are in use today, as well as 
some that are still up and coming. The chapters in this part are organized by 
the type of biometrics: fingerprint and hand, signature, ocular and facial, and 
other types.
If you’ve already settled on a type of biometrics that will work in your organi-
zation, we still suggest you read all the chapters in this section. Even if 
your educated guess was right, learning more about the other types of bio-
metrics will give you keen insight and will help open your mind to consider 
alternatives.
Part III: Implementing 
and Using Biometrics
Selecting biometrics is only half the fun; once you’ve made an educated 
and informed decision on a biometrics solution, you’ve got to make it work. 
We’ve poured our decades of technology-implementation and management 
expertise into the chapters in this part to help you avoid pitfalls we discov-
ered long ago. Digging yourself into a hole is no fun, especially when others 
are looking. But rather than giving you a shovel to make the hole, or even the 
ladder to climb out of it, we provide a map to help you sidestep it altogether.
In this part, we also discuss how to protect your biometrics system from 
harm. Biometric technology itself needs to be protected, so it can perform 
properly and protect your company’s assets. Finally, we discuss where we 
think biometric technology is going in the future. This will help jump-start 
you on some of the conventional — and not-so-conventional — wisdom in the 
biometrics industry and practices.

Part IV: The Part of Tens
No For Dummies book is complete without a Part of Tens. And the Part of 
Tens chapters in Biometrics For Dummies are really special. You won’t find 
lists of Web sites here; instead, you’ll marvel, be entertained, and wind up 
informed. And you’ll probably go back and give the Part of Tens a second 
look in the other For Dummies books on your bookshelf. It’s really that good!
Part V: Appendixes
This part contains a great consumer guide comparing all the biometric 
technologies discussed in this book and an appendix that covers physical 
security for IT pros who have spent most of their careers paying attention to 
computers. Just before the index is a short listing of biometric and informa-
tion security terms. We’ve included this glossary in the book so you can refer 
to it often and easily whenever some wily biometric term escapes you.

ere’s our “nickel tour” of biometrics — well, okay, that’d be a dollar or 
two in today’s money — back in the day, a nickel tour meant you got 
a pretty good overall look at something in a short time. This chapter is like 
that. If you’re going into a meeting about biometrics in thirty minutes, and 
you don’t want to appear clueless about it, this chapter will show you all the 
basics you need. But if you’re standing in the bookstore looking for more of 
a clue, you’re much better off buying the book and taking it home where you 
can drill deeper into the topics you’re really interested in.
What Biometrics Are and 
Who’s Using Them
The term biometrics comes from the ancient Greek bios = “life” and 
metron = “measure.” Biometrics refers to the entire class of technologies and 
techniques to uniquely identify humans. Though biometric technology has 
various uses, its primary purpose is to provide a more secure alternative to 
the traditional access-control systems used to protect personal or corporate 
assets. Many of the problems that biometrics help to solve are the weak-
nesses found in present access-control systems — specifically these:
 
 Weak passwords: Computer users are notoriously apt to use poor, 
easily guessed passwords, resulting in break-ins where intruders can 
guess another user’s credentials and gain unauthorized access to a com-
puter system. This could lead to a security breach where personal or 
business secrets are stolen by an outsider. If your password is currently 
password, 123456, abc123, letmein, or qwerty, please stop reading this 

10
Part I: Getting Started with Biometrics 
book long enough to change it — to the first character of each word in 
your favorite passage from Moby Dick. We’ll wait.
 
 Shared credentials: In both small and large organizations, we often hear 
of cases like this: A computer user shares his or her password with a 
colleague who requires access — even though, in most organizations 
(and in many security-related laws and regulations), this is forbidden by 
policy. People by nature are willing to help a colleague in need, though, 
even if it means violating policy to achieve a greater purpose.
 
 Lost key cards: Many times in our careers we have both found lost key 
cards in parking lots and other places. Often they have the name of the 
organization on them, so it’s like finding a key with an address on it, per-
mitting the person who found it a free after-hours tour of some American 
corporation.
Biometrics can solve all these problems by requiring an additional credential — 
something associated with the person’s own body — before granting access 
to a building, computer room, or computer system. An access-control system 
that utilizes biometrics will include an electronic device that measures some 
specific aspect of a person’s body or behavior that positively identifies that 
person. The device might be a fingerprint reader, a digital camera to get a 
good look at an iris, or a signature pad. (We discuss all the common types of 
biometrics in the next section.)
Biometric technology as a means of protecting assets has been around for 
quite a while in some fields. Military, intelligence, and law enforcement orga-
nizations have been using biometrics to enhance physical and logical access 
controls for decades.
But in the past several years, there has been an uptick in the use of biomet-
rics to protect high-value assets. Internet data centers (the kind that lease 
rack space and cage space to companies that prefer not to build their own 
fortresses) often use biometrics for admitting personnel to the data-center 
floor. Fingerprint-biometric devices are showing up everywhere — even built 
in to laptops, PDAs, and USB drives. Facial recognition is available on a few 
laptop models. And for protecting businesses and residences, fingerprint-
biometric door-lock sets are available at your favorite big-box home-
improvement center (though most of these have key-based bypass systems, 
reducing the actual security you get to the level of a key-based system).
We’ve also seen a grocery-store chain here in Seattle experiment with 
using fingerprint scanners for checkout-line payment. Walt Disney World in 
Orlando, Florida uses fingerprint readers for customers who purchase multi-
day passes, to ensure that those who reenter the facility on subsequent days 
are the same people who purchased the tickets on the first day. Everyone 
who attended Super Bowl XXXV had their faces compared to the faces of 
known criminals, using biometrics. Anyone entering the United States since 
September 30, 2004, has submitted prints of both index fingers — and in 
December 2008 that will extend to all prints from both hands.

 Chapter 1: Understanding Biometrics
Types of Biometrics
Although there are close to a dozen more-or-less effective ways to use bio-
metrics to identify someone, they all fall into two classes (see Figure 1-1): 
physiological and behavioral.
 
Figure 1-1: 
The two 
classes of 
biometrics 
are physi-
ological and 
behavioral.

Gait
Physiological
Physiological biometrics measure a specific part of the structure or shape of 
a portion of a subject’s body. The types of physiological biometrics include:
 
 Fingerprint: Officially established as a means of uniquely identifying 
people since around 1900, fingerprints are easily registered and mea-
sured — and devices for doing so are small and inexpensive. You can 
find them built in to laptop computers, PDAs, USB drives, door locks, 
and even credit cards.
 
 Hand scan: The geometry of an entire human hand is quite unique, 
almost as much as fingerprints themselves. Usually a hand scan does 
not measure the fingerprint-like patterns in the fingers and palms, but 
instead relies on the lengths and angles of fingers, the geometry of the 
entire collection of 27 bones, plus muscles, ligaments, and other tissues.
 
 Hand veins: If you shine a bright light through your hand, you can see 
an interesting pattern of veins — and also the bones and other elements 
in your hand.
 
 Iris scan: The human iris is the set of muscles that control the size of 
the pupil — that little hole in the middle of your eye. The human iris, 
when viewed up close, is the complex collection of tiny muscles that are 
stained various colors of brown, gray, blue, and green. When we say that 

12
Part I: Getting Started with Biometrics 
someone has blue, green, or brown “eyes,” the color we’re referring to is 
the color of the iris.
 
 Retina scan: The retina is the surface at the rear of the interior of the 
eye. It’s not normally seen except when (say) a doctor shines a bright 
light through the pupil just right. But it does show up when you have a 
photo with “red eye” — that’s the reflection of the retina. Red eye is not 
sufficient to identify someone; instead, it is necessary for a person to get 
their eye close up to a little camera that can see inside the eye.
 
 Face recognition: We recognize faces almost from birth, although how 
we recognize them is better understood now, enough that we can teach 
computers how to do it under certain conditions. Some laptop comput-
ers use facial recognition as a form of authentication before a subject 
can access the computer.
The characteristic in common with physiological biometrics is that they’re 
more-or-less static measurements of a specific part of your body. You might 
have to swipe your finger, place your hand, or look at the red dot, but the 
biometric equipment does the rest. Just hold still . . . there, got it.
Physiological biometrics are discussed in detail in Part II. There you can also 
read about some of the unusual biometrics that may be used someday.
Behavioral
Behavioral biometrics are more concerned with how you do something, 
rather than just a static measurement of a specific body part. Some of the 
behavioral biometrics in use include these:
 
 Handwriting: Everyone’s handwritten signature is different, probably 
uniquely so. Biometric systems measure signatures in a number of dif-
ferent ways:
 
• Static image. This is the oldest type of handwriting recognition where 
we compare a stored signature image with a new sample to see if they 
match. Arguably, with practice, the image of someone’s signature can 
be forged, although it’s extremely unlikely that the forger will create 
the signature the same way that the original person does, which leads 
to the next two forms of handwriting biometrics:
 
• Signature dynamics. Here we’re measuring either (a) the motion of 
the stylus or pen or (b) the dynamics of how the signature image 
itself is created.
 
• Stylus pressure. We can also measure the dynamics of the down-
ward force of the stylus on the writing surface while the signature 
is being made.

13
 Chapter 1: Understanding Biometrics
 
 Keystroke dynamics: The rhythm of someone’s typing (or keyboarding 
as we tend to call it these days) is as unique as someone’s signature. 
The precise timing of individual keystrokes is a product of the geom-
etry of the hand, the tone of the muscles in the hands and forearms, as 
well as the brain’s ability to send out the right signals at the right time 
that result in (say) Peter typing this sentence. And one nice thing about 
keystroke dynamics biometrics is that it’s entirely passive — a software 
program can continually measure keystrokes — and can, in many cases, 
sense whether someone walked away and someone else sat down and 
continued typing.
 
 Voice recognition: As with typing, the sound of someone’s voice is the 
product of physical characteristics (specifically, the construction of 
larynx and related passageways); the brain is in control of the linguistics 
of one’s voice. Some biometric systems will have the subject speak his 
or her name or password; better ones might have the subject read a 
unique phrase such as “Liberty requires virtue and mettle.”
 
 Gait: The way a person walks forms a unique pattern that can be cap-
tured for biometric purposes. As with facial recognition, it’s sometimes 
easy to recognize particular people at a distance by the way they walk.
There are stranger and more interesting behavioral biometrics that we dis-
cuss more fully in Part II.
How Biometric Systems Work
Biometric systems work through enrolling users by measuring and storing 
their particular biometric, and then later comparing the stored biometric 
data with data from unverified subjects to determine whether they should be 
allowed to access a system or location. Take a look at the entire process in 
more detail:
 
1. Enrollment.
 
 Before a user can begin using a biometric system, he or she must com-
plete an enrollment process. Depending upon the biometric technology 
in use, the user might do this on her own, or there may be a facilitator 
to help. The user provides other information such as her user ID or 
name, and then provides initial biometric data, which could consist of 
(for example) swiping fingers over a fingerprint reader (for fingerprint 
biometrics), looking into a digital camera lens (for iris biometrics), or 
repeating some words or phrases (for voice biometrics). Usually the 
biometric system will request several samples so that the system can 
determine an average and deviation.

14
Part I: Getting Started with Biometrics 
 
2. Usage.
 
 When the user wishes to access a system or building guarded with bio-
metrics, the user authenticates according to procedure, which could 
mean swiping a finger over a biometric fingerprint reader, placing a 
hand over a hand scanner, or signing his name. However it’s done, the 
biometric system will compare the sample with data stored at enroll-
ment time, and make a go/no-go decision on whether the biometric data 
matches or not. If there is a match, the user is given access; if not, he is 
denied access and given another try.
 
3. Update.
 
 For the type of biometrics that change slowly over time (such as hand-
writing or facial recognition), the biometric system may need to update 
the data that was originally submitted at enrollment. The biometric 
system may perform this update with each subsequent measurement 
(thereby increasing the number of samples, with emphasis on the newer 
ones), or it may utilize a separate update process.
Biometric systems are generally pretty easy to use. In most cases, even 
enrollment takes only a minute or two, and everyday usage takes only a few 
seconds. Indeed, regular use may take less time than the old way of gaining 
access to a computer or building. This is why we usually consider biometrics 
a break-even in terms of the time required to use the system compared to the 
former way in which someone had to identify themselves.
Characteristics of Biometric Systems
Every type of biometric measurement can be classified with a number of 
characteristics that should be considered in a selection process. Being famil-
iar with these characteristics will help you to better understand how to think 
objectively about each type. Sure, some of the available biometric technolo-
gies are cool, but it’s no longer the 1990s — we have to make rational deci-
sions about purchasing and using technology. Anyway, the characteristics 
we’re talking about are
 
 Universality: This refers to whether each person has the characteristic 
being measured. For instance, nearly everyone in your organization will 
have at least one finger for fingerprint biometrics, but gait-based biomet-
rics may be more difficult if you have any wheelchair-bound staff members.
 
 Uniqueness: How well the particular biometric distinguishes people. 
DNA is the best, and fingerprints and iris scans are pretty good too.
 
 Permanence: A good biometric system should measure something 
that changes slowly (if at all) over time. DNA and fingerprints are very 
good over the long term; handwriting and voice change somewhat from 
decade to decade.

15
 Chapter 1: Understanding Biometrics
 
 Collectability: This refers to how easily the biometric can be measured. 
DNA scores very low (it isn’t easy to collect); fingerprint and palm-scan 
biometrics rate quite high. Gait requires a person to walk over a dis-
tance, which would be hard to do while sitting at a workstation. Retina 
scan requires the subject get really close to a digital camera.
 
 Performance: This refers to the overall technology burden: how much 
equipment, time, and calculation go into performing a comparison. The 
fingerprint method fares very well; fingerprint readers are small, com-
pact, and accurate. DNA biometrics tend to be costly, slow, and labor-
intensive.
 
 Accuracy: How well does a biometric system distinguish between sub-
jects, and what are the false acceptance and false rejection rates?
 
 Acceptability: Will users be willing to use the biometric technology? 
DNA will score low because of privacy reasons. Retina scans will score 
low because some people will be uncomfortable putting their eye really 
close to something that seems intrusive. Similarly, people won’t mind 
swiping a finger across a surface-type fingerprint scanner or getting an 
iris photographed from a few feet away, but some are squeamish about 
sticking their fingers into a device (too many “B” movies).
 
 Circumvention: This refers to how easily a forgery can be made that will 
fool the biometric system (early fingerprint devices, for example, could 
be fooled with “gummy fingers”). Proof of life testing — a feature that 
determines whether a sample comes from a living body part — is incor-
porated into many biometric systems so digital images of body parts are 
less likely to fool the system. But circumvention also refers to whether 
someone can attack a biometric system in other ways, such as replaying 
known good credentials through a network connection.
Benefits of Biometric Systems
The antagonists of data security generally consider any form of security 
as added complication at best and a violation of privacy at worst. We have 
instead taken the path that security should be a business enabler by adding 
value in some measurable way. Biometrics are no exception: An organiza-
tion that is implementing biometrics is doing so in order to fulfill a business 
objective that is usually tied to the reduction of risk.
The three chief benefits that biometrics bring to an organization are
 
 More reliable identification: With biometrics in place, it’s far more 
likely that the person logging in or entering a building is who he says 
he is. The risk of a lost key card, for example, is greatly reduced when a 
biometric is required in addition to the key card. And it’s highly unlikely 
that you’ll find a finger or eyeball in the parking lot that an intruder can 
use to enter a building.

16
Part I: Getting Started with Biometrics 
 
 Elimination of password sharing: Because biometrics are associated with 
a person and cannot be separated from the person, it eliminates password 
sharing and that satisfies a regulatory requirement for some, and provides 
greater accountability for all organizations that use biometric authentication.
 
 More convenient identification: Depending upon the manner in which 
a biometric solution is integrated into an authentication/authorization 
system, the biometric solution may make identification even more con-
venient than before. For example, Peter can log in to his laptop com-
puter with a swipe of his finger, which takes less time than entering a 
user ID and password.
Selecting a Biometric System
Different biometrics use different measuring techniques and conditions. 
Depending on the requirements of a specific access control situation, some 
biometrics will be more suited than others. For instance, DNA verification 
would not work well for logging in to a computer system (even one that con-
tains really sensitive information), as the DNA confirmation is labor intensive 
and takes a few days at the very least — by that time you’ll forget why you 
wanted to log into the system in the first place.
The point we’re trying to get across here is that any initiative that considers 
using biometrics is to improve access control requires a lot of discussion — 
as well as the development of formal, written requirements. Failure to take 
those steps may result in choosing the wrong kind of solution, which can be 
a very costly mistake.
As with any technology-related project, the very first order of business 
should be the development of formal business objectives that are blessed or 
(even better) expressed by the executives in the organization. An example of 
a bottom-line objective is to improve the company’s ability to prohibit unau-
thorized persons from accessing valuable assets. It’s hard to find organizations 
that set out to acquire the latest technology just because it’s cooler than the 
old stuff in the previous generation. Similarly, nobody adopts the newest 
technology just to keep the system administrators from getting bored and 
quitting. (Nobody reasonable, anyway.)
The steps for selecting a biometrics solution are pretty straightforward:
 
1. Identify selection criteria.
 
 This process includes understanding the physical and logical environ-
ments, establishing physical requirements (size, weight, and power 
requirements of biometric devices, for instance), determining acceptable 
accuracy and rates of failure (false acceptance and false rejection), and 
getting an accurate handle on regulatory requirements, budget, implemen-
tation effort required, and how soon you need a solution in place.

17
 Chapter 1: Understanding Biometrics
 
2. Identify the field of possible solutions.
 
 When selection criteria are established, it will be easier to objectively elimi-
nate unsuitable types of solutions and get closer to a “short list” of candi-
dates. Closer analysis of requirements, features, and budget should help 
you get to one or two types of biometric approaches that may work for you.
 
3. Test potential solutions.
 
 When you’ve eliminated most of the playing field and are down to a 
short list of specific solutions, you should consider getting hold of an 
actual product you can test. Most vendors will loan you a reader or two 
for a couple of months if they think they have a shot at selling you a lot 
of them. When you test a couple of solutions in something close to your 
real setting, you can see how well they really perform. Be sure you get 
some users involved in the testing — their observations and feedback 
will be more valuable than you may realize.
 
4. Choose the solution.
 
 After you’ve tested some solutions, you should be able to make a selec-
tion. The runners-up will want to know why they weren’t chosen; it’s 
best to not burn your bridges, but instead, tell them why (amiably and 
honestly). Who knows — you might be doing business with them in the 
future when your needs change.
We describe the entire process of product selection in juicy detail in Chapter 8.
Implementing Biometrics
Once you have selected a biometric system, you’ll need to develop a plan 
to get the system installed, configured, and running. But if it were just that 
simple, we would not have devoted an entire chapter to the subject. The real-
ity is that implementing biometrics is fairly complicated, not because of the 
technology but because of the behavioral changes that are required of the 
people who will be using it and the typically large impact on the organization.
Educating users must begin early and should be structured in a manner that 
gives them a way to ask questions and express any concerns they may have. 
We can guarantee that if you’re implementing a fingerprint-based system, 
some of your users are going to express concerns regarding civil liberties 
and make remarks such as “I’ll be damned if I’m going to hand over my fin-
gerprints to my employer!” And we’re sure you will also hear something like, 
“I saw someone pick his nose before using the fingerprint reader — do you 
think I’m stupid enough to use it too?” Our point is that user education is 
probably more important for biometrics than for nearly any other kind of IT 
project. Even switching users from Windows to Linux would be easier, in our 
opinion — chances are nobody will call you a fascist for doing that.

18
Part I: Getting Started with Biometrics 
Aside from user education, careful planning is the most important part of 
successfully implementing a biometric system. If you’re going to be installing 
biometric readers in lots of places, then you’ll have the normal logistical chal-
lenges of getting equipment installed and configured properly — and making 
sure the red and green wires didn’t get crossed (which could be a problem if 
your installer is color-blind).
Obviously, we’ve touched on only a few of the issues that crop up in biomet-
ric implementation. For the complete story, turn to Chapter 9.
Understanding Biometrics Issues
Biometric technology is nowhere near universally accepted by all users. There 
are a number of social and legal considerations that give every organization 
some pause before taking the jump headlong into implementing a biometric 
system. Done right, identifying and managing these implications helps an 
organization make a better decision — not only on the type of biometric tech-
nology used, but also on how it will be used.
Privacy
In the United States, Europe, and other regions and nations, citizens have a 
legal right to privacy — which at times may give the use of biometrics the 
appearance (if not the fact) of intrusiveness. Sometimes privacy concerns are 
based on misperception; at other times, they’re well founded.
The privacy concern arises primarily because people believe certain biometric 
data that has been collected by a private organization can later be used in ways 
that would violate their legal rights — or even cause them more tangible harm. 
The classic example is fingerprint-based biometrics. When users register their 
fingerprints, they usually believe that the organization is collecting actual finger-
print images — but generally that’s not the case. Typically a biometric system 
based on fingerprints scans the image but stores only a cryptographic hash of 
the data that describes the print. Hashing cannot be reversed to produce the 
original fingerprint. Users should feel a little better once they understand this.
Privacy laws
A number of privacy laws in the U.S. provide some vague guidance on the 
permitted collection and use of biometric data. We say “vague” guidance 
because most of these laws were written prior to the popular use of biomet-
ric technology. Some of the noteworthy laws include the following:

19
 Chapter 1: Understanding Biometrics
 
 Privacy Act of 1974, later amended by the Computer Matching Privacy Act 
of 1988. These laws define how information related to individuals can be 
collected and used. The long and the short of it is, federal government agen-
cies can collect biometric information and even share it and combine it with 
information collected from other federal government agencies. However, 
every citizen has the right to know what information is stored, and must 
be given access to a process for correcting information that is inaccurate. 
These two laws don’t say anything about how long federal agencies may 
keep this information, so it’s likely they’ll have it long after we die.
 
 Executive Order 12333. Signed by President Reagan in 1981, this order 
seeks to encourage the enhancement of biometric collection methods 
while still retaining privacy. Primarily the order provides guidelines 
regarding what situations and conditions justify the collection of biomet-
ric information, and regarding what types may be collected.
We discuss these privacy laws in more detail in Chapter 3.
Protecting Biometric Data 
and Infrastructure
Few will argue that biometric data, even if it’s obfuscated, hashed, or 
encrypted, must be protected from unauthorized access, corruption, and 
loss. Security professionals call this the protection of CIA — the confidential-
ity, integrity, and availability of data.
My fingerprints have been breached — 
can I get new fingers?
Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’ve 
heard about the scourge of security breaches 
concerning credit cards, bank-account num-
bers, and so on. In the case of credit cards, 
when they’re compromised, the issuing bank 
quickly cancels the stolen card number and 
issues a new number for the customer.
But what happens if a person’s actual finger-
print images are compromised and published? 
You can’t get your fingerprints replaced; they’re 
permanent. Same goes for your iris image and 
your other physiological characteristics. This 
fact has driven the designers of most biometric 
systems to store biometric information in a form 
that can’t be used to derive the original data — 
not even whether it’s a fingerprint, an image of 
your iris, or a description of the way you speak.
This concern underscores the need for an organiza-
tion to do an effective job of educating its personnel 
about the facts — making sure they know exactly 
how their personal information will be stored and 
used. Lacking this information, staff members will 
fear the worst, which can undermine an otherwise-
well-planned biometric implementation.

Biometrics are used to protect valuable assets, whether those assets are 
workspaces containing expensive machinery or computer systems containing 
sensitive information. The measures taken to protect biometric data should 
be similar to those used to protect passwords and other credential data.
To understand how to protect biometric data, it is necessary to understand 
the types of threats that jeopardize it. Mostly, these are the same ones that 
threaten other information assets. There are quite a number of threats that 
we categorize as natural (such as floods, lightning, and hurricanes) and man-
made (such as sabotage, communications failures, and riots).
It is also important to understand the kinds of vulnerabilities that may exist 
in biometric systems and what can be done to minimize these vulnerabilities. 
Some of these vulnerabilities are the same ones that other types of informa-
tion systems and networks face — such as exposed cabling, missing security 
patches, and improper configuration.
The types of attacks that can take place against biometric systems include 
systems attacks, network attacks, application attacks, social engineering, replay 
attacks, faked credentials, bypass attacks, and enrollment fraud. The first four 
are the types of attacks that can be launched against any computing environ-
ment. The last four are types of attack specific to biometrics themselves — 
here’s a closer look at these:
 
 Replay attacks: Here, an attacker has found a way to re-transmit known 
good biometric authentication data over the network in a way that can 
fool the system into admitting him.
 
 Faked credentials: This attack uses a forged credential in an attempt to 
gain access to a system or building. Examples include “gummy fingers” 
and images of faces or irises.
 
 Bypass attacks: An attacker may try different methods of breaking in to 
a system or facility by bypassing the biometric system altogether.
 
 Enrollment fraud: An intruder may attempt to enroll him or herself in 
place of a real individual.
For the most part, the tools and techniques used to protect typical comput-
ing environments also apply to biometric systems. For instance, all the serv-
ers, databases, and network devices that support a biometric system need 
to be “hardened,” have current security patches installed, and have good 
access management controls in place.
As you might guess, we’re hitting the security aspect of biometrics pretty 
lightly here. The heavy-duty stuff comes later: Chapter 10 has a more com-
plete discussion of keeping biometric systems safe from harm.

T
o understand how to use biometrics for protecting assets, you must con-
sider what you can actually do with biometrics. Probably the most common 
use of biometric tools is authenticating known users for the purpose of granting 
access to sensitive systems or areas; some forms of biometrics are also good at 
identifying persons whose biometric data is on file without any initial clues as to 
who they are.
In this chapter, we help you understand when biometrics make sense and start 
pairing up some kinds of problems with specific kinds of biometric solutions. For 
a more detailed look at choosing and implementing biometric solutions, take a 
look at Part III.
Speaking the Language: Biometric 
Concepts and Terms
For the rest of this chapter to make much sense, it is important that you 
understand the differences between these concepts.
Authentication implies that someone has presented some sort of credentials 
or made an assertion regarding his or her identity; here biometric tools can 
verify that such persons are who they claim to be. The biometric system has 
a simple task to perform: Collect the biometric information from the user 
and then compare it to the known biometric information for the person to 
be authenticated. If the system comes up with a match (within acceptable 
margins for error), the authentication succeeds.

22
Part I: Getting Started with Biometrics 
Identification using biometrics is a somewhat different task: Biometric data is 
acquired from the subject and then compared to all samples in the database, 
in order to determine who the person is. In the case of a fairly complex but 
somewhat inexact biometric such as a person’s gait — where the margins for 
error are relatively wide (compared to, say, iris scanning) — an identification 
system might yield more than one possible match.
 
Whenever you use biometrics for identification, only the biometric itself is 
acquired from the subject; the identification is performed without the bias 
that goes along with comparison to a specific person.
Why not just always use biometrics for identification rather than for authenti-
cation? Well, for one thing, it’s time-intensive. Identification has to compare 
each user with the entire database until a match is found — far less efficient 
and less accurate. The “less accurate” part requires some explanation.
Consider what happens if you’re using a biometric database of fingerprints — 
with millions of users enrolled — in identification mode to figure out which user 
is trying to log in to your computer system. Since the system has to just start at 
the beginning of the database and start comparing, what happens if there’s a 
fairly close match to the current sample — and it shows up earlier in the data-
base than the correct match? Potentially, the user could end up identified as the 
wrong person. If you use the same database in an authentication capacity, the 
user asserts who he or she is, and then the system makes a comparison and 
decides to accept or reject the assertion. It’s still possible to have a false accep-
tance — after all, the close match is still in the database — but the user would 
have to choose the correct false match from the millions of choices at random. 
That’s unlikely unless the user has direct access to the encoded prints.
 
All forms of biometrics have error rates associated with failures to identify or 
authenticate users. Incorrectly accepting a biometric is called a false accep-
tance; the percentage where this will occur for the system or biometric type is 
called the False Acceptance Rate (FAR). Incorrectly rejecting a biometric is 
called false rejection; the percentage where this will occur for the system or 
biometric type is called the False Rejection Rate (FRR).
Starting at Square One
We like to start security projects by understanding exactly what business-
enabling function the new project is intended to facilitate, and making sure 
that the project will accomplish what’s expected. The number one problem 
with security projects is that while they’re furiously involved in making some-
thing secure, they forget that there’s an original business need that started 
the whole process. If you find it difficult to express your security project in 
terms of enabling organizational goals, it may be time to rethink your organi-
zation’s actual need for the project.

23
 Chapter 2: Protecting Assets with Biometrics 
Recognizing organizational benefit
When we ask security professionals what the organizational benefit of some 
security project is, we often hear things like “It will better secure our customer 
data” — which is really (believe it or not) beside the point. If the goal of the 
organization is to secure customer data, we guess we could see that as an 
organizational benefit, but it’s far more likely that the organization exists to 
provide some service to those customers other than just collecting their data 
and keeping it really secure.
We’re not saying that security is unimportant; far from it. The information 
security of an organization can mean the difference between happy custom-
ers who use your services and recommend them to their friends and multi-
million-dollar class-action lawsuits against the company for losing all of their 
credit card numbers. What we are saying is that security isn’t a useful goal at 
the organizational level. Instead, security is a tool we use to manage organiza-
tional risks to protect the bottom line.
As Alex Trebek might say if he were moonlighting as a savvy security consul-
tant, “Please phrase your security project proposal in the form of a goal in 
keeping with the mission objectives of the organization.” Okay, maybe he 
wouldn’t say that, exactly, but you get the idea. You have two basic ways to 
look at your deployment of biometrics:
A project whose main 
point is to use biometrics 
for something
Typical description: “A biometrics project that 
requires fingerprint identification for anyone logging 
in to the customer database.” 
A project with larger 
business goals 
consistently in mind
Typical description: “A project to reduce the cost 
of data-theft mitigation by introducing biometric 
authentication for authorized users of the database.” 
Why is it important to make this distinction? The short answer is that by placing 
the project in its proper context, you can show others in the organization the 
value of your project in terms that make sense to them. The longer answer is more 
about how security professionals think and talk about security — and how that 
affects planning for the organization.
Many security people should consider “catching more flies with honey than with 
vinegar” when they talk about the job of securing information or things — in this 
case, the honey takes the form of positive language focused on reaching organi-
zational goals. If your language is inherently focused on the negative aspects of 
the things you’re proposing to “lock out, keep from, exclude,” or otherwise stave 
off, the audience you’re most trying to reach may tune you out. That happens 
even though what you’re trying to accomplish is for the good of the organization. 
So focus your language on what your hearers want to accomplish, using a posi-
tive perspective of “providing, enabling, allowing, and making available.” 

24
Part I: Getting Started with Biometrics 
“Wait”, you say — “when I’m talking about locking out and excluding, I’m talk-
ing about the bad people, not our customers!” Keep in mind that providing, 
allowing, and making available is the output of the organization; the protec-
tive stuff is a side effect of good management. Statements that talk about 
“doing a great job of providing access by making it more convenient and 
secure” will make sense to management; rants about “keeping the wrong 
people from getting access by introducing new security measures” will 
mostly get tuned out.
Understanding your customer
In an organizational context, your “customers” are the internal people who 
will be using the biometric system to go about a typical day’s work. You can 
apply biometric protections that protect assets to both electronic-access sys-
tems (as the equivalent of a password) and to physical assets (in the form of 
access control). In effect, your internal “customer base” is limited to people 
who require access to computer systems or secured areas. In all seriousness, 
the customer base for your biometric security system is twofold:
 
 The organization that requires the kind of security that a biometric 
system provides. The organization’s goals and requirements should be 
what actually started the process of securing assets with biometrics, so 
those shouldn’t be a mystery.
 
 The people who actually have to use the system you install, probably 
without much choice in the matter. In any group of people larger than 
about three, it’s likely that not everyone will be thrilled with whatever 
biometric solution you choose. For larger numbers, it’s likely that the 
solution may not even work properly for some small percentage of users 
due to physical limitations.
The key is to understand who the end users of the system will be — both to 
accommodate the largest possible population and to avoid any gaffes in your 
technology choices. For example, the building Mike works in also houses ser-
vices for the blind and partially sighted. The service organization employs 
several blind people who require access to the building. Although (in most 
cases) eye-based biometrics would technically work fine, the need to have 
the user focus on a specific spot to get a good image would rule out retina or 
iris biometrics for access to this particular building.
Understanding customer needs doesn’t just mean understanding the physical 
characteristics of the population either. While working on a biometric identi-
fication system for a large health-care provider (for example), Mike was well 
down the path of recommending a good fingerprint-identification system 
when someone told him that lots of people in this environment wear gloves a 
lot of the time. Oops. Fingerprint biometrics could well be challenging in that 
situation. Oddly enough, a little testing showed that the print scanners he 

25
 Chapter 2: Protecting Assets with Biometrics 
was interested in could work through rubber gloves just fine — but if they 
hadn’t, and it didn’t become apparent until after the system was deployed, it 
could have been a serious mistake — brought about by ignorance of the daily 
routines of the doctors and nurses in an emergency room.
Understanding the objective
The objective of the exercise is to secure the asset, right? That’s super-easy as 
long as we all agree on what the specific definitions of secure and asset are. 
That may sound trivial, but take it from someone who’s sat in meetings for 
hours listening to people debate this very topic — it’s more complicated than 
it sounds, and the complexity crops up the moment you try to apply those 
definitions to a specific context.
Secure is an elusive quality — unobtainable in its pure form, if you believe 
most security folks. Humankind has a long history of building walls, forts, and 
various other obstacles, trying to keep ourselves and our stuff secure — 
most of which ultimately failed to do so.
 
Over time, the degree to which you can keep things secure is inversely pro-
portional to how interested others are in breaking that security. For example, 
the Content Scramble System (CSS) used for protecting DVD movies from 
piracy lasted for about three years before someone released code that uni-
formly cracked DVD encryption. Blu-ray was cracked even faster.
Since secure seems to be a relative term, it’s important — when contemplat-
ing a biometric system to keep something secure — to understand what level 
of security you are really striving for. If you’re securing weapons-grade pluto-
nium, we suggest further study (a nice advanced degree program, preferably, 
and 20 years or so of industry experience), but that’s an entirely different 
scale of project from (say) using a fingerprint ID system to provide access to 
the company accounting system.
Anti-biometric hobby
For a period of about three weeks in high school, 
Mike had no fingerprints. Any of his friends and 
family reading this might be thinking, “I remem-
ber no eyebrows a few times from his explo-
sives phase, but how did he blow his fingerprints 
off?” The truth is he actually sanded them off 
through hours and hours of wet sanding, while 
applying a new paint job to his 1976 Toyota 
Corona Mark II MX. All those hours of sanding 
the car also sanded Mike’s fingertips to the 
point where they were tender and had no dis-
cernable prints. Fortunately for his authentica-
tion needs, prints grow back quickly. But it’s 
worth asking: What processes happen in your 
organization that might interfere with biomet-
rics, even as side effects?

26
Part I: Getting Started with Biometrics 
Imagine that the asset being protected is really valuable — say, a couple of 
billion dollars’ worth of pre-patent intellectual property at a law firm. One 
of the measurements you might want to consider would be how much some-
one might be willing to spend to get access to those assets. An attacker might 
spend a few hundred dollars splicing into the line between the palm scanner 
and the computer system it’s connected to; voilá — now somebody can inter-
cept the biometric data and/or replace it with other data. Depending on how 
well you’ve protected that piece of wire, a few hundred dollars might be a 
good investment for access to billions of dollars worth of assets. Specifying 
a system that encrypts data between the scanning device and the system 
would mostly eliminate this problem, but it does add additional expense.
Higher levels of security typically cost more money, are less convenient for 
users, or both. Figure 2-1 graphically illustrates the relationship between 
convenience and security. If we were to add a third dimension to the dia-
gram, it would be a “cost” axis — because sometimes inconvenience can be 
overcome by spending more money.

 Chapter 2: Protecting Assets with Biometrics 
Applying Triple A: Authentication, 
Authorization, and Accounting
Once you have a complete understanding of the objectives, the customer, 
and how it all fits into the organization, you’re ready to roll up your sleeves 
and get involved with the real work of biometrics as used to protect assets: 
authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA, also known as Triple A). 
If you’ve heard of AAA before with respect to security, you may have thought 
of it as the part of a security system that grants or denies access. That’s a 
good start on protecting things using biometrics. Here, we take a closer look 
at the other two “A”s (authorization and accounting); the idea is to make sure 
everyone is talking about the same thing when referring to authentication.
Refining ideas about authentication
The act of authenticating someone presupposes that someone’s already 
made an assertion — along the lines of “This is Brenda” — which we are 
authenticating. Starting out with no information at all is a different task 
entirely — called identification. Biometric systems can be good tools for iden-
tification, but if we’re talking about securing systems, we want to use the 
most accurate possible comparisons. That means comparing a new biometric 
sample to a single existing biometric profile — which is the process of 
authenticating a person. Figure 2-2 illustrates the difference between identifi-
cation and authentication. It’s possible to build identification-based biomet-
ric systems for protecting assets, but if you go that route, be prepared to 
spend additional money to get the level of security that’s already available 
through authentication-based systems.
The assertion itself can be accomplished in many ways, but typical methods 
include typing in a username, presenting an electronic ID badge, or — in the 
special case of voice recognition — saying your name. A speech recognition 
system can translate what you say (your name) into text, and then a biomet-
ric voice-recognition system uses the already-collected voice pattern to make 
the biometric comparison. Note the distinction here between two separate 
systems: speech recognition and voice recognition. Speech recognition trans-
lates speech into text, but has no idea who is talking, while voice-recognition 
systems match patterns in the voice to known biometrics.
Because authentication requires an assertion of identity to start, biometric 
authentication is frequently a two-factor (also known as multifactor) authenti-
cation — the use of more than one item to authenticate the user. In practice, 
each of the (usually two) factors should be hard to duplicate or obtain; 
typing in a username isn’t a useful factor unless the username is obscure and 

28
Part I: Getting Started with Biometrics 
maintained as a secret. Often multifactor authentication is described as using 
two, or even three, factors: something you know, something you have, and/or 
something you are. In a biometric authentication system, we use something 
you are as one of the factors.

Authentication provides a mechanism by which a system can verify that users 
are who they purport to be. The typical uses are for access control to a com-
puter system or other mechanism, or to a physical area. There are other uses 
for authentication such as verifying that an action was performed by a specific 
person (discharging a medical patient) or an online banking transaction.
Authorizing actions
Authorization plays a role related to — but distinct from — authentication in 
securing systems with biometrics. Most security systems make distinctions 
between the things various people are allowed to do. Authentication allows 

29
 Chapter 2: Protecting Assets with Biometrics 
the system to know who is trying to do something, but authorization is how 
we can conceive of each authenticated user only being allowed to perform 
the tasks in the system that the rules allow.
Most of the time, the actual biometric system doesn’t have any direct role in 
authorization. That’s because authorization is based on rules internal to the 
protected system. There are a couple of exceptions to that: 
 
 At a very basic level, most biometric systems are required to authenti-
cate a user and then grant access to that user based on the successful 
authentication. The “granting access” part of that process can be per-
formed by other systems, based on information that the biometric 
system supplies (saying, in effect, Yup, that really is Rhonda).
 
 In some cases the biometric system itself may directly grant access 
based on a successful authentication. Biometric door locks are fre-
quently in the latter category; they can choose to open the door without 
consulting any other system.
In cases where biometric systems are expected to directly grant access to a 
physical area or system, the system must understand authorization or every-
one in the system will be granted access to everything. In the case of a door 
lock, for example, you can imagine that on a large campus, not everyone 
should have access to all doors. Just being in the system and able to get in 
and out of the lobby and your office doesn’t give you access to the shrunken-
head collection or the plutonium repository.
Another place where biometric authentication and authorization overlap some-
what is a special case: specifically requiring biometric signatures to authorize 
actions. In some financial systems, ordinary transactions can happen just 
because a specific user is logged in to a terminal and going about his or her 
business; when a transaction over some preset limit is attempted, however, 
the user is forced to specifically authorize that transaction by providing fur-
ther proof of identity. Biometrics is a perfect way to accomplish this kind of 
authorization because biometric data is hard for someone else to imitate.
Billions and billions
While working on a supplemental authorization 
system for a large financial institution, Mike 
once saw on-screen what the limit was for trig-
gering a forced re-authentication: The user 
would be prompted to re-authenticate when any 
single transaction exceeded nine hundred mil-
lion dollars. Because Mike knew how frequently 
the system was being used, he also knew that 
each of the users in the office where he was 
working was performing transactions of that 
size — or greater — at least once each day. 
That marked one of many times he considered 
changing his consulting rates on the spot.

30
Part I: Getting Started with Biometrics 
Auditing
Audit has a lot of common meanings, none of which are all that pleasant 
sounding (unless, of course, you are an auditor). In the AAA sense, auditing is 
about having a complete record of the authentication and authorization 
events. The record of what’s been happening is an important part of any 
system for a lot of reasons — and audit is among them.
In some situations, such as medical applications, a complete record of who 
has accessed records is more than just a good way of tracking access and 
behavior; it’s a legally mandated requirement, with serious penalties for get-
ting it wrong. Even without legal requirements, having a record of who 
accessed what asset and when is critical to understanding how people are 
using your protected systems.
In unusual situations — for instance, when there’s evidence of misuse — the 
audit records are essential to identifying what records may have been 
accessed and by whom. It’s worth mentioning here that audit records associ-
ated with data access warrant extra protection. When an experienced system 
cracker breaks into a computer or access system, the first thing the intruder 
wants to do is erase any tracks — and the audit records are the target.
 
You can tamper-proof your audit records by employing these three measures:
 
 Keep your audit records in binary format.
 
 Give the audit records cryptographic signatures.
 
 Archive the signatures separately from the audit records.
These three measures can provide enough protection that an attacker will 
look for someone else to mess with who’s not as careful.
Choosing the Best Fit
Biometric protection systems are uniquely positioned to be the most aggra-
vating, invasive, in-the-way system that your users have ever imagined. After 
all, the more accurate biometrics require pretty direct personal contact with 
the system. So a biometric system that isn’t suited to the task (or works 
poorly) is about as bad as information technology gets.
A biometric system well suited to your needs, on the other hand, provides 
better measures than really long complicated passwords, and saves all that 
extra typing. Careful thought about how the users work, what their work con-
ditions are, and how they expect to interact with the protected systems or 
areas will lead to good choices and happy users.

31
 Chapter 2: Protecting Assets with Biometrics 
In this chapter, we discuss several aspects of biometric systems that all have 
some effect on the purchase, use, maintenance, or usability of any such system. 
It can be tempting to focus on just one or two of these parameters as the most 
important and pretty much ignore the rest — but resist that temptation. The 
best approach is to list all the parameters that apply to your situation, assign 
weights to each of them (based on the specific needs and requirements of your 
asset protection profile), and see how the numbers come out. Although your 
installation may have additional items to consider, as an example, we consider 
security, environment, cost, and regulatory requirements.
Security as a goal
When the goal of a project is to secure assets, you might expect that security 
would always be the highest priority. The reality, however, is that the secu-
rity of a system must be strong enough to repel only those people who are 
actually interested in breaking in. Because the required level of security 
drives costs higher — while simultaneously producing a negative effect on 
the environment in terms of usability — the security requirements for a bio-
metric system should be carefully considered with an eye toward containing 
cost and providing a workable environment.
For example, even if we are just limiting our scope to fingerprint biometrics, 
there are security considerations to take into account when choosing among 
the systems available:
 
 Secure transmission: Is it possible to intercept the data coming from the 
reader? Is the wire protected? Is the information encrypted?
 
 Secure storage: How safely is the biometric database stored? Is the 
information in the database subject to abuse if stolen, or is it useless 
outside the system?
 
 Secure design: Does the biometric sensor itself allow latent prints to be 
collected (glass surface scanners).
Depending on the security required for your installation, you may need to 
consider points like these.
Environment as a factor
When you’re fitting a biometric system to your setting, you have to take into 
account not only the working environment as it exists prior to installation, but 
also the expected working environment after adoption of the system. In a per-
fect world, the biometric system actually improves the working environment 

32
Part I: Getting Started with Biometrics 
by providing a more convenient authentication and authorization method, 
saving users time and making their jobs easier. Since we rarely live in a perfect 
world, sometimes the main reason for instituting a new biometric system is to 
usher in a higher level of security — and some level of inconvenience is 
expected as a part of that process.
The introduction of a new way of doing things is almost always problematic 
in the short run; everyone has to get past the initial retraining before they 
can begin to use the new system efficiently. Sometimes the new system has 
to satisfy additional security concerns or regulatory-compliance require-
ments — and so will continue to be a pain to use, even after the initial break-
in. The goal, in those cases, is to meet the new challenges while minimizing 
the new system’s negative impact on the working environment.
One great way to understand each system’s possible impact on the working 
environment is to observe working installations that use the technologies 
you’re interested in — either in place somewhere else or as a test environ-
ment you build yourself. (For a more detailed discussion of building a test 
environment and getting good data from it, take a look at Chapter 8.)
Cost as a limitation
Of all the parameters you may need to consider and balance in choosing the 
right biometric technology for your project, cost is possibly the only one 
you’ll always try to push in the same direction — downward. While money 
can’t buy everything, it nearly always influences the other parameters in a 
specific direction. For example: Higher levels of security can be purchased, 
as well as sensitive, high-resolution biometric sensors that reduce the FRR or 
allow acquisition of biometric information from a distance (reducing the 
impact to the working environment). But it’ll cost you.
Because cost is nearly always an issue, the challenge is to buy as much secu-
rity, integration, and regulatory compliance as you really need — without 
breaking the bank. You need to figure out how much security is enough. 
About the only thing you have working in your favor with respect to cost is 
time. As with almost any technology, the longer you can put off your project, 
the more you will be able to buy (because the cost will go down over time) — 
which means you’ll accomplish more of your objectives with the same 
amount of money. Technology purchases can be one of those times when 
procrastination pays off.

33
 Chapter 2: Protecting Assets with Biometrics 
Regulatory considerations
We feel that regulatory compliance is a useful example because accomplish-
ing compliance goals is really an absolute, black-or-white goal. Cost, environ-
ment, and security are sliding scales; compliance-or-noncompliance is pretty 
clear-cut. If your organization must comply with regulations that describe 
how authentication and authorization are used, then you really don’t have 
much wiggle room in this area. Your new project will meet your compliance 
goals, or it will not be useful to the organization.
The absolute nature of this parameter can drive other parameters (such as 
cost) without providing any opportunity for compromise. If you must achieve 
a specific FAR, and the only available biometric system that can do the job 
costs twice your expected budget, you’ll be spending the extra money or risk-
ing fines from the regulatory body. So you must ask which will cost more — 
and make your choice based on the answer.
Regulatory compliance is specific to the regulatory body (typically federal, 
state, or industry based) and is often more art than science. The problem 
with compliance to regulations at the federal level is that the federal govern-
ment is not in the business of advocating specific technologies and wants to 
make sure that regulations are not so specific that they need to be changed 
often as technology advances. Due to these limitations, regulations tend to be 
a bit vague about technology or specific methods and rely on industry best 
practices to guide people.
For example, a regulation might say that your authorization system must pre-
vent repudiation of authorized actions. In other words, a user must not be 
able to say she did not authorize an action that she really did authorize. Most 
biometric systems offer some level of non-repudiation because they tie the 
authorization to a physical or behavioral aspect of the user, but iris biomet-
rics offer quite a lot stronger non-repudiation than simple signatures.

enerally technologists haven’t done such a great job anticipating the 
impact to society of any particular new technology or platform. Partly, 
that is just the nature of the game. If you give a child a plastic dinosaur in a

mand module for a spaceship trying to divert the giant asteroid and save the 
Cretaceous denizens from their horrible fate. As a society, we behave in some 
ways exactly like a curious child when it comes to technology. We explore 
every possible way we might use the new tool — some of which were never 
envisioned by the tool’s creators — and we keep pushing the limits of every 
idea until it no longer resembles the original concept. We (your authors) 
sincerely doubt that the estimable visionaries at DARPA were thinking about 
the kind of revolution e-commerce would eventually bring to the world in the 
form of the worldwide Internet.
Biometric technology is another one of those tools that evolves this way. As 
a base concept, it’s simple: Use recorded knowledge that describes some 
aspect of us (either physically or behaviorally) and then use that knowledge 
to later identify or authenticate the person who has those attributes — say, 
you. In order for your biometric measures to be really useful, the information 
gathered must be detailed and unique to only you, and clearly associated 
with your identity in whatever system is making the identification or authen-
tication. That’s where it gets complex.
This chapter is all about the vast implications of such a simple concept when 
we consider collecting highly personal information from people — of a sort 
that in many cases will never change over their lifetimes — and then using 
that information in government, at work, and in the home.

Privacy Issues
Any time we consider giving up personal information to someone else, we 
have to consider what the implications are. For example, we might be per-
fectly comfortable with telling family members where the secret stash of 
emergency money in our home is, but not as willing to share that information 
with a co-worker. These days there is so much information about each of us 
that seems to just somehow make its way to the Internet, government offices, 
and employment databases that savvy information users are being very care-
ful about who gets access to what.
Biometrics are at once both very personal and potentially damaging if some-
how used in ways we did not expect when providing the information. Also, 
since the act of collecting biometrics involves observing behavior or scan-
ning some body part in detail, it can seem even more invasive than it really 
is. For all these reasons, it makes sense to understand the issues surrounding 
privacy and biometrics.
Constitutional privacy protections
In the United States the right to privacy is reasonably well established and 
constitutionally based. Although the U.S. constitution does not explicitly 
name privacy as an individual right, interpretations of the First, Third, 
Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth amendments by the Supreme Court 
uphold privacy as a constitutional right; specifically, a right to physical, deci-
sional, and informational privacy.
There are potential problems with each form of privacy recognized by the 
Supreme Court, but in most cases (as we explain) the concern over biomet-
rics derives from issues of informational privacy. To understand why, we 
look briefly at what each form of privacy means — and give an example of 
how each might be of concern in biometrics:
 
 Physical privacy concerns itself with freedom from monitoring by or 
physical contact with others. Although this might initially seem to be a 
potential clash between  biometrics and your privacy, such a conflict is 
unlikely unless someone forces you to provide a biometric sample, or 
takes pictures to be used in this way when you’re in your own home or 
another nonpublic place.
 
 Although there haven’t been many challenges of an individual’s physical 
right to privacy with respect to biometric information, we could imagine 
challenging a police officer taking a high-resolution picture of Mike to 
capture his iris image for the purposes of biometrically verifying identity 
on Fourth Amendment grounds.

37
 Chapter 3: Biometrics in Our Lives 
 
 Decisional privacy is the freedom to make choices in personal matters. 
There are numerous emotionally charged examples of the Supreme Court 
decisions in this matter, but to stay out of those fights (most of them, 
anyway), imagine a state passing a law that prevents you from getting a 
tattoo. The decision to get a tattoo is a personal one, arguably affecting 
nobody else, and any such law would be found to be unconstitutional.
 
 As with physical privacy, there are few good examples of this with respect 
to biometrics in real life, but one example might be the government 
requiring Mike to submit his iris information when he really doesn’t want 
anyone to know what color his eyes are. Requiring Mike to lift his dark 
glasses and stare into the camera might be considered a violation of his 
decisional privacy. Such a measure would almost certainly be challenged 
as a violation of informational privacy (which we look at next) as well.
 
 Informational privacy is far easier to understand and to find examples for. 
Informational privacy is the freedom to control access to information about 
oneself. Since biometric information is always tied to information about the 
individual, subsequent use of that information has the potential to violate 
this privacy right.
 
 For example, if Mike submits his fingerprints to an employer to authenti-
cate him as he arrives for work, and that employer then uses those prints 
to run a criminal background check, the employer has most certainly 
used the biometric identifier in a way that might violate Mike’s informa-
tional privacy rights.
Note our use of the words might, may, and possibly in the preceding para-
graphs. We’re not trying to be imprecise on purpose. The problem is that 
law, especially constitutional law, is whatever the courts interpret it to be 
at the time. Until we see court cases establishing those interpretations, it’s 
impossible to know for sure what the outcome will be. Also keep in mind that 
privacy rights are not absolute rights — and are frequently weighed against 
the good of society. Your right to physical privacy does not extend to hiding 
contraband on your person and smuggling it out of the country, for example.
Statutory privacy protections
The Privacy Act of 1974, as later amended by the Computer Matching and 
Privacy Act of 1988 (the act), is by far the most interesting statutory description 
of privacy and rights to privacy in the U.S. A complete description of this act and 
its implications would be the topic of several books this size, but we can cover 
most of the ground important to biometrics pretty quickly. The 1974 act, as 
amended in 1988, can be found on the U.S. Department of Justice Web site:
www.usdoj.gov/oip/privstat.htm

38
Part I: Getting Started with Biometrics 
The act pertains to the collection, use, and dissemination of records main-
tained on individuals as a part of a system of records. More simply, the act 
defines how the federal government can collect and use information about its 
citizens. On the face of it, that sounds perfect: a single place where all our 
privacy questions are answered with no ambiguity. Those of you who’ve 
actually read an act of Congress can stop laughing now, and we’ll get back to 
the serious business of trying to understand this act.
Defining terms
Even though the act starts with 13 definitions that cover everything from 
“individual” to “record” and “system of records,” most of the time spent in 
court discussing the act is spent arguing about what each definition really 
means. We’re not going to discuss all the definitions here; most of them are 
pretty boring and won’t add much to the discussion. We present the defini-
tions for record and system of records here, though, because it’s critical to 
understand those terms to understand the current discussions regarding the 
act and biometrics. What follows is the exact wording from the act, with the 
numbers removed that denote which definitions these are (numbers four and 
five) and capitalization changed for the beginning to improve readability.
The term “record” means any item, collection, or grouping of information 
about an individual that is maintained by an agency, including, but not 
limited to, his education, financial transactions, medical history, and 
criminal or employment history and that contains his name, or the 
identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the 
individual, such as a finger or voice print or a photograph;
The term “system of records” means a group of any records under the 
control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the name of 
the individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or other identifying 
particular assigned to the individual;
The definition of record includes the term “finger or voice print or photo-
graph” — so it seems a slam dunk that a biometric detail would automatically 
be considered as a record for these purposes. While doing background read-
ing for this book, however, we found arguments that question the validity of 
using such biometric details as records for the purposes of the act. That’s 
because a given detail may not contain an individual’s “education, financial 
transactions, medical history, and criminal or employment history.” These 
analyses seem to leave out the phrase “including but not limited to,” which 
comes right before that list.
It seems clear that any useful biometric detail (which we call a record from 
now on) will also include information that groups it together with other infor-
mation about the individual. A fingerprint that doesn’t have any associated 
data is unlikely to be of any use. It’s possible to create a situation in which 
the definition or record does not apply, but more than likely any such bio-
metric records will always be a part of a “system of records” that links the 
biometric details to other information about the individual.

39
 Chapter 3: Biometrics in Our Lives 
What it all really means
Assuming that the act does apply, in almost all cases, to biometric informa-
tion collected by the U.S. government, here’s the main question: What does 
the act say about what can and cannot be done with that information?
In essence, the act tells federal agencies that they may not disclose any 
record that is contained within a system of records to any other person or 
agency — not without the written permission of the person to whom the 
record pertains. Then the act goes on for a while making exceptions to this 
for Congress, the census, the National Archives, law enforcement, and the 
Comptroller General — and a general exception from the 1988 amendment, 
allowing agencies to combine information and use computer matching to 
compare one record to another. Aside from those specific exceptions, they 
can’t share biometric information with anyone.
Other important things to note is that each agency that collects such infor-
mation is required to allow individuals to see the record pertaining to them, 
and to request changes to that record if they feel there are inaccuracies. The 
agencies are also required to keep detailed records when disclosures are 
made in accordance to the many exceptions listed.
The difference between having and using
One last note about the act is that it does not prevent any agency from collect-
ing just about any kind of information about you that they choose. The act is 
strictly about what they can do with the data once they have it. Something 
missing from this act entirely is anything describing how long such information 
can be kept. Since computer storage seems to keep getting cheaper and faster, 
it wouldn’t be a surprise if our biometric data in the hands of the U.S. govern-
ment outlives all of us.
Executive Order 12333
In the final category of U.S. government documents that have some bearing on 
our privacy and how the government handles biometric information, we have 
Executive Order 12333 signed by President Ronald Regan on December 4, 1981. 
Executive orders are not laws, and do not have the force of law. What power 
they do derive is from their typically being in support or clarification of current 
laws and act as a catalyst for other members of the executive branch to carry 
out the wishes of the president. Both Congress and the Supreme Court have the 
ability to effectively nullify or overturn an executive order — which the Supreme 
Court has done twice in the entire history of the U.S.
This particular order’s purpose was to encourage U.S. intelligence agencies 
to enhance information-collection techniques and methods, while still main-
taining a balance with personal privacy and freedoms of American citizens. 

40
Part I: Getting Started with Biometrics 
This directive permits collection — for intelligence purposes — of informa-
tion on American citizens as long as the information meets the following 
criteria (as laid out in the directive):
(a) Information that is publicly available or collected with the consent of the 
person concerned;
(b) Information constituting foreign intelligence or counterintelligence, 
including such information concerning corporations or other commercial 
organizations. Collection within the United States of foreign intelligence not 
otherwise obtainable shall be undertaken by the FBI or, when significant 
foreign intelligence is sought, by other authorized agencies of the 
Intelligence Community, provided that no foreign intelligence collection by 
such agencies may be undertaken for the purpose of acquiring information 
concerning the domestic activities of United States persons;
(c) Information obtained in the course of a lawful foreign intelligence, 
counterintelligence, international narcotics or international terrorism 
investigation;
(d) Information needed to protect the safety of any persons or organizations, 
including those who are targets, victims or hostages of international terrorist 
organizations;
(e) Information needed to protect foreign intelligence or counterintelligence 
sources or methods from unauthorized disclosure. Collection within the 
United States shall be undertaken by the FBI except that other agencies of 
the Intelligence Community may also collect such information concerning 
present or former employees, present or former intelligence agency 
contractors or their present or former employees, or applicants for any such 
employment or contracting;
(f) Information concerning persons who are reasonably believed to be 
potential sources or contacts for the purpose of determining their suitability 
or credibility;
(g) Information arising out of a lawful personnel, physical or 
communications security investigation;
(h) Information acquired by overhead reconnaissance not directed at 
specific United States persons;
(i) Incidentally obtained information that may indicate involvement in 
activities that may violate federal, state, local or foreign laws; and
(j) Information necessary for administrative purposes. In addition, agencies 
within the Intelligence Community may disseminate information, other than 
information derived from signals intelligence, to each appropriate agency 
within the Intelligence Community for purposes of allowing the recipient 
agency to determine whether the information is relevant to its 
responsibilities and can be retained by it.

41
 Chapter 3: Biometrics in Our Lives 
The important thing to consider from the order with respect to biometric 
information is what can be considered “public information.” Is anything that 
can be collected in a public place, such as your face, your gait, or your irises 
public information? If so, this presidential order makes all of that fair game 
for intelligence agencies to collect regarding American citizens. To be fair, 
there is language in the order that requires compliance with the law and the 
Attorney General — but it seems very unclear (based on this order) about 
what biometric information intelligence it allows agencies to collect. If you 
are interested in reading the original order, you can find a copy on the 
Central Intelligence Agency’s Web site:
https://www.cia.gov/about-cia/eo12333.html
 
Although some executive orders have built-in expiration dates, 12333 does 
not — so it’s still in full effect. Unless Congress provides active leadership to 
specify what information can and cannot be collected on U.S. citizens without 
their permission or knowledge, this executive order effectively defines the 
position of the executive branch.
Too much information
Many of us would like ways to identify ourselves for access to work, commerce 
and even our homes, without the bother of having to remember dozens of 
passwords for each environment. What could be simpler than using a technol-
ogy that recognizes something unique about us and applies that information 
for this purpose? After all, when we’re performing these various identification 
and authentication tasks, the only thing we never leave behind or forget is 
ourselves.
Many of the biometrics techniques we discuss in Part II of this book gather 
information about us that might be more revealing than intended. A simple 
example:  A grocery store that’s using fingerprint scanning to authenticate 
payment for groceries would know if you were missing (say) the index finger 
on your right hand. 
It’s possible that you don’t care about the grocery store knowing something 
like that, but it’s certainly very personal information that the store generally 
has no reason to possess, but cannot help knowing in this scenario. Even if 
you’re comfortable with your corner grocery knowing this, will you still be 
okay with it when the corner grocery is bought by (say) the giant conglomer-
ate MegaFudCorp International?
The point is that it’s impossible to gather information that is by its nature 
personal to us for biometric purposes without also potentially gathering 
irrelevant but possibly sensitive information at the same time. Some biometric 
technologies — such as iris and retinal scanning — even double as medical 

42
Part I: Getting Started with Biometrics 
diagnostic tests, since changes to these body parts typically happen only as 
a result of direct physical damage or certain diseases. Are you okay with 
medical information in the hands of people not involved in your health care?
Even behavior-based biometrics might reveal the early onset of some neuro-
logical disorders since we tend to choose behavioral characteristics that are 
so ingrained that major differences in (say) gait could be an indicator of a 
tumor or other neurological event.
The real problem here is that for some events, there’s no practical way to mask 
the irrelevant personal information. If your company uses retinal scanning to 
allow access to the server room and you start failing to authenticate, even after 
re-enrolling a few times, there are only a limited number of explanations for 
that — nearly all of which include a disease that messes with the fine capillary 
structure of your retina. Even if the system itself isn’t recording these events 
(which would be odd, since they’re security related), the humans who would 
have to assist in reenrolling you would quickly come to the conclusion that 
you’re ill — and we have no simple way of deleting that information from their 
brains. Result: The company or people in the company know about a medical 
condition that they have no right to know about. Biometrics are going to chal-
lenge lawyers and ethicists — especially with regard to the use and protection 
of what the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) calls 
EPHI (electronic protected health information).
Protecting biometric data
To return to the grocery example, do you trust the management of the great 
big MegaFudCorp to safeguard your personal information? Well, we give such 
companies our credit- or bank-card information all the time — so what’s the 
big deal with a little bit of biometric data? The difference is that you can 
cancel your credit card, but your unique biometric data changes slowly (or 
doesn’t ever change) — and once someone has it, there’s no way to make it 
invalid. Although it’s easy for organizations to acquire information, it’s quite 
another matter to completely purge that same information.
This concept is really at the heart of several battles over biometric identification 
systems proposed everywhere. From the perspective of the person or company 
collecting biometric information to identify or authenticate you, it’s the same as 
a password or a challenge response. (You know the typical gambit: “What’s your 
mother’s maiden name?”) For you, it’s potentially a key to your finances, front 
door, and medical records all rolled into one — which can never be recalled or 
changed if it’s stolen. No surprise if you consider this data critical to protect — 
but it would also be no surprise if MegaFudCorp didn’t consider it nearly that 
critical.

43
 Chapter 3: Biometrics in Our Lives 
Proponents of using biometrics have good arguments for why this isn’t as big a 
problem as it may sound — especially for the most widely used technology, fin-
gerprints. Fingerprint-identification systems almost never actually store a finger-
print in its entirety; instead, they only store a few data points that correspond 
with the representation of minutiae that the system chose as best for identifica-
tion purposes. Since you don’t have the actual picture of a fingerprint, the theft 
of the fingerprint data isn’t a problem, right? With fingerprints, a hash of the 
print data is all that’s really required for authentication, but identification really 
requires the whole print to be available since a one-to-many match can require 
additional analysis. A hash function takes relatively complex information (like 
your fingerprint information) and turns it into an integer (the hash) which can 
be used as an index — in this case, an index into a biometric database.
Without the original fingerprint image, you couldn’t re-create a fingerprint 
that would fool a human examiner for long, but theoretically you could create 
a bogus print that would fool the specific system that collected the data. 
Since you know what it’s looking for, that’s all you really need to re-create.
For most of the other forms of biometric information, a lot more detail is cap-
tured and stored, but they are in turn far harder to imitate or falsify. For those 
forms, though, possession of the information is the direct harm to your privacy. 
There’s no good reason anyone that you haven’t shared it with should know 
about the vein structure of your hand or the metal pin in your index finger.
Keeping a check on Big Brother
Easily the largest biometric projects in the world are all government sponsored 
and operated. Although it’s possible that you may completely trust your own 
government to never misuse personal information, it strains credibility to 
imagine that you might trust other national governments to do so. We don’t 
care where you live, or what government we are talking about, at some time 
in history it has likely misused personal information, violating the privacy and 
civil rights of its own citizens, and has an even worse record regarding the per-
sonal privacy and private information of noncitizens. Both authors of this book 
are American citizens with long histories of patriotism and cooperation with 
law enforcement, so when we bring up events such as the internment of 
Japanese Americans during WWII and recent questions about warrantless 
wiretaps, it’s with the words of Andrew Jackson’s farewell address in mind,
“But you must remember, my fellow-citizens, that eternal vigilance by the 
people is the price of liberty, and that you must pay the price if you wish to 
secure the blessing. It behooves you, therefore, to be watchful in your States 
as well as in the Federal Government.”
We’re not knocking any particular government here, just saying that we get 
worried when anyone creates a database to track the citizenry.

44
Part I: Getting Started with Biometrics 
Biometric passports
As of early 2008, at least thirty-nine countries have passports with biometric 
information that is contained on a chip embedded in the passport and is 
readable wirelessly. In many cases, the only biometric information currently 
on the chip is a photograph, which is also represented non-electronically in 
the passport. In some cases, however, fingerprints are also captured and 
stored on the passport as well. Proponents of biometric passports say the 
additional information contained on the card allows ports of entry to know 
for sure that the person in possession of the passport is the person it was 
issued to — since the information can be compared directly to biometrics 
gathered while customs officials watch. In theory, the use of cryptographic 
signatures ensures that the data has not been tampered with and the pass-
port is valid.
As a basic rule of thumb, whenever you hear someone make an absolute 
claim about security (such as “This will keep your data safe”), always assume 
that somebody is either ignorant or lying. The best encryption algorithm in 
the world will not keep your data safe if it’s not implemented properly. Some 
of the encryption used for passports has already been cracked due to poor, 
nonrandom key choices and other flawed implementation. Assurances that 
you have to be “very, very close” to someone’s passport to read its data also 
went out the window the 2006 Black Hat conference in Las Vegas as people 
were able to demonstrate reading passports from about 2 feet away. It’s also 
been demonstrated that RFIDs containing malicious data can be used to dis-
rupt the devices that read the data in passports — in essence, a Denial of 
Service attack on a port of entry.
Oddly enough, if you’re carrying around a biometric passport in your pocket, 
we don’t need to use biometrics to track your movements and identify you. All 
we need to do is grab the encrypted blob off of your card (apparently pretty 
simple to do) and then compare the blob we just captured as you walked in the 
door with the one we have. We don’t have to decrypt it, we just compare the 
encrypted data and if it’s the same, we know it’s the same passport.
We aren’t particularly worried personally about the government having a 
copy of our fingerprints as we are always careful to wear gloves when we’re 
doing something we don’t want the government to know about. We do worry 
about any government having a complete database of biometric information 
because we don’t see that level of tracking as a function of government. The 
temptation to use such a database in new and interesting ways will always be 
there, and easily justified as protecting society from a very real threat.
Other repositories
As biometric systems become more economical and simpler to use and 
administer, we’ll no doubt see many organizations that need to verify identity 
offering — or demanding your acceptance and compliance to — new 

45
 Chapter 3: Biometrics in Our Lives 
schemes. Banks are already using fingerprint, iris, and retinal data to authen-
ticate transactions; some look at fingerprint readers that fit into a credit card 
to show that you were holding the card at the time of the transaction.
The United Arab Emirates has deployed an iris-based identification system that 
compares every person entering the country to a database of several hundred 
thousand deportees. This system has been wildly successful in achieving its 
objective of not allowing these deportees back into the country — and has 
helped catch and arrest more than 73,000 returning deportees. To accomplish 
this, all the UAE government had to do was capture and compare the irises of 
every single person to enter the country. Although the current system does 
not apparently keep a copy of (say) your iris biometrics, it’s pretty easy to 
imagine that as a next step to further protect the population.
Maintaining the balance
We live in a world where sometimes our privacy is in direct opposition to our 
safety and ability to counter threats to society. If law enforcement knew the 
exact location of every person at all times, we guarantee that the crime rate 
would drop — but we don’t want that much intrusion into our daily lives and 
activities. A mandatory archive of all fingerprints and palm prints of every 
citizen would also be tremendously helpful in apprehending criminals when 
police find prints at a crime scene. That, too, seems to be too large an inva-
sion of our privacy to be allowed.
Official government databases are by no means the only threat to our privacy; 
employers, banks, and retailers are beginning to gather biometric information for 
their own use. Let’s say the police have good reason to believe that one of your 
fellow employees robbed a bank yesterday because the clerk recognized your 
company logo on the bag that person stuffed the money into, and the logo 
showed up on the shirt of the masked robber. Since the police don’t know 
exactly which employee it was — but let’s say they know that your company 
identifies employee movement through the factory by gait-based biometrics — 
they get a warrant for all gait measurements so they can use them for compari-
son to the video taken by the bank cameras. Result: Even though you, of course, 
were not a part of the crime, the police still have some of your biometric data. 
The police might later decide to compare that data to crowd footage of the latest 
anti-asparagus rally, just so they know whom to look out for in future asparagus-
based confrontations.
It’s clear that a healthy balance between individual privacy and the safety of 
our society is important, but given the ongoing debates, it’s equally clear that 
we don’t all agree on where that balance lies. In the U.S., we tend to err on 
the side of privacy and individual rights where we can — sometimes even at 
the expense of the general welfare and the crime rate. We do this because we 

46
Part I: Getting Started with Biometrics 
feel that the loss of our freedoms and ability to go about our lives without 
official interference is more important than the threat posed by people who 
use anonymity to strike against us. Figure 3-1 illustrates the concept of a 
“sweet spot” where privacy, security, the will of the public, and invasive 
knowledge of personal information are balanced.

Biometrics and U.S. Law
In the privacy discussion earlier in this chapter, we cover the basis for the 
privacy of biometric information in U.S. constitutional and statutory law. In 
this section, we examine some of the specific new laws and programs that are 
directly concerned with biometrics.
U.S. and state laws form a large, dark, and sometimes completely inexplicable 
labyrinth of twisty passages that yield fertile ground for legal scholars, judges, 
lawyers, and dozens of other professionals who don’t always seem to agree 
about the correct interpretation, scope, or jurisdiction of any particular para-
graph. Since we are none of those people, that means we’re going to miss lots 
of laws that we don’t know — and get some of it wrong that we think we do 
know. We promise to feel momentarily contrite for about 30 seconds on the 
first Sunday after the publishing date of this book to compensate. Synchronize 
your watches!
We discuss two categories of law with respect to biometrics:
 
 Laws that are written specifically to address biometrics issues and needs
 
 Laws that have some effect on the collection and use of biometrics

47
 Chapter 3: Biometrics in Our Lives 
The widespread use of biometrics is relatively new, so few laws directly 
address their use and misuse. There are lots of laws regarding the collection 
and use of personal information that were not written to address issues in 
biometrics — but they certainly apply to the kinds of information we’re col-
lecting, and to how we use that information.
Passport and entry
Prior to the tragic events of September 11, 2001, the only biometric informa-
tion collected and used at U.S. ports of entry were the photographs on pass-
ports. These photographs were used primarily to perform a manual check of 
the passport photo, comparing it to the person presenting the passport to 
verify that the person entering or leaving the country was indeed the holder 
of the presented passport.
Although not explicitly biometrics-based, new U.S. passports contain a digi-
tized picture of the holder, which can be used for facial recognition if the need 
arises. Speaking of need, 64 kilobytes of storage are available on electronic 
passports — which could be used to store additional biometric information — 
also if the need arises. Figure 3-2 shows the e-Passport symbol. Although some 
privacy advocates might disagree, it’s hard to imagine a worse scenario for 
biometric use of a passport than facial recognition alone. If biometric informa-
tion is to be stored on these documents, it would be nice to use something 
with a lower rate of false acceptance and false rejection than you get with facial 
recognition alone.

Part I: Getting Started with Biometrics 
The events of 9/11 caused the U.S. to reassess how we think about border 
security — and to pass laws requiring new biometric collection and verifica-
tion systems at the border. The USA Patriot Act Title X required the Attorney 
General to study and report on the feasibility of using fingerprints to identify 
people as they enter the U.S. This study resulted in the US-VISIT (United 
States Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology) program.
US-VISIT is a program that starts with the collection of fingerprint biometrics, 
sometimes at the point of entry and in many cases overseas before flying to 
the U.S. and then allows custom officials to compare the biometric informa-
tion to 3.5 million people on watch lists whom the U.S. would like to prevent 
from entering the country. As of June 2007, the program had collected finger-
prints on 100 million people — which will be archived for seventy-five years 
before being discarded. Initial implementation of US-VISIT collected only the 
index-finger prints from each hand, but these are quickly being replaced by 
systems that capture all ten fingerprints.
The transition from two prints to ten, according to official statements by the 
State Department, will make the US-VISIT program match international stan-
dards and provide additional information to reduce mismatches. Although this 
is a true statement from the State Department, the real value of ten prints 
versus two is more subtle and important to note: Collecting and comparing two 
arbitrarily selected prints (each index finger) is used primarily as an authenti-
cation of known identity. In this case, however, you’re comparing a known col-
lected print to a new sample taken from a person you want to authenticate, 
and seeing what you get. With all ten prints, you can start thinking more about 
identification in addition to authentication. Here’s an example . . . 
Imagine that you’re an agent working for Interpol, and you discover a usable 
fingerprint in the fragments of a bomb casing. You save the print and com-
pare it to known prints but come up with nothing. Being a good agent, you 
Those eyes
In 1985, a photograph by Steve McCurry of a 
young Afghan woman with sea-green eyes 
appeared on the cover of National Geographic. 
Although you may not have read the accompa-
nying article, the photograph is iconic and well 
known throughout the world. The penetrating 
gaze from a young woman who had already 
seen a hard and dangerous life is disturbing 
and lovely at the same time. Seventeen years 
later, that original photograph was used to 
verify using iris biometrics that the woman was 
Sharbat Gula, whom McCurry had located again 
by returning to the same region and doing con-
siderable detective work. The resulting match 
has a one-in-one-hundred-million chance of 
being incorrect. We discuss this incident fur-
ther in Chapter 13.

 Chapter 3: Biometrics in Our Lives 
supply this print to countries and agencies that would have an interest in 
helping you find the bomber, and you hope for the best. Two months later, 
U.S. Customs stops your bomber at the border because the print turns out to 
be the right pinky print of someone they just scanned into the system in Los 
Angeles. A two-print system would have missed this person completely since 
the print wasn’t from a finger (the index finger) that the system cared about. 
By collecting all the prints, the system practically guarantees identification of 
any individual whose fingerprint has ever been entered into the system by 
any means — within the capabilities of the fingerprint system itself.
Along with the fingerprints, a photograph is captured electronically that 
records the face as further information about the individual. Although a full-
face photograph is by no means optimal for iris collection, a good-quality 
photo has been used for positive identification using iris biometrics before.
Special jobs
You’ll never get anyone in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to admit 
on the record that they would like to have a rock-solid, biometrically 
enhanced identification card for every U.S. citizen — and capture iris, retina, 
and fingerprint scans at birth. You can bet a lot of folk there think that way, 
however, based on the number of citizens required to furnish biometric infor-
mation for their government or security-related jobs. It’s not politically wise 
to talk openly about tracking U.S. citizens with sophisticated biometric tech-
nologies at a national level, so what seems to be currently happening is a 
creeping requirement of biometrics into specific or special-purpose IDs for 
small segments of the population (that seem to increase in size daily).
Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC)
Congress, through the Maritime Transportation Security Act, directed the 
issuance of a biometric credential to 
“…any individual with unescorted access to secure areas of facilities and 
vessels and all mariners holding Coast Guard issued credentials or 
qualification documents.”
By U.S. Coast Guard estimates, that’s about 1.5 million workers — including 
longshoremen, truck drivers, merchant mariners, and port employees — 
nationwide.
Enrollment for this card includes the collection of a full set of fingerprints 
and a digital photograph, and it is used to identify and authenticate these 
workers in areas where a person might be able to effectively assist or 
perpetrate smuggling or generally violate customs laws.

50
Part I: Getting Started with Biometrics 
Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12)
HSPD-12 provides for a common identification standard for federal employees 
and contractors using two fingerprints and a photograph. Since this directive 
encompasses all the agencies of the U.S. government and approximately 1.8 
million employees and contractors, actual enrollment and issuance of these 
cards has been glacially slow. The implementation and administration of the 
rollout has been left in the hands of the individual agencies, each of which has 
its own ideas about the best way to accomplish the task.
Unregulated multitudes
While doing background research for this section of the book, it became clear 
to us that many professions require practitioners to be fingerprinted — but are 
not necessarily using those fingerprints directly as a biometric measure. In 
such cases, biometric authentication and identification is just about installing 
the technology; the data-collection part has already been accomplished. Since 
no central authority is keeping track of these unregulated fingerprint collec-
tions, there is no good measure of how many people fall into this category, but 
it’s pretty easy to estimate it in the tens (or even hundreds) of millions of 
people, since some of the categories are quite broad. A partial list of these 
include lawyers (requirement for admission to the bar in most or all states), 
New York City welfare recipients, criminals, private investigators, and many 
law enforcement officers.
Everyone else
Although it’s still a political hot-potato, there are a couple of initiatives that 
could enroll every U.S. citizen in a biometric identification system.
REAL ID
The REAL ID Act of 2005 (which is division B of the Emergency Supplemental 
Appropriations Act for Defense, the Global War on Terror, and Tsunami Relief, 
2005), requires people who want to open bank accounts, board airplanes, and 
enter federal buildings to present identification that meets certain standards. 
Not too surprisingly, REAL ID has provisions for including biometric informa-
tion, but currently does not require it as a part of REAL ID-based driver’s 
licenses (unless you count the photograph, which can be used for face recogni-
tion). As things stand now, people born after December 1, 1964, will have a 
REAL ID by December 1, 2014, and all others by December 1, 2017.
Not surprisingly, many states have raised numerous objections to a system 
that dictates rules in an area where states have had carte blanche: driver 
licensing. The rules control what can be used for proof of identity, security 

51
 Chapter 3: Biometrics in Our Lives 
of the physical offices where REAL IDs are issued, and background checks for 
the employees of any department that can issue licenses. These additional 
rules have the potential for adding lots of additional wait time to the process 
of obtaining a driver’s license, which already has a reputation for being an 
interminable process.
Crime and punishment
One category of biometric data collection in the U.S. that we don’t cover much 
here is actually one of the largest (and certainly the oldest) collection — that 
of criminals. If you’re convicted of some crimes, or even suspected in some 
cases, your fingerprints are collected (with or without your cooperation) and 
kept on file. These files are shared pretty widely among law enforcement orga-
nizations and even around the world in some cases.
Oddly, the personal information of people convicted of crimes is not very 
well protected in general. In one case, a file with information about persons 
on the FBI’s Most Wanted list included the usual names, aliases, and other 
personal information — as well as their correct Social Security numbers. The 
consequences of this inclusion would be somewhat amusing if it weren’t for 
the potential waste of law enforcement resources. An unsuspecting identity 
thief is in for the surprise of his life when he starts impersonating an FBI Most 
Wanted fugitive.
Protections against misuse
While doing the background research for this part of the book, it became 
clear that an exhaustive list of the places U.S. citizens were required to 
submit biometric information for identification is a much larger task than you 
might think it would be. If we include DMV (Department of Motor Vehicles — 
the State agencies that issue driver’s licenses) photos as facial-recognition 
biometrics, the number jumps to equal nearly the entire adult population — and 
since DMV photos are used for this purpose, that’s not a big leap. If we limit the 
list to more accurate and unique means such as fingerprints, the number drops 
from hundreds of millions to tens of millions — for now.
With all that biometric data lying around in government offices, workplaces, 
and computers belonging to random merchants, you’d think there would be 
lots of laws about how this information should be protected and how long 
anyone is allowed to keep it. As is typical for emerging technology, however, 
the law hasn’t really caught up to current practice yet. The U.S. has no laws 
regarding how long someone can keep biometric information once it’s col-
lected. Once you hand someone your biometric keys-to-the-kingdom, that 
person or institution may keep those keys indefinitely.

Protecting your biometric information
Lack of protection for personal information — and the resulting personal, pri-
vacy, financial, and legal mess — is in the news almost weekly these days. All 
it takes is for some entity with possession of your Personally Identifiable 
Information (PII) to leaves it accidentally on the seat of an airplane, in the 
trunk of a rental car, or sitting on an unpatched Web server where someone 
strolls/surfs by and grabs it with very little effort. As of early 2008, there are 
(conservatively) 200 million records containing sensitive personal informa-
tion exposed in this way in the U.S. alone.
With all the dangerous activity and the plethora of entities that might collect 
sensitive information, our legal system finally reacted. On July 31, 2003, the 
state of California enacted a security-breach notification law — the first of its 
kind. As of February 2008, 38 other states have adopted similar laws, most of 
which are based on the groundbreaking California law. Table 3-1 shows the 
actual adoption rates for the individual state laws, and how even something 
so obviously beneficial takes many years to reach widespread adoption.

Looking at the list in Table 3-1, you might say “Wait! What if I live in South 
Dakota, which hasn’t passed a security-breach law yet?” Fear not — you’re 
still very likely to get a notification if your biometric information is exposed 
by a security breach. As it turns out, most of the businesses to which you 
may have given such information also do business in one of the thirty-nine 
states that do have security-breach laws. You’ll be notified, all right. That’s 
because trying to sort out the people who reside in states that passed such a 
law from those who live where no such law exists is a real pain — and you 
can’t be sure another such law didn’t get passed in the “uncovered” states 
while you weren’t looking. If a security breach compromises 10,001 records 
and only one of those people lives in South Dakota, it’s not considered good 
customer service to tell the other 10,000 people, “We’re very sorry but your 
private information has been compromised by a hacker. Please don’t tell 
anyone from South Dakota — especially if you’re a member of the press.”
The California law and most of the ones that follow it can be summarized 
pretty simply: If personal information (which we define in a moment) is 
exposed by a breach in your security, you must notify all the persons whose 

54
Part I: Getting Started with Biometrics 
information was exposed. There is some detail about how to accomplish the 
notification and exceptions for ongoing legal investigations but that’s the law 
in a nutshell. Most states use the same definition of personal information that 
California does — which does not explicitly name biometric data — as follows:
An individual’s first name or first initial and last name in combination with 
any one or more of the following data elements, when either the name or 
the data elements are not encrypted.
 
 Social Security number
 
 Driver’s license number or California ID card number
 
 Account number, credit or debit card number, in combination with any 
required security code, access code, or password (e.g., a PIN) that would 
permit access to an individual’s financial account.
Although this definition does not explicitly call out biometric information, it 
could easily be argued that fingerprints or other biometric samples consti-
tute a “required security code” or “access code” to any reasonable jury. Our 
bet is that few companies would be willing to risk the public-relations prob-
lems that could arise from not informing customers that their biometric infor-
mation had been stolen — and then having that information announced by 
the news media instead. Kudos to Florida, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, 
and Wisconsin — all were forward-thinking enough to explicitly describe 
biometric data as personal information in their breach-disclosure laws.
Health care to the rescue
An idea that has not been tested in court yet is that, in many cases, biometric 
information could be considered health-care-related, called Electronic Patient 
Health Information (EPHI) according to HIPAA — the U.S. law that defines how 
EPHI must be protected in computers and networks. Since changes to some of 
the biometric data for an individual can only be explained by certain changes 
to their health status, employers must be very careful about how they handle 
iris, vein, retina, and other biometric measures. They have to be certain they 
don’t run afoul of our nation’s sensitivity to the privacy of health-care informa-
tion. Current laws and regulations don’t come into play directly, but the U.S. 
as a nation has shown an intolerance to exposing private data regarding the 
health of citizens — to a degree that should give pause to organizations collect-
ing this information as they decide how to protect it.
Biometrics and European Law
Europe — and more specifically the European Union (EU) — is very proud of the 
special care it takes with the privacy of its citizens’ personal information. Unlike 
the U.S., where the fundamental right to privacy is somewhat obliquely referred 
to in the Constitution, the EU Constitution has a comprehensive privacy statute: 

55
 Chapter 3: Biometrics in Our Lives 
Directive 95/46/EC. Also known as the Data Protection Directive, this statute 
deals directly with the handling of personal information — including biometric 
information. (In defense of the U.S. Constitution, computers and biometric infor-
mation weren’t popular topics of discussion in 1787 when the Constitution was 
written and ratified into law.) The full text of the EU constitution can be found at 
the official EU Web site:
http://europa.eu/scadplus/constitution/index_en.htm
Article II-68 of the EU constitution titled “Protection of Personal Data” is 
refreshingly short and clear. The entire text of II-68 consists of the three 
assertions:
1. Everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him 
or her.
2. Such data must be processed fairly for specified purposes and on the basis 
of the consent of the person concerned or some other legitimate basis laid 
down by law. Everyone has the right of access to data which has been 
collected concerning him or her, and the right to have it rectified.
3. Compliance with these rules shall be subject to control by an independent 
authority 
With these guiding principles, the Data Protection Directive is applied to the 
“processing of personal data,” which is defined as “any information relating 
to an identified or identifiable natural person.” The guiding directives from 
the directive concern the following topics:
 
 Principles relating to data quality
 
 Criteria for making data processing legitimate
 
 Special categories for processing
 
 Information to be given to the data subject
 
 The data subject’s right of access to the data
 
 Exemptions and Restrictions
 
 Data subject’s right to object
 
 Confidentiality and security of processing
 
 Notification
The actual directive includes pages and pages of detail regarding each of 
these topics. It boils down to the idea that an EU member citizen’s data must 
be carefully collected (if collected at all) — and the information collected 
must be enough to accomplish the required information-processing task and 
no more. In addition, the information must be handled exactly as described to 
the citizen, who must be allowed access to information collected on him or 

56
Part I: Getting Started with Biometrics 
her, and the information must be carefully protected from disclosure at all 
times.
The effect of these privacy laws on biometrics in the EU is interesting from a 
social point of view. EU member nations’ citizens are generally more comfort-
able with the collection of extensive biometric information by their govern-
ments than U.S. citizens are. That’s because the collection and use of such 
information is so much more carefully controlled than it is in the U.S. Nearly 
all member nations have biometrics-based identification built into their pass-
ports or have that capability and will soon be using it.
Since there are EU laws regarding how personal information can and will be 
shared between EU nations, port-of-entry security between member nations 
can be far more relaxed than it is in countries that don’t have laws that 
restrict the handling of personal information such as biometrics. This also 
allows companies to collect information from citizens of other EU nations 
without too much additional scrutiny of information-handling procedures. 
This is in stark contrast with the hoops that American companies must jump 
though to handle EU personal information; U.S. law is not nearly restrictive 
enough to satisfy European sensibilities. Even the US-VISIT program, which 
collects fingerprints from all people entering the U.S., was subject to scrutiny by 
the European Commission as a potential violation of Data Protection Directive.
The EU laws closely resemble proposed “Guidelines on the Protection of 
Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data” from the Organisation for 
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an international organiza-
tion with thirty member countries, including the United States. The OECD 
guidelines steer the privacy and information sharing policies of nearly all 
member nations except the United States.
Biometrics and Laws in Other Countries
The OECD guidelines use the same basic guiding principles already listed in the 
section on the EU Data Protection Directive — but guidelines issued for the 
member countries don’t carry the force of law or Constitutional authority. The 
force that the guidelines do have, even outside of the member countries, is that 
for the purposes of border protection, anti-terrorism, and law enforcement, bio-
metric information must be shared among the nations of the world — and the 
OECD guidelines are designed to be restrictive enough to satisfy privacy con-
cerns (at least as well as can be imagined in such circumstances). Even the U.S. 
has endorsed the guidelines, but as yet has done little or nothing to comply.

57
 Chapter 3: Biometrics in Our Lives 
In general, democratic governments are doing a balancing act: the needs of 
society to control borders, catch criminals, and prevent identity-related 
crimes (such as identify theft) against the individuals’ rights to privacy. 
Nondemocratic governments, on the other hand, have been quick to adopt 
biometric identification of citizens — in many cases, for the purpose of track-
ing their movements and activities.
Currently, there are no laws that describe the idea of what we call tainted bio-
metric data. Biometric information collected from a populace who have no 
choice in the matter should make us think twice about the use of such data in 
our efforts to make the world a better and safer place. We would consider 
any biometric information collected against the will of the individual or 
coerced from an individual to be tainted in this respect. Other ways that bio-
metric data might be tainted would include collection without the subject’s 
knowledge or gained from sources like health-care organizations that col-
lected the information for non-biometric uses.
Ethics Issues with Biometrics
The use of information to identify or authenticate persons gives rise to ethi-
cal considerations surrounding improper use of the identification and 
authentication processes themselves, but in the case of biometric informa-
tion, some of the measures are so personal that the biometric measure itself 
can raise ethical concerns.
Tracking you down
Any measure that can be used to identify a person might also be used to 
track their movements and activities in ways completely unrelated to the 
task for which the identifying information was originally collected. In the case 
of biometric data, there is no way to decouple the identifying information 
from the person — resulting in a really sticky situation: Every place where 
that information is captured can be correlated with every other time and 
place that information has been presented, forming a complete picture of the 
individual’s activities, tastes, financial position, associates, affiliations, and 
whereabouts. Although that may be desirable when talking about criminal 
activity, it’s an extreme violation of personal privacy for normal citizens 
going about their noncriminal lives.

58
Part I: Getting Started with Biometrics 
Some biometric measures — such as gait, iris, facial imaging, and 
voiceprint — cannot easily be concealed in public places, and might allow 
entities in possession of this kind of biometric information to know far more 
about the subject than would be possible otherwise. Indeed, many of these 
biometric measurements can be captured without the subject’s knowledge or 
consent. In the absence of good laws preventing such actions, we may soon 
see gait-based biometrics used to follow your progress though the mall — and 
making suggestions to store clerks about what products to offer you, based on 
your earlier purchases or store visits. Then again, it could be relatively easy to 
wear a “disguise” in the form of a heel lift in one shoe that will change the 
way you walk, and allow you to “disappear” completely!
Controlling how your biometrics are used
Good privacy laws make sure that biometric information collected from an 
individual with her consent may be used only for the precise purpose for which 
it was provided, and no more. Privacy advocates who are against the use of 
biometric identification have the legitimate fear that once the information is 
collected, it cannot be withdrawn; that biometric identification is forever asso-
ciated with the subject, even if the information eventually falls into the wrong 
hands or policies change to a point at which the subject would not have will-
ingly given the biometric data had those policies been in place at the time. 
Currently, fingerprints captured in the US VISIT program are used only to 
control entry by undesirable persons, and to capture exit time and place 
for non-U.S. travelers. Another terrorist attack on U.S. soil, however, might 
change how we look at that data entirely — and cause us to start profiling 
travel behavior using biometric entry and exit data. Not only would that 
potentially violate our agreements with the countries where these travelers 
originated, it would violate the travelers’ understanding of how that informa-
tion was to be used when they supplied it.
Ignoring irrelevant data
Biometric information by its nature may also capture information regarding 
race, ethnicity, gender, and other potentially prejudicial physical characteris-
tics. From long experience, we know that some humans have a hard time 
ignoring prejudicial characteristics if they become known. The potential for 
irrelevant characteristics becoming available in facial-recognition systems 
that capture and save the entire image — and not just the metrics — are 
obvious, but other biometric measures also have this potential as well. At 

59
 Chapter 3: Biometrics in Our Lives 
the very least, some physical differences such as missing limbs, weight, 
height, or eye color will be obvious with several biometric identification 
systems.
The irrelevant data should be discarded, to whatever degree is possible, 
to prevent prejudicial behavior on the part of people with access to the 
biometric data; in addition, regulations must be put in place to protect 
subjects when it’s impossible to eliminate such information. For an example 
of a primitive identification that elicits prejudicial response and even fear, 
consider surnames — and the behavior that ethnically identifiable names 
can produce.
Understanding failure
Failure to authenticate or to be identified by a biometric system can be embar-
rassing and potentially far too revealing. Reasons for failed authentication can 
include
 
 Weight loss or gain
 
 Hair loss
 
 Medical conditions
 
 Body changes due to trauma
 
 Change in personal hygiene
 
 Psychological problems (behavior-based)
Each of these potential reasons for a false rejection can have the potential to 
cause the subject loss of self-esteem, loss of personal privacy, or just embar-
rassment — none of which should not be a potential outcome of logging in to 
the office system in the morning.
 
People implementing biometric systems need to be aware that failures to 
authenticate can be based on highly personal, and sometimes embarrassing, 
factors that have nothing to do with the technology and everything to do 
with users’ private lives. Sensitivity to this issue and good training for 
people operating the systems can help prepare you for somewhat awkward 
situations with your users. We cover similar user support issues in more 
depth in Chapter 9.

60
Part I: Getting Started with Biometrics 
Managing concerns
There are very few ethical concerns related to biometrics that are not coun-
tered by careful consideration of users of the system and their potential 
concerns. As long as the use of such systems is voluntary — and the informa-
tion collected is used only in the precise way described to the subject at 
collection time — biometrics can be used ethically and responsibly.
The U.S. is sorely in need of laws that address privacy more specifically, if 
not a constitutional amendment that addresses a right to privacy. In the 
absence of such constitutional clarity, however, interpretations of legal prec-
edent and current laws will leave citizens wondering what will happen to the 
biometric information gathered by the government, commercial applications, 
and (for example) shopping mall security — and how that information may 
be used. In the meantime, it’s important for users to understand who is get-
ting their hands on such information, and how — whether? — they have 
agreed to protect it and use it.

n what ways can you measure a man (or a woman)? 
With biometrics, those ways range from fingerprints, 
hand scans, and hand-vein scans to retina and iris scans 
and facial recognition. Also there’s handwriting, voice 
recognition, and keyboarding. Don’t forget gait (how you 
walk) and facial thermograph (no need to blush about 
that). Then there are more exotic methods such as odor, 
DNA, and brainwave — and even a few more in this 
section that we don’t want to give away here.

In This Chapter
 Discovering the biometric basis for hand biometrics
 Considering practical implementations
 Finding hand biometrics at work in the world
I
n this chapter, we will get a look at fingerprint and hand-based biometrics 
to understand their strengths and limitations in practical use. Hands and 
fingers are pretty obvious choices for biometric identification since they 
have many characteristics that are unique to the person they’re attached to, 
and we’re used to poking them into places where we wouldn’t want to put 
our eyeballs, ears, or other body parts that have sufficient uniqueness. This 
propensity to use our hands in all kinds of ways also presents unique chal-
lenges for biometrics that we will discuss here as well.
Any biometric measure has what we call a biometric basis, which is the basic 
concept that allows us to use that measure to uniquely identify a person. For 
each kind of biometrics we discuss, we briefly explain the idea behind the 
particular biometric measurement as the biometric basis.
Fingerprints
The inner surfaces of our hands and feet are covered with ridges and fur-
rows. The formation of these ridges happens in our mothers’ wombs, only 
partially guided by our specific genetics. Thus, while identical twins tend to 
have similar characteristics, the details of each area — the minutiae — are 
unique to the individual. With such reliable uniqueness conveniently pack-
aged at our very fingertips, it’s not hard to understand why fingerprints are 
the most popular and widely used form of biometric identification.

64
Part II: Types of Biometrics 
Understanding the biometric 
basis for fingerprints
An image of the pattern of ridges and furrows that cover our hands, feet, and 
fingers can be optically captured at a point in time when we’re certain of the 
identity of the provider, and then later compared to a new image to authenti-
cate that user. Although fingerprints change size as we grow, the structure of 
the ridges and furrows doesn’t change at all over time, except for essentially 
mechanical alterations such as cuts or scars. Figure 4-1 shows a close-up of 
fingerprints.
 
Figure 4-1: 
Close-up of 
fingerprints.
 
Contemplating practical considerations
We use our hands a lot, so the possibility that our prints become marred by 
damage, temporary or otherwise, is much greater than that of damage to, 
say, our eyes or facial structure. Physical damage to your fingertip means it 
doesn’t look the same as when you captured your print for identification — 
and the system may reject your identification if it can’t exactly match one or 
more of the unique characteristics.
Although — in theory, anyway — we could use any portion of our feet and 
hands that have identifying characteristics, in practice the tips of each finger 
or thumb are the easiest to position for imaging. They’re so easy, in fact, that 
each of us leaves perfectly legible copies of our fingerprints on objects we 
touch all the time — as many criminals have learned the hard way. While this 
makes finger- and handprints very convenient as a biometric identification, it 
also makes finger- and handprints among the best-documented (and most 
generally available) biometric identifiers we have.
Misappropriation of fingerprint information isn’t commonplace (yet). In one 
well-published case, however, the German Interior Minister’s fingerprint was 
acquired from a drinking glass at a public event, and then published in a mag-
azine, along with the means to use the print to fool some fingerprint readers. 
As far as we know, nobody has successfully used the published print to

impersonate the minister, but it’s not beyond the realm of possibility. To

Fingerprint, and by extension palm-print, readers come in essentially three 
forms:
 
 Optical: These work much like a regular image scanner, where a light 
source is used to illuminate the surface of the scanner area and a charge-
coupled device array collects an image of the illuminated surface.
 
 Thermoelectric: Thermoelectric scanners use substances that electrical 
properties are influenced by localized heat sources (like your finger) and 
read the electrical variances in the surface to acquire an image of the 
fingerprint.
 
 Ultrasound: Ultrasound imaging of fingerprints bounces very high 
frequency sound waves off the three-dimensional structures of your 
fingerprint and records the 3D model acquired.
Fingerprint identification is famously challenging when the prints are collected 
from wine glasses, door handles, and various blunt instruments. In a biometric 
identification scheme, however, you’re working in a controlled environment — 
and can use that greater control to get more reliable results. In other words, if 
we are consciously trying to leave a good fingerprint when registering on a bio-
metric system, chances are we’ll leave a better one than we might on the 
handle of that big kitchen knife when we have something else in mind.
Scanners for fingerprint biometrics come in a number of shapes and sizes, 
with two basic modes of operation
 
 It scans you: Your finger or fingers remain motionless while a scanning 
device moves across your print to capture it.
 
 You scan it: You move your finger across a stationary scanning device 
while it captures your print.
The second method — moving your finger across a stationary scanning 
device — is only practical because fingerprints are pretty simple to under-
stand, and not much open interpretation in positioning your finger for scan-
ning. This is not true for some other prints — in particular, palm scanning 
(more about that in the next section). Figure 4-2 shows a fingerprint 
scanning device in use today.

Where you will see fingerprint biometrics
Fingerprint biometrics serve as the workhorse of biometric-based identifica-
tion. Typically, you will see fingerprint biometrics on door locks, laptops, 
keyboards, and more formally at points of entry. Three factors have largely 
influenced the widespread use of this tool:
 
 The technology required to do simple fingerprint scanning is relatively 
cheap.
 
 The analysis required to determine a match (or lack of one) doesn’t 
require a lot of computer resources.
 
 We humans seem to be more comfortable sticking our fingers — rather 
than our eyeballs or other body parts — into the ID device.
Say AAA
You’ll often hear security wonks talk about 
Triple A as if normal people would have any 
idea what that means. The As in AAA stand for 
  Authentication: Who are you?
  Authorization: What are you allowed to do?
  Accounting: What is actually being done in 
the name of the authenticated, authorized 
person?
Biometrics is almost always about who you are, 
so we’re mostly dealing with authentication in 
this book. There are, however, some kinds of 
biometrics that folks are starting to look at for 
specific authorization and access applications, 
such as “Based on pulse, pupil dilation, and 
facial blood flow, this person is too angry to be 
allowed to send this e-mail. We’ll let him calm 
down a bit first.” (Perhaps there’s a solution to 
road rage here, similar to built-in breath tests 
in cars. . . .)
For more about Triple A principles, see Chapter 2.

67
 Chapter 4: Fingerprint and Hand Biometrics
On the other hand, simple fingerprint systems have been shown (on some 
occasions) to be relatively easy to compromise by using fake fingers with real 
fingerprints. As a result, fingerprints are typically used for low-to-medium-
security applications (such as logging in to personal workstations) — with 
notable exceptions, such as the US VISIT program (which we discuss in 
Chapter 2). Chances are a more sophisticated biometric method will be used 
for a high-value asset or system.
Fingerprints are sometimes used in higher-security settings when other factors 
are available to corroborate their use. For example, the fingerprints contained in 
the electronic memory of certain passports, or on the new Hong Kong Identity 
Card, are always used in the presence of a security person, such that using a 
fake finger would likely be obvious, unless you are a spy with amazing skin-thin 
fake-print gloves. In that case, you could also have altered your retinas and 
hand-vein structure as well. (In that case, you’d better check: You may be a 
fictional character in a movie.)
Palm Scan
The same kind of ridges and furrows that make our fingertips unique also cover 
the inside of our hands (and feet, for that matter). Our palms also have another 
feature that is unique when studied in detail: the flexion creases. In addition to 
the conspicuous (typically three) flexion creases in each hand — formed at 
around 21/2 to 3 months after conception — a number of finer lines with less 
regular patterns are formed at around 4 months. Combinations of these charac-
teristics are what we refer to when talking about palm scanners and palm prints 
in biometric identification. Figure 4-3 shows what we are talking about here.

Part II: Types of Biometrics 
Understanding the biometric 
basis for palm scanning
Like fingerprints, the ridges and furrows, as well as the flexion and other creases 
in our hands, are formed before we take our first breath of air, and don’t appre-
ciably change throughout our lives. While our wrists and palms are not quite as 
flexible and easy to position for imaging as fingertips, they are still, um, handy 
for placing on scanners of various shapes and sizes to collect an image.
A full image of an entire hand, including the palm and fingerprints, provides a 
large number of minutiae for comparison — more than for fingerprints alone — 
resulting in accurate matches with few false negatives or positives. Palm 
scanning is typically more restrictive about positioning the hand with respect to 
the scanner, which also tends to provide better accuracy, since the palm is more 
likely to be in the same position each time.
The larger number of points collected in a hand scan means that more 
changes, like a paper cut, can occur before the comparison to the original is 
too changed to recognize, which still providing a high level of assurance that 
the palm presented is the same as the reference sample.
Contemplating practical considerations
While palm scanning can be very accurate and the larger scanning area more 
forgiving of changes to the image, palm scanners tend to be more expensive 
than fingerprint scanners for a couple of reasons:
 
 Palm scanners must be more substantial to accommodate everyone’s 
hand and the greater weight of the palm. Something you rest your finger 
on can be much lighter, smaller, and less expensive than something 
intended to scan your palm. Designers have to take into account the fact 
that few people would lean on a finger while authenticating themselves, 
but it’s second nature to lean on something your palm is resting on.
 
 Palms are much larger than fingers, so the imaging surface must be 
much larger as well. In electronic imaging, the size and quality of the 
imaging surface is a large part of the cost of a device. The palm surface 
isn’t naturally a flat, or nearly flat, surface: it’s curved. Getting a really 
good image of the palm requires an imaging surface that’s curved to cap-
ture the print in a relaxed state and not stretched. The mechanics of 
scanning from a curved surface are much more complex and expensive 
than those that scan from a flat surface.
A factor in favor of palm scanning is that while we do tend to leave our finger-
prints on most of the smooth surfaces we touch, we leave palm prints much 
less, and those prints rarely include the flexion crease details. FBI statistics 

69
 Chapter 4: Fingerprint and Hand Biometrics
show that about 20 percent of the prints collected at crime scenes are palm- 
or handprints compared to the other 80 percent that are from fingertips. 
That means palm prints are far less likely than fingerprints to be collected by 
some hacker with the intent to misuse them.
Where you will see palm scan biometrics
Palm scanning is losing ground to hand vein scanning, which we talk about 
next, but it can still be found where security is important — in places such as 
IT co-location facilities and high security building access. Palm scanners are 
good at dealing with changes over time when the authenticating customers are 
a large group, and the time between authentications may be months or years. 
Because palm scanning is forgiving of minor changes to the appearance of the 
palm, it is quite suitable for IT hosting providers, which may only be visited a 
few times each year. In the intervening month you may suffer cuts or abrasions 
to your palm or even scars, but there should still be enough distinguishing 
characteristics to authenticate on the first try. If a more picky method, such 
as fingerprint scanning, were employed in this example, the hosting provider 
would have to deal with frequently re-authenticating customers to allow access 
to their facilities.
Palm scanning and palm printing are now in frequent use in law enforcement 
to provide a more complete analysis of crime scenes. About 20 percent of the 
prints taken from crime scenes are palm prints.
Hand Veins
Unlike other hand-based biometrics, hand-vein biometrics focus not on features 
that are unique to hands and feet, but on veins, which occur throughout the 
body. Although theoretically possible to use the unique structure of veins in 
other parts of the body, the hand’s unparalleled utility for placement on scan-
ners is an important reason that hand-vein scanning — and not, say, elbow-vein 
scanning — is gaining ground as a very secure, relatively nonintrusive method 
for establishing credentials. Another important factor will be familiar if you 
played with a flashlight as a child, shining it through your fingers to see the 
shadowy bones and vessels inside. The hand, fingers, and wrist are all thin 
enough to let light through, illuminating and measuring internal structures — 
especially if we use some interesting tricks with colored light.

70
Part II: Types of Biometrics 
Understanding the biometric 
basis for hand veins
The veins in your body are somewhat similar to the veins in any other per-
son’s body at the macro level, but there are enough differences to make the 
false rejection rates (FRR) and false acceptance rates (FAR) better than any 
other hand-based technology. Because finger and palm prints are used in 
courts of law, sometimes with life and death hanging in the balance, a 
number of studies have been conducted to show just how unique those 
biometric indicators are. Hand veins are never used in such circumstances, 
and the relative uniqueness is less well documented. So far, private studies 
and experience indicates that vein patterns are at least as unique as finger 
and palm prints, and the images lend themselves to analysis better than any 
of the surface methods, making hand veins a generally more reliable method.
An image of the vein structure is taken by shining an infrared, or near infra-
red light, into the hand, which makes the red blood in veins appear black, 
while the surrounding flesh appears white. This results in a high contrast 
image of the vein structure suitable for comparison in subsequent authenti-
cations. Figure 4-4 shows an example of a hand-vein scanner.

 Chapter 4: Fingerprint and Hand Biometrics
Contemplating practical considerations
Hand-vein scanning has nearly all the advantages of other hand-based biomet-
rics, and eliminates nearly all the disadvantages.
Since the scanning technique ignores the surface of the hand, and only cap-
tures internal vein structures, the problem with minor cuts, abrasions, and 
new scars is pretty much eliminated. Nothing short of catastrophic injury to 
the hand will change the image of vein structure enough to produce a false 
rejection.
As with palm scanning, positioning is relatively easy and tends to be consistent 
from one scan to the next — and the larger number of data points (compared 
to fingerprint scans) means that even the unfortunate loss of a finger (for 
example) would not change enough of what the scanner sees to invalidate 
the authentication, and the user would be properly recognized.
One of our complaints against finger- and palm prints is the use of something 
that we leave on everything we touch as a key to authenticating people. The 
unique pattern of the veins in our hands, on the other hand, will not be left 
behind on wine glasses and candlesticks as we go about our day. Even if 
someone did end up with a good image of your hand veins, nobody has dem-
onstrated a simple way to produce a fake hand that will mimic the pattern 
well enough to fool a scanner. (Yet.)
On the ghoulish side of things, a severed finger or hand will typically fool a 
fingerprint or palm-print scanner (so we’re told) but that same finger or hand 
will not produce a good vein image, so it can’t be used to gain access.
It’s alive!
Although this isn’t the most pleasant of subjects, 
the idea of knowing whether a biometric sample 
is alive when it’s presented is important — and 
in a few documented cases, it’s a practical 
consideration. In at least one recorded case, 
a Malaysian businessman lost a finger to car 
thieves who wanted to be able to start the car 
without him later. A system that can see whether 
the subject it’s scanning is alive protects both 
the asset and the personnel by making that 
gruesome gambit useless.

72
Part II: Types of Biometrics 
Where you will see hand vein biometrics
Until recently, hand-vein scanners were seen only in high-security applica-
tions as physical-access authentication devices. As with palm scanning, hand-
vein scanning works well for facilities access. Vein scanning’s ability to ignore 
small changes to the skin and its great FRR and FAR statistics make it a great 
solution when you have a large number of users to track, but not a lot of 
access to those users for updating their biometric information. You will see 
hand-vein scanners in high security facilities for entry points and secure 
room access.
More recently, Fujitsu has released a mouse with an embedded hand-vein 
scanner that brings a very high level of surety to biometric identification at 
the workstation level. Infrared imaging isn’t technologically difficult, so you 
should expect to see various kinds of vein scanning built into smaller 
devices, such as mice, to realize the many advantages of vein scanning over 
the most popular current portable technology, fingerprinting.
Sonar/Ultrasonic
It was a little tough deciding whether we should put sonar and ultrasonic 
technology into Chapter 11, where we discuss biometrics’ future, or here 
because presently it deals primarily with hands. We’ve chosen to compro-
mise and discuss the current work in hand biometrics (because it’s seeing 
some use today), and leave the other sound-based imaging concepts (which 
are still just ideas at this point) for Chapter 11.
In general, this technology relies on the fact that it’s possible to use sound 
waves to map a three-dimensional space with a fairly high degree of accu-
racy. Possibly the best-known use of this approach is medical ultrasonic 
imaging, used to get pictures of the inside of our bodies for diagnostic pur-
poses. Since ultrasonic imaging doesn’t involve potentially harmful radiation 
(as does the use of X-rays), we use it to look at fetuses in real-time video. If 
my friends and family are any indication, there’s a whole generation of chil-
dren coming whose first baby pictures are taken this way (and shared on the 
Internet).
Understanding the biometric basis for 
sonar and ultrasonic biometrics
This chapter follows the progression of scanning, from the simple surface 
images of fingerprints through progressively greater detail of the structures 
in and around the hand. Ultrasonic measurement can detail the internal 

73
 Chapter 4: Fingerprint and Hand Biometrics
structures of a hand — including veins, muscles, bones, and even such 
extreme detail as the 3D structure of the fingerprint from the inside. These 
measurements can be represented as two-dimensional images, or (using a 
technique called ultrasonic holography) store all the 3D information for 
comparison.
As you might expect, the wealth of information about the structures in a 
hand that are collected in this manner are unique to each individual — and 
impossible to duplicate with current technology. Ultrasonic imaging is able to 
detect blood flow, for proof that the hand presented is alive (cloning finger-
prints may be easy, but cloning a living hand is considerably more difficult, 
we think), and might even be able to tell how much stress someone is under 
by looking at heart rate and blood-vessel dilation (indicators of response to 
duress).
Contemplating practical considerations
Most current work in ultrasonic biometrics and the systems that demonstrate 
this approach have focused on the simplest use of the technology: capturing a 
3D image of fingerprints. The more sophisticated kinds of imaging and analysis 
use more information from the hand or other body parts — and they’re just 
around the corner, almost ready for practical use.
The patents filed for these devices claim that they can be produced cheaply 
enough to incorporate into workstations and laptops, which would make this 
one of the few biometric scanning systems available at this level that can 
prove the sample it’s scanning is alive.
Where you will see sonar and 
ultrasonic biometrics
Of all the hand- and finger-based biometric systems discussed so far, this 
is the one you are least likely to see in current use. Several companies and 
universities are currently testing this technology and figuring out where it 
might best be deployed, but not a lot of consumer-ready equipment is out 
where you might see it. Based on the advantages of this technology and the 
relatively low cost of ultrasonic transducers (the things that emit the sound 
waves and receive the echo), this technology could easily show up on lap-
tops in the next couple of years.

his whole chapter focuses on the most commonly used biometric mea-
sure in formal contexts — signatures. Society has long accepted a hand-
written signature as formal authentication for documents. The Talmud 
describes a process for signatures and witnessing signatures as early as 
the third century, and by 500 A.D. the Roman Empire was using the sub-
scripto, a handwritten subscription to the contents of a document for wills, 
which was quickly adopted for other legal documents and shortened to be 
just a representation of the signer’s name.
Since the early Roman uses of signatures there is an unbroken history of 
their use, formalized by England in 1677 in a law called “An Act for Prevention 
of Frauds and Perjuries” — which is the basis for accepting written signa-
tures for document authentication today. We should also note that unlike any 
other form of biometric authentication, signatures also often convey intent. 
Signing a loan form doesn’t just show that you were there and signed the 
document; it shows your intent to agree with the terms of the document. 
Even though (as this chapter shows) signature biometrics fall short techni-
cally when compared to many other biometric measures, the unique element 
of intent makes the biometrics of signatures a more popular technique than it 
would be otherwise.
Although signatures are widely accepted as a tool for authenticating that a 
specific person was present and signed a paper document, the current practi-
cal use is primarily limited to an examination of the signed paper document 
to verify that the signature matches signatures that are known to be from 
that individual, comparing the shapes of letters, the construction of letter 
shapes, and the pressure applied in creating the signature when that informa-
tion is available.

76
Part II: Types of Biometrics 
Signatures in a biometric setting use all of that information, but instead of 
examining an already executed signature, a biometric signature authentication 
system has the opportunity to capture information during the act of creating the 
signature and to use accurate measurements of various other factors to collect 
a good behavioral biometric sample. Although all signatures are (technically 
speaking) examples of a behavioral biometric, this chapter concentrates on 
technology-driven signature biometrics.
Recognizing a Signature
For the last several hundred years, signatures have been recognized using the 
simplest possible method: visual matching. If the signature in question closely 
matched the appearance of a known sample, it would be judged to be from the 
same person as the known sample. As we became more sophisticated about 
signatures and dealing with forgeries, we started looking at nuances of the 
shaping, strokes, and pressure when possible. For example, an original signa-
ture (one that has not been reproduced by photocopying, faxing, or other 
means) retains details such as the varied pressure applied to the paper while 
the signer was creating it. Using sensitive instruments, we can actually mea-
sure the depth of the slight groove created as the pen moved across the paper. 
Depending on the paper, you can also measure the speed of the pen in various 
areas of the signature, depending on how the ink bleeds into the surrounding 
paper because slower strokes deposit more ink, which bleeds more. Strokes 
that leave the paper also tend to trail into a thin point rather than ending 
abruptly. The way this happens varies from person to person.
Many of these items are fodder for biometric signature recognition, since 
they can also be measured directly while the signature is collected. Wet ink 
signatures can also supply other factual aspects that signatures collected 
purely electronically cannot — for instance, ink composition and color, paper 
absorption and bleed, and the aging characteristics of some inks. Although 
these chemical and physical characteristics are interesting and useful for 
authenticating signatures from historical documents or paintings, they’re not 
all that helpful in authenticating a credit-card transaction.
Understanding the biometric basis 
for signature recognition
The most basic form of signature recognition for biometrics is quite similar 
to what happens in fingerprint biometrics. We call this basic form an image-
only biometric signature since we are not using anything about the act of 

77
 Chapter 5: Signature Biometrics
signing — only the image of the signature itself — to authenticate the signer. 
The method collects various characteristics of the signature from a known 
signature sample (or multiple samples) and compares their characteristics to 
the sample presented for verification or authentication.
 
Full comparison of any two signatures will almost always fail, since it’s nearly 
impossible for anyone to exactly duplicate a signature. Minor variances in 
paper, ink flow, pen weight, and muscle control will nearly always introduce 
variations between any two signatures, even from the same person.
To deal with these variations, signature comparison algorithms use other 
characteristics to help correctly identify authentic signatures. In later sec-
tions of this chapter, we explain how movement and pressure are used to 
help with this process; right now we are primarily concerned with the physi-
cal image of the signature.
Although any two signatures from the same person may not be identical, the 
relationships between the letters, the relative sizes of loops and character 
spacing should match. For example, if your lowercase letter t is exactly three-
quarters the height of your letter l, that ratio will generally remain constant 
across all your signatures. Are the two letter ts in Littleton crossed with a single 
stroke or with two? From the left or the right? Do you pause after the second t 
for the cross-stroke, or wait until the end? Do you bother to dot the i or leave it 
undotted? Is your i dot a speck, a line, a circle, or more comma-shaped? Each 
of these characteristics, though it may differ somewhat from the sample, will 
be repeated in ways that can be compared to the original and authenticated.
Letter shape is also an obvious place to look for uniformity and biometric 
uniqueness, but in many cases it’s behaviorally less distinct (and physically 
more subtle) than other gross characteristics of the physical form of the 
signature.
Contemplating practical considerations
Any signature is a tough biometric to do well when all you capture is an elec-
tronic image of the handwritten signature (the technique we examine in this 
section). Two measurements that are important for signature biometrics are 
Failure To Enroll, or FTE (the rate at which a biometric system is unable to 
enroll new users), and Failure To Acquire, or FTA (the rate at which a biomet-
ric system is unable to read a biometric sample from a user). Variations 
between signatures from the same person can result in much higher FTE and 
FTA rates than variations in most other biometrics — which just means the 
system might require several known samples in order to enroll an individual. 
In some cases (including one or both of the authors), repeated signatures are 

78
Part II: Types of Biometrics 
so variant that it can be impossible to enroll in a signature-based system at 
all. Although this may not seem such a big problem, having valid signatures 
questioned too often can be annoying.
Electronic signature pads (see Figure 5-1) are easily available and relatively 
inexpensive if you are only collecting an image. These devices are really just 
very small digitizer pads, so the technology has been around for quite a while 
and other uses have brought the prices down. They are in everyday use in 
thousands of retail locations in the United States and elsewhere, where cus-
tomers swipe their credit cards and sign their names with a special stylus 
that reproduces their signatures digitally on a small display.
 
Figure 5-1: 
An elec-
tronic

In some cases, authentication can mostly ignore the whole step of comparing 
a new signature to a known sample. For example, signatures captured with-
out enrollment (the collection of a known biometric sample, positively associ-
ated with a person in the database) at a point-of-sale system are not 
compared to anything unless (or until) the transaction is questioned. The 
assumption in these cases is that a new signature sample can be collected 
from the purported signer and compared after the fact. Since the number of 
disputed or repudiated transactions is relatively small, these systems have 
no need to incur the increased overhead of trying to match a signature to an 
enrolled identity in real-time.
Since the relative capture cost for signatures is small compared to other bio-
metrics forms like iris or retinal imaging, and the concept of using signatures 
to verify and authenticate is generally familiar, people are tempted to use sig-
nature biometrics in places where it might not be the best technology for the 
job. Even though capture of the signature is inexpensive, the kind of analysis 
required to do a good job of comparing signature images to known samples is 

79
 Chapter 5: Signature Biometrics
pretty involved, and it requires more computer processing power than you 
will find in most embedded systems. This is especially true when the 
required authentication must happen in real time while people wait.
Given that we use signatures to authenticate everything from real estate sales to 
international treaties; it may sound odd to say they shouldn’t be used for serious 
secure biometric authentication — but let us explain. When signatures are used 
on important documents — which really must be authentic — they are generally 
witnessed by a disinterested third party — in some cases, a notary public whose 
primary function is to authenticate signed documents by watching someone with 
a proven identity sign a document — and then using a serialized seal to record 
that fact. In the case of international treaties, there are typically lots of in-person 
witnesses, and thousands or even millions of people watching on television. In 
the absence of witnesses or other corroborating proof, image-only biometric sig-
natures are not appropriate for high security or high stakes use.
As one last practical consideration of image-only-based signature biometrics, 
it’s one of the few forms of biometrics that can be considered discriminatory 
in and of itself. A handwritten signature requires some level of literacy; 
although an X or other mark can sometimes be used on paper documents, an 
X doesn’t contain enough unique information to use for a signature biomet-
ric. Additionally, a number of ailments or age-related conditions cause fine 
motor control to degrade — making signatures illegible and unusable for bio-
metric authentication.
Where you will see image-only 
signature biometrics
Image-only signature biometrics is a rarely applied method. That’s due (in 
part) to the practical limitations described in earlier sections of this chapter. 
In some low-risk applications, however you will definitely see image-only sig-
nature biometrics used.
Electronic signatures are not digital signatures . . .
. . . and neither one really implies a biometric 
sample. A fairly wide range of electronic signa-
tures is possible; it includes any kind of elec-
tronic sound, symbol, or process is affixed to a 
document or record — by someone with sole 
control of that identifier — with the intent to 
sign the document. Digital signatures, on the 
other hand, are a subset of electronic signa-
tures that uses a cryptographic method to 
ensure message integrity and authenticity. 
(Knowing the difference between these two 
signature types will impress everyone who 
already knows the difference.)

80
Part II: Types of Biometrics 
If you have received a package from a certain brown-uniformed delivery ser-
vice in the last several years, you have most likely signed a small electronic 
pad with a stylus to acknowledge receipt. If you have ever had reason to 
question the delivery of such an item, you have seen the pixilated low quality 
image capture of something that could be either a signature, or an antelope 
in a polyester pants suit. Even with the poor capture quality, this generally 
works for the delivery service because they also have a witness to the act 
(the delivery person) and more carefully recorded details like the exact time 
and location where the signature was taken.
Image-only signature biometrics really make sense only when other factors 
are present to validate the signature; there’s only limited biometric informa-
tion available with just the image, and in many cases the quality of the digi-
tized image is poor. Expect to see this technology in places such as 
point-of-sale systems where there is a human witness to the transaction — 
and in places where the intent is to show that a human being was present, 
but repudiation of the transaction is not a big issue.
Stylus Movement Dynamics 
(X and Y Directions)
To make up for the weaknesses in capturing only the image of a signature, two-
dimensional stylus movement dynamics captures more information in the form 
of how the stylus moved while the signature was created. Since the digitizer 
that’s collecting the signature is connected to a computer, it’s perfectly possi-
ble to record and analyze the way the signer moved the stylus across the sur-
face to create the signature — as well as the resulting signature itself.
It wasn’t me — I was nowhere near there
Many years of working in information technol-
ogy have shown both your authors that appar-
ently nobody was anywhere near the site of any 
IT disasters when they occurred. Careful exam-
ination of the logs and video surveillance often 
shows that not to be the case (so we get to have 
that conversation with someone about keeping 
soft drinks out of the computer room). In the 
area of authentication, we’d love to be able to 
do the same thing in a more formal way — to 
accomplish what we call non-repudiation, 
essentially proving that the repudiation of a 
transaction was (ahem) incorrect, and some-
body really was there. Although biometric mea-
sures are generally good at non-repudiation 
(after all, they’re part of who you are), weak bio-
metrics — such as image-only signatures — 
can’t prove much if someone claims the 
signature is a forgery.

 Chapter 5: Signature Biometrics
Understanding the biometric basis 
for stylus-movement dynamics
As with many other biometric measurements, more detail can yield more 
accuracy. Lack of detail in a biometric measurement can lead to problems:
 
 Failure To Enroll (FTE): Not enough detail is acquired to make the mea-
surement unique to an individual, or the variance of the specific data 
acquired makes it unreliable or unacceptable.
 
 Failure To Acquire (FTA): Similar to failure to enroll, except that the 
enrollment process ignored the wide variance in the measured data and 
now the system rejects a valid user too often.
 
 False acceptance: To compensate for wide variance in the measured 
data, acceptance criteria are set too broadly — until (say) Mike’s dog’s 
paw print is considered similar enough to his signature to authenticate 
the pooch as Mike.
 
 False rejection: Even though there is variance in the measured data, the 
system does not compensate, so Mike has to sign his name six times to 
get it exactly the same as when he enrolled.
By capturing additional behavioral characteristics of the act of signing your 
name, it’s possible to improve the odds for accurate authentication and iden-
tification for signature biometrics.
Speeding
One of the things you can watch in two dimensions (okay, three if you count 
time) is the speed at which the stylus moves as a signature is generated. As it 
turns out, the speed with which we form letters and parts of letters is even 
more unique to each of us than the form of the character itself — especially 
when you’re performing the act of signing your name, since people do that so 
often.
A forger trying to forge a signature is interested in just two scenarios involv-
ing the speed of signing:
 
 Forging the name in private with all the time in the world. In this sce-
nario, the forger doesn’t have to even be able to look like they are sign-
ing normally. They can laboriously move the pen across the paper, even 
tracing on top of the sample they have to make sure to get the right 
look. Although we can’t imagine this scenario in a biometric setting, it’s 
the most obvious example of something a good stylus dynamics biomet-
ric would reject, even if the resulting signature were a perfect forgery. 
Since the speed through the act of signing wasn’t even close to the same 
as the recorded biometric information, it would be rejected.

82
Part II: Types of Biometrics 
 
 Forging the name live, in front of someone else. This scenario seems as if 
it might hold more promise for a forger to beat a biometric system, since 
the bad guy has practiced the signature over and over to be able to look 
like he’s signing normally when he creates the forgery. The would-be forger 
would be sorely disappointed by failure in this attempt — and the failure 
could happen because the thing he practiced was exactly matching the 
form of the signature, not the movement of the original signer. Subtleties in 
the speed of the stylus through the act of signing differ from one signer to 
the next; even watching a video of someone signing his or her name isn’t 
much help; trying to match it exactly would be nearly impossible.
Stroking
Another way to apply two-dimensional movement dynamics to signatures that 
is less costly from a computer processing time than speed dynamics is stroke 
order and direction. If we all remembered our lessons from grade school and 
followed them to the um, letter, stroke order and direction would be exactly 
the same for all of us, since we would all be creating letters in exactly the same 
ways. Remember the illustrated diagrams with numbers and arrows for creat-
ing each cursive letter? As it turns out, like many other lessons from grade 
school many of us forgot or abandoned the letter of the law for lettering and 
now create many of our letters our own special unique way. Can any of you 
really execute a proper cursive capital Q anymore? See Figure 5-2 for a 
refresher.
 
Figure 5-2: 
Stroke 
drawing of a 
proper cur-
sive capital 
letter Q.
 
Stroke order and direction by themselves will be largely similar to everyone 
else’s order and direction. In conjunction with other measures, however, 
they can still add uniqueness to a biometric signature.

83
 Chapter 5: Signature Biometrics
Contemplating practical considerations
Unlike pressure dynamics (which we cover next), two-dimensional (2D) 
dynamics are available from almost any digitizer you would use to capture 
signatures. That’s because these devices track the movement of the stylus or 
pen in real time as it moves across the writing surface. Thus any system that 
currently captures image-only signatures could be pretty easily used to cap-
ture two-dimensional stylus-movement dynamics — without changing hard-
ware. The hardware limitations will likely be in the form of computer 
capability at the point of collection or sampling; many of those devices are 
embedded in handhelds or point-of-sale devices with tiny little processors 
and not much memory.
To actually use the additional information, you’ll have to enroll users into the 
system and capture the 2D dynamics for later comparison. This requirement 
matches the use and behavior of other biometric systems, but differs some-
what from the traditional (non-biometric) use of signatures; it also differs 
from some uses of image-only signature biometrics.
Unfortunately, two-dimensional stylus-movement dynamics depends on being 
able to track the movement across a signature that’s very similar to the 
recorded one. People whose signature generally is too variable to enroll with 
image-only signature biometrics will also still have a problem with image and 
stylus dynamics combined.
Where you will see two-dimensional 
signature dynamics biometrics
Anyone who wants to use signature biometrics for a serious security applica-
tion will have to enroll the users with multiple images of each signature — 
enough to provide for normal variance and good samples of the 
two-dimensional speed and stroke dynamics. Doing so eliminates the effec-
tiveness of tracing copies of the proper signature and other forgery attempts. 
This requirement does, however, effectively eliminate the use of two-dimen-
sional signature biometrics in many of the places that are currently appropri-
ate for image-only signature biometrics. Enrollment with multiple signature 
images just isn’t practical in most of those cases.
Since there are simpler, more accurate methods of authentication that use 
biometrics, 2D signature dynamics are likelier to crop up in places that 
already accept normal ink signatures but need further authentication and 
non-repudiation capabilities. Some examples would be loan documents 
(remember signing about a hundred times to buy a house?), authorization 
documents by government officials, and potentially some in-person banking 
transactions.

84
Part II: Types of Biometrics 
Stylus-Pressure Dynamics
Although we tend to think of the motion of signing our name as a purely two-
dimensional movement, microscopic examination of a regular ink signature 
reveals that we apply varying amounts of pressure throughout the process. 
That variable pressure yields varying ink widths and indentations in the paper 
we’re signing upon. You can see examples of this — without the microscope — 
at the beginning and end of strokes where the pen is moving prior to, or just 
after, contact with the paper. That’s where an ink signature characteristically 
narrows to a point as the pressure from the pen is just beginning or trailing off.
Based on this fact, it’s quite possible to also capture information about the 
pressure applied to the stylus in the vertical z-axis (if we assume the paper or 
pad itself is in the x-and y-axis). As a matter of fact, we are three-dimensional 
beings moving a pen or stylus around in a three-dimensional world, so there 
are quite a number of additional biometric measurements to consider when 
we start down this path.
Understanding stylus-pressure and other 
biometric signature dynamics
The pressure we apply during the process of signing is as behaviorally 
unique to each of us as the shape of the signature itself. When experts are 
examining forged signatures, pressure dynamics — as shown by indentations 
on the paper as well as ink width — are typically more important than the 
general look of the letters, since the look itself is far easier to copy.
With sensors in either the signing pad or the stylus itself, it’s quite possible to 
measure the pressure exerted — while simultaneously capturing the image of 
the signature, along with speed and direction of travel for each element of the 
signer’s name. In combination, all these elements yield an amazing amount of 
unique biometric detail regarding the act of signing one’s name — which can 
be compared to the already-enrolled data to authenticate the signer.
While we’re talking about ways to instrument the stylus for measurement, let’s 
also consider what else of interest the pen or stylus can tell us. As an experi-
ment, tape a two-foot-long stick to your pen and watch the end of it as you sign 
your name. Notice all of that wildly exaggerated motion? The extension shows 
you what is already happening at the non-business end of the pen when you sign 
something, just makes it more visible. Well, what if we put a three-dimensional 
accelerometer into the pen or stylus and recorded the motion both at the other 
end of the pen, but pen’s motion through space when you lift it to dot and i, 

85
 Chapter 5: Signature Biometrics
cross a t, or start the next word. Now we’re capturing a lot of information — the 
image of the signature, the speed and direction of the stylus on the pad, the pres-
sures exerted on the pad as the signature is applied, and the movement — in 
three dimensions — of all parts of the pen while the signer signs. Whew! There 
really can’t be much else of biometric interest there, right?
Mostly right. What about the grip and grip pressure of the signer on the pen? 
The shape of the hand, as well as training and experience, will affect how you 
hold a pen — as well as the pressures you apply to the pen as you sign your 
name. To a degree, this starts back into the realm of physiologically based 
biometrics and away from behavioral, but all are quite valid things to look at 
as part of signature biometrics.
If these extreme levels of capture and analysis seem farfetched, you should 
note that prototype pens and signing systems have been tested with all these 
methods except grip and grip pressure — we added those just for fun. But 
you never know. . . . 
Contemplating practical considerations
None of the technology required to capture z-axis information either in the 
form of pressure dynamics or even accelerometer-based pen movement is 
particularly expensive, but most of it is not yet standard equipment in most 
signature-capture devices, so hardware upgrades will be required in most 
cases to capture this additional information.
Although a full three-dimensional picture of pen movement through the act of 
signing adds to the richness of biometric information, it will be considered 
overkill in most cases. The level of information to be processed and analyzed 
in a simple image capture (versus high-resolution capture) of the complex 
movements of a pen in three dimensions is several orders of magnitude dif-
ferent — and only marginally increases the utility of signature biometrics for 
the applications currently using it.
Where you will see 3D signature dynamics
For the most part, this prospect echoes what we said about 2D signature 
dynamics, so we won’t repeat that here. The additional information offered 
by 3D dynamics might be attractive to very high-security applications that 
require a traditional signature in addition to the biometric measurements. A 
government official signing a treaty or a judge signing court documents 
would be likely candidates for this approach.

86
Part II: Types of Biometrics 
Because this sort of signature biometrics provides the highest degree of non-
repudiation, good candidates for using it are those situations that currently 
use a normal signature to authenticate an action with potentially serious con-
sequences, such as
 
 Signing out explosives for the testing range
 
 Signing the sonar contacts shift log
 
 Judge signing legal orders
In these cases, the signature is not being used to authorize an action, but to 
show what responsible party put their name to it.
Heisenberg Applied to Biometrics
Werner Heisenberg noted that when dealing with atomic particles, the very 
act of observing either their location or their momentum changes them; 
observing one aspect changes the other. Thus you can know where a particle 
is or how fast it’s moving, but never both at the same time. The problem is 
that to know where the particle is, you have to bounce a photon off it, and 
when you bounce the photon off the particle, you changed the momentum of 
the atom by some uncertain amount.
The popular example of what is called Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle has 
to do with the act of measuring the temperature of the water in a drinking 
glass. Considering that the thermometer itself will change the temperature 
of the water, one can see that the very act of measuring often changes the 
object being measured.
Accelerate in all directions
Accelerometers are finding their way into home 
electronics everywhere. The most basic ones 
can sense acceleration on a single axis, so 
could sense that your iPhone is oriented verti-
cally or horizontally since the earth pulls every-
thing towards itself — at a rate equivalent to an 
acceleration of 9.8 meters per second per 
second. Some smart people figured out that the 
only time on earth that an accelerometer will 
sense no acceleration at all is in free-fall and 
put them into laptops to shut down the hard 
drives just before impact with the floor to save 
data.
There is a patent filed for capturing a “signing 
action” in midair using a camera, but a wireless 
pen device with accelerometers could accom-
plish something very similar and not require that 
you sign in the general direction of the video 
camera.

87
 Chapter 5: Signature Biometrics
What does that have to do with signature biometrics, you ask? You learn to 
sign your name using pencils and pens and using paper sitting on a desk or 
flat writing surface. Thousands and thousands of practice signatures have 
happened in this environment — and that fact forms the very basis for signa-
tures as a behavioral biometric.
In a perfect world, a signature biometric system would exactly duplicate 
these conditions and we would sign our name using a normal sized pen on 
regular paper while we watched the ink flow and form our regular signature. 
In practice, most current signature-based biometric systems are so far from 
this ideal that it’s amazing they work at all. In effect, the act of observing your 
signature is changing the signature in unpredictable and uncertain ways. 
What we usually see in current signature-based biometric systems:
 
 Styluses that in no way resemble a pen
 
 Styluses that do not imitate the flowing action of a ballpoint or even the 
smooth flow of a fountain pen
 
 Digitizing surfaces that are too smooth, too rough, or just generally 
don’t feel like paper
 
 Styluses with wires coming out the top
 
 Digitizing surfaces that are too small to sign in
 
 Digitizing surfaces that float in space with no place to rest your wrist
 
 Digitizing surfaces that do not allow you to see your signature as you 
create it or that show the signature on a screen time-lagged behind your 
actual signing
Behavioral biometrics really work only when the act of observing the behavior 
doesn’t mess with the behavior. We’re convinced that enrollment-based signa-
ture biometrics works only because the changes to behavior are consistent 
across all samples, and the captured data is never compared to a normal ink 
signature on paper. On the other hand, if a certain brown-uniformed delivery 
service ever needs to definitively prove that Mike signed for a package, he 
expects that the antelope in the polyester pantsuit will not help their cause.

W
hen allocating types of biometrics to specific chapters, it made sense 
to group together everything that had to do with some part of your 
head. Although many of the techniques are vastly different, there are advan-
tages and disadvantages they have in common. In this chapter, we discuss 
retina, facial, and hair biometrics. (Just kidding about hair biometrics — we 
don’t think anyone’s doing that yet.)
All the various head-based biometrics require some sort of imaging that 
involves — you guessed it — your head. Even though many of us are comfort-
able sticking our fingers or hands into something to get a fingerprint, thermal 
scan, or something else that will distinguish us biometrically from others, 
many are somewhat less comfortable doing the same with their heads (after 
all, there are sensitive things in one’s head like brains and eyeballs).
From a psychological perspective, we tend to associate features on the head 
with identity far more than we do other features such as fingerprints, hand 
geometry, or elbow prints. From an early age, we learn to associate facial 
characteristics with individuals and remember things like eye color, ear 
shapes, hair styles, and even nose shapes. On the other hand (so to speak), 
most people could not tell you whether their closest friends’ fingerprints 
were arches or whorls.
These psychological components of how we think of and protect our heads all 
participate in how willing we are to use physiological biometrics that target 
features on our heads. It also colors how accurate and intrusive we expect 
these biometrics to be, especially with respect to facial recognition. Do you 
really want a computer to know how many pores are on your forehead?

Part II: Types of Biometrics 
Identifying a Retinal Scan
The retina is the layer of nerve cells at the back of the eyeball that acts as 
the projection screen for images passing through the cornea, iris, and lens. 
These nerves connect (via the optic nerve) to the brain, and convey the 
information that the brain interprets as vision.
Since the iris has to be open to allow light in for sight, and the cornea and lens 
pass light in both directions, it’s possible to see the retina by just shining a 
light in there and watching it reflect. Optometrists and ophthalmologists use 
this as a non-invasive way to learn things about the health and function of your 
eyes.
As with many physiological biometrics, what were initially medical technol-
ogy and procedures take on new uses as tools for biometric measurement.
Understanding the biometric 
basis for retina recognition
Although the primary functional purpose of the retina is to present the nerve 
cells to light so you can see things, all those nerve cells need support from 
blood cells, which are far easier to photograph than nerves. In 1935, Drs. 
Carleton Simon (no relation to Mike) and Isodore Goldstein discovered that 
the patterns of these blood vessels were unique to each individual and could 
be used to identify people. As with so many advances in science, this was 
discovered while they were studying something completely different (eye 
disease), but they were astute enough to see that this was an important find.
Unfortunately, digital imaging wasn’t available in the 1930s, so identifying 
people using this method involved developing film and manually comparing 
the images to other images taken earlier. Not that surprisingly, the practical 
use of this idea in real-time biometric authentication had to wait until the 
mid-1980s.
With modern technology, we can take a digital image of the retina while the 
user’s eye focuses on a specific point, and then use computers to compare 
the new image with a known sample.
Since the retina is well protected within the eyeball — unlike fingers or 
palms — it’s not subject to wear and tear. The retina is also naturally stable; 
it doesn’t change much over a person’s lifetime. This uniqueness, combined 
with lifetime stability and protection from damage, makes the retina a very 
useful and accurate feature for biometric measurement. Figure 6-1 shows a 
cut away side view of an eye with retinal veins.

Retinal veins
Contemplating practical considerations
In practice, retinal biometric authentication and identification involves having 
you sit very still for several seconds while focusing on a specific point in space 
and a low-intensity infrared light is shined into your eyeball — where it images 
a small, specific capture area of the retina. Typically the light and camera appa-
ratus must be no more than about 3 inches from your eye and shielded from 
ambient light. (Did we mention that you can’t move your head at all during this 
process?)
Even though retinal scanning is considered very accurate, the use of this bio-
metric seems to be waning as other accurate measures come into play — 
such as iris scanning, which can be done comfortably at a reasonable 
distance using ambient light. People who work at (or visit) highly secure 
facilities such as military installations or power plants can still be convinced 
to stick their heads in a hood and stare at the marker — but almost any other 
kind of facility is looking for quick, non-intrusive-but-accurate measurements.
Due to the way retina scans are acquired, some basic training is required to 
use these systems successfully; typically that training occurs when a person 
is enrolled in the system. This makes retinal scanning unsuitable for places 
that plan to authenticate or identify the general public — for example, ports 
of entry.

92
Part II: Types of Biometrics 
Where you will see retinal biometrics
Because of the limitations for distance, the training component, and the nega-
tive perception by many users of something that scans inside the eyeball, it’s 
quite likely that you will not see retinal biometrics anywhere at all. Less intru-
sive methods that show characteristics not only better but from a distance — 
including better and more accurate eye-based methods — are available. 
Retinal imaging seems to be a dying technology.
There are still some very-high-security installations that have not converted 
their retinal biometrics gear to something newer yet — but we’d expect to 
see them adopt iris recognition just as soon as they can put the project and 
budget together to do so. It’s the coming thing. As of early 2008, diligent 
searches for a manufacturer still making retinal imaging gear that isn’t 
specifically for medical purposes turned up nothing.
Iris Scanning
The iris is the colored part of the eye that expands and contracts to allow 
more or less light in. For most people, this is the part of the eye that we 
remember most about someone, and is most commonly used as a general 
descriptor on such documents as driver’s licenses and passports. In some 
ways, eye color alone has been used as a gross biometric indicator for 
centuries — “It was the green-eyed kid who took my candy. . . .” These 
days we have the technology to be more accurate.
Not long after Simon and Goldstein published their paper about the unique-
ness of blood vessels in the retina, ophthalmologist Frank Burch proposed 
the idea that the iris was also sufficiently unique for identification purposes. 
The timing and development of usable technology for those purposes follows 
almost exactly the same path as retina identification: Aran Safir and Leonard 
Flom patented the concept in 1987, and John Daugman patented his algo-
rithms in 1994. Thus a working iris-based identification system was born.
Due to the patents on iris recognition and the further patents on the algo-
rithms for working with the iris images, owned by Iridian Technologies, all 
the available commercially available iris recognition technologies are created 
by or licensed by Iridian. As with any successful technology that solves a real 
world problem, there are a number of groups working on ways to accomplish 
the same task without infringing on the Iridian patents. No strong second 
player has emerged in this area yet.

93
 Chapter 6: Retina and Facial Biometrics
Understanding the biometric 
basis for iris recognition
The basic concept behind iris biometrics is that the complex structures of the 
iris are unique to each individual and can be captured with a simple visible-
light camera. A subject is positioned so the iris can be digitally imaged; after 
image capture, the Daugman algorithms are used to abstract the iris data and 
compare it to previously enrolled irises for authentication or identification.
If you’ve never done it before, grab a mirror and get a good look at the com-
plexity of your own iris. You will see structures in the iris (see Figure 6-2) 
that range from radial to circular and even freckles. Something as seemingly 
simple as the base color of your iris is actually attributable to both pigmenta-
tion (in the form of melanin) and the texture of tissue and blood vessels in 
the iris. The structures you see are stable from about the age of one year; 
they don’t change appreciably throughout your life, barring a disease that 
affects the eye physically.

Here’s look-
ing at you,

Iris
Contemplating practical considerations
Iris recognition may be the most promising of all the physiological biometrics 
currently in use due to its very high accuracy, non-intrusive sampling tech-
niques, and reliance on only normally visible attributes.
Irises can be accurately imaged at distances of at least 3 meters, through 
glasses and car windshields while the subject is in motion. Iris-based identifica-
tion has been done using old photographs taken several feet away and with the 
subject in a natural pose, but in those circumstances, the comparisons to 
known samples must be done the hard way: with humans doing the actual 
laborious comparison. Automatic comparisons are possible in more controlled 
conditions — but without the intrusiveness of stopping subjects and getting 
them to stare at a target while an infrared camera images their retinas from 
inches away.

94
Part II: Types of Biometrics 
Installed systems that have performed trillions of iris comparisons report per-
fect scores for eliminating false acceptance and false rejections. So far, iris 
recognition seems to combine the high accuracy of retina technologies with 
the ease of acquisition common to many behavioral biometrics.
In high-security, low-throughput applications, proof that the iris is attached 
to a living person is fairly simple to accomplish as well: Blinking on command 
and/or showing light-based pupil contraction and redilation would be hard to 
imitate convincingly.
Where you will see iris biometrics
Not too surprisingly, given the advantages of iris biometrics, many places are 
already using this technology — and many more installations are in the plan-
ning stages. The accuracy of the technology appeals to high-security applica-
tions such as military and national infrastructure; and its remote-acquisition 
capability and ease of use lend themselves to high-throughput technology 
and screening applications (such as airports and checkpoints).
The United Arab Emirates uses iris-recognition technology to screen all 
incoming visitors against a list of thousands of persons who have been 
expelled from the UAE. Border authorities have done 200 billion cross-com-
parisons between IrisCodes (the mathematical representation of the iris 
information) — and have caught 46,000 persons illegally attempting to reen-
ter the UAE — with no false matches.
In the United States, the Child Project is an iris-based system for helping to 
identify and return missing children; as of September 2007, 1,400 sheriff’s 
offices were participating. The company that supplies the technology for the 
Child Project (BI2 Technologies) also supplies Senior Safety Net and the 
Inmate Recognition and Identification System (IRIS).
The U.S. is using iris-recognition technologies in Iraq to control access to 
facilities, but has so far resisted the temptation to do more than capture 
facial images on passports.
Facial Imaging
As human beings, we learn to use facial images to identify people, starting with 
our first views of Mom and Dad. We get so amazingly good at this process that 
it’s virtually impossible to fool us with a substitute face that’s almost like the 
one we know — and we’re fairly good at penetrating disguises such as false 
moustaches, beards, makeup, and the like, especially when dealing with a face 
we know well. As an example, Mike’s 18-month-old niece can identify him from 
a photo taken before she was born — minus his new goatee.

95
 Chapter 6: Retina and Facial Biometrics
We further extend our skills in facial recognition to interpret expressions with 
great subtlety and accuracy, so that we can say things like “That is my friend 
Eddie, and he looks happy.” For the human brain, which has devoted lots of 
space and power to this task, the recognition task is simple; children master it 
long before they can speak, and it happens nearly instantaneously after they 
have it down. For some, the storage and recognition are so extensive that any 
face, once captured, will be familiar — even years later, when other contextual 
information about the person associated with the face is long gone. (Now, if we 
could just remember where we saw that person before . . .)
Computers, unfortunately, do not have the fantastically well-trained neurons 
that we do in this area, so they aren’t nearly as good at faces as we are under 
most circumstances. Using specialized imaging hardware, computers are 
much better at seeing through smoke, costumes, and other disguises — but 
then they fall back on recognition algorithms that still fall far short of what 
your built-in ones can do.
Understanding the biometric basis 
for facial imaging biometrics
Facial-imaging biometrics are based, as you might think, on comparing informa-
tion from two digital images of faces to see whether they match. The problem is 
that faces offer all sorts of challenges when you try to make direct comparisons, 
so you should note the careful language in the previous sentence — “information 
from two digital images” is not the same as “two digital images.”
For a good example of why we can’t just take two pictures and see whether 
they’re identical, take a look at the angelic picture your sibling sent you of 
your four-year-old nephew. Now, hold that picture up and suggest to your 
nephew that he make the most horrible scary face he can, without using his 
hands or artificial fangs. (As a side project, take a picture of this new face and 
send it back to your sibling, titled “Reality.”) Do you think that these two pic-
tures would indicate these are even the same species when compared 
directly to each other? Typical changes to facial appearance that would 
throw off direct image comparison include (but are likely not limited to)
 
 Addition or removal of facial hair
 
 Body piercing
 
 Change in hair style
 
 Makeup
 
 Lighting changes from original image
 
 Different angle from original image

Because it’s really not possible to rely on directly comparing the images pixel 
by pixel, scientists have spent quite a lot of time figuring out how to repre-
sent the essential information in a face mathematically so that they can cor-
rect for cosmetic and imaging differences. The math is fairly intricate and not 
appropriate for this book, but we include a short description of the principles 
involved for the three main methods used in facial recognition.
Elastic Bunch Graph Matching (EBGM)
This method uses methods that closely match the fields in the visual cortex 
of higher vertebrates (including us). The mathematical model that we verte-
brates seem to use is something called a two-dimensional Gabor function, 
which (you should be pleased to hear) we won’t attempt to fully explain here. 
In effect, this method identifies local landmark features of a face such as the 
corners, top, bottom, and center of the eyes, assigns some characteristics of 
the image surrounding that landmark, and then compares these characteris-
tics with a new set of landmark characteristics from a new image.
This method has some advantages over other current methods in recogniz-
ing facial images that are not oriented exactly the same way as the sample, 
but like the vertebrates it imitates, it requires some training to be able to 
work well with a given pool of faces.
Principal Components Analysis (PCA) 
PCA uses linear algebraic techniques to reduce facial image information to 
the smallest set of uncorrelated components and then compares the dis-
tances between the features of two sets of facial image data reduced in the 
same way to see if they are the same. With respect to the reduction and “cor-
related components” consider the laugh lines near the corner of your mouth. 
If there is more than one on each side, the nearby ones are very similar in 
size and direction, so that whole feature can likely be compressed to a repre-
sentative line that’s more like an average of the two.
This technique allows the system to represent the necessary information for 
comparing two faces using very little information once the mathematical rep-
resentations have been accomplished — which is nice if you have a lot of 
faces to store. On the other hand, it suffers a bit from the fact that facial 
images have to be normalized — meaning they all have to be the same size 
and the eyes, nose, and mouth in the sample images must be lined up before 
the PCA is applied.
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
LDA is a statistical technique that attempts to generate a good predictor of 
what characteristics a given face might exhibit, given a series of samples called 
a class. Essentially, the idea here is to toss out facial features that seem to vary 

97
 Chapter 6: Retina and Facial Biometrics
greatly from sample to sample, and concentrate on those features that remain 
relatively the same. At the same time, LDA tries to choose predictors/features 
that maximize the differences between faces that are known not to be the same.
As with any statistical model, LDA’s accuracy is heavily influenced by the 
class samples it’s given to compare. If some of the facial image samples that 
are used to work out the predictor are not very representative of the face in 
question — that will have a negative effect on the predictor function and the 
system’s ability to recognize faces.
Other methods
Given the complexity of computer comparison of facial characteristics, it 
might not surprise you to hear that there are actually many methods being 
explored for facial recognition, some related to the methods described in the 
preceding sections, some radically different. If you’re mathematically inclined 
and interested in some of the other methods, look up Independent 
Component Analysis, Evolutionary Pursuit, Kernel Methods, Trace 
Transform, Active Appearance Model, and Hidden Markov Models. Nearly all 
these are even more complicated than what we’ve already described here. 
Maybe we’ll include them in our next book, Mathematical Algorithms for 
Computerized Facial Recognition For Dummies. (We’re kidding — we think.)
Contemplating practical considerations
Based on the methods required for recognizing faces, you should expect to 
use some very fast computers and possibly even some specialized proces-
sors to accomplish accurate facial recognition in a reasonable amount of 
time. Slower computers or faster response times will yield unacceptable false 
rejection or false acceptance rates (likely both).
Remember too that even the best facial-recognition system is not as accurate 
as something like iris recognition — or even fingerprint recognition. Nearly 
all current methods for recognizing faces have some way of accounting for 
poor capture angles, expression, and other issues of this nature. These prob-
lems are inherent to facial recognition; they make the kind of accuracy avail-
able in other methods impossible.
Where you will see facial 
recognition biometrics
Probably the best-known use of facial biometrics was at the 2001 Super bowl in 
Tampa Bay, Florida. The idea was that the Super Bowl was a high-profile target 
for terrorist attacks — and if officials were to capture images of 100,000 people 
as they walked through turnstiles and other checkpoints, then they could use 

98
Part II: Types of Biometrics 
facial biometrics to compare those images to a database of known criminals — 
and, in the event of a positive match, arrest them before they could start doing 
anything harmful.
Privacy advocates raised alarms at the idea of monitoring and identifying 
100,000 private citizens without their knowledge or permission, but it turns 
out that both sides kind of had the wrong idea. Privacy folks didn’t mention 
that to be recognized (identified) by any biometric system, you must first be 
enrolled — that is, your biometric information would already have to be 
stored in the system. 99.9 percent of the people entering the stadium were 
not enrolled anywhere, much less in a criminal database so their privacy was 
relatively unharmed. The officials needed to remember that under those cap-
ture conditions, you’re lucky to authenticate a known face; actual identifica-
tion is very difficult.
A live test of facial recognition at Palm Beach International Airport in 2002 
failed to match volunteer employees (who had been enrolled in the system) 
about 53 percent of the time. Problems cited included eyeglasses, imaging 
angle, subject movement, and lighting. In a test that included 5,000 passen-
gers and a database of 250 photographs, the system raised false alarms about 
two or three times an hour — and failed to identify anyone correctly.
Facial recognition is at its best in controlled conditions when comparing images 
taken under identical conditions. Although that sounds pretty restrictive, it’s 
commonly used by law enforcement to compare mug shots to pictures acquired 
for this purpose — and, in some cases, to compare ID photographs from pass-
ports or driver’s licenses to samples gathered in controlled conditions.
Upcoming Head-based Biometrics
There are a couple of head-based biometrics that are not yet mainstream, but 
have a fair amount of research backing them up — and interesting potential: 
ear and facial thermograph. Since you aren’t likely to see them anywhere 
soon, we don’t present any practical considerations (which would be purely 
artificial at this point). We do want to present the ideas here because this 
industry moves very fast, and we expect to see commercial systems using 
these methods eventually.
Recognizing ears
Some people look at ears, and some don’t. We don’t know how many times 
we’ve heard comments about the shape or characteristics of someone’s ear 
and been completely in the dark, since we aren’t ear people. Apparently the 

99
 Chapter 6: Retina and Facial Biometrics
folks who do look at ears are on to something, though; studies show that ears 
are at least as rich in individuating characteristics as faces. Of course, since 
you don’t smile or talk through your ears, they’re easier features to get stable 
images of (unless, of course, they’re covered by hair or a hat or adorned with 
little shiny objects).
The techniques and processes used for recognizing ears is nearly identical to 
those used for faces, so we won’t delve into the biometric basis or practical 
considerations for ear biometrics as a section of its own. But note the advan-
tages of ears: Their relatively stable appearance (earrings aside) and the 
amount of unique information they offer make them a better biometric than 
facial imaging, given the same circumstances. There is a great potential for 
using ear recognition as a multimodal biometric along with facial recognition 
to provide accuracy that neither method could produce alone. Multimodal 
biometrics use more than one biometric characteristic at the same time to 
provide greater accuracy for a biometric method that may be less accurate 
but in use for its ease of acquisition.
Ear recognition is fairly new on the scene and not well commercialized at this 
point, but the clear advantages over facial recognition in accuracy and ease 
of capture should move this technology along pretty quickly.
Recognizing facial thermographs
Another way of looking at faces (if you’re a computer-imaging device) is to 
use infrared imaging techniques to get a picture of the thermal output from a 
face. This thermal output — essentially heat — is largely generated and con-
trolled by the veins near the surface of a face; it can provide sufficiently 
detailed and unique information to serve as a biometric measure.
Unlike other vein-imaging biometrics, thermographic facial images are typi-
cally taken from a distance; the technology can’t yet capture as much vein 
detail as (for example) hand-vein biometrics, which we cover in Chapter 4. At 
a distance, the thermal information from the veins is somewhat more diffuse, 
and this lack of detail can cause problems with accuracy.
Additionally, mood, health, exertion levels, and a number of other factors can 
change the thermographic map of a face — sometimes so much that collected 
biometric samples no longer match. Environmental factors (such as partial sun 
heating a portion of the face) can also throw off this kind of recognition.
With all these problems and capture difficulties, why would you ever use 
facial thermographs as a biometric? Well, the trick is not to use it exclusively. 
It’s an excellent supplemental (or multimodal) technique when used with 
facial imaging; it doesn’t rely on visible light, so it sees right through many 
disguises. A facial thermograph through a Halloween mask looks just like that 
same person without the Halloween mask.

100
Part II: Types of Biometrics 
Facial thermography also captures more than just identity. For some applica-
tions, the idea that you could know something about the mood, stress, or even 
alcohol consumption of the person being authenticated or identified is a plus.

n addition to the biometric measures that we cover in the previous chap-
ters of this part, a number of biometric measurements are not heavily 
used but show promise — for the future, in a specific area, or both. In a few 
special cases (such as brainwave and DNA biometrics), we discuss these 
measures strictly because if we left them out, you’d ask us why — not 
because they have any immediate practical value or promise for the near 
future.
When it comes right down to it, you can base a physiological biometric on 
the detailed imaging of just about any biological characteristic of a human 
being — and behavioral biometrics use almost anything we do often enough 
to become expert at, whether it’s tying your shoe or snapping your fingers. 
For example, given enough sampling detail, we’re pretty sure that the pattern 
of hair growth on your scalp would yield a sufficiently unique biometric to 
use for identification and authorization. Unfortunately most people would 
have to get their heads shaved before anyone could get a good look at the 
pattern. We’re guessing a fair number of people would object to that (for the 
sake of a biometric measurement, anyway), so follicle-placement biometrics 
probably won’t get a lot of attention any time soon.
Here we cover a lot of biometrics that may have potential problems just 
now — whether from a societal, technological, or legal perspective — but 
also have redeeming characteristics that make them interesting.

102
Part II: Types of Biometrics 
Recognizing Speech
Human speech is another one of those things that babies start learning how 
to tell apart early — starting with mom and dad and branching out to family 
and friends pretty quickly. When friends call us on the phone, we generally 
don’t have to ask “Who is this?” We know very quickly from the sound of the 
voice who we’re talking to.
For each of us as individuals, the list of recognizable voices is actually pretty 
long — including regular baristas, actors, musicians, radio personalities, and 
co-workers, in addition to friends and family. For most people who are reason-
ably active socially, the list expands to at least a couple of hundred people 
whom they can accurately recognize by just the sound of their voices.
Using this speaker-recognition capability to authenticate someone actually 
precedes widespread access to digital audio processing; earlier systems used 
analog filters to determine matches. In the mid-1970s, Texas Instruments 
built a prototype system that was tested by the U.S. Air Force and the MITRE 
Corporation. Once the cost of digital processing of analog voice signals 
became cost-effective in the late 1980s, many companies and academic study 
groups started working on ways to use speech for identification purposes. 
Take a look at Figure 7-1 for a graphic representation of a human voice.

Unlike most visually based recognition using analog images (which require 
computers to interpret relatively large amounts of two-dimensional image 
data before they can start comparing), computer voice recognition can use 
exactly the same sample as a human being would — or possibly more, 
through the use of sensitive microphones.

103
 Chapter 7: Other Types of Biometric Identification Schemes
Understanding the biometric basis for 
speaker recognition
Speaker recognition is one of the few biometric measures that combine both 
physical physiological characteristics (your larynx) and behavioral charac-
teristics (how you pronounce words). As it turns out, either one of these 
characteristics by themselves might be a reasonably unique biometric mea-
sure, so the two combined become a reasonably accurate biometric.
There are ways to make speaker recognition even more accurate by training 
the system using phrases that will then be used to match. For example, “My 
voice is my password, verify me” is a lot simpler to match if the system has 
learned how you say that exact phrase over a number of samples. Speaker 
recognition systems that try to know how you speak, no matter what you are 
saying, are more complicated and use way more computer time.
Physiological basis
When we speak, a surprisingly complex mechanism is activated that all work 
together to make the sounds involved in human speech. The physical size 
and structure of each of these structures contribute to the unique sound 
qualities of your voice. While it’s tempting to think of the voice box or larynx 
and vocal cords as the only items that really influence how you sound, the 
human voice also uses the resonant spaces in the sinus and oral cavity to 
produce speech. It’s pretty simple to test this — just plug your nose and see 
how the sound changes by just restricting the sinus. If you think back to the 
last time you battled the common cold, you’ll recall the drastic changes in 
tonal quality that full sinuses cause.
The tongue and lips also physically affect how sounds are made, but more on 
the behavioral level than physiological. The ways your lips and tongue make 
sounds are learned behaviors — which you apply to match the ways you 
specifically grew up speaking (with possibly just a little influence from the 
shape and physical structure of your lips and tongue).
Speaker recognition is not speech recognition
They might sound almost the same, but while 
speaker recognition is focused on biometri-
cally identifying someone by matching voice 
characteristics, speech recognition is the sci-
ence of translating the human voice into text or 
commands. For example, you say “Mrs. Wright 
writes to right wrongs” and the computer prints 
“Mrs Right rights to write wrongs.” Speaker 
recognition is the science of training the com-
puter to recognize when someone says “Mrs. 
Wright writes to right wrongs” and it determines 
that’s Mike Simon! Note also that speaker rec-
ognition is also sometimes referred to as voice 
recognition.

104
Part II: Types of Biometrics 
Behavioral basis
An old friend once told Mike that he spoke what little German he knows as if 
he’d been taught by someone from Atlanta. This friend was born and raised 
in Berlin and had lived in the United States for decades before she heard 
Mike butchering her mother tongue; she was accusing Mike of speaking 
German with a pronounced Southern accent, and not Southern Germany 
either.
The point is that the sound of our speech is a learned thing, heavily influ-
enced by our learning environment. Mike’s Spanish language skills were nur-
tured by spending years working alongside Mexican migrant workers in the 
strawberry fields of Oregon as a child, and while his vocabulary is still at a 
3-year-old’s level, Mexicans have told him that he sounds Mexican until he 
messes up sentence structure.
Our speech and language is influenced by geography, education, and even 
our jobs, to a point where a good human analyst can tell a lot about where 
you grew up, currently live, and potentially, do for a living by listening to you 
for a while. We’ll discuss the language aspects of this later in this chapter in 
the section on linguistic analysis.
Factoring in heredity and environment
Heredity has influence over the physical factors that influence speech, and 
environment influences the rest. So, what happens when heredity creates a 
vocal apparatus that’s shaped a lot like your father’s and you also happen to 
learn how to speak from him? From personal experience, I know that from the 
age of 16 until I left home nobody could tell the difference between my father 
and me on the phone. Both of us would have to stop people who thought 
they were talking to the other. This pattern included employers, friends, and 
(in Mike’s case) girlfriends and teachers; all of whom knew our respective 
voices quite well. For a detailed look at the apparatus that produces the 
human voice, take a look at Figure 7-2.
Twins: The people biometrics loves to hate
Throughout this book, you will see references 
to how various biometrics deal with identical 
twins. If you read a lot of literature on biometric 
studies, you’ll no doubt imagine that biometrics 
researchers believe a small army of identi-
cal twins must be poised to descend on their 
precious idea and destroy it out of some twinly 
spite. In fact, most researchers are just using 
identical twins as the worst-case scenario for 
most biometric tests. For twins, the bio part of 
biometrics is nearly identical (barring physical 
damage) — and that can throw a wrench in the 
metrics part of biometrics (which depends on 
unique features). We’re not ruling out the army 
of twins; we just don’t have any real proof.

We’ve never tested a voice-recognition system to see whether it would pick 
out the subtler differences between our voices, but the point here is that quite 
possibly the “identical twin” test would struggle a bit with speaker recognition.
Contemplating practical considerations
Speech has some interesting advantages that are hard to duplicate in terms 
of using existing hardware for good remote authentication or identification. 
For example, with a good phone connection it’s possible to consider a system 
that verifies who is on the other end of a phone conversation using speaker 
recognition. If you’re worried about someone capturing and replaying a 
passphrase, you could even ask semi-random questions and use general 
attributes of the voice rather than recognition of specific words.
Capturing high-quality speech samples is easy, using technology that has been 
undergoing constant improvement since the early wax-cylinder days. Any ten-
dollar microphone is capable of recording sounds from 100 to 15,000 Hz, and 
the human voice ranges only from about 300 to 3,500 Hz. The harmonics of the 
human voice are highly individual, and based on the structure of the voice 
apparatus itself; they can range above 3,500 Hz, but not as high as 15,000.

106
Part II: Types of Biometrics 
Since capturing samples is pretty easy, and the analysis is usually limited to 
transformations of a two-dimensional waveform, the hardware required to do 
speaker recognition is inexpensive. Only these things keep speaker recogni-
tion from widespread adoption:
 
 It’s easily confused by ambient noise, even when excellent noise-
cancellation filters are used.
 
 It can be affected by transient conditions such as common colds.
 
 It has a tarnished reputation from systems installed over a decade ago 
that were not very accurate.
Where you will see speaker recognition 
biometrics
Speaker recognition is generally well accepted by people as a reasonable bio-
metric to use; folks won’t often object to its use (as they might with more 
intrusive mechanisms such as retinal or DNA sampling). Oddly, speaker rec-
ognition is more inherently subject to privacy abuses than most other forms 
of biometric identification; it can be used to identify people using their own 
spoken words. In Chapter 3, we take a look at the idea that free speech is 
impaired in an environment where you can always be identified by record-
ings of your very speech.
For a short while, something called VoicePrint was included with Mac OS 9, 
but reportedly it had accuracy problems; the false-rejection rate was around 
40 to 50 percent in a room that wasn’t absolutely silent. OS X doesn’t seem to 
have anything like that included, possibly because of the reliability problems.
Even with some accuracy issues, the fact that speaker recognition can be 
accomplished via telephone is just too attractive for people not to use. To 
handle the accuracy problems, most folks who use speaker recognition at all 
are using it as one of multiple factors to authenticate a transaction. For exam-
ple, you might initiate a transfer of funds online, and have the bank ask you 
for a phone number it can use to call you. The transaction then pauses until 
the bank’s automated system calls the provided number — and uses speaker 
recognition to verify that the person answering is the account holder.
DNA as a Biometric Recognition 
Technique
Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), contained in each cell of all living things, is the 
basic blueprint for the organism. Starting in the late 1800s, scientists have 

107
 Chapter 7: Other Types of Biometric Identification Schemes
been getting better and better glimpses of what DNA really is and how it’s 
structured. In 1953, Watson and Crick published what is now known to be the 
first structurally accurate model for DNA, based on X-ray images taken by 
Rosalind Franklin (but sadly without crediting her).
Unlike the blueprints of a home, the DNA in our bodies is almost entirely 
unique to us as individuals, the exceptions being identical twins. For the 0.004 
percent of the population that are identical twins, DNA will yield 100 percent 
false acceptance. For those same twins, biometrics based on phenotype — as 
determined by the interaction of genes with the environment in the uterus (for 
example, fingerprints or irises) — will differentiate correctly every time.
For the rest of us, our genetic material is unique and could be used to identify 
or authenticate us.
Understanding the biometric 
basis for DNA
In theory, DNA is a wonderful biometric measurement. It’s known to be 
unique and the process of comparing one person’s DNA to another is well 
known and not prone to errors like almost all the image-based biometrics. In 
theory, we could do a complete one-to-one comparison of one person’s DNA 
to a known sample and have near-perfect accuracy. With certain exceptions 
(those darn identical twins again . . .).
To accomplish a DNA comparison, cells must be collected from the person 
being identified or authenticated, which are then processed to extract the 
DNA to be compared to a known sample. The cells to be extracted can come 
from blood, skin cells, or a swab from the inside of your cheek. Using current 
methods, the DNA is then extracted from the sample and duplicated many 
times so we have a large enough sample of DNA to examine.
Contemplating practical considerations
The current state of the art in DNA testing is really only useful for scientifi-
cally provable identification if hours or days can elapse while the identifica-
tion is performed. Myriad — one of the companies that conducts genetic 
testing on the remains of 9/11 victims for identification purposes — said that 
the time to process a sample in its high-volume environment was about two 
weeks. A lab worker with nothing else to do but process a single sample 
could likely cut that time to hours, but nothing like a real-time turnaround is 
possible using current technology. So using DNA authentication to log in to 
your e-mail probably won’t happen any time soon.

108
Part II: Types of Biometrics 
Another thing to understand about current methods for DNA comparison is 
that nowhere near the complete DNA of an individual is used to make a com-
parison. In fact, the most common method, short tandem repeat (STR) analysis, 
looks only for several series of repeating base pairs that don’t even code any-
thing genetically. These repeating pair sequences act as filler or garbage in the 
DNA; they’re quite unique in length — repeating once in every 10 billion — 
when comparing all 13 recognized markers. Since this method doesn’t even 
look at the part of our DNA that encodes genes, it’s easy to imagine that a test 
using the rest of a person’s DNA would be even more accurate.
Since the current tests take days or many hours at best, a more complete 
comparison that isn’t just looking at the length of garbage or spacer 
sequences but actually looking at genetic encoding would almost certainly 
take months or even years with current technology.
DNA comparisons also require a sterile laboratory and trained technicians to 
provide good quality assurance for the process. Automated robotics are a 
part of any high-throughput DNA lab, but humans still are an important part 
of the process for now.
Where you’ll see DNA as a biometric 
recognition technique
First, let’s talk about where you will not see DNA used as a biometric mea-
sure. Until technology catches up with science fiction films — Gattaca (1997) 
in particular — you will not see DNA used for any authentication tasks. For 
real-world authentication, a wait of days, weeks, or even hours is typically 
not acceptable; it’s highly unlikely that you’ll see DNA used in this way.
Public or high-throughput identification is another area that DNA will likely 
not penetrate for a number of years due to the highly invasive nature of grab-
bing a few cells from you to test. Even if methods for making the comparisons 
were fast enough, it’s unlikely that any large public group would agree to give 
up some cells, just to be identified. 
Probabilities and DNA
The processes used in DNA matching are 
deterministic — given a specific DNA sample, 
they will always yield the same results when 
done properly. The outcomes, on the other 
hand, are probabilistic: The markers compared 
are not the complete DNA of either the known 
sample or the presented one, so duplicates that 
are not from the same person are possible (just 
not very likely).

109
 Chapter 7: Other Types of Biometric Identification Schemes
You will continue to see DNA matching used to help identify persons — pri-
marily from cells left at crime scenes — because the processes used to make 
the comparison are scientifically accurate and deterministic rather than 
probabilistic (as is the case with fingerprint matching). The accompanying 
sidebar explains why.
Gait-Recognition Biometrics
Have you ever seen someone in the distance and immediately known who it 
was, even without seeing that person’s face? If you have, then there’s a good 
chance that what you were subconsciously analyzing was the way that 
person was moving, and the movement itself was enough for you to deter-
mine who it was. Studies have shown that this talent is a fairly weakly 
expressed in human beings, but it does seem to be one area of basic biomet-
rics in which computers outdo typical humans.
Gait is a biometric measure that is both behavioral and physiological. The 
way we walk is a learned trait, which makes it a good behavioral biometric. 
Gait is also somewhat dependent on physical characteristics such as the 
length of our legs, our weight, and foot size.
Understanding the biometric 
basis for gait recognition
As with most behaviors we learn to the level of “expert,” the way we walk is 
distinctive to each of us an individual. For the first couple of years of life — 
before we develop the expertise we have as fully mobile, walking, and run-
ning people — it’s very unlikely that any gait-based biometric would work. 
For some reason, however, we haven’t been able to find gait biometric stud-
ies on toddlers anywhere.
Walking is hard
None of us really think about this after about 12 
months of age, but the physical act of walking is 
tremendously difficult from a mechanical per-
spective. To move in a particular direction, you 
have to start leaning in that direction to the 
point where you would fall over if you didn’t 
take a step. In essence, you are using dozens of 
muscles — along with all the bones in your feet, 
legs, and many in your back — to fall continu-
ously in a specific direction while your feet 
move to stay underneath you. No wonder it’s so 
hard to make bipedal robots that can walk rea-
sonably well.

110
Part II: Types of Biometrics 
Once we learn how to walk and run without tripping too much, we settle into 
a rhythm and style of walking that is somewhat unique to us. This style 
accommodates physiological traits such as the length of your legs, ratio of 
legs to torso length, arm swing, and all the things that go into propelling you 
forward with all the grace you can muster.
Many of the things that are most telling — or at least most easily observed — 
about gait are best observed from a side view of the walker, where stride 
length, arm swing, torso position, and vertical bob can all be seen clearly. 
While the largest gross movements are most visible from the side, newer gait-
sampling techniques are using more of the available information by looking 
at more than just stride and cadence.
Since so much of the body moves when walking, newer methods of gait recog-
nition don’t focus quite so much on the legs and stride; they pay more atten-
tion to how identifiable points on the body move in relationship to other parts 
of the body. This new kind of analysis tends to accent how closely gait is tied 
to physiological attributes, while still using many behavioral aspects as well.
Contemplating practical considerations
The larger movements associated with gait can be captured from great distances 
with reasonable accuracy, using no more than decent camera optics and light-
ing. Speaking of lighting, it’s quite possible to capture usable gait-biometric infor-
mation in total darkness using infrared cameras (though we’re not sure that 
stumbling around in the dark would yield a valid biometric sample).
Newer gait-biometric techniques look at the movements of the body more 
holistically; they require more camera angles to capture everything they 
need for accurate comparisons. Many of the proposed installations that 
would employ this technique are for hallways or tunnels where people can be 
observed walking in a straight line for a specified distance.
Gait biometrics will still be on the new side for a while yet; accuracy in practi-
cal application has not been good enough for identification purposes when 
the pool of people is over a few thousand. Even so, many organizations and 
research groups are looking to use gait biometrics as a good screening pro-
cess that might reduce the identification pool for other techniques (such as 
facial recognition or thermographic images).
Where you will see gait biometrics
Governments and intelligence agencies all seem fascinated with identifying 
people at a distance; no surprise that they are often the most interested in 

111
 Chapter 7: Other Types of Biometric Identification Schemes
gait biometrics. Using (say) infrared cameras in low light to recognize gait 
from a small pool of captured biometrics is quite useful in covert surveil-
lance. In anti-terrorist applications, being able to determine whether a target 
is among the group of people walking around a campsite from a half-mile 
away is another advantage of gait biometrics.
Outside of military uses, gait biometrics can be a good high-throughput 
screening tool — and so might be used in sports arenas or other large venues 
where a more intrusive biometric technique wouldn’t be either feasible or 
well accepted. Even though gait in its current applications can’t offer good 
identification from a large pool, it could inform crowd control to check on 
someone more closely if that person is a good match for someone in a 
smaller pool of suspects.
Closely related to stadium crowd control — but on a much smaller scale — is 
the concept of using gait biometrics to spot unwelcome returnees to a bar, 
dance club, school, or similar venue. Frequently people who have been 
expelled try to return and cause more problems. In these cases, there is no 
biometric collection of suspects, but a good video-surveillance system could 
provide the raw data and analysis to alert folks to a potential situation.
Typing Dynamics
This biometric measure has a long (and somewhat odd) history with one of 
the authors, starting in 1982 in university computer labs. While thumbing 
through some IBM manuals on the Display Management System for IBM 3278 
terminals, Mike hit on the revolutionary idea that it would be possible to 
write a program to duplicate the operation of university login screens and 
capture logins from unwary students who would just see the screen flash, 
and then the login screen again. (Hackers do this today on phishing sites, but 
they probably didn’t get the idea from Mike.) After avoiding expulsion, Mike 
gave some thought to how to keep someone from capturing a password in 
this way and using it to log in to his account. He came up with the wild idea 
that the way people type was probably unique to them, and if you could just 
watch the cadence and inter-character timing, you could see that the person 
typing in the password didn’t just happen to know the password, but was the 
actual person associated with the account.
This marked the first and only time Mike ever hacked a system without per-
mission — and the first of many times that his friends would later say, “Why 
didn’t you patent that?” The story doesn’t stop there, though. Many years 
later, working as a security consultant in Seattle, Mike met a very nice man 
named Gordon Ross who was at the time the Chief Technology Officer for 
NetNanny, the sole licensee of keystroke-dynamics technology (patented in 
1989 by some very smart people at SRI). Gordon has been a friend and col-
league since that day. The reason Mike didn’t pursue that idea in 1982? It 

112
Part II: Types of Biometrics 
wouldn’t have worked on IBM 3278 terminals, which sent whole strings to the 
computer at once as a block when an attention key was struck. Since the idea 
didn’t solve the immediate problem, Mike moved on.
BioPassword, Inc., a spinoff company from NetNanny, still owns the patent 
for this technology; it has no commercial competition at this time.
Understanding the biometric 
basis for typing dynamics
Typing dynamics or characteristics are a form of behavior that can be used 
biometrically — but many of us learn them much later in life than most of the 
other behavioral biometrics. People in the digital immigrant class typically 
learned to type in high school (if they ever formally learned), while the digital 
natives who grew up with computers and the Internet learn to type as soon as 
their language skills support it. (They go on to learn to text-message and 
leave typing behind, but as yet we haven’t seen texting dynamics used as a 
biometric tool.)
Typing may not be quite as deeply ingrained as walking or writing for many 
of us, but studies show that just two factors, the inter-character timing and 
the dwell time (how long a specific key stays pressed as you type) can yield 
99-percent-accurate identification of the typist.
Contemplating practical considerations
Typing dynamics may well offer the most practical biometric available when 
computers are involved. That’s because the sensor is the keyboard, com-
bined with timing gathered using the CPU’s own clock. No extra devices are 
required. To install this technology, essentially you just install the software.
The fact that this biometric technique does not require any kind of special 
hardware sensor beyond what’s already attached to the computer makes it 
very attractive to online services such as banks and brokerages.
In years past, use of keystroke dynamics in an online environment would have 
required installation of additional software that would make it impractical for 
high-volume public use. These days, however, modern Web-browser environ-
ments such as Adobe Flash (98.8 percent of all Internet browsers according to 
Adobe), Java (84 percent), and JavaScript (nearly 100 percent) — can all be 
used to watch keystrokes while a user is typing passwords into a Web browser.

113
 Chapter 7: Other Types of Biometric Identification Schemes
One possible method of biometric authentication — much easier to accom-
plish with keystroke dynamics than with most other biometrics — is what 
we’d call continuous authentication and authorization monitoring. The idea 
here is to continuously monitor the keystroke dynamics of someone logged 
in to a computer. You can check to see whether the user got up for a coffee 
and another person sat down at the keyboard and started using the system. 
You might be able to accomplish something similar with facial or iris recogni-
tion, or (for that matter) facial themography, but it would be considerably 
harder to accomplish, not as accurate, and relatively easily defeated. With 
typing dynamics, the usurping user would have to avoid typing anything to 
avoid detection. There are a lot of reasons an organization might want to 
keep track of who is typing on a specific keyboard at any particular time, 
including location or productivity tracking in addition to authentication and 
authorization.
 
Since keystroke dynamics measure the characteristics of how you type a spe-
cific sequence — say, a password — it’s also possibly the only biometric avail-
able that’s easily resettable. If a system focused on validating users through a 
password enhanced with keyboard dynamics, and someone learned to imitate 
the user’s dynamics at login somehow, then simply changing the password 
would restart the learning curve for the hacker.
Where you will see typing dynamics
BioPassword has been making large inroads into online authentication with 
banks and brokerages, which are all under federal mandates to add more fac-
tors to password authentication.
Factoring the odds
Multifactor authentication is a term you’ll hear 
a lot when security folks are talking about 
secure authentication. The idea is that by com-
bining more than one of the following, you can 
seriously decrease the odds that someone can 
acquire one of the factors (such as your pass-
word) and use it to get a false authentication:
  Something you know — a password or 
passphrase
  Something you have — an electronic token 
or key
  Something you are — biometrics measures
In large volumes, creating and disseminating 
the “something you have” part can be very 
expensive.

114
Part II: Types of Biometrics 
Because it’s a “sensorless” approach to biometrics, we can expect to see key-
stroke dynamics in places where good practice, regulation, or both may 
require something stronger than passwords alone. An example of this would 
be U.S. medical institutions that are required by HIPAA to record exactly who 
accesses a medical record. Keystroke dynamics can alert the organization to 
the fact that a password is being used by more than one person — or prevent 
access by anyone except the authorized user.
Interesting Biometrics Not 
Ready for Prime Time
In addition to the biometrics that we cover in the previous sections, there are 
a few “honorable mention” biometric types that aren’t in current use in any 
except for very small specialty areas. We think they’re interesting — even if 
these biometric measures may not be practical just now due to problems 
with sensor or sampling technology. They could easily get even more inter-
esting when technology catches up, and might even offer a perfect tool for 
solving a new or future problem you encounter. For now, they’re just fun to 
think about.
Sentence-structure and linguistic-analysis 
biometrics
Statistical analysis of an individual’s use of language is actually a pretty hot 
topic right now, but its uses are fairly focused on defense scenarios. The 
basic idea is to identify the person who wrote something by looking at his or 
her characteristic ways of using language — these, for example:
 
 How does the person put sentences together?
 
 What words does the person tend to use?
 
 How does the person structure ideas when writing?
These biometric methods are by no means exact ways of identifying individ-
ual writers, but they have interesting properties when applied to groups of 
writers and subject areas.
 
For really useful results, the analysis of sentence structure and language for 
this purpose needs large samples of known origin. For example, while it might 
be fascinating to see if Homer really wrote both The Iliad and The Odyssey, it’s 
difficult to obtain a verifiable sample of his writing to use for comparison.

115
 Chapter 7: Other Types of Biometric Identification Schemes
The modern age has yielded copious amounts of text in the form of e-mails 
that provide statistical fodder for language-based biometrics. Studies of 
e-mail collections have shown that it’s possible to predict human relation-
ships based on language clues in large bodies of e-mail (for example all the 
internal e-mail for a company) and even predict certain kinds of human 
behavior (like the tendency to betray one’s employer and leak confidential 
data) based on e-mail language. Using these clues and examining the shared 
lexicon of groups, these measures can be used biometrically to identify 
groups of people and categorize the groups.
If all that sounds pretty Orwellian, you might want to reread the acceptable 
use policies for your company with respect to who owns company e-mail, 
who is allowed to read it, and for what reasons. In most cases, e-mail you 
send or receive in your company e-mail systems doesn’t belong to you, and 
you’re given very little right to privacy in it.
Brainwave biometrics
Brainwaves in the science-fiction melt-a-stick-of-butter-with-your-mind mode don’t 
exist, so far as we can tell, but the human nervous system is electrochemical in 
nature, so pretty much anything we do — including thinking — does create a 
minute electrical field. These fields can be detected and even mapped using 
medical equipment such as electroencephalographs (EEGs), and magnetoen-
cephalography (MEG) machines. Both of these measure electrical impulses 
generated by the brain directly. Here’s what’s currently in use:
 
 EEG: These devices measure activity by measuring electrical impulses 
passing though electrodes placed on the scalp, generally requiring 
direct contact with the skin in specific locations — requiring shaved 
spots in the hair.
 
 MEG: This is a relatively new technology that uses superconducting 
coils cooled to minus 269 degrees Celsius placed near the skull to detect 
electrical fields in the brain. These coils then induce a magnetic field in a 
superconducting quantum interference device, or SQUID, which can 
then be analyzed.
 
 PET and fMRI: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) actually measures 
the brain’s consumption of radioactive glucose, and functional magnetic 
resonance imaging (fMRI) gear watches magnetically aligned hydrogen 
atoms in the brain react to a radio pulse. These devices measure brain 
activity without looking at the electrical fields. PET scanning can mea-
sure activity; fMRI can map out structures in the brain.
While all these methods yield unique biometric data, they’re all either too 
expensive or too intrusive to gain much ground as popular biometrics (“. . . 
to log in, think about pumpkins while we measure your brainwaves to confirm 
your identity . . .”).

116
Part II: Types of Biometrics 
While technically not brainwaves, the electrical impulses your nervous system 
uses to keep your heart beating are measurable all over the body including the 
fingers. As it turns out, the harmonics of the electrocardial signals are a good 
candidate for biometric measurement; they can be measured as quickly and as 
unobtrusively as fingerprints. In fact, since it’s possible to measure this electri-
cal activity from the fingers, it makes a good proof-of-life for fingerprint readers 
so that the system knows the finger is attached to a living person.
Odor biometrics
We know, from observing bloodhounds, that it’s possible to uniquely identify 
people by odor — and we know that it’s almost impossible to mask that odor 
entirely without airtight seals. So odor has the potential to be a highly accu-
rate biometric measure that cannot easily be masked or duplicated.
Unfortunately, this method has problems in both the technical and social 
arenas:
 
 Technically, reproducing the sensitivity and selectivity of a bloodhound 
nose and brain is very difficult. So far, we can’t really come close with 
electronic noses, but work continues in this area.
 
 Socially, it’s not particularly acceptable to tell people that you would 
like to identify them or authenticate them by using their body odor. 
(Imagine the enrollment process. Or don’t. It probably wouldn’t be 
pleasant for anyone involved.) Of course, this doesn’t preclude the use 
of odor biometrics in a passive identification role.
Inevitably, odor is something that we leave behind everywhere we go — ask 
any bloodhound. Even the most pleasantly odor-free person leaves traces 
that trained dogs can identify and follow. Unfortunately, bloodhounds are not 
always convenient, and they do tend to shed on the back seat. There are 
agencies and police departments working with electronic noses to identify 
not only explosives, but traces left behind by humans. Some time in the near 
future we may see “smell evidence” presented as proof that someone was 
present at a crime scene. (“You know, something about this case stinks. . . .”)

Using Biometrics

In this part . . .
T
his is where the rubber meets the road. If you intend 
to set up a biometrics solution in your organization, 
this section will help you establish selection criteria, 
run a pilot or two, choose a vendor, and build an imple-
mentation plan. After you get your biometric system run-
ning, you need to do some regular chores to keep it 
running smoothly.
Understanding and working with users is also essential 
to success when biometrics are introduced into an 
organization for the first time. There are mispercep-
tions and fears that can be overcome with effective 
communication and training. You’ll find it all in this part.

here are uses for biometrics beyond access control — such as law 
enforcement, surveillance, and other general identification purposes — but 
for this chapter, we focus only on selecting a biometric solution for access-
control purposes. Frankly, all the other uses of biometrics are so specialized 
that if you’re interested in them, you likely already have some background in 
that area.
Because we’re focusing on access control, we should be clear about how 
we’re using that term. In this context, access control is about using biometrics 
to manage who’s allowed to use a particular resource. In many cases, that 
means access to computer systems, but it can also be applied to physical 
access — say, to an area of the facility via a door control, or even access to 
non-computer equipment such as a car.
Access control also has implications regarding how biometric comparisons 
are made. Because biometric comparisons can be used to either authenticate 
known users (as you would with a password) or identify users using nothing 
but the database with no other identification clues, we discuss how these 
techniques change the selection. As an example, consider a fingerprint bio-
metric system that enrolls people using only the right index-fingerprint. Such 
a system is pretty good for authenticating users, given a cooperative user 
and a good look at the right index finger. If you happen to have the correct 
print, it’s possible even to identify that user using his or her enrolled data 
as well. On the other hand, if you have all ten fingerprints, any of the prints 
can be used to identify that person. It may seem like a fine distinction, but it 
affects how you choose a biometric solution.

122
Part III: Implementing and Using Biometrics 
Identifying Selection Criteria
Before we start talking about the merits of various solutions, it would be a 
good idea to establish what criteria make sense to use in selecting a solution. 
There are quite a large number of biometric technologies and applications 
out there, so our first step has to be to establish what characteristics of the 
environment and the potential biometric solutions are of interest and useful 
in determining what to select.
The users
It’s important to be familiar with the people who’ll be using the biometric 
solution. At the very least, you must ask and have answers to questions like 
these:
 
 Are they members of the general public with a mix of ethnic and educa-
tion levels and a variety of attitudes?
 
 Are they employees in a high-tech firm?
 
 Will they be using the biometric system several times a day, or just a 
couple of times each year?
 
 Will they be in a hurry and possibly be a little bit impatient (biometric 
controlled entry into a public restroom comes to mind just now)?
A great example of the need to understand users is in health care, especially 
urgent care environments. Health care is an area where convenient reliable 
access to information isn’t just nice to have, it’s an absolute requirement 
with lives hanging in the balance. It also happens to be a place where access 
control to extremely sensitive information is required by law and the expec-
tation of patients, so biometric access controls are often considered for these 
environments.
In these cases, you have several groups of highly specialized user groups, 
each of which need access to essentially the same information for different 
purposes, sometimes in the same environment. An emergency room doctor 
might need to know about an incoming patient’s allergies or prior conditions 
that they may access directly themselves, or indirectly through another 
emergency room worker. The doctor might be gloved, masked, and sterile in 
preparation for a procedure, while the nurse or other worker might be in the 
same condition, or sitting at a desk. Each of these users of the system have 
vastly different viewpoints and opinions about how the system should work 
while sharing the common goal of providing timely quality health care.

123
 Chapter 8: Selecting a Biometrics Solution
The environment
In this context, environment means the circumstances surrounding the 
contemplated biometric solution that will influence selection. For example, 
a high-throughput situation like airport check-in would be a bad place for 
something invasive and training dependent like retinal biometrics, but would 
be a fine place for iris biometrics since they can operate at a greater distance 
and with no user training.
Selecting the proper biometrics solution for your environment requires that 
you fully understand the unique requirements of the place where the pro-
posed solution will be installed. Throughout the rest of this section, we dis-
cuss environmental factors that you should consider.
Accommodating physical requirements
There are a number of questions you should ask regarding the physical attri-
butes of the place where the solution will be installed.
 
 Will this be happening indoors where lighting, temperature and other 
variables are controlled, or outdoors where things are more variable?
 
 What is the physical relationship (distance) between the authenticating 
user and the secured system or area?
 
 Is the authentication process attended by a trusted facilitator (guard or 
reception) or is it “self-service”?
 
 Are there attributes of the environment that rule out certain forms of 
biometrics, for example work gloves required and fingerprint ID?
It’s helpful to try to describe all the potential users of the biometric system 
and describe how they’ll use it to understand the physical requirements of 
each user and scenario.
Determining accuracy and “F”-rate requirements
Not all biometric measures are created equal in terms of accuracy and preci-
sion, especially given specific conditions in enrollment and subsequent use. 
Although iris recognition is extremely accurate and simple to enroll, it costs 
more and is harder to install than a simple fingerprint reader — and the fin-
gerprint reader may be all you really need (even if it doesn’t work well on 
cows). It’s important when contemplating a solution to understand the False 
Rejection Rate (FRR), False Acceptance Rate (FAR), and Failure To Enroll 
(FTE) rates.
False rejection is annoying — it means a valid user has been incorrectly 
rejected by the biometric system, and must either try again or use an alterna-
tive authentication method. For most systems, you can lower the FRR simply 
by allowing the system more leeway in interpreting the specific characteris-
tics of the biometric measures in use. The problem here is that by allowing 

124
Part III: Implementing and Using Biometrics 
the system to accept looser matches, you automatically increase the FAR — 
which means unauthorized users will incorrectly be accepted by the system. 
Adjust it too far and you might as well just prop the door open.
 
Commonly, medium-security installations adjust the system so the FRR and 
FAR are the same — an arrangement referred to as the Equal Error Rate or 
EER — but this isn’t a cure-all. The appropriate FRR and FAR settings have to 
fit the security requirements of the installation. If higher security is required, 
adjust the system so the FAR gets very close to or at zero — and deal with 
people having to try more than once sometimes.
Because most systems allow you to adjust acceptance criteria, the key here is to 
look at FAR and FRR across the range allowed by the system and choose a biomet-
ric that matches the security needs required by the installation with as little false 
rejection as possible. Nobody likes being rejected, especially by a door or turnstile.
Unfortunately, biometric systems aren’t equipped with big knobs labeled FRR 
and FAR that you can twist until you get it right. Instead, you’ll be dealing 
with a greater number of adjustments — it’s more like adjusting the amount 
of brown sugar in a cookie recipe. If you increase the brown sugar to make 
the cookie chewier and more resistant to drying out, you also need to adjust 
the white sugar to keep the sweetness right — as well as fine-tuning the 
baking time to deal with the hygroscopic nature of the brown sugar (meta-
phorically speaking). Bottom line: You have to tweak till it meets your secu-
rity requirements.
Getting a better FAR might include modifying the software processing the 
incoming data so it rejects somewhat variant biometric data — but might 
also include more user training to get the best possible data from the sensors 
you have in place.
Cow network
A college project back in 1985 required that we 
identify individual cows electronically when 
they entered the milking stalls — which would 
then display information about each cow, 
retrieved from the database back in the office. 
For example, if the cow was on medication that 
would affect the milk, a notice was displayed so 
that particular milk would be shunted aside and 
discarded. The ID process itself was accom-
plished with proximity ear tags (which is almost 
biometric, since they become “part of the cow” 
in a sense.)
Because we also needed to check in the milk-
ing staff at each station (to track how they 
responded to the notices), we also provided 
them with proximity cards, shaped differently 
from those of the cows (and, oh yeah, not 
clipped to their ears). In fact, both cows and 
cowhands were using the same system, but 
had different physical interactions with it — 
and different needs based on their interaction. 
We wisely never told the cowhands that they 
were in the same database as the cows, just 
with different characteristics. We didn’t tell the 
cows, either.

125
 Chapter 8: Selecting a Biometrics Solution
Understanding regulatory requirements
There are few federal or state regulations that address the use of biometrics 
specifically, but there’s quite a lot of regulatory fussing about authentication, 
authorization, and accounting (AAA for short, which we talk about in more 
detail in Chapter 2) — so much, in fact, that we couldn’t possibly make a 
definitive list of regulations (or even agencies). What we can do is provide 
some examples of industries that tend to regulate such things — and give 
you some of the specifics.
In general, the various regulatory bodies really care about AAA when users 
might need to be held personally accountable for actions performed while 
authenticated to a system. Industries or systems where that kind of scrutiny 
might be useful include
 
 Health care
 
 The Food and Drug Administration
 
 Law enforcement
 
 Banking and finance
 
 Any company managing data that includes credit cards
Although each of these industries cares a lot about who’s using a system 
or has access to an area, the associated regulations differ wildly. For 
example, health care is regulated by the Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA) Security Rule — which specifically avoids dis-
cussion of any specific technology in the area of “person or entity authen-
tication.” The FDA, on the other hand, requires (in 21 CFR part 11, an FDA 
regulation regarding the use of electronic signatures) that electronic signa-
tures not based on biometrics must use at least two other factors to authenti-
cate the user. Biometrics-based systems have no such requirement.
In many cases, regulations also require that the user not be able to repudiate 
their actions as an authenticated user. Essentially, the system must ensure 
that nobody using the system will be able to claim later on that “I wasn’t 
there, nope, not me” when (ahem) certain actions occurred. In biometrics, 
this requirement relates directly to the false acceptance rate — and the 
possibility of replay attacks against the system, where a recording of valid 
authentication information is presented to the system. For example, in an 
installation that requires unattended authentication, voice-recognition bio-
metrics would be especially susceptible to replay attacks — so they wouldn’t 
meet some standards for non-repudiation.
There is no single answer for how to be compliant with regulatory require-
ments when you’re using biometrics. In fact, only the newest regulations 
even acknowledge that biometric technology exists. Your best bet is to dig 
deeply into whatever regulatory environment you’re working in — they’re 

126
Part III: Implementing and Using Biometrics 
nearly always supported by online groups and professional organizations — 
and then apply what you’ve learned about the specific characteristics of each 
type of biometrics to your specific environment.
Pricing potential solutions
Pricing isn’t all about product cost, and this is especially true for any prod-
uct that affects large groups of people, like a new biometric authentication 
system. Clearly, normal information-technology standards apply — so you’ll 
need to look at the expenses related to product, installation, deployment, 
training, and maintenance — all of which follow the same guidelines you’d 
use for any technology purchase and deployment.
Biometric installations add some specialized costs to the mix that are also 
worth considering:
 
 Training/retraining: If it’s a new process that people will be using to 
access areas and systems that they’re accustomed to using another 
way, everyone using the new system will require retraining — or at least 
allowed enough time to get used to the new system.
 
 Enrollment: Any biometric system requires users of the system to enroll 
by providing a known good sample of their biometrics to the system 
for later comparison. In most cases, that requirement calls for a human 
operator who can verify the user’s identity and operate the system to 
enroll new users.
 
 Productivity loss: Although we like to think of enhanced security as an 
enabler for new business opportunities, introducing a new process with 
no direct addition to revenues is a direct cost to the organization. In 
some cases, you might be replacing an older, slower process — which 
means recording the resulting productivity gain is important.
Logging and reporting
Any system responsible for granting and denying access to important assets 
of an organization should be capable of keeping a record of access requests — and 
the system’s responses. As with almost everything else in security systems, 
however, how much logging and reporting you do depends on the characteris-
tics of the assets — and their protection profile (a technology and implemen-
tation independent description of the security requirements of the assets).
Typically, authentication systems record the following information:
 
 Who attempted authentication
 
 What that person was trying to gain access to
 
 When the attempt was made
 
 Whether the attempt was a success or a failure

127
 Chapter 8: Selecting a Biometrics Solution
Any good biometric authentication system records that data. With biomet-
rics, some of these items show some unique aspects that we need to consider 
when selecting a solution. Here’s a handy example: When a biometric system 
is working in authentication mode (as opposed to identification), the identity 
of the user is presented to the system, and then the biometric comparisons 
are made to authenticate the user. In the case of a failed attempt, biometric 
systems can record the biometric information of the person attempting the 
authentication. If it’s someone other than the expected user, that information 
could later be used to identify a suspect, since you now have that person’s 
biometric data in a special file, associated with the place and time of the 
attempt.
 
Considering the nature of biometric methods, where an authentication is 
attempted combined with timing can be an interesting and useful reporting 
tool as well. Because your biometrics are a part of who you are — and nobody 
we know has mastered the art of being in two places at once — a successful 
biometric authentication that happens in two widely separated places in too 
short a time always means (a) someone has compromised your authentication 
system or (b) your FAR is way too high.
Considering user privacy
A detailed discussion of biometrics and privacy appears in Chapter 3, but the 
issue is worth mentioning here as a selection criteria, too. Most biometric 
measurements are stored in an abstract form that allows the system to do a 
two-step process:
 
1. Perform a one-way hash that transforms the originally captured data to 
the abstract form.
 
2. Compare the abstract data to a known sample.
Because of those two steps, it’s not possible to use (for example) fingerprint 
data in a biometrics database to create an image of the original fingerprint. 
The same is true for iris recognition, facial  recognition, and most other 
forms of biometrics. If the users of the system know this, they’re more likely 
to adopt the system — with a lot less hostility.
 
What can be done with the abstracted forms of biometric data is injecting that 
data into an authentication system at just the right place to successfully forge 
a biometric authentication. If a person’s biometric data is compromised, that 
person risks some forms of identity theft for the rest of his or her life.
With that kind of long-term personal impact at stake, it’s important to choose 
biometric systems that do a really good job of safeguarding the data they 
collect from enrolled users. In practical terms, that means encrypting the 
collected data — and using encrypted communications when transmitting it 
over networks.

128
Part III: Implementing and Using Biometrics 
Also worth considering, on the privacy front, is that many forms of bio-
metrics can tell the operator more about a person than the operator really 
should know. Behavioral biometric information can indicate (for example) 
the onset of neurological disorders; sudden failures with most eye-based 
biometrics can indicate a long list of diseases — and medical information is 
generally presumed to be confidential, known only to patient and physician. 
Because disease or trauma-related biometric anomalies are nearly impossible 
to notice when they happen, plan on ways to reduce the impact these events 
have on the user and operator.
Considering standards and interoperability
Until recently, there were so few biometric products on the market that 
the very idea of interoperability wasn’t interesting. Now, systems exist 
that store biometric information onto smartcards and passports that must 
be readable by a wide variety of systems, so both the American National 
Standards Institute (ANSI) in collaboration with International Committee for 
Information Technology Standards as well as the International Organization 
for Standardization (ISO) with the International Electrotechnical Commission 
(IEC) have published standards for the storage, use and transmission of bio-
metric data. If you anticipate that interoperability among biometrics systems 
is (or will be) important to your installation, we suggest you take a look at the 
ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee #37 (SC 37) proceedings and publications 
that can be found here:

Identifying the Field of Possible Solutions
After you’ve worked out the selection criteria most applicable to your envi-
ronment, it’s time to start narrowing down the list of potential solutions — by 
applying those criteria and zeroing in on your final list of candidate solutions. 
This is where you put on your healthy skepticism glasses and prepare to deal 
with sales critters. Don’t get us wrong; some of our best friends are salespeo-
ple. Honest. And hey, salespeople with expense accounts are almost always 
good for a decent lunch — but to keep the playing field level, you have to let 
all of them buy lunch for you and your team.
Kidding aside, you’ll most certainly need to talk to vendors and sales folks 
to get their take on what their products’ capabilities are — and to hear what 
they have to say about their competitors. Just take both items with a few 
grains of salt.
The right way to start any technology project is to clearly express the 
requirements for the system you’re contemplating. Generally, this process of 
gathering requirements involves these steps:

129
 Chapter 8: Selecting a Biometrics Solution
 
1. Speak to stakeholders about their expectations of such a system.
 
2. Compare stakeholder requirements to external requirements for the 
system, including legal regulations.
 
3. Write up the requirements for review by stakeholders, management, and 
representative users of the system.
 
4. Repeat Steps 1, 2, and 3 until all new input is analyzed and reviewed.
 
5. Incorporate feedback from stakeholder, management, and user review 
into the requirements document — and then translate the requirements 
document into a format for external consumption.
Speaking to stakeholders
The stakeholders for a particular proposed system or solution will be the 
people in the organization that have direct interest in the implementation, 
use, or outcomes of the solution. In practice, these are people in the organi-
zation who will benefit from the solution in some way, or whose work will be 
directly affected by the solution. For example, a typical biometric authentica-
tion system for accessing the computer server room would list the following 
people as stakeholders:
 
 IT management
 
 IT server staff
 
 Maintenance
 
 IT security staff
You have no real need to consult with sales staff or accounting in this case, 
since they won’t be affected in any way.
 
Discussing requirements with stakeholders is always a bit tricky, since they 
don’t understand the technology, and can’t be expected to. Due to that lack of 
understanding, some of their stated requirements may be infeasible for any of a 
number of reasons — including technical capability, cost, or conflicts of interest 
with other stakeholders. The following list should help you collect the informa-
tion you need without making any stakeholders feel they aren’t being heard:
 
 Keep notes about potential problems to discuss during the review 
process. It’s not a good idea to toss out anyone’s requirements at this 
point, but you definitely should be making notes about potential problems 
and conflicts that you’ll offer up in the review process. If you know for 
sure that 99.999 percent accurate iris scanning at a 12-foot distance 
while in motion is going to break the budget, make a note of that and 
bring it up later.

130
Part III: Implementing and Using Biometrics 
 
 Please resist the urge to quash what appear to be infeasible require-
ments in the information-gathering phase. At this stage, everything 
should be considered; telling folks that their needs won’t be met really 
just discourages them from participating. You’ll have plenty of opportu-
nity to crush their dreams in the review phase.
 
 Make sure stakeholders know the difference between wants and 
requirements. If your stakeholders are prone to asking for everything 
they see on television or in the movies (especially science fiction), you 
might need to impress upon them the difference between wants and 
requirements.
 
 A want is something that they believe would make the system work 
better or provide additional utility. A requirement, on the other hand, is 
something that, if not provided, will make the system of marginal or no 
use to them.
 
 Collect stakeholder requirements separately. When feasible, it’s good 
to get stakeholder requirements from individuals or associated groups 
separately from other individuals or groups, so they aren’t influenced by 
each other at this stage. Larger groups with differing interests can tend 
to drown out the quieter voices — whose requirements are just as real 
and important to the project.
 
 Anticipate and address stakeholders’ concerns about biometrics. 
Because this is likely the first time you’ll be speaking to some of these 
people about a biometrics project, you’ll also need to keep in mind that 
the general public looks at biometrics with some degree of suspicion. 
It’s collecting data about their bodies and behavior and doing who-
knows-what with it. Try to anticipate their concerns and be ready to 
address them in these requirements meetings.
 
 Be prepared to explain potential concerns to customers. If the project 
is about using biometrics for your customers (and not internal people), 
you’ll need to work with your team to explain potential concerns to 
them, as well.
Analyzing requirements
The preceding section helps you compile a comprehensive list of require-
ments from stakeholders. With that list in hand, it’s time to make some sense 
of them — the requirements, not the stakeholders. Now is the time to docu-
ment how the stated requirements each affect the solution choice, implemen-
tation schedule, and costs.
It’s also the right time to get a working understanding of any conflicts that 
the requirements may give rise to. For example, suppose you’re preparing 
to provide your online customers with biometric authentication to enhance 
the security of your Web site. The operations-security folks are adamant 
that nothing short of iris recognition will meet their needs, but marketing 

131
 Chapter 8: Selecting a Biometrics Solution
and sales insist that whatever solution you choose must incur no additional 
expense or installation for your customers. If you check off all those custom-
ers who already have iris-recognition systems installed, that leaves you with 
approximately . . . yep, 100 percent of the customers needing new hardware 
and software to use the system. Uh-oh.
In such a scenario, you might be tempted to dismiss the iris-recognition 
requirement as silly or over-the-top — but resist that temptation. It wouldn’t 
be surprising if, in the last phase, working with stakeholders who understand 
their requirements better than you do, you encounter somebody who states 
a need for something with the FAR and FRR rates of iris recognition. There 
are really only a few possible resolutions for this dilemma:
 
 One of the opposing requirements isn’t really a requirement, but rather 
a want.
 
 One of the stakeholders isn’t really a stakeholder, and that person’s 
requirements can be safely ignored.
 
 You can heroically find a solution that makes the apparent conflict go 
away.
 
Under no circumstances should you decide on the first of these options with-
out discussing it with — and getting support from — the affected parties. If 
they’ve said it was a requirement, they won’t take kindly to seeing it dropped 
off the list without consultation.
 
Finally, here are a few more pointers to keep in mind while determining 
requirements:
 
 Check external regulatory guidelines: Another source for conflict may 
be external requirements imposed by regulations, laws, or guidelines. In 
this case, the winner of the conflict pretty much has to be the external 
regulatory body — unless your organization really feels like living on the 
edge and challenging that authority. The good news is that federal regu-
latory guidelines are typically so vague that opportunities for conflict 
are relatively rare — but it’s good to check, just in case.
 
 Avoid vendor salespeople who want to help you with your require-
ments. Chances are their requirements will make their particular system 
the “only logical” choice. Better to develop your requirements internally 
without letting the vendors rig the game.
 
 Do a basic sanity check on the resulting requirements list from the 
perspective of the person selecting and potentially implementing it. The 
project requirements should be achievable with your current budget, in 
the available timeframe, and with acceptable interruptions to operations. 
From the perspective of an information technology stakeholder, these are 
among the requirements you bring to the table. You may have additional 
requirements regarding reliability of the system, maintenance, required train-
ing, and administrative usability that you should express at this time as well.

132
Part III: Implementing and Using Biometrics 
Reviewing your requirements
After you’ve come up with a good list of requirements for the system, you’ll 
need to write them up in a format that others can understand. In Mike’s case, 
this is the first time the requirements list makes it from his notes into elec-
tronic form — but your process may differ. The important thing here is to not 
get too fancy; just express the system requirements in a way that the stake-
holders can review and comment on.
The fascinating thing about this part of the process is that it will almost always 
result in additional requirements being requested from various stakeholders. 
It doesn’t matter how diligent you are in the first round of gathering require-
ments; there just seems to be something about the act of reading a “final” list 
of requirements that prompts people to remember the critical thing they forgot 
to mention last time. Knowing that, you can build in time for additional analysis 
and review of the inevitable new requirements in this phase.
Some people make this documentation task a carefully structured document 
with clear introductions, explanations, and conclusive explanations. Because 
this document is primarily for internal consumption, we usually just make it a 
list, starting with the words This system must . . . and saving the more detailed 
writing for the upcoming Request for Proposals (RFP).
Incorporating review feedback
After all stakeholders have had a chance to review the requirements, it’s 
time to build the document upon which you’ll base the RFP and subsequent 
implementation plans. Here’s where you spend the time to give the project 
some context, carefully describe in detail the expected behaviors of the new 
system, and outline the impact to the organization’s operations.
Often you’ll notice that the feedback all has a particular tone to it — which 
you’ll need to accommodate in the final requirements. For example, suppose 
that once everyone saw the complete list of requirements, each of them men-
tioned that people entering Building Seven — located in Barrow, Alaska — prob-
ably won’t want to pull off their mittens in January and risk frostbite just to get 
a fingerprint scanned. If that’s the case, and fingerprint recognition seems to be 
a good fit elsewhere, you may need to put the Barrow scanner in a vestibule to 
deal with that problem. (Barrow presents other problems with biometrics too, 
since at minus-70 degrees Fahrenheit people tend to cover ALL parts of their 
bodies, and even change their gait a bit to deal with the clothing.)
 
Remember back when we were describing “Speaking to stakeholders” earlier 
in this chapter — and we mentioned a stakeholder naming specific technolo-
gies (such as iris recognition) as a requirement? Most of the time, talking about 
specific technologies before you submit your requirements to vendors is a mis-
take. It’s okay to talk about accuracies required, physical characteristics of the 

133
 Chapter 8: Selecting a Biometrics Solution
system, and users, but getting too specific about technologies or implementa-
tion too early is risky — especially when you’re dealing with a relatively young 
and growing technology such as biometrics. You don’t want to unnecessarily 
limit your options too quickly; you run the risk of eliminating great new prod-
ucts that would actually meet your requirements. Who knows — someone 
may have worked out the “running from angry polar bears” gait-recognition 
algorithms for the Barrow site, such that gait recognition meets your needs 
after all. . . .
Identifying and speaking with 
reference customers
If you have collected and analyzed requirements, and your analysis has 
resulted in a good understanding of exactly what you would like to accom-
plish, you have the selection criteria already prepared for vendors that you 
would like to submit an RFP to. It’s the list of every vendor that could pos-
sibly meet your developed criteria. At this stage, if you don’t know a particu-
lar vendor well and aren’t sure whether its technology is a fit, send the RFP 
anyway — you might be surprised. At this stage, it’s not your job to disqual-
ify vendors; they will do that themselves as they respond to the RFP.
Once you have narrowed the field to a few vendor solutions, consider talking 
with people in other companies who have implemented those solutions. Ask 
the salesperson for reference contacts — preferably companies about the 
same size as yours, and not too far away in case you want to pay them a visit.
 
It’s best to get at least two or three reference contacts from other customers, 
and develop a short questionnaire you can use so you ask all of them the same 
questions (after talking with the first reference customer, you’ll probably dis-
cover several more good questions that you can then ask the other contacts).
If the salesperson can’t or won’t provide reference contacts, you might be 
just a little suspicious, unless your company is the first to use a new biomet-
ric product. In that case, get references from the same vendor for other, simi-
lar products. Remember that references aren’t just about the technology, but 
how well the company does overall.
A very short list of questions that we use when talking with reference cus-
tomers includes these:
 
 How well did the product work for you?
 
 Did you need assistance from the vendor? How responsive was the 
vendor?
 
 What problems did you encounter?
 
 What lessons did you learn?

134
Part III: Implementing and Using Biometrics 
 
 How would you do things differently if you could start over?
 
 Would you use the vendor’s products again if you could?
Testing Potential Solutions
Testing biometric systems can be a tricky prospect; solutions can range into 
the hundreds of thousands of dollars, and many require integration into 
some sort of facility — say, the door controls or something equally hard to 
change just for a test.
With that in mind, there is still considerable testing you can do without tear-
ing apart your facilities. Your goals in testing are to verify that the proposed 
system meets your requirements, and doesn’t behave in any unexpected 
ways that you didn’t anticipate. Grab a copy of your requirements, and we’ll 
see what we can do.
Vendor/manufacturer on-site testing
Although it may not be feasible to install a six-camera gait biometric into 
your lobby just to test a potential solution, you can bet that the manufacturer 
will have facilities set up for you to visit to get a feel for things. Even better, 
they might have a cooperative, happy customer (you should be asking for 
happy customers anyway) that would consent to showing you their facility 
and talking about implementation, maintenance, and their general impres-
sions. It’s not the same as setting it up and letting your own users test, but in 
some ways this kind of test will offer up better data than you could in your 
own facility.
Getting mature data
A test setup is “only a test” — something that’s been artificially created for 
the purposes of seeing how a proposed solution works. Unless you have a 
gigantic budget and a healthy implementation schedule, it isn’t practical (even 
possible) to set up a system that will work exactly like the final product long 
enough to allow people to get trained, use the test system long enough to get 
past training time, and replace their general unfamiliarity with a routine.
By looking at an already-installed system, interviewing users and administra-
tors of the system, and watching it in operation, you should get a good feel 
for how your installation would work after the newness wears off and things 
settle in a bit. A really great manufacturer or vendor will have at least one or 
two satisfied customers who can spend a little time with you — and a longer 
list of other customers who are willing to give the product a thumbs-up over 
the phone.

135
 Chapter 8: Selecting a Biometrics Solution
At this stage of testing, we also ask manufacturers for customers who are less 
than happy with the product, though we don’t always get useful replies to 
that one. The least useful reply is
Everyone loves our product, we don’t know of anyone who would say 
otherwise.
A slightly better reply is
Well, XYZ Co. didn’t care much for the “running from angry polar bears” 
gait-recognition system, but it’s because all they had chasing them were 
slightly upset geese.
And the best response of all is
We do have some folks who haven’t been entirely satisfied with our product 
who may be willing to share their experiences with you. We’d like to have 
the opportunity to explain what happened with them after you’ve made 
contact.
Any manufacturer confident enough in the quality of its product to put you 
in contact with less-than-completely-satisfied customers is either really good 
at bluffing, or pretty sure it has a great product. In any event, you should be 
able to get a good enough read from the less-than-happy customers to clas-
sify them as
 
 Curmudgeonly and dissatisfied with almost everything, including your 
phone call
 
 Unreasonably focused on some aspect of the product that isn’t impor-
tant, or at least isn’t important to you
 
 Legitimately concerned with some aspect of their interaction with the 
company or the product
Using industry data
In place of actual hands-on testing, testing by industry groups can be useful 
for establishing quantitative measurements of products to see whether 
they meet your requirements. Groups that offer such testing include the 
International Biometric Group (IBG) and the National Biometric Security 
Project (NBSP). Their tests primarily determine accuracy, FRR, FAR, and 
other easily quantifiable measurements, but aren’t quite so useful for evaluat-
ing user experience, impact, or other less quantitative measurements. Note 
that performing this kind of testing is expensive; in many cases, the testing 
costs are borne by the biometric device manufacturer, the person needing 
the results (you), or sometimes both. That shortens the list of tested devices, 
but if one of your prospects is on the list, it’s helpful data.

136
Part III: Implementing and Using Biometrics 
The NBSP specifically makes Performance and Standards Conformance test 
results available on their Web site at www.nationalbiometric.org. The 
specific performance measurements available are False Accept Rate, False 
Reject Rate, Failure To Acquire Rate, Failure To Enroll Rate, and Throughput 
Rate. Because each of these measurements is a likely candidate on the techni-
cal side of your requirements document, this testing can be quite useful.
NBSP standards-conformance testing includes both the ISO and INCITS 
standards mentioned earlier in this chapter (in the “Considering standards 
and interoperability” section), as well as some industry specific standards 
from the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the International Civil 
Aviation Organization (ICAO). If compliance with standards is on your list of 
requirements, take a look at their testing in this area too.
Keep in mind too that each manufacturer will most certainly have test data as 
well — usually describing how amazing their product is, and directly compar-
ing it to the unreasonably inferior competitive products. Oddly enough, each 
of the competitors will have similar test data that paints the same picture for 
their products. Don’t be tempted to just ignore what each manufacturer says 
about its product — and pay close attention to what they say about their 
competitors. Most manufacturers won’t lie outright; there is usually some 
kernel of truth in the claims they make for their stuff, as well as their take on 
what the competition is up to. If nothing else, it provides conversation points 
when you have your next vendor meeting.
Testing installations
Sometimes it’s actually feasible to install a system for testing purposes, 
either because it’s something simple (such as a fingerprint reader for authen-
ticating to a computer system) or the project is big enough that spending 
money on a pilot is worthwhile. In these cases, getting value out of your test-
ing requires a fair amount of planning and some attention to detail in collect-
ing and interpreting results.
Defining success
First, you need to decide what outcomes from the testing will be needed to 
deem it a success. Clearly, this would include meeting all the specific require-
ments you’ve already developed, but are there additional criteria (in the 
“want” category) that you’d like to evaluate in the test environment? Are 
there factors that seem obvious, that didn’t make it into the requirements, 
but will clearly be a part of testing — such as, “the system operates continu-
ously with at least 99.999-percent availability for the duration of the test?”
Careful attention to very specific, measurable success criteria is important 
because (a) it makes the decision/selection process easier in the end and (b) 
sometimes the manufacturer will partially fund or support the pilot project 
in some way — say, by loaning equipment and/or offering free support. In 
such cases, the manufacturer will want to understand very specifically what 
criteria must be met for their product to be selected. Often the sales critters 

137
 Chapter 8: Selecting a Biometrics Solution
involved will get pretty pushy about this, calling daily to see whether the 
acceptance criteria have been met and you’re ready to sign a check. When 
this behavior gets annoying, we usually just explain that the CEO is con-
cerned about the amount of time we’ve spent on the phone to support this 
product and wants us to explore other alternatives unless we can lower the 
contact time to zero for a month or so. If that doesn’t work, just tell the sales-
person not to call you for a while.
Also note that when you’re gathering data in areas that the manufacturer 
already publishes — such as FAR and FRR — significant deviations mean that 
either the manufacturer was very optimistic in its testing, or something is 
wrong with your test installation. Both are good reasons to have a represen-
tative come in for a closer look at your setup.
Selecting test subjects
Getting the right mix of people into the test program is also vital to getting 
good results from a test installation; you want to get usability information 
from a wide sample of the intended user base. All too often, technology tests 
are conducted using other technologists — whose view of how systems work 
is completely different from that of normal people. The right mix will include 
people who have varying degrees of familiarity with technology, biometrics, 
and authentication.
 
A somewhat delicate subject to address while choosing people for biometric 
testing is that you’ll need to choose people at extreme ends of the physical 
spectrum related to the specific biometric to know how the system performs 
with the extremes of the physiological characteristics it’s measuring. For exam-
ple, Mike would bring in his 7’1” co-worker to help test the palm-print scan-
ner system, since this guy’s palm is about 1/3 wider than Mike’s and the new 
system should be comfortable for everyone to use. (Now, if we were designing 
a biometric access system for NBA locker rooms, we’d find the 5’2” custodian 
and make sure the vertical placement of the sensor still worked for him.)
 
Be sensitive in this part of the selection process; don’t include users who will 
obviously not be able to use the system, unless you’re also testing the alterna-
tive authentication system. If your palm scanner is right-hand-only and you have 
someone in the company with no right hand, you already know that person can’t 
use the new system, and you’ll have to make alternative accommodations.
Training staff and users
Because you’re going to have real people using a real system, you’ll need to 
actually teach the selected users how the new biometric system works, and 
give them a taste of how they’ll interact with it. For the user experience to be 
well supported, you’ll also need to train administrators and support staff so they 
know how to operate and maintain the new system. You might be tempted, in 
some cases, to skimp on training administrative and support staff for a test — 
but your results will be somewhat skewed if you do, because the users won’t be 
getting the kind of support from your staff that they ordinarily would.

138
Part III: Implementing and Using Biometrics 
A good example of how staff training helps is in the enrollment process. For 
users to start using the system, they’ll have to go through an enrollment pro-
cess that captures their biometric data and stores it in the system for later 
comparison. In many cases, enrollment requires the acquisition of multiple 
samples to have enough data to eliminate mismatches that come from poor 
positioning or other factors in normal use. As you might expect, running 
your fingers though the print reader ten times in a row is a little tedious, and 
poor training of the person facilitating enrollment could make it unbearable 
or even invalidate the enrollment process altogether and force users to go 
through it all over again. Nobody’s going to like that much.
While training administrative staff and normal users on the system, pay close 
attention to how well your training material is received. Are any emergent 
problems in training due to poor materials, or is the system actually hard to 
learn? Training will be an ongoing part of using and maintaining the solution 
you select, so understanding how well this part of the process goes is a criti-
cal part of evaluating the proposed solution.
Flipping the switch
Once the solution is in place, your guinea pigs — (ahem) users — are selected 
and everyone is trained in the proper use of the test system, it’s time to hit 
the big switch and actually start using the system as a part of operations.
In some ways, this is harder to do with a test installation than it would be if 
you converted the whole organization. That’s because a test installation uses 
two sets of rules and operational procedures — one for the test subjects and 
another for everyone else. Keeping track of who should be doing what (and 
when) can be somewhat time-consuming, but it’s important if you want useful 
test data.
Make sure everyone involved knows what to expect when the test system 
is operational, and to whom they should report unexpected behavior. Also 
be sure to allocate time to monitoring the operation of your new biometric 
system — long enough to feel comfortable with its level of operation and sta-
bility. The first day, or even week, of operation for your test installation is not 
a good time to catch up on your vacation days. Instead, make sure that all the 
places where you want to capture information about the operation of the test 
are actually reliably capturing data — and that the data makes sense.
Measuring results
Once a reasonable amount of time has elapsed, you’ll have the data you need 
for making a final decision regarding the system under test. What amounts 
to a “reasonable amount of time” depends on how long it takes to make sure 
that each of your requirements for the system has been tested — and that 
you have data supporting the success or failure of each one. Even if you’ve 
covered all your requirements in a relatively short time, it’s sometimes help-
ful to run a test system through one or more natural cycles specific to the 
organization. For example, if you’ve implemented a palm reader that limits 

139
 Chapter 8: Selecting a Biometrics Solution
access to enrolled users only during their actual work shifts, you should 
operate the system through one complete combination of shifts, as well 
as any potential reorganization that might move people from one shift to 
another.
The final analysis will have one fairly simple component — essentially a 
checklist with all your requirements on it and a column for yes, no, and com-
ments. The more difficult part of measurement is really all the other informa-
tion that you acquired while operating the test, some of which you weren’t 
even looking for. If you replaced a human guard at the door with a biometric-
system-and-a-man-trap (a system which prevents a person who fails to 
authenticate from running away by trapping them), and everyone complained 
that the lobby just seems too barren without a real human greeting them in 
the morning, how do you figure that into your analysis?
Making the Selection
You’ve vetted your requirements and you’re pretty sure any solution that 
meets them will be acceptable. You’ve documented these requirements and 
received proposals from appropriate vendors, describing products that not 
only meet your requirements, but calculate the 371-millionth digit of pi (it’s 
3) while not busy improving your bottom line by at least 15 percent. What the 
heck, assume you’ve had the needed budget, time, and expertise available to 
test one or more of these potential solutions, and have copious data available 
to make a final decision on your new biometric authentication system.
In the best of all cases, you have identified several potential solutions that all 
satisfy your requirements — including functional requirements and budget. 
If you didn’t include the stability and support potential of the manufacturer 
in your requirements or RFP, you should definitely look at that now as a final 
deciding factor.
It’s no good to install a whiz-bang biometric ear-recognition-at-a-distance 
system that meets your needs perfectly if the company goes bankrupt next 
month or has a poorly organized support staff. That kind of critical informa-
tion can be difficult (or impossible) to come by, but in the case of large instal-
lations involving serious cash outlay, it’s quite typical to request financial 
statements from vendors or manufacturers to determine long-term viability.
If you have several viable candidates, the world is your oyster and you can 
start haggling on price. In fact, in a competitive market where you have sev-
eral viable choices, the final selection frontier is price. We’re not saying price 
should be weighted more heavily than other criteria; that depends on your 
specific circumstances. Rather, within your original budget constraints, pric-
ing is the last item you use to help make your final selection. That’s because 
it’s a variable that depends on the final list of candidates and can be influ-
enced at the final stages of negotiation.

140
Part III: Implementing and Using Biometrics 
 
What if your process yields only one viable candidate solution? At first glance, 
it may look like the decision is already made and you should just proceed. On 
the other hand, maybe your requirements were overly restrictive. There are 
a couple of factors that you should really consider if your process only yields 
a single viable candidate. If there’s only one player on the field, that vendor’s 
pricing is based on lack of competition; it’s hard to effectively negotiate at that 
point. Also, if that candidate is the only one to meet your criteria, guess who 
pretty much has you over a barrel in years to come, when it’s time to consider 
pricing, providing maintenance, and delivering upgrades? Still, if you’re still 
comfortable with the sole survivor at that point, your choice is made for you.
Playing nice
In a competitive-bid situation, you should always 
consider explaining to the losers why they didn’t 
win. If you’re respectful and considerate in how 
you present this information and the bidder is 
smart, they walk away with valuable informa-
tion about how to improve their product or their 
response to RFPs. Occasionally, you also learn 
things about their products and the winning bid 
that you would never have known without the 
follow-up. (“Yeah, everyone seems to be upset 
by the burning sensation as we laser-image the 
fingerprint. We’re working on a lower-power 
laser for the next version.”)

mplementing a biometric solution is like a lot of big IT projects, but there 
are a lot of wrinkles that most IT people aren’t used to dealing with. 
Although a biometric project involves fundamental changes to authentication 
and authorization services on the network, implementing biometrics also 
requires changes in users’ behavior that you don’t see in most projects — 
and collects fundamentally personal data from users that they’ve never had 
to share with the company (or almost anyone else) before.
Likewise, maintaining and upgrading a biometric system comes with unique 
(and sometimes unexpected) challenges. Human factors come into play here 
more than in almost any other type of IT project, because of the unique ways 
the users interact with biometrics. People tend to be particular about what 
they stick their fingers or eyeballs into; you have to recognize that while con-
sidering your implementation. Success or failure in most biometric projects 
is more people-dependent than technology-dependent.
Implementing the Biometrics System
At this stage of the process, the biometric system has been selected and per-
haps even purchased. Here we depart the realm of the theoretical and enter 
the world of reality — of putting your money where your mouth may have 
been during the selection phase (even if it alters your basic facial-recognition 
biometric sample). It’s time to make the chosen biometric system work in 
your organization.

142
Part III: Implementing and Using Biometrics 
If you’re the person who is supposed to make it all happen, perhaps you’re 
feeling a bit like a mountain climber standing on the flanks of Mt. Everest, 
gazing at the wind-wracked summit over three miles higher than your rela-
tively comfortable vantage point and thinking to yourself, How in the world 
am I going to get from where I am to that foreboding place up there?
Thankfully, (believe it or not) most biometric projects are far less effort than 
climbing Everest. It all starts with a plan, and help from others in the form of 
expertise and support. And think about how nice the view will be when you 
have the entire system up and running.
 
If you’re a small company that’s just getting a new lockset for the computer 
room that includes a biometric fingerprint reader, you can probably just buy 
the lockset and make sure that all the people who need to get into the com-
puter room get registered so they can get in when they need to. No big deal. 
You probably don’t need a lot of planning for that, beyond making sure that 
the FAR and FRR are within the tolerances you need. But if you’re implement-
ing a biometric building-access system in a twenty-thousand-employee orga-
nization, you’ll need to do a lot of advance planning to make sure the project 
goes off without a hitch.
Building a plan
A biometrics project — especially a big one that affects large numbers of 
users — requires advance planning to ensure that the implementation team 
will be able to design, build, and activate the biometric system. Planning 
is also required so the implementation can be completed on time and on 
budget, and the biometric system will perform as originally expected.
Getting a good project manager
Hopefully an experienced project manager is available to build the implemen-
tation plan. The larger the project, the more vital it is that a project manager 
with experience in project planning and management be available to keep the 
implementation moving in the right direction.
We’re reminded of a project manager who ran a large, year-long, single-sign-
on project team. Jeff ran a tight ship: he made sure we showed up at our 
weekly project meetings, that we were making progress on our tasks, and 
that he was aware of all significant issues. Left to our own devices, we’d have 
lagged behind and become distracted with the other cool and interesting 
technologies that were vying for our attention. Jeff kept the schedule and 
budget updated, helped overcome issues, and kept us focused on the project 
schedule and our need to pay attention to the project.

143
 Chapter 9: Implementing, Supporting, and Maintaining a Biometrics Solution
Sadly, not everyone appreciates great project management. There are always 
a few people in any large project who feel that the communications require-
ments are excessive — that the schedule is more like a “guideline” (they 
wish) and their own part of the project is essentially independent of the 
rest (ditto). You’ll hear them grumbling in the back of the weekly meetings 
about having “real work” to do, and asking if they really need to meet the 
deadline for their part as long as it’s done before the final installation date. 
Unfortunately, there’s no cure for this mindset except time and experience. 
When possible, it’s fun to have them project-manage a small group of their 
own on projects that can afford to be a little late (just be sure to tell them 
that the schedule is tied to their bonus).
Putting the plan together
A savvy project manager won’t build the schedule in a vacuum; instead, he or 
she will ask members of the project team (and other interested parties) plenty 
of questions to understand what’s needed to get the biometrics system imple-
mented. Here’s a short list of what the project manager has to do:
 
 Identify tasks: The project manager needs to know: What are all the 
tasks required to implement the biometric system? This quest should 
start with the high-level tasks, but should include the details as well.
 
 Identify hardware resources: This should include any servers required 
to support the solution, as well as any additional hardware needed for 
existing systems. For a biometrics installation, this will almost certainly 
include specialized hardware that isn’t on your “currently approved” list.
 
 Identify software resources: Any additional software required to imple-
ment and support the biometric system should be identified. This 
should include new software as well as upgrades to existing software.
 
 Identify network resources: Chances are your biometric solution 
requires some sort of network communication, particularly if it is used 
to support authentication in an IT environment. Not only do you need to 
know what network resources are required, but also how much network 
traffic your biometric system is expected to generate.
 
 In most cases, the biometric identification process needs to happen 
almost in real time — which may have an impact on network design and 
the proximity of biometric databases.
 
 Identify staff: Projects require trained and experienced staff members 
who know how to perform the various tasks that have been identified. 
If internal staff aren’t available — or aren’t experienced in one or more 
areas — you may have to identify contractors or consultants who can 
fill the gaps. In an ideal world, contractors manage themselves, but keep 
in mind that you’ll have expenses related to managing them as well, 
whether in their up-front fees or your own staff time.

144
Part III: Implementing and Using Biometrics 
 
 Build a budget: After you’ve identified all the needed staff, hardware, 
software, and other resources, you can establish a budget. It should 
address all the expenses shown here, plus those not covered in this sec-
tion.
 
 Build a schedule: When most of the preceding items are figured out, 
the project manager can put a schedule together. The schedule should 
include all the tasks required — including interdependencies, prerequi-
sites, and the resources required for each.
 
The plan in its entirety (and by this we mean the required resources, per-
sonnel, schedule, and budget) must be subjected to executive review and 
approval. Only after the plan has executive blessing can you safely proceed 
and execute the plan.
Executing the plan
Successful projects are not judged by their excellent plans, but by excellent 
execution. Many teams can create good plans, but fewer can carry them out. 
The inclusion of biometrics — still a new technology that incites factors that 
many IT departments are struggling with — can be enough to jeopardize the 
success of even the best plans.
Okay, we’re not telling you that your biometric project is going to fail — 
far from it. If you’re reading this book in a bookstore (or reading an online 
excerpt), know that we’re not telling you to shy away from biometrics 
because it’s too challenging; in fact, we are enthusiastic about biometrics and 
the increased security that results from their use. Rather, we’re saying you 
have to know where the risks are — and anticipate them.
 
Good planning is as much about anticipating potential failures and avoiding 
them as it is about finding the path to success.
Biometric-related risks
The specific risks associated with a biometric-related IT project are entirely 
due to the unique aspects of biometrics. Here’s a rogue’s gallery of risks:
 
 Changing human behavior: The introduction of biometrics into a tech-
nology environment demands that people change their behavior in a 
fairly radical way. With new applications or tools, we’re asking users to 
click here instead of there, to select data this way instead of that way, and 
so on. But a biometric project demands a fundamental change in behav-
ior. Imagine replacing all the light switches in your home with overhead 
pull-chains. How long do you think it would be before you stopped 
reaching for the wall switch every time you walked into a dark room? 
Okay. Multiply that hassle factor by a factor of at least ten.

145
 Chapter 9: Implementing, Supporting, and Maintaining a Biometrics Solution
 
 New personal behavior: Using biometrics requires that users interact 
with technology with their bodies. But wait — keyboards and mice are 
handled with hands, and displays are viewed with eyes. But people are 
accustomed to that. Biometrics introduces a new behavior that many 
users have never done — or have done rarely. Now we’re asking users 
to subject a part of their bodies (fingertips, palms, irises, retinas, what-
ever) to the system. Many will feel that use of the new system is . . .
 
 A “personally invasive” issue: Biometrics measure what some users 
consider personal — and private. Users may not wish to share their fin-
gerprints, iris scans, or other close measurements with the organization, 
feeling that it’s an invasion of their privacy. Some will openly object; 
others will quietly object but submit begrudgingly.
 
 Gunk in the electromechanical equipment: IT departments are becom-
ing accustomed to (nearly) trouble-free electronic equipment such as 
sealed disk drives and optical storage. Many of us started our careers 
back when computers had a significant mechanical aspect to them: card 
readers, line printers, reel-to-reel tape drives, and paper-tape readers 
required a lot of care and daily cleaning. Although biometric devices 
may lack the gritty mechanics of a card-punch, they are physically 
handled by users — and more prone to just wear out and/or get dirty 
than most IT departments are used to. In practical terms, we’re saying 
that many types of biometrics technology require some sort of periodic 
cleaning and/or maintenance. The bottom line is: Who is going to add 
“janitor” to their job description?
 
 Fear of communicable disease: Biometric devices that involve physical 
touch (such as a fingerprint reader or palm scanner) may be a put-off for 
some users. With the recent public concern over bird flu, TB, and MSRA, 
more people are wary of putting their hands (or other body parts) in 
places where others may have left germs. Hand-sanitizer stations nearby 
may help — but this is just another one of those factors that can make 
or break the implementation in some cases.
Project management
Project management doesn’t end when the project plan is built, finalized, and 
approved. That’s when it begins! Gas ’er up and let’s go: the real skills of proj-
ect management are put to the test when the project begins and the project 
manager has many issues to deal with, including these:
 
 Project team members whose other projects are still going past their 
anticipated end, which makes them less available for this project.
 
 Project team members who are distracted by less important things.
 
 Project team members who are distracted by more important things.
 
 Unscheduled sick time. (As opposed to scheduled sick time? We won’t go 
there.)

146
Part III: Implementing and Using Biometrics 
 
 Vacations — especially near year-end in organizations that enact use-it-
or-lose-it policies.
 
 Low estimates on effort required to complete tasks.
 
 Transfers and resignations.
We think you get the idea. A good project manager can’t squeeze blood out 
of a turnip (although we have worked with some who’ve tried), but one can 
do an admirable job of keeping people focused and working as close to the 
original schedule as possible. Later on you can try to find a market for turnip 
juice.
Really great project managers will do a good job of showing everyone how 
important it is that their part of the project goes exactly as planned — and 
how critical their efforts are to the project and the organization. A team 
member who understands this and still doesn’t perform should really be 
doing something else (maybe somewhere else, if you catch our drift).
Mid-course corrections
Surprises happen, even in the most disciplined organizations. Sick time, vaca-
tions, vendors changing the specs, servers arriving late, resignations, and 
other project emergencies throw a monkey wrench in projects, making them 
take longer and cost more (or, getting done on time while cutting corners 
that you’ll pay for later after the project team and the subject matter experts 
disband). But these things happen to almost every significant project — a 
good project manager expects them and deals with them, while keeping the 
project as close to the original schedule and budget as possible.
Running pilots and tests
There are a few ways to approach a technology implementation project. 
When an organization is bringing in an entirely new technology, we suggest 
that the organization try it out before making the purchase. It’s a little easier 
to change your mind when money hasn’t yet changed hands. You can try out 
a vendor’s biometric solution in some limited capacity — and if you don’t like 
it, you can put it back in the box and tell the vendor, “No, thanks.”
 
Unlike the white lies many of us tell when we return unwanted merchandise at 
the store, it’s really helpful to tell the biometrics vendor the truth if you don’t 
want their solution. The reason for this is that a good biometrics vendor will 
listen to your valid complaint, take the product back to his or her company, 
and give the design department a heads-up. (“See? I told you they wouldn’t like 
the fingerprint readers when we shaped them like lizards’ mouths!”)

147
 Chapter 9: Implementing, Supporting, and Maintaining a Biometrics Solution
Although your organization may have done a try-it-before-you-buy-it evalu-
ation, if you’re doing a large-scale implementation, we strongly suggest that 
you include a pilot rollout as part of the plan. The larger your project is — by 
whatever measure, but especially by the number of users affected — the 
more important a pilot will be for your biometric implementation. As we 
discuss earlier in this chapter, a biometrics project has more ways it can fail 
than do most other IT projects — so going slowly will help establish learning 
on all levels: integrating with existing systems, installing, training users, and 
gaining user acceptance.
A pilot is a small-scale implementation used to validate integration, instal-
lation, provisioning, training — and whatever other steps are in the imple-
mentation plan — on a small portion of the full environment. For example, 
if you’re planning on installing biometric palm-scanning readers on all the 
wiring-closet doors in all the buildings in town, we suggest you install one of 
those gizmos on just one door first, and let it “soak,” “burn in,” or whatever 
your favorite phrase is for “letting it run for a while to see how well it goes 
before we commit to the whole enchilada” (We don’t, however, recommend 
letting your enchiladas soak; that will make them soggy.)
Before starting the pilot, you need to establish success criteria. By this we 
mean, when the pilot is over, how will you know whether it was successful? 
Your criteria needs to be objective and measurable, and the techniques for 
measurement established up front.
What will you measure? Be sure to measure the users. More than with most 
other types of projects, user acceptance and opinion are vital to biometrics 
— unless you enjoy the users coming in the night with torches and pitch-
forks, demanding that you fix the system or throw it out.
 
We suggest you have your legal department people insert a clause in the con-
tract with your biometric solution provider that makes the solution provider 
at least partially responsible for the outcome of the pilot. With more skin in the 
game, the vendor is more likely to help, and the pilot is more likely to succeed.
After the pilot, you’re ready to implement the full solution, right? Don’t be so 
anxious. After you’ve run a pilot, you have some nice, straightforward prepa-
ratory steps to take:
 
 Collect measurements
 
 Collect user-acceptance data
 
 Call a debriefing session where project participants, stakeholders, and 
even some users discuss what went well, what didn’t go so well, and 
what changes should take place.

148
Part III: Implementing and Using Biometrics 
 
 Decide whether the pilot should be continued, started over, or whether 
the full implementation should take place.
 
 Obtain executive approval for decisions made during the debriefing.
Only after all this happens can you really be ready to throw the switch.
Throwing the switch
In the movie, Young Frankenstein, Dr. Frankenstein (or should we say, 
Frahnkensteen?) calls down to Igor, “Throw the third switch!” to which Igor 
warns, “Not the third switch!!” Frankenstein replies, “Throw it! Throw it, I 
say!!”
In real life, we really do feel the tension when we throw the third switch on a 
project — the switch that gives the new system life. As with Frankenstein’s 
monster, the real complications of what you’ve just done might not be appar-
ent for quite a while. For example, everything might work fine until some 
weekly janitorial-maintenance “event” happens, and you discover that these 
folks haven’t been trained in the use of the new system, so the bathrooms are 
all out of soap and bathroom paper.
Phasing in a solution — if you can
If you’re implementing biometrics on a large scale, we suggest you phase it in 
if possible. Implementing the system all at once is a little riskier. Here’s why:
 
 If something goes wrong that wasn’t seen in the evaluation or the test, 
there could be a lot more disruption as you scramble to fix it.
 
 Implementing all at once takes more resources (a lot more) and will 
probably cost you more as well.
 
 All-at-once implementations also have the unpleasant characteristic of 
being guaranteed to affect your boss either for good or for ill.
 
 Phased implementations allow you to choose who might be annoyed 
with you if things go poorly.
Creating backout plans
It’s smart to anticipate that things can and do go wrong in technology proj-
ects. As you develop your implementation plans, you should think through 
each step; in particular, imagine how each step can be undone or reversed if 
something bad happens.
 
Here are some implementation principles that apply to any technology 
project — which we hope you’ll apply to your biometrics implementation 
plan:

149
 Chapter 9: Implementing, Supporting, and Maintaining a Biometrics Solution
 
 Create backups: Back up systems, databases, configuration files — what-
ever you’re changing.
 
 Change the copy, not the original: When a step in a process involves 
transforming data from an old format to a new format, preserve a copy 
of the old format so you can easily revert to it. If that isn’t possible (for 
instance, if the dataset is just too large), then you need to develop the 
capability to reverse each transformation you do, in case something 
goes wrong and you have to go back.
 
 Test each backout plan: You wouldn’t create an implementation plan 
without testing it — and it’s just as important to test a backout plan to 
make sure it will work. (If you’re skeptical right now, think about para-
chutes — and the reason for reserve chutes.)
 
 Predetermine when to back out: When things go wrong with a project 
like this, there’s always a tendency to think “We almost have it. Just a 
little more time and we won’t have to back out and restart.” We’ve seen 
this tendency prevail until the CEO gets fed up and comes over to see 
who needs a kick in the pants. Know what the limits are beforehand — 
and stick to them.
 
 Properly set expectations: Let folks know how confident you are in the 
implementation plan. If you’re working with really new technology (or 
you were unable to do a pilot), there’s no shame in telling people that 
things might get bumpy — and that under some circumstances you’re 
prepared to back out. This is far better than having to do a totally unex-
pected backout on installation day.
Informing users
The best technology projects include not only the plans, steps, and con-
tingencies for making the technology work, but also everything needed to 
ensure that all users know the essentials: what’s coming, why it’s coming, 
how it will work, when it will be available, and how to use it.
This is like the old adage, what if you threw a party and nobody came? You 
wouldn’t plan a party, order food and decorations, plan entertainment, and 
make other arrangements, but not tell anyone what, when, where, and why.
Equally poor form would be a last-minute e-mail to users (as shown in Figure 
9-1), informing them of the big project just a few days before.

IT Helpdesk
This approach of shoving a solution down the throats of all employees is 
short-sighted for several reasons:
 
 It doesn’t solicit input or ideas.
 
 It makes employees feel that something is being done to them.
 
 It doesn’t address potential concerns about privacy for the users’ bio-
metric information or how that information will be used.
 
 It doesn’t take into account any employees who may be working 
remotely and won’t be able to register from remote locations.
 
 It doesn’t provide any sources for additional information.
 
 It doesn’t address alternatives or workarounds.
 
 It doesn’t list the names of the persons on the project team. (Is some-
body afraid of the response?)
 
 It doesn’t accommodate user training or special needs.
Methods
Even in a situation where a new biometric-based authentication or authori-
zation solution is being implemented for use by all employees, in our opin-
ion you still want to market it (in effect, “sell the idea”) to your employees. 
Ideally, you’ll be able to show everyone how the new system will have a 
positive impact on the organization, further organizational goals, and demon-
strate a link between those goals and personal benefit to employees. For the 
project to be successful:
 
 Users must understand why the system is being implemented.
 
 Users must understand how to use the system.
 
 Users must understand the impact of the system on their work and on 
the company.

151
 Chapter 9: Implementing, Supporting, and Maintaining a Biometrics Solution
These three key objectives are accomplished with information that is com-
municated to employees in meaningful and effective ways. We break down this 
requirement as follows:
 
 Information: Employees need information that explains what’s going 
on: what this biometrics system is, how will it work, and why it’s being 
implemented.
 
 
Be prepared to answer this worry: Is it because they don’t trust us?
 
 Communicated: Different people assimilate information in a variety of 
ways. Some prefer on-screen text; others comprehend printed materials; 
spoken words work best for some; others want illustrations or diagrams. 
Information should be communicated over a variety of media, including 
(but not limited to) e-mail, voice mail, posters, flyers, Web sites, videos, 
and so on.
 
 Meaningful: The information conveyed must be meaningful. Users need 
to understand what is going on, how it will affect them, and why it is 
happening.
 
 Effective: If users are expected to do something, the information com-
municated must clearly spell out what. If there are rules, exceptions, 
questions, and so on, users must understand how it all works.
In a larger organization, these communications might be best handled by 
marketing professionals who know how to put together a message campaign 
that will reach all users in an effective, meaningful way. Larger organizations 
that lack these skills should consider outsourcing this task or prepare to face 
the struggles of doing it the hard way — either through more effort or with 
more active management, to make sure the users are “getting it” and under-
stand what’s going on.
Considerations
Let’s face it: Even with an effective communication plan, some employees just 
never come out from under their rock. We don’t know if they’re just oblivi-
ous, or if they’re so focused on their work that they never pay attention to 
any incoming communications, including the new mouse pad, screen savers 
and pocket protectors that scream, “Biometrics are coming! Biometrics are 
coming!!” (Okay, from a public-relations point of view, screaming mouse pads 
may not be such a good idea. But you see what we mean.) Even despite all 
the communications — the posters, the picnics, and everything else — some 
will be late to the party or won’t come at all. We’ve had users respond to the 
PA announcement that there will be an outage related to the installation in 
a panic, with excuses ranging from “I never read e-mail from IT” to “Oh, you 
meant this Friday the 22nd.”

152
Part III: Implementing and Using Biometrics 
Except in smaller organizations where you can put someone in charge of noti-
fying each person personally, there will just be some who are left behind. You 
just need to be prepared to deal with a few people who will be completely sur-
prised when they can’t get into the building on Monday morning or can’t log 
in to the network (and what’s that funny new mouse on my desk?).
Training users
One great way to get users properly informed is to organize training for 
everyone. If the new system is really simple, then they may only need a 5-to-
10-minute session; if it’s more complicated, a little more time may be needed.
There are two approaches that can both be made to work: training before 
implementation, and training right afterward.
Pre-implementation training
You can train users before the biometric system is implemented. Training 
prior to implementation has its strong points:
 
 Training and marketing merge into one activity.
 
 You get users exposed to the new technology before it’s actually imple-
mented.
 
 Some users might ask questions on topics that the project team never 
considered.
 
 The training schedule can be a bit more relaxed, since they’re not 
required to learn the system to get into work today.
 
 They’ll know how to use the technology when it is implemented.
One disadvantage of pre-implementation training is that users are apt to 
forget what it was all about if too many days or weeks elapse between their 
training and their first opportunity to use the real system.
Post-implementation training
When we say “post-implementation” training, we’re really saying that it’s best 
to start training just as the biometric system is being implemented — we don’t 
mean days or weeks afterwards. Also, post-implementation training doesn’t 
mean that this is the first thing most users will hear about the new system. If 
anything, planning for post-implementation training means additional warn-
ings and information about the upcoming events, since it will be an impactful 
event that must run very smoothly.

153
 Chapter 9: Implementing, Supporting, and Maintaining a Biometrics Solution
One really useful way to do training at implementation — or just after — is 
to combine training with registration, so each employee can learn about the 
new biometric technology and get fingerprints, palms, irises, retinas, or what-
evers registered during the training session. When it’s done right
 
 This approach lets each person register and then begin using the new 
system right away.
 
 People who aren’t available right away (because of vacations, business 
trips, and so on) can attend the training later and still get registered.
 
 Often the mechanism for post-installation training and registration will 
need to remain in place for the life of the system, because new employ-
ees will need training and registration.
In an organization with more than a few hundred employees, you can hold 
training sessions all day for the first few days, and then less often. When 
you’re registering users during training, hopefully you’re keeping good 
records so you know who the stragglers are, and you can get them through 
the training to reach the 100-percent mark.
Dealing with user issues
The law of big numbers states that in a large enough company, there will be 
people who behave in almost any strange way you can imagine (those of you 
in big companies know exactly what we are talking about). Here are a few 
examples of the kinds of user issues you may have to deal with:
 
 User doesn’t show up at training: Some just won’t go to the training ses-
sions. Maybe they’re shy, too busy, or afraid of rooms with bright lights.
 
 User refuses to be registered: With privacy such a significant issue, 
you’re going to have some employees who — out of fear or lack of infor-
mation — will resist registering with the biometric system because they 
feel they’re giving up valuable private information.
 
 User refuses to use the system: This one’s similar to the last item: Some 
users will resist using the biometric system for a variety of reasons, 
including privacy or health (particularly with biometric systems that 
involve touching something like a fingerprint reader or palm scanner).
 
 Users mess with the system: . . . or with themselves, to “make a point.” 
This could be related to privacy issues or some personal war with tech-
nology, but “accidentally” marking all their fingertips with indelible ink 
is an example we’ve actually seen.

154
Part III: Implementing and Using Biometrics 
Supporting Users
After a biometric system is deployed, it’s going to require some attention. As 
with any electronics-based system, biometric devices are prone to failure — 
let’s hope it’s infrequent, even rare — but failures do occur. Not only the 
equipment, but users will need some attention as well: they need to know 
how to use the system properly, and this means knowing where to go for 
information in case they forget something (or if they’re new).
Fault management
Every type of IT and electromechanical system is prone to failure; ask anyone 
who’s ever used one over time. Whether frequent or rare, failures do happen.
 
When coupled with all its dependent systems, networks, and other compo-
nents, a system as a whole will have a greater likelihood of failure than each of 
its separate components.
There are two ways that you’ll learn of a failure of a component in your bio-
metric solution:
 
 A monitoring system will alert you.
 
 A user will call you.
If you have a monitoring system, then both methods will apply in your orga-
nization. Without a monitoring system, your users become your monitoring 
system.
We suppose there’s also a third option: no one will tell you. That would mean 
people are finding some way around your biometric system. In a building 
with multiple entrances, if you notice (say) weeds growing up around one of 
the back entrances, you might check to see whether the biometric device is 
working. If it isn’t, then perhaps no one bothered to tell you — which is prob-
ably indicative of other problems beyond the scope of this book.
Monitoring
The beauty of a monitoring system is that you’re more apt to discover a 
problem before your users are. Depending upon the type of biometric system 
you’re using, you may be able to set up some monitoring of the biometric 
hardware (or the connected system) that will enable you to capture alerts 
and error messages and pipe them into a monitoring application.

155
 Chapter 9: Implementing, Supporting, and Maintaining a Biometrics Solution
Depending on the biometric system, monitoring may or may not be cost-
effective. But remember: It’s not just about the dollars, but about user pro-
ductivity. Getting a truly meaningful and accurate estimate on any cost or 
productivity savings may well mean having a monitoring system that enables 
faulty devices to be repaired as soon as they’re discovered.
Keep in mind, however, that a monitoring system is only as good as the 
functioning sensors currently in place — and dead systems sometimes tell 
no tales. A monitoring system will have a hard time detecting (for example) 
that a fingerprint sensor has a grime buildup that’s about to start creating a 
bunch of false rejections until someone cleans it — but a heuristic monitor 
that spotted an increase in the FRR for the grimy sensor, prior to complete 
failure, might be helpful. If you rely on the systems themselves to report their 
health (or lack of health), keep in mind that sometimes components die with-
out informing anyone (dead systems tell no tales). An independent monitor 
that polls each component from time to time will do a better job of letting 
you know when something is wrong.
Helpdesk
All but the very tiniest companies have an established protocol for whom to 
call when various systems in an organization (computers, lights, heat, water, 
and so on) require attention. In most organizations, a central help desk exists 
to accept complaints of every kind, which can be dispatched to the person or 
department that will actually fix whatever the broken thing is this time.
Organized help desks have references available that help them to figure out 
exactly what the caller is talking about when something is amiss. Before a 
biometrics system is implemented, the helpdesk needs to be equipped with 
several facts about the system so that they can help the caller.
Many companies have a goal of fixing problems during that first phone call. 
To accomplish this, helpdesk personnel have more extensive resources 
available that guide them through some simple troubleshooting (for open-
ers, is the computer plugged in, is the power-strip light illuminated . . . ?). 
Sometimes helpdesk personnel have administrative access to systems so 
they can get an instant look at the status of a user’s system or account — and 
can fix things easily while the user is still on the phone. Organizations with 
this “first-call resolution” as an objective will have to ensure that helpdesk 
personnel have the right tools and access — and train them on how the 
biometric system works so they can fix simple problems or help users to fix 
them on their own.
In the case if biometric authentication systems, keep in mind that they 
have something significant in common with other authentication systems: 
Typically they’re set to lock users out after multiple unsuccessful attempts. 

156
Part III: Implementing and Using Biometrics 
As with password-based authentication systems, the helpdesk will need the 
capability to reset a user’s account to allow the user to log in. Helpdesk per-
sonnel should also be trained to ask useful questions about how the account 
got locked out in the first place — here the idea is to identify bad devices, 
stolen credentials (such as a username or badge associated with the biomet-
ric data), bad procedures, or improper use.
Repairs and replacement scenarios
The nature of electronics and electromechanical devices tells us that some 
devices will fail and require replacement. Your organization will need to be 
prepared to acquire (or stock) replacement parts and components — and be 
ready to use them if and when a biometric reader stops working for good.
Replacing a faulty unit is only part of the picture, however. Another aspect 
of the situation is to figure out how users access building spaces and com-
puter systems when the biometric reader is broken. This, too, is a scenario 
that requires advance contingency planning. If a building-entrance biomet-
ric reader fails, how are you going to admit workers during a workday? 
(Propping the door open is probably a very bad idea.) Maybe you have to put 
personnel at the entrance to check IDs, or post a sign and have people use 
another entrance.
 
It’s smart to fully document a device-failure-and-replacement scenario — com-
plete with time estimates, a list of necessary resources (equipment, tools, and 
the people needed), and the expected impact of a device failure.
Publishing information for users
Most organizations prepare and publish information for users on a wide vari-
ety of topics — including benefits, compensation, policies and procedures, 
information systems, and so on. When a biometric system is introduced to an 
organization, the organization had better get some information prepared and 
made available so users have a handle on how to use the system.
Intranet
Intranets are the medium of choice for publishing nearly every form of 
in-house information. Information about your biometric systems can be 
included. Depending upon the type of biometric system you’ve implemented, 
there are a variety of things you can make available for users:
 
 Promotional materials that were developed for the initial implementation
 
 User instructions
 
 Troubleshooting steps (things to check if it’s not working)
 
 How to register (or re-register)

157
 Chapter 9: Implementing, Supporting, and Maintaining a Biometrics Solution
 
 Original manufacturer instructions if they’re useful
 
 Short video clips of users using the biometric system (“Oh, that’s how I 
put my hand on the palm reader!”)
 
 Whom to call for more help
 
One of the objectives for providing self-service information is to improve user 
productivity and reduce helpdesk calls (which are more costly).
Hard-copy materials
For the first few weeks or months, you may want to add hard-copy materials 
to your collection of information for users. One idea is to keep a supply of 
brochures or flyers that were used at the initial implementation. They can be 
given to new employees who join the organization after the biometric system 
is implemented — those materials can be tailored at the outset to be useful 
not only to employees who were around when the system is implemented, 
but also to new employees later on.
 
Printed materials, unlike your intranet, may find their way out of the confines 
of the company — and into the hands of people you don’t trust. If you feel that 
any portion of the information in these materials could compromise the secu-
rity of your system you should consider redacting that for printed materials.
Health issues
For the type of biometric systems that involve touch — especially those 
mounted on community devices such as building entrances — the topic 
of communicable diseases is sure to surface. Many common diseases are 
transmitted by touch, even indirect touch (consider doorknobs, telephones, 
and bathroom fixtures). Logic tells us that biometric devices such as finger-
print readers and palm scanners can — if conditions are right — serve as an 
infection vector if a contagious employee uses one of those devices. In most 
cases, the biometric device is neither more nor less capable of transmitting 
disease than a doorknob — which we don’t usually provide additional sani-
tary measures for — but user perception is everything here.
In a situation where MSRA, influenza, or other diseases spread by touch are 
rampant, your organization may need to take steps to ease employees’ fears 
and limit the transmission of communicable disease. Some possible remedies 
include these:
 
 Hand-sanitizer stations strategically placed just before or after a touch-
based biometric station
 
 Dispensers of surface disinfectants used to clean biometric readers 
(make sure that the type of biometric reader is suited to such cleaners — 
that they won’t become clogged with, or blinded by, cleaning agents)

158
Part III: Implementing and Using Biometrics 
We think it would be a good idea to develop some requirements around this 
issue. See Chapter 8 for more information on the methods used to select a 
suitable provider of biometrics solutions.
Maintaining a Biometric System
Biometric systems are generally thought of as a component in a larger 
information system. Most biometric devices contain microprocessors and 
firmware (software) that sometimes require updates and/or replacement. A 
well-designed system will allow these operations to be accomplished with 
little or no down time or retraining.
Software updates
A biometric system often includes software that runs on a workstation or 
server. Companies that produce software are usually under pressure to ship 
software before it’s really ready — so those companies have to continue 
developing the software long after it’s been put in the hands of customers. 
This means they must have a way to get software updates deployed.
We aren’t going to tell you how to update the software in your biometric 
system — we presume that you have system administrators (or someone 
similarly harried) who know how to update software. As long as they follow 
good practices — such as performing backups before installing updates, and 
reading the release notes so the implications of the updates are fully known 
before installing the software — you’ll probably be okay.
 
One measure that we do advocate for critical systems is that you avoid com-
bining them with other critical components on the same servers. Not only is 
there potential for harmful interaction between the two (or more) critical 
systems in that situation, but also a kind of domino effect: An update that goes 
haywire could potentially affect multiple critical systems instead of just one.
Hardware updates
Biometric systems have a hardware component — a fingerprint scanner, 
palm scanner, iris scanner, earlobe scanner, whatever. Fortunately, hardware 
engineers seem to have better luck with releasing finished products than do 
software engineers. As a rule, few (if any) hardware upgrades are required, 
though they do happen from time to time.

159
 Chapter 9: Implementing, Supporting, and Maintaining a Biometrics Solution
Firmware updates
Many types of biometric devices have firmware, which is just software that’s 
a part of electronic devices. Digital cameras, MP3 players, and DVD players 
have firmware, too.
Sometimes the manufacturer of a biometric product will update the firmware 
for its devices. As with software updates, you’ll need to figure out how the 
firmware updates are actually performed, but you’ll also want to read the 
release notes to make sure you actually need the firmware upgrade.
 
In some cases, firmware updates can be impossible to undo. More manufac-
turers are making firmware upgrades less dangerous, but there is still some 
danger that a firmware upgrade will turn an expensive piece of hardware into 
an oddly-shaped brick. That’s what backup hardware is there for. (It is there, 
right?)
Change management
If you asked people in IT management if uptime and availability were important 
to them, most or all of them would affirm their importance. But if you asked 
them if they’re using a change management process, fewer would say so.
Change management is the formal process of vetting every proposed change 
in a system prior to making the change. The steps in a change management 
process typically look like this:
 
1. Proposed change: Someone requests a change be made to a system. 
This change could be something as simple as a configuration change 
or as complicated as a software or operating system upgrade. The 
requested change should include these elements:
 
• Description of the change
 
• Business or operational justification for the change
 
• Who will perform the change
 
• When the change will be made
 
• Impact of not doing the change
 
• Risks associated with making the change
 
• Backout plan in case the change is unsuccessful
 
• Anticipated user impact (such as downtime while the change is 
made)

160
Part III: Implementing and Using Biometrics 
 
• Other systems affected by the change
 
• Test results (hopefully the change was tested on a test environ-
ment)
 
2. Change review: The proposed change is circulated for review among all 
the formal participants in the change-management process.
 
3. Change approval: Participants in the process discuss the proposed 
changes to identify any other risks or impacts. Then they can decide 
whether the change can take place as planned.
 
4. Change wrap-up: After the change is made, final recordkeeping can be 
filed to record the successful implementation of the change.
Organizations that use a process based on these steps experience far fewer 
unscheduled downtime incidents. When proposed changes are discussed 
among stakeholders, surprises (and their resulting downtime) have less 
chance to happen. In our experience, the most common reason for unsched-
uled downtime for a service is poor (or nonexistent) change management, 
not equipment failure.
Configuration management
In a computing environment, changes in configuration can become pretty 
complicated and hard to track when they take place on all the computers and 
in all the system layers (operating system, database, application, tools, and 
so on). Systems can get out of sync along the way; things can get really cha-
otic in less time than you’d probably think — especially in an environment 
that lacks adequate change-management processes.
Configuration management is the process of tracking all the configuration 
changes that occur in a given system or group of systems. In short, configura-
tion management means keeping a journal of all the changes that occur in a 
system. The purpose of configuration management (or CM) is to provide a full 
history of the changes made to a system, to support any troubleshooting or 
diagnosis needed in the future.
For example, suppose a server supporting a biometric solution begins to mal-
function: one of its processes has developed an apparent memory leak that 
causes the process to grow until it consumes all available memory — and 
crashes. With a good record of the changes happening on a system, it’s not 
hard to determine that a recently installed operating-system patch is the cul-
prit. With the cause of the problem identified, the organization can take steps 
to remedy the situation.

161
 Chapter 9: Implementing, Supporting, and Maintaining a Biometrics Solution
 
There are configuration-management tools available that automate the collec-
tion of CM information into one resource: a configuration-management data-
base (CMDB). These tools are handy not only for tracking changes, but also 
for making automated changes on systems. In organizations with dozens or 
hundreds of servers, this is the only way to go.
The discipline of CM can be applied to a biometric system, even if there are 
no CM tools in place. It takes discipline, for sure — but good records kept 
from early on in a biometrics implementation — usually in the form of a jour-
nal — can be invaluable if problems crop up.
Upgrades
When you’ve had your biometrics system for more than a few years, your 
supplier is almost sure to tempt you with upgrades. The newer devices will 
be, um, newer, but also smaller, faster, easier to use, and possibly shinier.
Our advice to you is to keep your original devices for as long as possible. 
Your CFO (or whoever is responsible for the organization’s finances) will 
appreciate your keeping the biometrics system going at least until the hard-
ware investment is fully depreciated — which will probably be at least three 
years. Not only that, but upgrading to newer devices will involve labor, sys-
tems changes (maybe), and possibly user retraining as well. Remember that 
all expenses should be considered with respect to the operational benefit to 
the organization. If the upgrade doesn’t provide a required benefit, then it’s 
just about shininess. Get some sunglasses.

Chapter 10
Securing Biometrics Systems
In This Chapter
 Identifying threats and vulnerabilities
 Investigating typical attacks
 Keeping biometric systems safe
 Employing security standards and practices
A
 biometric system is, in the generic sense, just another information 
system. Like any information system, this one contains information — 
some of it sensitive — that must be protected from authorized disclosure, 
modification, or corruption.
Unlike most other information systems, a biometric system is used to protect 
other systems and assets. The value, then, of the biometric system is equal to 
the value of all the assets that it protects. More specifically, the value of a 
security failure associated with the biometric system is the sum of all the 
value associated with systems it is in place to protect. When you see it this 
way, you will begin to realize that the level of attention to security of a bio-
metric system should be quite high.
This chapter looks at the vulnerabilities present in biometric systems and the 
threats that endanger them. We discuss typical attacks on biometric systems, 
steps you can take to strengthen the security of a biometric system, and the 
assets in the organization that such strengthening helps to protect.
Biometric System Threats and 
Vulnerabilities
Biometric technology has something in common with any technology used to 
protect valuable business assets: It will be relentlessly attacked until its 
weaknesses can be found and exploited. The biometric systems themselves 

164
Part III: Implementing and Using Biometrics 
may contain valuable information that becomes the target of attackers. Thus, 
in this section, we discuss threats to biometric systems and the vulnerabili-
ties those threats target. It’s important to understand those threats and vul-
nerabilities before we can hope to adequately protect our assets.
Before we go any further, let’s look at the meaning of the terms threat, vulner-
ability and risk. Over the years we’ve found these terms to be used inter-
changeably and incorrectly. As with any industry jargon, these terms are 
tossed around and used by people who do fully understand their meaning, 
and by those who think they do — but don’t really.
 
 Vulnerability: a weakness in a system that may permit an attacker to 
compromise it.
 
 Threat: a potential activity that would, if it occurred, harm a system.
 
 Risk: the potential negative impact if a harmful event were to occur.
The terms vulnerability, threat, and risk can be visualized like this: Imagine a 
game of chess, where one player has a very weak position, and the other 
player has a very strong position. The player with the weak position is unable 
to protect his king — this is a vulnerability. The weak player’s king is vulnera-
ble to attack – a position of high risk. The strong player has powerful pieces 
(such as a queen, bishops, and rooks) that are in low risk positions to easily 
capture the weak player’s king — this is a threat.
And while we’re at it, there are some other words we should discuss:
 
 Attack: the act of carrying out a threat with the intention of harming 
a system.
 
 Exploit (verb): the act of carrying out a threat against a specific 
vulnerability.
 
 Exploit (noun): a program, tool, or technique that can be used to attack 
a system.
Using the chess analogy again, the strong player could attack the weak 
player, exploiting his vulnerability to capture his king. The strong player’s 
method of attack would be known as his exploit against the weak, 
high-risk player.
When you understand these terms, then discussions that use them will be 
clearer and more comprehensible.
 
Not all vulnerabilities are of the type that can be attacked or exploited by 
someone of malicious intent. Some vulnerabilities could lead to human 
error — whether of omission or commission — that could result in harm to a 

165
 Chapter 10: Securing Biometrics Systems
system. An example of this type of a vulnerability is a computer program 
whose user interface is so obscure that it leads to users who select the wrong 
options or perform the wrong tasks, resulting in errors and mistakes. Although 
an attacker may not have intent or means to attack this kind of a vulnerability, 
the vulnerability still exists — and can still result in trouble. Usually it’s just a 
matter of time.
We hope that you’re now clear on these important terms; when you are, the 
rest of this section will make a lot more sense. If you’re a security expert, 
then you may have skipped this introduction, or perhaps it served as a handy 
refresher. Either way, here’s where we get down to discussing real threats 
and vulnerabilities.
Natural threats
Natural threats to a biometric system are types of events caused by nature, 
also known as “acts of God.” These include
 
 Flood
 
 Wildfire
 
 Earthquake
 
 Lightning
 
 Landslide or avalanche
 
 Volcano
We could include asteroid strikes, but you get the idea. All these and more 
have the potential to knock out biometric devices and systems. We don’t 
want to turn this chapter into a miniature disaster-recovery book, but we do 
want to observe that many naturally occurring threats can damage biometric 
devices, systems, and equipment, as well as supporting infrastructure such 
as networks and servers. In many cases, an organization’s disaster-recovery 
planning automatically includes support for such systems as biometric 
authentication servers. However, biometric devices are sometimes located in 
remote buildings that contain no other devices, while the servers keep 
chugging away in some other location, perhaps hundreds of miles away.
 
In some extreme cases, you should consider the effects of a natural disaster 
on the availability of a biometric system or measure. For example, people 
hunched over in a severe hailstorm and running for the door won’t present 
good gait-based biometrics for the camera; any injury that alters appearance 
could throw off some of the other measurements; even an influenza pandemic 
could throw off voice-recognition systems.

166
Part III: Implementing and Using Biometrics 
Later in this chapter, the “Protecting Biometric Infrastructure” section 
discusses methods that can be used to protect biometric systems against 
natural threats.
Man-made threats
Man-made threats are those caused by actions — or inactions — of human 
beings, often resulting in malfunctions or damage to biometric equipment. 
Some of these threats include
 
 Fire and fire-extinguishing agents
 
 Malware (viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and so on)
 
 Sabotage and vandalism
 
 Hazardous materials accident
 
 Power-supply malfunction or failure
 
 Public-utility interruption
 
 Communications failure
 
 Social unrest and riots
 
 Terrorism and war
As with the natural threats listed earlier, this list is not meant to be compre-
hensive; rather, it should give you a better idea of the range of activities that 
can result in biometric systems not operating when they’re needed.
 
Unlike natural threats, man-made threats may specifically target an organiza-
tion for political, religious, ideological, or economic reasons. Some organ-
izations just seem to attract ill will from certain individuals or groups. If your 
organization fits into this category, chances are you’re already aware of this 
fact, and have taken measures to protect your business interests and assets. 
(If you haven’t, now would be a better time to start than later.)
Biometric system vulnerabilities
Biometric systems are specialized; they include devices used to measure 
certain characteristics of individuals, but they may also include servers, 
operating systems, application software, and database-management systems. 
In this section, we discuss general vulnerabilities found in many types of 
information systems, as well as those specific biometric-related 
vulnerabilities. We break down the vulnerabilities by category.

167
 Chapter 10: Securing Biometrics Systems
Physical vulnerabilities
Physical vulnerabilities refer to weaknesses that may be present that would 
permit an attacker to physically access or harm a biometric system. Some of 
these vulnerabilities include:
 
 Biometric device: Although users need to be able to access biometric 
devices to use them, some device designs or installation methods may 
permit someone to damage — or even steal — a biometric device. It may 
also be possible for an intruder to alter the behavior of the device, 
enabling unauthorized persons to fool the biometric system into grant-
ing access. This physical vulnerability is exacerbated if the devices are 
deployed to control physical access to a secure area — and so must be 
placed in an unsecure area.
 
 Cabling: An intruder who can access cabling may be able to eavesdrop 
on the communications between biometric devices and servers, or 
between servers. This may enable an intruder to obtain sensitive infor-
mation — and biometric data qualifies as sensitive. An intruder may also 
be able to block communications or alter communications through a 
man-in-the-middle attack, where someone who is literally in the middle of 
a communication between two parties can alter the communications 
going in both directions without the knowledge of either party.
 
 Server: If an intruder can gain physical access to a server, then he or 
she may be able to take complete control over it, whether by altering 
the software, the hardware, and stored data, or by stealing the 
server altogether.
 
 Network devices: An intruder who can gain physical access to 
network devices such as routers, hubs, switches, and firewalls may be 
able to eavesdrop on network communication, alter communications, or 
block communications.
Operating-system vulnerabilities
Biometric devices are often connected to a central server that contains the 
entire database of authorized biometric data — as well as the software that 
communicates with biometric devices. Servers all contain operating systems 
such as Windows or Linux which, if improperly managed, can have vulner- 
abilities such as these:
 
 Missing security patches
 
 Configuration errors
 
 Lack of, or improper, hardening
 
 Improper user access configuration

168
Part III: Implementing and Using Biometrics 
Database vulnerabilities
Your database-management systems (DBMSs) that store biometric data — 
such as Oracle, MySQL, and SQL Server — can have vulnerabilities of their 
own. They can permit an intruder to steal, alter, or destroy stored data. Some 
of these vulnerabilities in a DBMS include
 
 Missing security patches
 
 Configuration errors
 
 Lack of, or improper, hardening
 
 Clear-text (unencrypted) credentials stored on client systems
 
 Improper user access configuration
If you’ve noticed that the types of vulnerabilities between DBMSs and 
operating systems are similar, you’re right! Both have many things in 
common — and suffer from many of the same types of security problems.
Biometric software vulnerabilities
In a corporate biometric authentication system, biometric devices are often 
connected to a central computer that runs a biometric software application 
that is used to manage enrollment and access requests. This biometric soft-
ware may have vulnerabilities that could permit an intruder to steal data or 
unauthorized personnel to bypass biometric controls to gain entry into facili-
ties or data. The operating system and database may be secure, but a vulner-
ability in the biometric software can just as easily result in a security breach.
Some of the types of vulnerabilities that could lead to these intrusions 
include:
 
 Configuration errors: The software could be configured in such a way 
that could result in security weaknesses including authentication 
bypass, exposure of sensitive data, or malfunction.
 
 Installation errors: If the biometric application software was installed 
incorrectly, this could result in exposed data, elevated permissions, or 
malfunctions.
 
 Permissions errors: If the biometric application’s permissions are not 
properly configured, users of the application may be able to access 
more data or functions than they should.
 
 Faulty logic: If the biometric application’s design has any flaws, it could 
be possible to cause the application to malfunction, resulting in elevated 
permissions for an intruder or access to sensitive data.

 Chapter 10: Securing Biometrics Systems
Many applications are Web-based; that is, users access the application via 
the web browser on their laptops, desktop computers, or mobile devices. 
Web applications have a host of specific vulnerabilities:
 
 Injection vulnerabilities: These vulnerabilities permit a user to insert 
computer code into data being sent to the application server. This can 
trick the server into executing instructions that expose or corrupt data.
 
 Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities: This type of vulnerability 
results when an application accepts input data that is sent to a web 
browser without validating the data. Sometimes, as a result, a script 
executes on a user’s browser that hijacks user sessions (among other 
kinds of trouble).
 
 Parameter manipulation: Web applications often use hidden parameters 
transmitted to and from a user’s web browser. An application that does 
not examine the integrity of these variables may be manipulated to allow 
a malicious user to attack the application through this manipulation.
 
 Session-management vulnerabilities: Web applications establish unique 
sessions for its users; if the session data can be manipulated, this can 
result in a malicious user being able to hijack another user’s session.
 
 Cookie vulnerabilities: Cookies are used to store small pieces of data 
on end user systems, usually for session management or user identifica-
tion. If the data in a cookie is not well protected (say, encrypted), an 
attacker may be able to manipulate the cookie so it performs an authen-
tication bypass or steals other users’ sessions.
 
 Buffer-overflow vulnerabilities: Also known as a buffer overrun, this flaw 
exists when a program attempts to store more data than the size of a 
fixed-length buffer can handle. The overflowing data will corrupt other 
memory locations including code, causing program malfunction or even 
the execution of injected instructions.
 
 Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities: These vulnerabilities 
are present in applications that do not perform sufficient authorization 
checks. A malicious user could construct URLs on his Web site that 
could, if clicked, result in the victim’s browser performing an unauthor-
ized transaction.
 
 Malicious file execution: Here an application (or a flaw in an applica-
tion) permits a user to upload a file and have it executed on the server.
Biometric vulnerabilities
If all the preceding vulnerabilities weren’t enough, there are some actions 
that can be taken in an attempt to fool or confuse a biometric application. 
Some of these of vulnerabilities include

170
Part III: Implementing and Using Biometrics 
 
 Re-registration flaws: An intruder pretending to be a legitimate user 
may be able to fool a biometric system into re-registering the intruder 
instead of the real user. For instance, suppose intruder Trudy is pretend-
ing to be user Ursula. When the biometric system refuses to admit 
Trudy, she explains, “It’s not accepting my fingerprints anymore, I need 
to re-register them.” If the system (typically aided by an attendant such 
as a security guard) permits Trudy to re-register Ursula’s identity, then 
Trudy will have been able to use her own biometric to access Ursula’s 
account. This type of attack often involves social engineering or some 
other stolen credential such as a password.
 
 Matching flaws: A biometric system with an excessive False Acceptance 
Rate (FAR) may permit unauthorized persons to access business 
premises or assets.
 
 Replay vulnerability: If an intruder can access cabling that transmits 
biometric information, he may be able to intercept and later transmit 
valid biometric data in an attempt to access information or facilities.
 
The vulnerabilities we’re discussing in this section, if exploited, permit the 
attacker to break into whatever application the biometric system is protect-
ing. If your online banking is protected by biometrics and an attacker success-
fully breaks the biometric system, the attacker is able to log in to your online 
banking application and do everything that you yourself can do if you logged 
in legitimately.
Attacks on Biometric Systems
Organizations deploy biometric systems to protect assets of value. As long as 
those assets have value, intruders are going to want to steal, corrupt, or 
destroy those assets, and they’ll use any means at their disposal to do so. 
In the security profession, the techniques that an intruder might use are 
called attacks.
The purpose of an attack is to penetrate an organization, sidestep its 
controls, and (in turn) gain control of a desired asset. An attack might be 
direct or indirect, logical or physical, technology-based or human-based. 
Often attacks avoid using the same channels of access that legitimate users 
would use.
Attackers really have the upper hand when their attack strategies come up 
against our defenses. Here are some principles of attack and protection that 
make this point:

171
 Chapter 10: Securing Biometrics Systems
An attacker can . . . 
But we must . . . 
Attack the softest target.
Protect all targets.
Attack via the weakest path.
Protect all paths.
Exploit a chosen vulnerability.
Remove all vulnerabilities.
Attack at a time of his choosing.
Protect at all times.
Use a tool or technique of choice.
Protect against all tools and techniques.
Replay attacks
In a replay attack, an intruder has been able to record successful login ses-
sions involving biometric systems or devices — and later tries to perform an 
authentication on his own by replaying the captured data.
For instance, if a voice-recognition biometric system is used to authenticate 
a legitimate user, let’s say an intruder was able to intercept and record 
data that included the user’s voice. Later, the intruder may attempt to 
access the same system (or facility) and will play back the recorded data 
captured earlier.
In the case of voice recognition, the attacker could record the legitimate 
user’s voice over the air with a hidden microphone and later play it back 
through a speaker. Or the attacker could intercept a network transmission 
containing the user’s voice (or the representation of the user’s voice, in case 
it’s encoded before transmission), and then play it back later by inserting it 
into the network.
Faked credentials
Some biometric systems may be vulnerable to attacks using faked credentials. 
Examples of such attacks include these:
 
 Gummy fingerprints: Several research articles have been published 
since the year 2000 that demonstrate that a few dollars’ worth of ordi-
nary chemicals can be used to lift a valid user’s fingerprint and use it to 
manufacture a gelatin-based fingerprint that can even be placed over an 
attacker’s finger. Such an attack could be difficult to detect — the 
gummy finger would be warm, like a real finger — and the attacker could 
literally eat the gummy finger once he or she had successfully fooled the 
biometric system.

172
Part III: Implementing and Using Biometrics 
 
 Iris photographs: High-quality photographs of a legitimate user could be 
used in an attempt to fool a biometric system. If a biometric system 
can’t distinguish between a living iris and a high-quality photograph of 
same, then an intruder might penetrate a system or facility. In practice, 
this would require extraordinary resolution and reproduction as well as 
something to simulate the refraction of the outer layers of the eyeball, 
so it has never been done successfully.
 
 Fake hands: If an intruder can make a mold from a legitimate user’s 
hand, he or she could possibly build a fake hand out of rubber, plastic, 
or some other substance in an attempt to fool a system that scans hands 
or palms. Nearly all hand and palm scanners have proof of life built in, 
but a fingerprint-only scanner could be more easily fooled in this way.
 
 Facial photograph: If a biometric system relies on facial recognition (as 
some laptop computers do today), an imposter may be able to fool such 
a system by holding a life-size photograph of the user in front of the 
camera. Surprisingly, this method has been shown to work with some of 
the less sophisticated facial-imaging systems. But even good systems 
are sometimes fooled by twins.
 
 Recorded voice: If an intruder can make a high-quality recording of a 
legitimate user’s voice, he may be able to use it to successfully imitate 
the user by playing it back. This is possibly the easiest of these exam-
ples to attempt but also one of the easiest to protect against: Just have 
the user read a random phrase instead of the same thing each time.
Stolen credentials
Although grisly scenarios may not occur frequently, we’ve heard news 
stories of intruders who have actually stolen body parts from legitimate 
users to fool a biometric system.
In one case, as reported by the BBC, members of a gang in Malaysia chopped 
off a car owner’s finger to get past the fingerprint-security system for the 
owner’s Mercedes S-class automobile. And we have heard of a case where an 
intruder used a severed finger that was warmed by a flashlight.
Some biometric systems are more vulnerable to stolen credential attacks 
than others. Fingerprint readers are the most often exploited, followed by 
hand scanners. But the thought of a stolen eye is just gruesome to us — and 
unlikely to work, since most eye-based systems require proof of life (although 
criminals aren’t likely to know that). However, we think you’re pretty safe if 
your biometric system is voice-based — we have yet to hear of a stolen 
larynx being used to successfully fool a biometric system. And if your 
biometric system is gait-based, an intruder would have to steal your entire 
body — and then operate it exactly as you do! We think you’re pretty safe if 
you use gait biometrics.

173
 Chapter 10: Securing Biometrics Systems
Bypass attacks
Intruders use every trick in the book to try penetrating a system or facility if 
it contains assets of sufficient value. If a biometric system is strong enough to 
resist a direct attack, an intruder will attempt to go around the system alto-
gether — a bypass attack. Although this is technically not an attack on a bio-
metric system, it is an attack on the controls protecting an asset.
One classic example of a bypass attack that we’ve heard about is a high-
security facility that used biometric controls for entry. But the facility was 
located near a public road. An intruder could stop his car, walk to the rear of 
the building, and enter through a door that was frequently propped open so 
smokers could easily come and go during their smoking breaks.
Another bypass attack we’re familiar with happened when an intruder got 
into a control room for a certain electrical power station that was protected 
with a strong steel door. The door could only be opened using a palm-vein 
reader. But the control room was full of hot, humming electrical equipment — 
so a flimsy steel vent wide enough for human passage was installed in the 
bottom of the door. Mission Impossible it ain’t. But it worked.
Re-enrollment attacks
An intruder who is refused access to an asset by a biometric may be able to 
con an attendant, receptionist, or guard into re-enrolling the biometrics of a 
legitimate user — using the intruder’s biometrics. Such a ploy wouldn’t be 
too difficult to accomplish if the intruder had a fake ID and was a good actor 
or actress; often, the attacker is aided by information gathered from social-
networking sites that describe the person being imitated, and even explain 
when he or she is scheduled to be on vacation (talk about a ready-made time 
for an attack . . .). We have yet to hear of someone successfully trying this 
approach, aside from authorized penetration tests, but we mention it here so 
you’ll think out of the box (as we try to do) and consider all the possible 
ways past the controls and processes that protect a valuable asset.
System attacks
Someone hell-bent on accessing a protected asset may choose to attack a 
computer system that supports a biometric application. Several tools and 
methods can be used to attack a system:

174
Part III: Implementing and Using Biometrics 
 
 Port scan: In this case, an intruder has a program that sends data 
packets to a target system using every possible TCP/IP port number, 
in an attempt to discover the existence of a running service that could 
be exploited.
 
 Password guessing: In this attack, an intruder attempts to log in to the 
server over the network (or using an attached keyboard, if the attacker 
has physical access to the target system) — and tries commonly used 
passwords. If the intruder can log in, he or she may be able to try more 
attacks — such as application or database attacks.
 
 Buffer overflow: Here an intruder starts by communicating with a 
system tool or program, and attempts to cause a buffer-overflow error 
that could result in the intruder gaining control of the entire system.
 
 Denial of service: This is an attack where the intruder sends a huge 
volume of network traffic — or specially crafted messages — to the 
target system in an attempt to cause it to malfunction, rendering it 
unavailable for normal use.
Network attacks
An intruder may choose to attack a biometric system by attacking reachable 
network devices such as switches, hubs, routers, and firewalls. These net-
work devices are not too different from servers or workstations: They are 
hardware machines with an operating system and other software. In the case 
of a network device, the software is designed for the special purpose of pro-
cessing network traffic.
Some of the tools and types of attacks on network devices are as follows:
 
 Port scan: Here an intruder sends packets to a target network device, 
using every possible TCP/IP port number in an attempt to discover the 
existence of some feature in the device that could be exploited.
 
 Password guessing: An intruder tries to log in to the network device by 
guessing likely passwords. If successful, the attacker can control not 
only the device but also the network traffic flowing into and out of it.
 
 Buffer overflow: The intruder attempts to make the network device mal-
function by sending packets specially crafted to cause a buffer-overflow 
error, which could result in the intruder controlling the device.
 
 Network mirroring: The intruder diverts the traffic of a target network 
and can collect network traffic as it occurs, gathering information that 
could be used to further compromise systems on the network.
 
 Denial of service: Here the intruder sends a large volume of traffic, or 
specially crafted messages, to the network device in an attempt to cause 
it to malfunction.

175
 Chapter 10: Securing Biometrics Systems
A successful network attack may permit an intruder to get closer to the goal 
of accessing or controlling an asset. A successfully hacked network device 
may be a stepping stone to an attack on biometric data (a valuable resource 
for further exploits) or the assets that the biometric system is supposed 
to protect.
Application attacks
An intruder can choose to attack an application that is used to control or 
manage biometrics, or another application that may be related or near to the 
protected asset. Remember, if an attacker can successfully attack any appli-
cation in an environment, then he or she is one step closer to their ultimate 
target.
Techniques that an intruder can use to attack a system include:
 
 Password guessing: An intruder might guess user IDs and password 
combinations if he feels he might get lucky.
 
 Buffer overflow: The intruder could send specially crafted inputs to the 
application in an attempt to cause it to malfunction, including (possibly) 
the execution of injected code.
 
 Input validation: The attacker can attempt to confuse the application by 
sending it unreasonable information such as long strings of data or con-
trol characters. If the application doesn’t validate the input data, it could 
attempt to process the data anyway, resulting in a malfunction.
 
 Script injection: The attacker can inject script commands into input 
fields in an attempt to alter or steal data from the application’s 
database.
 
 Cross-site scripting: An attacker can attempt to implant malicious code 
in a Web page that executes on a victim’s browser with a wide variety of 
possible results — including session stealing and execution of malicious 
code on the victim’s computer.
 
 Cross-site request forgery: An attacker can place a link on his own Web 
site that causes the victim’s browser to access a different Web site 
(where the victim has already been authenticated, or so the attacker 
hopes)— and, once there, to perform some action on behalf of the 
attacker. For instance, suppose attacker Alfred creates a URL on his Web 
site:
<img src=http://www.victimbank.com/transferfunds?account=Alfred&amount
=10000>
 
 If victim Mary clicks this image, and if Mary was already authenticated 
into www.victimbank.com, then VictimBank.com would transfer ten 
thousand dollars to Alfred’s account.

176
Part III: Implementing and Using Biometrics 
Social engineering
Clever and resourceful intruders know that the easiest way to reach a target 
is by the path of least resistance. If an intruder is unable to successfully 
penetrate the technical defenses of a system or facility, he may instead rely 
on some unwitting employee to help the intruder gain access. Some examples 
of social engineering include:
 
 Tailgating: If an intruder is unable to enter a facility on his own, he can 
pretend to be an employee who has lost his key card (or index finger or 
eye) and follow an employee through a secured door. It’s especially 
effective if the intruder is carrying some heavy object (say, a computer 
monitor or box of books); an employee is more apt to help the intruder 
into the building.
 
 Remote access: A clever intruder can make a series of phone calls to 
various people inside an organization to get all the pieces necessary to 
log in successfully to the corporate network. He can get the VPN URL 
from one employee, a username from another, and get a password 
reset from the helpdesk if they don’t sufficiently validate the identity 
of the “user.”
 
 Loading dock entry: Many reasonably secure facilities have a blind-spot 
when it comes to the loading dock. A good social engineer in a brown 
shirt and pants can often just walk in the back door with nothing but 
a clipboard.
 
 Road apple: The attacker leaves a removable medium lying around 
somewhere, in hopes it will get picked up — say, near the door to the 
lobby. A curious employee picks up the gizmo, takes it inside, and plugs 
it in — big mistake — whereupon it autoexecutes a Trojan or virus, 
granting the attacker access. This is especially effective if the medium is 
of some practical value — say, a USB stick or an SD card.
 
 Dumpster diving: Intruders can go through an organization’s trash in 
the hopes of finding discarded printouts, memos, and documents that 
contain enough information that they can con their way into a system 
or facility.
Protecting Biometric Infrastructure
Biometric infrastructure typically consists of biometric readers, systems 
(servers, user workstations, or both), networks, and software. You have to 
take steps to protect all these components, one by each, using techniques 
discussed in this section.

177
 Chapter 10: Securing Biometrics Systems
 
This section will give you a head start, but you shouldn’t consider this chapter 
an exhaustive treatise on protecting information systems. Instead, call it a 
starting point. You’ll want to consult other texts for complete information on 
protecting servers and networks that use biometrics. We’ve included a list of 
books and other sources of the needed information at the end of this chapter.
Security-protection concepts
Information-security professionals tend to conceptualize or abstract the 
means used to protect information and information assets. It can be hard 
enough to understand the abstract nature of information systems (biomet-
rics included); understanding how to protect them can, at times, be even 
more difficult.
Basic defenses
At the most basic level, biometric systems need to be protected in three ways: 
through confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Security professionals use 
the term CIA to denote these terms. Here’s a closer look at these concepts:
 
 Confidentiality: Information must be protected from viewing by unau-
thorized parties and systems. Although in many cases the biometric 
system is serving as part of the means to protect information in the 
organization, the biometric-related information itself must be protected 
from onlookers.
 
 Integrity: The integrity of biometric-related devices, systems, and 
information must be maintained. All the components in a biometric 
system must be protected from unauthorized tampering. This includes 
the biometric devices themselves, as well as the systems and software 
that make it all work. Any unauthorized modifications to a biometric 
system may render it ineffective.
 
 Availability: The biometric system must be available for use at all 
times. If some condition or event makes the biometric system 
unavailable, then the assets that the biometric system protects may 
themselves be un-available when they’re needed — which could disrupt 
business operations.
Next we need to talk about controls, which are the mechanisms that protect 
systems and information. There are four basic types of controls:
 
 Detective controls: These are controls that — you guessed it — detect 
an activity or event. Examples of detective controls are audit logs, event 
logs, and video surveillance systems.

178
Part III: Implementing and Using Biometrics 
 
 Preventive controls: These are controls that prevent an activity or event 
from occurring. A preventive control may include a means of identifying 
a subject, thus preventing unauthorized access. Examples of preventive 
controls include key-card entrance controls, data encryption, user ID or 
password login, smart-card login, and — oh, yes — biometrics.
 
 Deterrent controls: A deterrent control is one that is intended to dis-
courage a subject from attempting some unwanted or unauthorized 
activity. Examples of deterrent controls include No Trespassing signs, 
video surveillance cameras and monitors in prominent view, and that 
really sharp-looking razor wire along the top of chain-link fencing.
 
 Administrative controls: These controls are the policies and procedures 
that define acceptable behavior from the organization’s people — and 
the required characteristics of information systems. Examples include 
security policies, requirements, standards, and procedures.
Security purists will argue (correctly) that there are other types of controls 
as well. This isn’t an exhaustive book about IT controls or internal audit, so 
it’s not necessary for us to delve into these other types of controls other than 
to name them:
 
 Mitigating controls
 
 Automatic controls
 
 Manual controls
 
 Compensating controls
No matter what the type, however, sometimes controls fail. So here’s a look 
at two control-failure modes. As you might guess, controls are really just 
abstract terms that denote the actual mechanisms that protect information 
and assets in some way. Sometimes these mechanisms can fail; when they do, 
they fail in one of two ways:
 
 Fail open: When a control fails open, this means that all events (autho-
rized as well as unauthorized) are permitted. An example of a fail-open 
situation is the failure of a key card or biometric-controlled door buzzer, 
resulting in a door that opens with no more than a push. A fail-open situ-
ation puts protected assets at risk because they can be accessed by 
any party.
 
 Fail closed: In a fail-closed situation, all events are blocked, including 
those that should be allowed. An example of a fail-closed situation is a 
failure of a key card or biometric reader that prevents everyone from 
going through a protected doorway. A fail-closed situation disrupts busi-
ness operations by preventing subjects from being able to access busi-
ness assets or information needed to complete tasks.
Both fail-open and fail-closed situations are problematic; they put assets at 
risk and disrupt business operations. We can’t say that all cases of fail-open 

179
 Chapter 10: Securing Biometrics Systems
are bad and that all cases of fail-closed are good — it really depends upon the 
specific control, what asset is protected by it, and what other controls still 
protect the asset.
Defense in depth
In the preceding subsection, we hint at the existence of more than one con-
trol protecting an asset. This concept is called defense in depth. This concept 
specifies that two or more controls, ideally of different types, work in combi-
nation to protect assets. Each control provides some type of protection by 
itself, and together they offer greater protection. Figure 10-1 shows a typical 
defense in depth. Examples of defense in depth, old and new, include these:
 
 Castle: The ancients understood defense in depth and got it right. A lot 
of treasure (or a beautiful princess) may be hidden in the innermost 
chambers of a castle that is protected by a moat, a moat monster (or 
possibly just a deterrent control in the form of a “Beware of moat mon-
ster” sign), a drawbridge, turrets for archers, high walls that are difficult 
to climb, inner courtyards with more gates, turrets, hostile terrain, and 
so forth.
 
 E-commerce data: An online merchant protects its valuable transaction 
data with firewalls, routers with ACLs, intrusion-detection systems,
system-level access controls, database-level access controls, acceptable 
use policies, audit logging, and encryption. Notice that some of these 
controls are preventive; others are detective, deterrent, and administrative.

Part III: Implementing and Using Biometrics 
Protecting biometric devices
Biometric devices are the gadgets that perform the scanning or viewing in 
a biometric system. Recalling the concepts of CIA earlier in this chapter 
(confidentiality, integrity, and availability), we need to protect biometric 
devices by preventing the following antisocial activities:
 
 Theft: We want to keep someone from stealing the device, and for 
several reasons:
 
• When stolen, the control will fail open or closed, disrupting 
business and threatening assets.
 
• The thief may use the stolen device in an attempt to determine 
how others can be defeated.
 
• He may steal the device, alter it, and attempt to replace it.
 
• He may be short on cash and will try to sell it.
 
 Sabotage: We want to prevent someone from damaging a biometric 
device, which could prevent others from being able to use it.
 
 Alteration: We must be able to prevent someone from altering the 
device, which could lead to a fail-open situation that could leave assets 
unprotected; or to a fail-closed situation where no one can access 
business assets.
Protecting communications
Communications are present in most biometric systems, typically between 
biometric devices and servers. The nature of such communications should 
be considered confidential, and the security of the organization could be 
compromised if an intruder was able to eavesdrop on communications taking 
place in a biometrics system.
Several means are available for protecting biometric communications 
including:
 
 Authentication: A biometric system may authenticate the biometric 
traffic itself, as a way of distinguishing between authorized devices and 
imposters. Authentication might use MAC (hardware) addresses, 
encrypted handshakes (the electronic variety — hand-jive just doesn’t 
do the job), or some other means.
 
 Encryption: Perhaps you can encrypt the entire communications 
channel between biometric devices and servers; if you can, then you 

181
 Chapter 10: Securing Biometrics Systems
may be able to prevent someone from being able to eavesdrop on your 
biometric system traffic and use it to launch a replay attack or a man-in-
the-middle attack. If biometric communications are protected with 
encryption, then access to encryption keys must be restricted.
 
 Cable protection: You need to make sure that all cabling to biometric 
devices is protected from damage, sabotage, or alteration. This may 
mean running cables through conduits or raceways that are away from 
possible intrusions.
Protecting servers
Servers that contain biometric data or perform functions that support biomet-
ric systems must be protected from unauthorized access and manipulation. 
Such access could be harmful, could lead to the compromise of biometric 
data, or could allow unauthorized accesses to biometric-protected assets.
 
 Security patches: All available security patches should be installed on 
servers containing critical data (or that connect to critical data or func-
tions). Failing to install security patches could result in unauthorized 
access when a hacker exploits known vulnerabilities.
 
 Network access: Only authorized, network-based accesses should be 
allowed. All unnecessary points of network-based access should be 
disabled, removed, or fitted with access controls. Putting network ports 
in the lobby (no! no! what where they thinking?) is a typical violation of 
this control.
 
 Login credentials: Valid login access to servers must be kept to the 
smallest number required for normal operations. Many intrusions into 
servers happen through guessed or cracked passwords for legitimate 
user accounts.
 
 Hardening: Servers should be “hardened” to protect them from unau-
thorized access, tampering, and attacks. Hardening servers includes 
removing unnecessary services and functions, enforcing strong login 
credentials, and using the strongest possible security configurations.
 
You have to provide adequate protection for all the servers in an enterprise 
environment — not just those containing sensitive business information or 
biometric data, but all of them. An intruder can easily find a weak server in an 
environment and use it as a stepping stone to a successful attack — even on a 
hardened server — if given the chance. Thinking back to the castle example 
earlier, it’s like having a moat and drawbridge in the front, but a broad path to 
a flimsy door in the back.

182
Part III: Implementing and Using Biometrics 
Protecting biometric applications
The tools and applications that are used to manage biometric data and func-
tions need to be protected, to prevent unauthorized access to biometric 
data. A compromise of any biometric application could lead to the compro-
mise of biometric data as well as access to any and all assets protected by 
biometric controls. Several measures need to be taken to protect biometric 
applications, including the following:
 
 Secure configuration: The biometric application must be configured so 
it’s secure. Unnecessary access methods and features should be dis-
abled or removed.
 
 Strong credentials: The login credentials required to access the biomet-
ric management application must be strong enough to repel attacks that 
try to guess user IDs and passwords. Every user must have unique login 
credentials — none should be shared.
 
 Proper installation and maintenance: Biometric application software 
must be properly installed and maintained so it’s free of vulnerabilities 
that could be exploited by an intruder.
 
 Adequate role-based access controls: The roles assigned to individuals 
who manage biometric access controls must be established, allowing 
only the minimum accesses required by each individual to perform 
stated job duties and to maintain the segregation of duties.
Protecting biometric data
Biometric data in an access-management system may be a target of attack if 
an attacker believes that data is usable to gain unauthorized access to pro-
tected assets (whether through a replay attack or some other means). For 
this reason, biometric data itself must be protected from unauthorized 
access and disclosure.
 
 Access controls: Biometric data must be protected so that only autho-
rized applications, as well as authorized persons, may access it.
 
 Audit logging: Logging must be set up at the application, database, and 
system levels.
 
 Be sure to log all accesses and changes to biometric data.
 
 Databases: In many cases, database-management systems (DBMSs) are 
used to manage access to biometric data. Controls at the DBMS level are 
needed to prevent unauthorized access, and to log all accesses and 
changes. Database-management systems must be hardened, no less than 
servers, with measures that include security patches, secure configura-
tions, and strong access controls.

 Chapter 10: Securing Biometrics Systems
 
 Backup media: Biometric data has to be frequently backed up to other 
storage systems or media, in the event that data in primary storage is 
lost or damaged. The three primary reasons to back up data are
 
• Hardware failure: In the event a disk drive, controller, or server 
fails, data can be corrupted or unreachable.
 
• Software failure: Although rare, a software bug can corrupt data or 
make improper changes to it.
 
• Disaster: Should a fire, flood, earthquake, or other event occur, 
computer and storage systems may be damaged beyond repair.
Finding Sources of Security Information
There is no longer a need to start from scratch when you’re looking to pro-
tect your systems and data. There are several excellent sources that provide 
strong guidelines, including these:
 
 ISO 17799 and ISO 27001: These are the international standards for 
information security management. These standards define practices for 
security governance, management, processes, and controls. One dis-
advantage of these standards is that they are not free: The documents 
containing the standards can only be purchased, and they are moder-
ately expensive (a few hundred U.S. dollars each). You can purchase 
these from www.iso.org.
 
 NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology): The NIST 
Special Publications 800 series are a series of very useful publications 
sponsored by the U.S. federal government in the area of information 
security and standards. Some standards (such as 800-76) are specific 
to biometrics; others (such as 800-53) are exhaustive lists of specific 
security controls that government offices are audited to check. The NIST 
Web site is a big place, but the 800 series can be found at csrc.nist.
gov/publications/PubsSPs.html.
 
 PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard): This stan-
dard describes in detail the controls required to protect credit card 
data. Although PCI DSS is credit-card-centric, if you protect biometric 
authentication data in the same way PCI DSS would require for credit-
card data, you’ll have done much of what is needed to protect it well. 
Information is available from www.pcisecuritystandards.org.
 
 CERT: The Computer Emergency Response Team at Carnegie Mellon 
University has a wealth of information for security management, inci-
dent management, and system hardening. CERT is located at www.
cert.org.

Part III: Implementing and Using Biometrics 
 
 SANS Institute: This organization has information on incident response, 
server hardening, application hardening, and training. SANS is located at 
www.sans.org.
 
 Books: There are several good titles available that will help you to better 
understand how to protect biometric data and biometric information 
systems, including these:

The Future of Biometrics
In This Chapter

 Investigating what the future holds

his chapter discusses what we expect to see down the road in biometrics 
— and some of the implications of these new technologies for authenti-
cation. Neither of the authors have a working crystal ball, but both make a 
living anticipating technological change and positioning companies to meet 
those challenges, so we might actually get some of it right — but we will 
almost certainly be wrong in some cases. Read this chapter with that in mind, 
and you’re less likely to be disappointed when laser holographic nose-hair 
analysis doesn’t make it to the mainstream.
Improvements in Technologies
In its first few versions, almost any technology has rough edges, wears out 
too quickly, and generally isn’t as good as it will be in a few years — after 
folks have had a chance to complain about its deficiencies and engineers 
have had a chance to laugh at the horrible mistakes of their predecessors. 
Biometrics systems are still relatively new as a widely used, technology-
based authentication tool, and have really caught on only in the last 15 years 
or so. There are many ways we can expect them to improve over time.
In this section, we take a look at biometric technologies discussed in Part II of 
this book — and make some educated guesses about where those technolo-
gies go next.
Fingerprint and palm scan
Since fingerprint-based biometrics are one of the most mature and widely-
used of the biometric technologies, it might seem likely that we would see 
the least innovation in this area, but that’s only if you ignore the fact that 
fingerprints are so darn useful they just can’t be ignored. Fingerprints are so 

186
Part III: Implementing and Using Biometrics 
well understood as a biometric technology that new innovations in finger-
print capture and recognition are still valuable to the innovator.
Getting fingerprints
As of now, most fingerprint capture for biometrics is a very deliberate 
process where the user places their finger or fingers or palm into the capture 
device or runs them across the capture device and an image is taken. New 
advances in photographic technology with higher resolutions than were 
previously available might enable fingerprint capture at a distance, so that 
literally waving your hand at the pickup or briefly adopting the universal “I 
surrender” pose for a moment will be enough to authenticate the user. On 
the flip side, combined with the knowledge that it’s quite possible to create 
a working fake finger with a print from a print-image, we might have to start 
wearing gloves in public to prevent someone from getting our prints with a 
high-resolution camera and a telephoto lens.
At the opposite end of the scale for acquiring fingerprints is the idea that to 
use a computer, you typically have to touch both the keyboard and mouse. 
Innovations in scanning technology may allow systems to constantly monitor 
the fingerprints of the person actually using a computer or use it as s second 
factor in authenticating a user as they type in a password. For this purpose, it 
wouldn’t even be necessary to scan all the keys in a keyboard, maybe just the 
vowels. Th ntrdr wld hv t tp lk ths t kp frm bng dtctd.
Our best guess for acquiring prints is that new technology — some gizmo 
that captures not only prints but also proof that the print is attached to a 
living human being — will dominate innovations in fingerprint technology. 
Prints are too easy to acquire via simple means (such as lifting them off 
drinking glasses and ATM touch-screens) to really trust them by themselves 
for secure authentication.
I don’t know art, but I know what I like
Humans have been developing insanely 
sophisticated biometrics processors for 
centuries, but we keep them in our brains. 
Since the ability to recognize faces and facial 
expressions is important to us, we devote a fair 
amount of brain power to performing this task, 
and a four-year-old can do it better than any 
computer system on the planet. If you doubt this, 
take a look at the level of artistic skill required 
to render an animal (say a skunk) face versus 
a human face. If you get the colors and basic 
shape of the skunk right, it will look okay to most 
eyes (but not to another skunk). Only a skillful 
artist can produce a good-looking rendering of 
a human face, because we humans are really 
good at processing the detailed biometric 
information in faces and expressions.

187
 Chapter 11: The Future of Biometrics
Comparing prints
In the before-time (25 years ago), when computers didn’t have fancy graphical 
user interfaces, the idea of analyzing a high-resolution fingerprint, identifying 
the minutiae, and then comparing it to a new print in real time for verifica-
tion was impossible. Here we are 25 years later and not only do computers all 
have graphical user interfaces, some of the graphics and animation are just 
for fun, because we have way more computing power than we really know 
what to do with.
Since we have all that computing power available, why do we have to break 
each fingerprint down to minutiae and use those limited points of compari-
son? Instead, it should be possible to use all the geometry in each fingerprint 
and gain significantly more confidence in the comparison. In fact, a suffi-
ciently detailed image comparison, using all the available visual information 
of a fingerprint, would probably be able to detect and reject most of the 
simple ways of duplicating a print and finger. The extra processing power will 
also come in handy as any of the more ad-hoc methods of acquiring prints 
become popular, since the system might then need to rotate the acquired 
image and generally manipulate it until it matches the reference print best.
Hand veins and ultrasonic holography
Hand veins have so many advantages as a biometric tool that it’s guaranteed 
to be a place where technologists spend time improving the acquisition and 
analysis techniques. Because proof of life is inherent to the technique, hand 
vein biometrics is already in widespread use in medium- to high-security 
installations with significant investment in this technology. Since the only 
way a manufacturer can get you to buy the same item twice is to make the 
new version irresistibly better in some way, we can expect to see lots of work 
put into improving this technology so we can replace last year’s model.
Getting the image
Hand veins are really a subset of a larger group of hand biometrics that 
includes looking inside your hand rather than just at the surface. These 
methods currently use either ultraviolet light in the case of hand veins or 
ultrasonic sound for ultrasonic holography.
As it turns out, medical science is always looking for a good new way to 
look inside our bodies to get high-resolution images of three dimensional 
structures. The techniques that don’t use ionizing radiation like X-rays, such 
as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are good candidates for looking inside 
us for biometric purposes. (Not to be confused with certain aquatic mammals 
that recognize people by looking inside our skins with natural sonar. Those 
would be biometric porpoises.)

188
Part III: Implementing and Using Biometrics 
It’s true the MRI technology is currently pretty expensive to use for just doing 
a biometric scan, but we are constantly developing new ways to look inside 
the human body. It may be hard to imagine something that costs a million 
dollars becoming cheap enough for this purpose. Not that long ago, however, 
a simple laser was confined to laboratories and research institutions. Today 
you can buy one at the pet store for playing with your cat.
Clearly, looking at veins, arteries, bones, and muscles in high-definition color-
enhanced detail will tell us everything we ever wanted to know about the 
unique aspects of our hands, fingers, and wrists, producing a few gigabytes of 
data about those appendages in a couple of seconds.
Using all that extra information
When someone walks up to you and asks for a couple of dollars to go place a 
bet on double zero, you check to see if it’s really your brother-in-law before 
you hand over the money. In addition to making sure it’s his smiling face, 
you quickly do a few more tests to see if giving him the money is such a good 
idea. Depends on the bother-in-law, but you might also take a whiff to see if 
he’s been drinking, check his pupil dilation to see how much he’s been drink-
ing, and look at his wrist to see if he’s hocked his watch already.
When we have as much information as we could expect to get with an MRI 
of the inside of your hand, we can do a lot more than just check to see if it’s 
your hand, and some of that is probably even relevant to authentication, 
authorization, and access controls. For example, we can see from dilation of 
your veins and pulse rate that you might be under some amount of stress. Do 
we really want to grant access to the nuclear reactor? Maybe in that case we 
require additional personnel to accompany you.
Conversely, maybe your heart rate is low, but your blood oxygen levels are 
also low. Should we allow you to initiate the start sequence for the 787 you’re 
about to fly to Germany, or maybe call an ambulance?
The only thing we can be completely sure of is that when additional informa-
tion is available, we will find a way to use it in a biometric AAA capacity as we 
discuss in Chapter 2.
Signature
Biometric signature recognition is a tricky subject with respect to future 
developments, since it’s really a technological way of recognizing an archaic 
form of authentication. If the next generation tends to sign their name less 
and less, will that eventually invalidate the basis for the biometric measure-
ment of signatures? If you sign your name only a few times per year, will it 
still have a repeatable unique characteristic that will be useful biometrically?

189
 Chapter 11: The Future of Biometrics
Signing your name
Today, about all biometric signature systems record is the actual image of 
the signature, some information about how you moved the pen or stylus to 
create it, and the pressure you placed on the signature pad as the signature 
was created. Although that may seem about all there is to know about signing 
your name, there are certainly a few more unique data points that could be 
collected to better validate the signature.
The pressure that your fingers put on the stylus itself, not just on the writing 
surface is likely to be unique to your writing, especially when combined with 
and compared to what part of which letter you were shaping at the time. It’s 
similar to stylus-pressure dynamics (the pressure of the stylus on the pad), 
only related to squeeze pressure on the stylus itself.
Also, it’s certainly possible to measure the speed of movement, orientation, 
and direction of the stylus not just while in contact with the writing pad, 
but continuously, using accelerometers in the stylus itself. Once again, it’s 
likely that for a motion that we repeat as often as signing our name, all these 
motions are unique to the individual in context with all the other information 
being collected at the same time.
Signing off
The writing on the wall suggests that we are stuck with using signatures for 
quite a while, even though other biometrics are far more personal, hard to 
duplicate, and accurate. That said, the problems inherent to good signature 
biometrics and relatively complex analysis required to produce good results 
mean that not many folks will be doing a lot of work in this area in the future. 
Personally, Mike signs checks when there is no alternative (maybe 2 percent 
of the time), contracts because there is no accepted alternative, and home 
loan documents because that industry seems to still be living in 1965. We can 
imagine that the generation of iPods and cell phones will look at signatures 
the way we look at wax seals and signet rings.
Maximum acceleration
Accelerometers are finding their way into all 
kinds of electronics these days. Since they are 
able to detect both acceleration due to motion 
and acceleration due to gravity, you can put 
one in a cell phone so the phone knows quite 
literally which way is up, and adjusts its display 
accordingly. We’ve had them in cars for quite 
a while now to tell the car when to deploy air 
bags. The accelerometers that IBM started 
putting into laptops a while back were designed 
to detect a peculiar condition — a complete 
lack of acceleration, which can only happen 
when the laptop is in free-fall.

190
Part III: Implementing and Using Biometrics 
Retina scan
Retinal imaging is an interesting technology for future speculation because it 
already meets almost any standards for accuracy we might require. The near 
zero FAR and industry best FRR don’t leave a lot of room for improvement 
there. Nevertheless, there are some distinct disadvantages to retinal scan-
ning that we can consider for improvement.
Scanning distance
To some degree, the distance your eyeball can be from a retinal scanner is 
dependent on how much detail we need, and therefore how high the resolu-
tion of the scanning system is. To understand what this is about, imagine a 
fence with a knothole in it, which represents your pupil. On the other side of 
the fence is a mural that you’re asked to describe in as much detail as you 
can. Okay, now that we have the setup, describe the mural as you can see it 
from 10 feet away from the knothole and fence, and then describe what you 
see with your eye pressed up against the hole. Basic physical laws dictate 
how much detail we can see through a small hole at specific distances and 
the closer we are, the more we can see.
To take the analogy a bit further, now imagine that instead of using your 
naked eye, you do the same experiment with a telescope. The telescope has 
more light gathering capability than your eye and a wider aperture, so it’s 
able to see more detail of the small piece of mural from 10 feet through the 
knothole than before. Back in reality, we know that one of the reasons that 
retinal scanning is so accurate is the fantastic complexity of the capillaries 
in the human retina, and so maybe a really high-resolution scan from further 
away will eventually be possible and still yield highly accurate results. It 
would certainly be nice to authenticate by just reading a sign placed strategi-
cally in front of the scanner but at a normal reading distance from your eye, 
instead of the normal three inches or so used today.
Another reason we expect to see work done on increasing the distance speed 
and intrusiveness of today’s retinal scanning systems is that, along with facial 
recognition, iris scanning, and a few other technologies, medium distance 
high-speed retinal scanning could be used to scan in public spaces to help 
identify fugitives or other persons of interest to law enforcement. Obviously, 
there are legal and privacy concerns regarding using an ID system in this 
way, but facial recognition is already in heavy use in similar situations, so we 
expect that a more accurate method would be popular.
Health benefits
Not very many things can alter the structure or appearance of the retinal 
capillary system, and nearly all of them are related to disease. There are 
obvious eye-related problems such as glaucoma and cataracts, but also 

191
 Chapter 11: The Future of Biometrics
malaria, leukemia, and lymphoma have an effect on the eyes that can be 
seen in changes to the retina. It’s possible that the system that allows you 
access to work every morning might also alert you to minute changes in your 
retina that could signal the onset of disease. We talk about ethical and pri-
vacy issues in more detail in Chapter 3, but consider the implications of this 
idea for a moment. Do you want your employer to know that you might have 
contracted a disease, possibly even before your doctor knows? Could the 
changes in your retina be considered Electronic Patient Health Information 
(a legal term defined by the U.S. HIPAA medical privacy law) and therefore 
subject to special protection? Would you rather that the system just ignored 
the changes and left you blissfully unaware? Given that the medically signifi-
cant changes mean that you will start failing your authentication attempts, is 
there really any choice in the matter?
Iris scan
Due to the involvement of John Daugman’s patents, and the fact that all cur-
rent implementations of iris scanning currently use the Daugman algorithms, 
advances in iris recognition are largely dependent on the continuing work 
of Dr. Daugman and his team at Cambridge (noted in Chapter 13) and their 
commercial partners at LG — but not entirely so. The National Institute 
of Standards and Technology (NIST) conducted a large scale open evalua-
tions of iris recognition software in 2006, the Iris Challenge Evaluation (ICE). 
Others are actively developing new algorithms that may yield non-infringing 
patents and begin to diversify the field a bit more.
One could even argue that there’s not much future work required in iris iden-
tification, since it boasts the lowest FAR and FRR of all the generally available 
technologies, but accuracy isn’t everything. There are areas that the industry 
is clearly interested in and will show progress in the coming years, no matter 
who is working on them. Also, as with retina scans, iris scans are subject to 
minute changes over time that the biometric system will have to incorporate 
into its methodology.
Scanning distance
Unlike retinal scanning, which has obstacles of geometry that make distance 
scanning very difficult, irises are visible from a distance. Current work at a 
distance of as much as 10 feet shows great promise. At greater distances, 
it can be harder to acquire exactly the right angle needed for imaging the 
essentially flat surface of an iris, but we can expect to see a lot of effort put 
into achieving iris scanning at great distances to make the scanning less 
intrusive, and to scan without the subject’s knowledge. Examples of using 
photographs taken without the idea of iris recognition later being used for 
that purpose show (as with Sharbat Gula, detailed in Chapter 13) that good 
high-resolution photography will drive iris recognition more than processing 

192
Part III: Implementing and Using Biometrics 
for the foreseeable future. But again, there is a chance that legal issues may 
result in case law stating that high-resolution photographs of a person’s face 
constitute an invasion of privacy. Currently however, images taken in public 
places are fair game.
Processing iris information
It’s hard to use the word perfect with respect to a man-made process, but the 
Daugman algorithms appear to be close enough that lots of trying isn’t going 
to buy much in terms of efficacy. Studies done on very large installations 
involving hundreds of thousands of individuals all in the same database indi-
cate that current systems are as accurate as we need. New work on speed, 
accuracy in poor conditions, and oblique capture angles will certainly all be 
interesting and fruitful. Much of the work done on processing iris information 
will be focused on finding sufficiently innovative ideas that the Daugman and 
LG patents do not come into play.
Proof of life
One current knock against iris scanning is that it can be relatively easy to 
fool, using an image of the required iris. Since nothing inherent to the iris 
image or capture technology (digital photography) can show that the image 
presented is a real eyeball, or that a living brain is attached to it, there is a lot 
of future work that will use related information to establish this information 
including the following:
 
 Pupil dilation based on changing lighting
 
 Stereoscopy to get a view of the clear optical parts of the eye in relation 
to the iris
 
 Command- or signal-based blinking to see that an eyelid is attached 
and working
Made you look
With all ocular imaging systems, one challenge 
is to position the eyeball in exactly the same 
way as the last time you imaged it. As it turns 
out, that isn’t as hard as it sounds. We have 
very accurate positioning systems in the 
muscles around our eyes that allow us to move 
the eye to focus on specific objects or images. 
If we can get you to focus on an object or image 
that never moves with respect to the capture 
camera, your eye will be positioned in exactly 
the same way with respect to the camera each 
time. For the folks that are identifying irises at 
a distance without our knowledge, that means 
they need to come up with something you will 
look at on your way by while they photograph 
your eye. Intelligence services will be hiring 
advertising agencies to consult in this area if 
they want to succeed.

193
 Chapter 11: The Future of Biometrics
Facial image
Recognizing facial images holds a special place in biometrics because we are 
all so good at it as humans, and thus far it’s fallen so far short of its appar-
ent promise. It’s one of many areas of natural expertise gained over time; the 
human brain is just a lot better at it than computers are. We’veonly recently 
been able to create supercomputers with comparable abilities (such as the 
chess-playing Deep Blue in the late ’90s).
Unlike most of the other image-based biometric technologies that focus on 
as much detail as possible over a fairly small surface, facial images are large 
areas, and traditional approaches actually toss away much of the detail in 
search of larger characteristics that remain unique. In the case of facial 
geometry-based algorithms, only the placement of features is examined. 
Combined with the fact that we rarely fully obscure our faces, and facial rec-
ognition becomes a prime candidate for biometrics at a distance.
There have already been many interesting tests of mass use of facial 
recognition biometrics with decidedly mixed results. Looking at the past 
as a map to the future, we can expect more testing and implementation of 
facial recognition technology and better results as the technology gets better 
at extrapolating facial characteristics from images at the wrong angle and 
as with most of biometrics, using additional detail provided by ever higher 
resolution images to provide better accuracy.
Facial image recognition is one area where we will see significant advances 
in how we process the information that do not depend on significant strides 
in image quality. The reason for this is not that we won’t see the image qual-
ity gains, it’s that there are a number of applications of facial imaging that 
use existing camera infrastructure, such as ATM cameras and security video 
cameras that will not be replaced quickly. These cameras were specified and 
installed without computer-based biometrics in mind and replacement will 
come at considerable cost, so we can expect to see older less capable cam-
eras providing images for use in facial biometrics for a long time.
Since we know we can’t force the replacement of every bank and parking lot 
security camera every time we add a million pixels to the current high-end 
capture camera, there will continue to be significant work to improve how we 
process poor quality images.
Facial thermograph
Thermographic cameras are expensive, compared to most other image 
capturing technology, and unlike visible light cameras, the cost is not being 
driven down by a large consumer market. Facial thermography does have 
interesting advantages over other biometrics that will likely promote addi-
tional research including low-cost infrared cameras with better resolution.

194
Part III: Implementing and Using Biometrics 
How are you?
If you’ve ever worked in an environment with live guards at the doors or in 
the lobby, you may have come to know the guards and the guards know you. 
Possibly the first thing anyone says to you at work each day in such an envi-
ronment is “Hi Jane, how are you doing?” A good guard will pay attention to 
your answer, and probably detect your general state of well-being, no matter 
what you actually say. Here again, this is something we humans practice 
starting in the first months of our lives, and get pretty good at after decades 
of practice. Facial thermography has the potential to perform many of the 
same kinds of emotional and physical evaluations as a human guard would in 
these situations, because many conditions of agitation, sobriety, and general 
unease change the blood flow to our face in ways that could potentially be 
used to tell the system more than just if you are who you say you are.
Peek-a-boo
Likely the most significant advances we will see using thermographic facial 
recognition will be centered on identification in challenging conditions where 
subjects are actively avoiding detection and identification. Since thermog-
raphy does not use visible light — it uses the infrared your face emits as 
its light source — it can detect thermal patterns through fake moustaches, 
heavy makeup, scarves, and other disguises, and in total darkness.
Ear recognition
So far, ear recognition has resembled facial recognition in both the method of 
capture and analysis, but is superior to facial in accuracy due to the ear’s 
CSI For Dummies
If you’ve watched any crime dramas on 
television in the last 10 years, you have watched 
as attractive young forensic experts take a 
320-x-400 image from an ATM, and then blow 
up the reflected image in the car bumper from 
across the street to then have a recognizable 
picture of a car license plate at an oblique angle 
to the bumper and hidden from the direct view 
of the camera. We’re here to tell you that most 
of what you see isn’t just really hard or super 
advanced — it’s impossible. The information 
captured by the camera, which is limited to 
the camera’s resolution and the light gathering 
capabilities of the lens, is all the information you 
have to work with. When you process images 
to sharpen edges or otherwise enhance them, 
you’re essentially adding information to make 
the image clearer, and the information you’re 
adding is at best a good guess. Blowing up a 
small part of a low quality photo presents exactly 
the same number of pixels, it just makes them 
larger. We’re not saying that it’s impossible to 
get interesting information out of photos using 
image processing, just that you’re stuck with 
what the camera actually got.

195
 Chapter 11: The Future of Biometrics
stability in form over time and larger amount of unique detail. This stability 
and remote recognition capability make ear recognition a better candidate 
than its cousin facial as a nonintrusive and remote biometric identification.
The fact that our ears don’t change shape over time means that we can 
consider image-analysis techniques that won’t work well for things like faces 
that change with each expression. So, although the capture of ear images 
will likely follow the new technology for facial images very closely, the way 
that we analyze ear images will diverge from facial over time. Very esoteric 
techniques that use the initial image of the ear to produce Gaussian force 
field representations and other methods that treat the data as an abstract to 
provide results that are less affected by lighting and background variances 
are being explored with some success.
From a practical viewpoint, the ear provides such a better-behaved biometric 
than faces that we will eventually leave behind our species bias towards faces 
as an identification and see much more use of ears in situations where both 
methods are possible. A downside of ear recognition biometrics is that many 
ears are hidden behind hair styles. Would the widespread use of ear biomet-
rics put a tousle in our hairstyles by requiring ears to be visible at all times 
(or at least at work or at the ATM)?
Speech
Speaker recognition doesn’t suffer from a lack of fidelity in the capture or 
storage of the human voice. In fact, even the simplest systems are capable of 
capturing every possible nuance of speech and saving it perfectly. The single 
largest problem speaker recognition must overcome in the coming years is 
that it’s based on both anatomy and behavior; and for speech purposes, both 
of these change over time, with illness, and at the whim of the speaker.
Basic truth
Advances in speaker recognition accuracy will be based on the concept that 
there is a basic physical absolute that forms the basis of the speech of an 
individual and that absolute does not change when the speaker has a cold, or 
ages a dozen years or so. To some degree, we unscientifically know this to be 
true, since we recognize voices that we know well through all these kinds of 
changes. I have even managed to annoy old friends that call after being out 
of contact for many years by correctly identifying their voice over the phone 
(not the most sensitive of audio instruments) and ruining their “guess who 
this is” game.
Only when we are able to eliminate the transitory effects of disease, hydra-
tion, purposeful obfuscation, and the long term effects of aging will speaker 
recognition become a really useful tool for authentication and authorization.

Part III: Implementing and Using Biometrics 
Call-in
Identification using speech is another matter though. Remember, using 
biometrics for identification is a one-to-many process where we compare 
one new sample to many samples in the database. Intelligence services and 
law enforcement will be pushing the envelope on speaker identification 
using samples from bomb threats, harassing telephone calls, and other 
collected samples. Speaker identification under these circumstances has 
the same problems with the behavioral and environmental changes to voice, 
but due to the nature of the identification problem presented; interested 
parties have no choice but try to incrementally improve on technique with 
inherent limitations.
DNA
For a technology that’s used far more often in law enforcement than anything 
except fingerprints, DNA has a lot of drawbacks as a biometric technology 
and precisely because it’s so widely used, a lot of time will be spent trying to 
deal with these drawbacks.
Waiting for processing
Current methods for processing and comparing a DNA sample to a refer-
ence sample take hours in the best case and more typically days. This rules 
out DNA for anything that requires immediate feedback, including most 
authentication or authorization tasks. (If you think the latency of user ID and 
password authentication is slow, consider that DNA-based login would take 
all day — by the time you logged in, it would be time to go home.) Although 
DNA is exceedingly good at identification, we will see research pushing the 
processing speed problem to allow DNA-based biometrics to be used in a 
more timely way. Oddly enough, one of the ways of doing that is to ignore 
the human DNA in a sample and focus on the simple stuff that’s also present 
in the sample — bacteria and other parasites that are easier and faster to 
sequence, but as a collection offer up a DNA profile unique to the individual.
Collecting cells
We’ve come a long way from whipping out a needle and collecting a blood 
sample each time we need a few cells, but bucal swabbing (the inside of the 
cheek) each time you want to enter the server room is also more than a little 
intrusive. New techniques that gather as few cells as possible possibly by just 
vacuuming them off the back of your hand or your head might be a bit more 
acceptable.

197
 Chapter 11: The Future of Biometrics
Catching up with eyeballs
Both iris scanning and retina scanning are more unique to individuals than 
DNA. DNA comparisons are typically done using four to six non-coding 
regions and currently cannot distinguish between identical twins. Both 
iris and retina-based biometrics can distinguish between identical twins. 
Significantly faster processing of DNA would make it possible to use more 
than six regions and significantly improve the uniqueness of a DNA profile.
Dealing with privacy
Public perception of DNA identification is that it captures genetic information 
that reveals more than just identification. Although the genetic material pro-
vided does in fact contain such information, most identification techniques 
specifically choose to use areas away from or between genes to avoid this 
problem.
The problem is, once you give someone some cells for DNA fingerprinting, 
you have to trust them to throw away both the cells and the extra data not 
needed to identify you. It’s hard to imagine how technological advances 
might answer this problem, but it’s a significant hurdle that DNA biometrics 
must pass before it can be more widely accepted.
Gait
Analysis of gait is getting a lot of research attention as it provides another 
biometric tool that promises to identify people at a distance, possibly with-
out their knowledge. The field of biometrics is still relatively new, so it’s hard 
to speculate accurately about where all this research will take the field — but 
this chapter is all about speculation. We want to talk about all the biometric 
types that we cover in Part II, so we’ll give the crystal ball a little extra juice 
and see what we see.
One of the most fascinating biometric events Mike has ever seen don’t involve 
humans as subjects at all. In college he had a zoologist friend he hiked with 
in the woods and swamps of the Pacific Northwest. This friend wore glasses 
to correct rather bad distance vision; Mike has always enjoyed perfect uncor-
rected vision, so he was skeptical the first few times his friend pointed to a 
remote, dark-colored speck and named its species and gender. In every case, 
the guy was correct. How was he was seeing so much detail that Mike could 
not? Only later, in a conversation with a cognitive psychologist, did Mike 
understand: Apparently the zoologist wasn’t seeing any more detail about the 
black speck; he was unconsciously using clues about location, movement, 
weather conditions, and time of day to deduce what he was seeing.

198
Part III: Implementing and Using Biometrics 
In order for gait analysis to realize its potential, we will see scientists figuring 
out how to emulate that zoologist’s knack, using all the movement dynamics 
from the gait of the walker, but factoring in other movement and timing clues 
to help zero in on a more accurate identification.
Typing characteristics
Although not yet widely used, keyboard-typing-characteristic biometrics are 
so useful (and so simple to capture) that we’re likely to see new and innova-
tive uses in the near future. Current technology is not designed to capture 
some of the more interesting aspects of our typing though, so that’s one 
place we can expect to see interesting new directions for this technique.
In addition to the typing dynamics already discussed in this book, it seems 
likely that additional characteristics could be used to further identify an 
individual. A keyboard modified to register (say) how hard each finger hits 
each key, typing rhythm, and actual fingertip-contact area for each keystroke 
would certainly add unique and characteristic data to the typing profile.
Also relevant to the typing style of an individual is what we would call that 
person’s composition style, for lack of a better term. For example, Mike 
wrote exactly two term papers on a typewriter before he gained access to 
computers — and never looked back. His typing style is heavily influenced by 
the fact that he knows for certain that he can delete characters by just hitting 
the Backspace key, and make whole words or phrases go away by selecting 
them with a mouse and hitting Delete. That in itself distinguishes him from 
his parents, but not from the majority of the population at this point. The 
specific way that Mike deletes, however — and what he tends to delete or 
re-structure — is cumulatively quite unique to him. At this level of analysis, 
typing structure starts to blend in with the next topic for future speculation, 
sentence structure and linguistic analysis.
Sentence structure and linguistic analysis
Semantic analysis as a biometric technique is new enough that there are few 
current references to it beyond law enforcement and historical document 
analysis. It certainly has a bright future, though, if our analysis continues 
to improve in accuracy. Linguistic analysis in many ways is the ultimate 
biometrics at a distance, since it can be used to identify the writer of text, 
given a sufficient sample of known authenticity and sufficient unknown text 
to compare it to.

199
 Chapter 11: The Future of Biometrics
Natural language processing — of which sentence-structure and linguistic 
analysis for biometric purposes is a small subset — is currently studied 
by law enforcement (for example, Milt Jones’s accurate profile of the 
Unabomber). It’s also used for historical rabble-rousing such as debating who 
“really” wrote Shakespeare’s plays and Lewis Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland.
As yet, little of these analyses appear to be conclusive, but here again we 
look at the abilities of humans in biometric processing to see what might 
be done eventually with computers. From the experience of writing several 
books with co-authors, Mike knows that his father can accurately tell which 
chapters (or even paragraphs) are his, and which ones he did not write. 
Someday, when you log in to a computer and type a few sentences, the 
machine will determine whether it’s really you or someone who has success-
fully guessed your user ID and password. We think we can expect improved 
techniques in the analysis of text to yield useful identification information 
from sample prose in the near future.
Brainwave
We know our human brains are unique, and the various impulses that 
make up our thoughts would be fantastically unique if we could really 
capture them in a useful way. Unfortunately, the ways we can watch brain 
function are either fantastically expensive — such as functional Magnetic 
Resonance Imaging (fMRI) — or dangerous to do a lot of (Positron Emission 
Tomography) or not very detailed (electro-encephalography).
Okay, current techniques are both impractical from a cost standpoint and 
too generic in the way they map current brain activity. So none are likely to 
be built into a USB key any time soon. That’s not to say that all brains react 
the same way to the same stimuli, but similar patterns will happen across 
many brains, based on the current levels of activity we can measure. Oddly 
enough, the only way we could use current technology to authenticate that 
you are who we think you are would be to show you a picture of a password 
that only you know, and see whether the proper sequence for recognition 
fires in your brain. At that point, why not just have you type in the password 
and save a few million dollars in software development and equipment costs?
If we were to take a wild guess at where brain-function-based biometrics 
will eventually go, we’d say it will be based on watching the unique neural 
activity involved when the subject remembers something specific. This 
would need to be a very high-resolution technology that still wouldn’t require 
you to lie motionless in a large magnetic doughnut after leaving your jewelry 
and other metallic items in another room. Not exactly conducive to a routine 
login to a computer, is it? But perhaps technology like this will be used to 
determine whether you’re permitted to enter a building.

200
Part III: Implementing and Using Biometrics 
Identifying by odor
Really good odor-identification systems should be possible. After all, we 
know bloodhounds can identify people easily — and perfectly uniquely — 
by smell alone. The problem is that most current techniques for identifying 
the chemicals floating around in the air can really identify only a single 
chemical at a time — and body odor is a complex miasma of chemicals that 
collectively create the odor of a person.
A fair amount of work is underway to resolve the acquisition problem in 
odor identification; so far capturing odors for that purpose is difficult. 
Sensing what’s floating around in the air is important if you’re going to detect 
explosives in airports and drugs in various situations, so we’d expect that 
problem to drive the development of ever-more-capable electronic noses — 
which should, in turn, yield better odor-based biometric capabilities. Seems 
it would be cheaper to just use bloodhounds at the employees’ entrance to 
the building and let the bloodhound decide whether you should be permitted 
to enter. It’s not an elegant solution, but . . .
 
In data security, simplicity often wins out over complexity.
New Objects to Measure
With all the interest in using biometrics to identify, authenticate, and 
authorize, there will certainly be new objects or characteristics discovered 
that provide sufficient uniqueness for each individual to result in a useful 
biometric technique.
Although it’s easy to imagine new things that we might be able to measure, 
it’s quite difficult to imagine all the security, social, and privacy implications 
of new techniques until they’ve been in play for a while. We’re going to take a 
stab at not only predicting some new biometrics that we might measure, but 
also at imagining some of the implications of each new measurement. Here 
are some of our thoughts on what we might reasonably see in use before we 
get too far into the future.
Behavior-based
Behavior-based biometrics rely on an interesting aspect of human learning, 
which is that when we learn to do a physical task well, we tend to perform 
that task almost exactly the same way each time. The more we practice, 
the more closely we match previous behavior. Because of this human trait, 
almost anything we do a lot could be imagined as a behavioral biometric.

201
 Chapter 11: The Future of Biometrics
Game play
If you’re over thirty, this may not be the biometric for you, since your video 
game-playing skills haven’t been honed by thousands of hours of controller 
use. The generation that can run, kick, and jump with a game controller 
almost as well (maybe better in some cases) than IRL (in real life for us 
oldsters) will likely develop some distinctive game-playing characteristics — 
how the controller is held, characteristic movements of each control, that 
sort of thing — that uniquely identify the person to the controller.
At the very least, we can imagine using such information to control access 
to differently rated games in a household; the ten-year-old could be detected 
and locked out from operating the more violent games, or presented with an 
age-appropriate version of the same game. There’s no reason this couldn’t be 
used for other kinds of authentication, though it’s hard to imagine using a few 
minutes of Tetris or Meteor as an entry test for the office.
Reading dynamics
There’s a fair amount of work being done to understand how people read 
and what that physical process really is. For example, an experienced reader 
doesn’t read each character, starting at the far left and only having “read” 
a word after processing each letter. So exactly what is happening there? 
It’s still a research topic, but we appear to recognize the word shapes for 
common words and only slow down to get more detail when a word we don’t 
recognize shows up.
While people are studying these things, they’ve also been coming up with 
ways to track our eye movements while we read — and record not only 
exactly where we’re looking on-screen, but also the movement our eye made 
to get there. We can suppose that the way we read is sufficiently unique to 
differentiate us, given good measuring capabilities and sufficient text to read. 
As with many biometrics, this one could also be used to supplement other 
techniques to produce a strong final product. You can imagine reading a 
short phrase while a camera tracks your eye movement, compares the iris to 
its known sample, and does voice-print analysis at the same time. Fooling all 
three systems simultaneously would be quite a challenge.
Basing biometrics on physical properties
This is really a third kind of biometrics different from behavioral and even 
different from physiological biometrics in a way. Physical properties biomet-
rics are about measuring physical properties associated with an individual, 
but not in the traditional way of imaging a body part. Strictly speaking, DNA 
would fit better into this category than into physiological.

202
Part III: Implementing and Using Biometrics 
Electrical field
Our nervous system operates using electrical impulses that jump from the 
axon of one cell to the dendrites of another, carrying bits of information to 
and from the big collection of nerve cells at the top that we call the brain. 
Monitoring detailed brain activity and using it biometrically can identify 
people — and a scan detailed enough to accomplish that feat might be 
considered a bit intrusive, because it reveals quite a lot about your mental 
state and processes. A less-intrusive technology might focus not so much 
on the brain as on the electrical activity occurring elsewhere in the body; it 
might be combined with other biometrics that have a kinematic (movement-
based) and behavioral (rather than physical) basis to provide additional, 
differentiating data of excellent quality. For example, if we could watch 
the electrical impulses heading down your arms to your hands while you 
type, while at the same time capturing your typing-behavior biometrics, the 
combined data would almost certainly be more accurate than we could get 
from either technique separately.
One potential flaw in an approach that samples the body’s electrical field is 
that it could conflict with some versions of personal area networks (PANs) 
that use your body as the network medium. Versions of these networks are 
starting to appear, regulating access to cars, PDAs, and other stuff you have 
to touch before you can use. It would be easy to mistake the operations 
of these PANs for some sort of sophisticated biometric system. But in fact 
there is little or no traditional authentication happening; in these cases, 
the physical key is in contact with the subject (you), and transmits its 
authenticating information through your body to the device. And you can bet 
that techniques for hacking into a person’s body (electronically speaking) 
won’t be far behind.
Skeletal structure
Details of our bones and joints are certain to produce enough uniqueness 
to be useful as a biometric tool, if only we could figure out a way to get a 
good look at them that didn’t involve dangerous radiation (if done daily) or 
gigantic machines with the annoying habit of wiping out the information on 
our credit cards. Since this technology is more of a potential future capability 
than a reality just now, we can safely make some guesses about where such 
technology might come from.
When we’re looking for new physical measures of the human body, we can 
count on medical research to provide some. In many ways, the goals of medi-
cal researchers are almost identical to those of biometrics. Both want to 
find safe, nonintrusive ways to get extreme detail about various aspects of 
the human body. New techniques that could capture a noninvasive, low-risk, 
high-resolution photo of the skeletal structure would provide vast amounts 
of biometric information for identifying a subject.

203
 Chapter 11: The Future of Biometrics
General kinematics
Although gait is very promising as a distance-based tool, it’s really a subset 
of the kinds of movement that might be recorded and used to later identify 
people. Those are known as kinematics. As a source of biometric data, kine-
matics can actually be classified as both physical and behavioral. The behav-
ioral aspects of how we move are most evident when people do things that 
they do a lot — say, walking, opening a door, or eating. In effect, the activities 
we perform often wear a “groove” in our brains so we perform those activi-
ties nearly identically each time. Gait is one of the first such movements 
used as a kinematic biometric. That’s because it’s the most-often-performed 
general activity other than sleeping and sitting (both of which are harder to 
capture in a useful way).
Even when we’re not performing well-known tasks, the way our bodies move 
has to obey some very specific rules governed by bone length, muscle attach-
ment, and other factors that make up the physical metrics of kinematics. 
Given a large amount of sample data — and sufficient processing and analysis 
facilities — it’s certainly possible to imagine identifying a person biometri-
cally by watching how his or her body performs a novel task. Imagine being 
asked to bounce a basketball for a few seconds to get authenticated — that’s 
an example of the basic idea here. Subtler methods would probably just 
watch you walk into the building, using not only gait but door-opening and 
head movements to authenticate who you are.
Non-genetic chemical
Although people have serious objections to DNA-based biometrics, there are 
lots of things swirling around in our bodies that don’t have any of our genetic 
material, but may in fact uniquely identify us.
Little creatures
Viruses, bacteria, and microbes all have genetic material of their own, and 
they’re all more easily examined than human DNA. There is also potentially 
more than one way for our micro-passengers to help identify us.
One way would be to examine the collection of strains of various beasties 
with the idea that while such simple creatures don’t have enough complex-
ity or uniqueness (in most cases) to identify individuals, there certainly is a 
wealth of information about groups of those creatures —  and the collection 
of them hanging out in your spit might be unique enough to help identify you.
Another approach would be to use the most genetically advanced of the vari-
ous microscopic animals hanging out with you to identify specific lineages. 
Since for them you are the ecosystem, your little friends are all pretty closely 
related to each other. (They don’t get out much, so they have only other 
family members available for procreation.)

204
Part III: Implementing and Using Biometrics 
We don’t know enough about the various genetic traits of flora and fauna 
living in, on, and around our bodies to know how much unique information 
we can extract from them as a proxy for you. Preliminary work in this area, 
however, seems to suggest that it’s a possible biometric measure.
Antibodies
Neither of the authors have enough medical background to discuss the 
operation of antibodies in the human immune system in any detail, and 
(okay) it’s not really within the scope of this book. So if you have any medical 
background at all, we suggest you skip this paragraph unless you’re up for 
a good laugh at our expense; our explanation will touch only on the aspects 
useful to us in biometrics.
The body’s response to the introduction of a pathogen — say, the common 
cold or rhinovirus — is to eventually create antibodies that bind themselves 
to the specific strain of pathogen so the immune system can seek it out and 
destroy it. The process by which this happens is wonderfully complex — and 
almost entirely irrelevant to our discussion of biometrics.
The interesting thing for us is that the antibodies for all the various 
pathogens we’ve encountered and defeated in our lives are still hanging out 
in our bloodstream. Now, think back on every sniffle, flu-bug, and generally 
fever-inducing time of your life since childhood; try to imagine someone else 
having exactly the same leftover antibodies as you. Not likely.
Current technology is not able to classify all the various antibodies in 
your system in any reasonable amount of time, but advances in medical 
technology may well sort that part out. Even with that sorted out, we still 
have to get some blood to do the testing, which seems a bit intrusive (to say 
the least). We can’t imagine computer-operated hypodermic needles built 
into keyboards just yet (or don’t want to, anyway).
So why is this form of biometrics interesting at all, you ask? For two reasons:
 
 It’s a cool idea, and we technologists never let mere user convenience or 
comfort get in the way of a cool idea.
 
 It promises to be an accurate biometric based on medical science that 
does not record or use DNA at all.
The ability to do blood-based comparisons without recording anything about 
the DNA of the subject has the potential of helping law enforcement collect 
elimination samples (samples that are collected from persons known to be 
associated with a crime scene, but who are not considered a suspect — in 
order to identify their samples in the evidence collected and eliminate them) 
from people who would otherwise balk at giving the government their blood 

205
 Chapter 11: The Future of Biometrics
for DNA profiling. Although we might want to help out with a criminal inves-
tigation, we might draw the line at the government potentially knowing about 
a genetic predisposition to (say) road rage. This biometric technology would 
provide a way to compare blood samples in a useful way, without the road-
rage thing coming back to us in court years later.
Other chemical analysis
If it’s possible to identify people by body odor, it stands to reason that a 
number of things about the human body must be chemically unique to each 
individual. Odor originates on the body and is carried away by evaporating 
sweat, so chemical testing the composition of sweat would yield interesting 
biometric results, even if we leave out the epithelial (skin) cells that we’re 
likely to get with the sweat collection.
Likewise, in what might be really the ultimate biometric measure, we might 
grab a small chunk of skin and shovel it into a really sensitive mass spectrom-
eter that can tell us exactly what chemical elements are in the sample and 
(with a bit more work) exactly what amounts of each — would that result in 
a sufficiently unique signature to identify the subject. Or are we all so alike 
chemically that this wouldn’t be useful?
The answer to that question is probably somewhere in the middle. We are 
what we eat, as well as what we breathe, and (to some degree) what we hang 
out in. Subtle differences in diet, air, and environment all influence the levels 
of many trace elements in our systems. Although we expect that this kind of 
analysis would generate interesting results — and potentially have enough 
uniqueness to be biometrically useful — to our knowledge nobody has stud-
ied this method in any really useful way. Yet.

Ten Tools Used in Biometrics
In This Chapter
 Exploring new-fangled ideas, techniques, and devices
 Understanding “soft” tools: survey skills, diplomacy, and business knowledge
O
kay, the word “tools” is pretty broad — and here we use the broadest 
definitions of the word to discuss technologies, techniques, and even 
ideas that you can use as tools in understanding and implementing biomet-
rics. The goal of this list is to describe some of the ways you can select, plan, 
and implement a biometric solution.
Credit-Card Fingerprint Scanner
This tool we find interesting not so much for the specific task, as for the 
concept that you can get swipe-style print readers (which require that you 
slide your print over a bar, rather than press a scanner) embedded into 
something as small and thin as a credit card.
If you’re just looking at putting together a new biometric authentication 
system for your organization using existing technology, you may want to just 
skip to the next section; this section is written more for folks who are inter-
ested in how a biometric authentication or authorization might enhance their 
company’s product.
The concept of putting a fingerprint reader onto the stuff you might want to 
protect from unauthorized access (such as a credit, debit, or proximity card) 
has been around for a while. If you’re interested in what’s out there, do an 
Internet search for biometric memory stick and look at the increasingly long 
list of such devices on the market. The idea of a working fingerprint reader 
on a credit card — which has, after all, little access to power, almost no 
storage, and a rough life of getting carried around in people’s wallets — 
should lead designers down a whole new path in their understanding of 
where such technology can be used.

210
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
As a useful biometric tool, the low-profile fingerprint reader with miniscule 
power requirements has to be one of the most interesting things we’ve seen 
in a while. To get a look at a page describing this tool (and a nice picture of 
it), go to 
www.ameinfo.com/58236.html
Contactless Palm-Vein Imager
Fujitsu Laboratories has been doing a lot of work on palm-vein scanning, so 
we mention two tools they have developed . The first is a new palm-vein scan-
ner that looks like a small hot plate — but instead of heating up a package of 
ramen noodles for lunch, this one accurately reads the complex patterns of 
veins in your palm from a few inches away.
The new style of reader solves the hygienic issues of having many people 
touch the same scanning device hundreds of times each day to be granted 
access to a facility. Since there is no required contact, no germs are transmit-
ted from person to person. In health-care situations, this is a critical advance.
Also addressing health-care is the idea that since this is an infrared imager, it 
can “see” through latex gloves pretty well — and authenticate or identify 
workers without any impact on a sterile environment.
Generally, people feel more comfortable using a device that they don’t actu-
ally have to touch. In addition — unlike the body-part-print-based technolo-
gies — you don’t accidentally leave what’s measured (your hand-vein 
patterns) on stray drinking glasses. You can be pretty confident that the 
source information for the biometric is secure. You can find a picture and 
more description of this technology at this link:
http://www.fujitsu.com/global/about/rd/200506palm-vein.
html
Mouse-Embedded Palm-Vein Scanner
Also from Fujitsu, the mouse-embedded palm-vein scanner is really just a 
specific instance of the same technology as the contactless palm-vein imager 
discussed previously: To be authenticated, the user just holds a palm above 
the imaging device built into the mouse. In addition to this no-touch conve-
nience, such tools are worth special mention because they accomplish some-
thing important: They don’t take up more space on the desktop.

211
 Chapter 12: Ten Tools Used in Biometrics
Folks now make computer mice with fingerprint readers, palm-vein readers, 
and even an iris-reading mouse. We feel that a new authentication technology 
for the desktop should have as little disruptive impact as possible — not only 
on users and their typical workflow, but on the increasingly cluttered desk-
top workspace. Embedding technologies like these into items already existing 
on the desktop means you don’t have to find yet another nook for the new 
biometric-authentication tool. Another great example of this kind of design is 
USB hubs built into computer flat screens — now that we have a screen with 
a hub in it, we’ll never buy another desktop hub.
To get a look at examples of each of these desktop authentication technolo-
gies, take a look at these links:

Cardio-Signature Reader
Aladdin Knowledge Systems has brought to market a new kind of biometric 
reader that is both a useful tool and the first of its kind, reading a new kind of 
biometric: the electrical signals that make your heart beat. Instead of focus-
ing on the main signal (as you’d see on an EKG), however, these readers 
look at the more subtle “under-patterns” that lie beneath the main control 
signals — and appear to be completely unique to an individual, given enough 
capture detail.
The Aladdin system is one of a whole new set of biometric tools that are 
cropping up: biometric signatures. For the most part, these will be looking at 
subtle signals from autonomic systems in the body that produce enough 
unique information to identify individuals. We wouldn’t be surprised if, at the 
appropriate level of detail, something like the muscle-twitch patterns in an 
eyelid before a blink will become a unique identifier (and might do dual duty 
as a lie detector).

Laptop Facial Recognition
For quite a long time now, laptops have had the option of an embedded video 
camera — offering live video chat, videoconferencing, and maybe something 
more interesting than dull spreadsheets to hackers who get remote control of 
your laptop.
Lenovo — possibly among others — has found a new way to use that embed-
ded camera: to authenticate users using facial-recognition biometrics. Several 
Lenovo models use a program called “VeriFace” to authenticate a user to the 
Microsoft Windows Vista operating system. Because this tool is integrated 
with Vista, all the legitimate user has to do to unlock a locked screen is to sit 
down in front of the computer and it will unlock. The whole package actually 
gets good reviews from people who own those particular Lenovo models. In 
addition, as with various biometric methods built into computer mice, this 
one doesn’t consume any additional desktop space — especially important 
for a laptop since the “desk” might be, well, your lap.
The use of this tool isn’t limited to just Lenovo laptops by any means. At least 
one other software company out there, Banana Security, has produced 
software for this purpose. Here are a couple of Web sites that offer 
more information:

Biometric Timecard Systems
Some studies indicate that time theft can account for as much as ten percent 
of the total payroll in a company that pays hourly. A traditional approach to 
solving this problem is to tie an entry badge with a magnetic stripe on it to 
the timecard system, so you have to have your card handy to get into the 
facility, and you have to have it with you to clock in. Creative people have 
found dozens of ways of circumventing this kind of system, and it introduces 
a losable card that may also create an ongoing expense.
The new biometric tool for solving this problem is a biometric timecard 
system that identifies and clocks in users when they present their biometric 
information. Since time theft is a fairly widespread problem, there are a 
number of manufacturers making integrated biometric timecard systems that 
use fingerprint, hand-vein, and hand geometry to identify individual users 
and start clocking their hours.

213
 Chapter 12: Ten Tools Used in Biometrics
One thing we find interesting about these systems is that they’re sold as a 
package, with the biometrics and the time-logging system all built into a 
single device. Truth is, any good biometric system with a logging facility 
(a feature no good one would be without) would work just as well for time-
tracking and check-in. The only change from a normal medium-security 
biometric installation would be an added requirement: that you check out 
when you leave.
Biometric Flash Drives, Portable 
Hard Drives, and Stuff
A fingerprint reader on a credit card — a useful design landmark we mention 
earlier in this chapter — isn’t all that farfetched; some new tools are taking 
advantage of this concept. These devices do not, for the most part, provide 
tools for creating a biometric authentication system for your home or office. 
(Not yet, anyway.) But they can be used biometrically to secure devices 
and transactions.
Portable storage of all kinds is starting to get a bad rap from security folks — 
and for good reasons. One of the more serious problems we face in informa-
tion security is the loss or theft of devices that contain huge numbers of 
private records. The authors haven’t figured out why it’s necessary to have a 
hundred thousand or so customer records on a keyfob or laptop that you 
leave in the trunk of your car while you watch a Little League game, but it 
happens. Such security lapses are one reason about 325 million customer 
records containing private data have been exposed over the last four years. 
One great way to reduce the impact that theft of portable storage can have 
on the organization — and the customers — is to integrate encryption into 
the device itself, using biometrics to keep the authentication quality high and 
avoid the lost-password problem.
Another security problem that this kind of tool promises to solve is securing 
transactions that happen in public places on public networks. We’ve known 
for a long time that such transactions need to be encrypted — at the very 
least, so prying eyes can’t grab the credit-card number as it flies by. Another 
problem with these transactions is harder to solve — being sure who is 
initiating the transaction. Is it you, or is it someone in possession of your 
credit card and/or cell phone? Some early vending-machine and cell-phone 
integrations trusted whoever was in possession of the cell phone to buy a 
candy bar using that phone number. Some new phones and PDAs have 
built-in fingerprint readers that allow a vendor to verify securely — through 
the cellular, Wi-Fi, or NFC connection — that the individuals initiating 

214
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
transactions are who they say they are. In many cases, the biometric 
authentication goes no farther than the device — which already knows the 
biometric of the registered owner, and can do the verification locally.
The “tool” in this case the range of devices out there that already have good 
biometrics sensors installed — and that you may be able to use for your 
particular purpose if you get creative.
Survey Skills
This is the first of three “soft” tools that we feel are important to your ability 
to be effective in deploying new biometric technologies. One of the most 
important things that you will need to know when preparing for a new 
biometric technology is certain kinds of information about your users’ 
physiology, behavior, and attitudes.
No biometric tool will be well accepted if it depends on physiology that is 
(for some reason) not accessible or usable in your user base. We know of an 
information-technology professional who designed a new fingerprint-
identification system for accessing secure storage facilities for a utility dis-
trict. He chose a great system, tested it on himself and lots of his office 
mates, and then started putting it in place for the storage facilities. In fact, 
enrollment of the workers was going very well, but over the course of the 
first day, he discovered the serious flaw in his thinking: Utility workers start 
the day with clean hands, so at that time, registration worked fine. As the day 
progressed, dirtier and dirtier hands were being used for authentication, 
which wasn’t great for the equipment, and wasn’t working so well for authen-
tication, either. It turns out that a number of the workers saw this problem 
coming, but “nobody asked them” so they just watched the train wreck. 
 
In large organizations, it’s nearly impossible to anticipate the work conditions 
for every category and class of employee, so don’t try. Instead, find good ways 
of asking them about those conditions — and listening to what they have to 
tell you. Even the most uninformed computer or technology users will know 
more about how their day rolls out than you do, and they can give you clues 
that will help get things right the first time. In the utility company’s case, 
things went from bad to worse as they discovered that a significant number of 
the older workers’ hands were so worn from manual labor that they were 
nearly unreadable.

215
 Chapter 12: Ten Tools Used in Biometrics
Diplomacy . . . 
. . . is a skill that everyone should cultivate  — but information technology 
workers have even more need of it than others. That’s because as an IT guru, 
you’re constantly disrupting the workplace. It’s not entirely your fault. As it 
turns out, information technology is disruptive by nature.
Biometrics projects change the way we gain access to the tools and locations 
we need to do our jobs — and that change can be on the extreme side of dis-
ruptive if it’s not handled well. The transitions have to be smoothed. If 
unforeseen circumstances make the transition from the old way of doing 
things to the new biometric system less than smooth, you’d better know how 
to unruffle the ruffled feathers. Keep reminding yourself that no concern is 
“silly” just because it stems from ignorance of the system or misperceptions. 
Nobody can (or should) be expected to know the system the way you do — 
and if a particular concern seems silly, that just means you should be able to 
easily allay that concern with some well-chosen words.
We mention the problem of privacy often in Chapter 3, so we won’t talk about 
the details here —  except to say that many people you work with will have 
privacy concerns regarding any use of a biometric system, and you’ll hit a 
snag in deploying biometrics if you’re not prepared to help those folks under-
stand the organization’s point of view. Often, the best way to accomplish that 
is to understand the users’ point of view, so they don’t just dismiss your 
ideas.
Business Knowledge
There’s one more important body of knowledge needed for a successful bio-
metrics project: a deep understanding of the business processes into which 
you’ll be integrating your biometric techniques. Even if you have an encyclo-
pedic knowledge of the technical aspects of biometrics, the systems you will 
be installing onto, and the details of the installation process, you have to 
understand why the processes you’re working with exist in the first place. 
Then you have a handle on the new biometrics technology will make that 
process better, more efficient, or maybe just compliant with laws or regula-
tions. Remember, it’s ultimately about the business!
The job of a good information technologist is to enable business practices, 
and it’s no different for security people. Yes, your focus is to build security 
into those processes, but the processes themselves are what’s important, not 
the security itself. The security you should be building is a product of busi-
ness decisions about risk management, and not some absolute standard of 
what is secure and what is not.

216
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
A really great biometrics project will be one that helps the organization 
manage risk by improving authentication or identification techniques for pro-
cesses that have been deemed to embody too much risk from the perspective 
of identity management. A bad biometrics project just arbitrarily makes identi-
fication management more secure, and stops there. It may not have addressed 
managing risk at all. Don’t just spend money to “make security better.”

here are quite a lot of biometrics Web sites and other sites out there with 
good biometrics information — so many that choosing just ten great 
ones is a bit of a challenge. What we’ve done here is not so much collect the 
ten absolute best sites we could find (that’s a moving target), but rather we 
chose ten helpful sites from several categories to provide a wider view of bio-
metrics sites on the Internet. The Internet changes daily, and in an emerging 
field such as biometrics, we can just about guarantee that by the time you 
read this, there will be more sites than we could have included — and some 
of the links we provide will be somewhat outdated. Use what we provide here 
as a starting point for your own exploration and see where it leads you.
National Geographic and Sharbat Gula
We mention this particular case in Chapter 3 in connection with biometrics in 
our daily lives — but it’s worth highlighting the National Geographic Web 
site’s pages that talk about the fascinating tale of a young Pashtun woman 
caught on camera by photographer Steve McCurry in 1985. Mr. McCurry and 
a team of biometrics scientists authenticated her 17 years later — using the 
iris images from the original 1985 photograph to compare to a more recent 
photo of her.
The story and the Web site are interesting to read from a general human-
interest standpoint, but we also use it all the time as a biometrics Web 
resource to illustrate some key points:

218
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
 Authentication is a far different process than identification. In this 
case, the identification was accomplished through strong journalistic 
and detective work, on the ground in a place where public records are 
rarely of help and “Gula” is a very common name for women, meaning 
“flower” in the Pashto language. In contrast, the authentication of the 
identified woman — confirming she was the same as the original — was 
only slightly complicated by the fact that the original image was not 
intended to be used as an iris biometric.
 
 Some of the best biometrics — such as iris and vein patterns — do 
not change over time. The ability to perform a very high-probability 
match using a single 17-year-old sample collected poorly (from the 
biometric point of view) shows how well these kinds of measurements 
work over time.
 
 We will see all the privacy issues surrounding biometrics only over 
time and with experience. Sharbat Gula wasn’t particularly happy with 
having her picture taken in the first place, according to her own 
account, and was unaware of very broad dissemination of her face on 
the cover of National Geographic. Her face changed greatly over the 
years, and most people would not have made the match with the 
original photo, but for her family’s memories of the event. The fact that 
we can prove that it was this particular woman, placing her and her 
family at a specific time during a time of war in her homeland, certainly 
has privacy implications.

Electronic Frontier Foundation
The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a strong advocate for citizens’ 
rights in the digital age, provides information, advocacy, and (in some cases) 
legal support to people whose electronic freedoms or privacy are at risk.
Not too surprisingly, the EFF has written a well-founded and well-reasoned 
paper expressing the EFF’s concerns about the use of biometrics, which is 
posted here:
http://w2.eff.org/Privacy/Surveillance/biometrics/
In this paper, the EFF does a great job of describing its concerns, though the 
assertion that the accuracy of biometric systems are impossible to assess 

219
 Chapter 13: Ten Biometrics Web Sites
seems to indicate that this was written before some of the large-scale installa-
tions were in use, which are now providing high-accuracy data from large-
scale use that is not tainted by manufacturers or vendors.
The discussion on “Current Biometrics Initiatives” is definitely worth a read if 
you want to understand what the U.S. federal government is up to in this 
area. This area, once again, makes us think that the article is a year or two 
old, as it doesn’t mention the implications of the facial information captured 
by U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Real ID initiative (which we dis-
cuss further in Chapter 3).
Possibly the best section of this paper is “Attributes of Biometric Systems”; 
this section not only talks about biometric systems in the abstract, it also dis-
cusses all the most common types in some detail. It’s a different perspective 
from that presented in this book, and well worth reading.
National Biometric Security Project
The National Biometric Security Project (NBSP, at http://www.national
biometric.org/) was established as a nonprofit organization shortly after 
the events of 9/11/2001 to help the government and private industry protect 
U.S. national infrastructure through the use of biometric technologies. Keep 
in mind that this organization is primarily focused on protecting infrastruc-
ture, and all its material is provided relative to that goal, so it’s really of 
marginal use if you’re just interested in figuring out a better way to use the 
fingerprint reader on your laptop or installing a biometric lock on your house.
Unlike many of the initiatives undertaken immediately after the 9/11 attacks, 
the NBSP understood from the start that there were privacy issues related to 
the protective measures they would be assisting — and they spent some time 
and effort researching this area, both from a domestic and an international 
perspective.
As a research site, this is one of the better ones we’ve seen. It includes pages 
and pages of analysis on some vital topics:
 
 The application of biometric technology. You can download a PDF book 
on this topic from the site, free of charge, at
www.nationalbiometric.org/news_events_publications_std.php
 
 International privacy laws with respect to U.S. applications of biometrics
 
 U.S. privacy laws with respect to the application of biometrics
 
 Published and emerging standards in biometrics

Part IV: The Part of Tens 
United States Department of Justice
The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has a keen interest in biometrics and 
generally being able to identify and authenticate people — as well as a duty 
to the people to protect privacy and freedoms. To this end, the DOJ doesn’t 
tend to take a stance on biometrics directly, but it does publish a lot of infor-
mation about the laws of the land — and which are used to interpret how our 
privacy and freedoms are protected.
The DOJ Web site is a gigantic place to go looking for stuff, even if that stuff is 
sometimes nearly impossible to interpret simply. What we provide here are 
multiple links to privacy and biometrics-related links at the DOJ (and one 
from the department of defense):

National Institute of Standards 
and Technology
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is an enormously 
helpful resource for just about any information-security-related questions you 
may have. In Chapter 10, we discuss the NIST 800 series of documents; these 
cover everything from security controls and policy to specific encryption 
standards and their use.
As a nationally funded agency, the NIST’s task is primarily to research and 
answer questions of this nature for other government agencies — but as a 
general rule, most of what NIST has to say is applicable to private industry as 

221
 Chapter 13: Ten Biometrics Web Sites
well, though you may have to trim off some of the government overkill. For 
example, if the NIST lists 17 separate security controls regarding authentica-
tion, your organization may need to use only seven or eight of them. Just 
divide by two and round up (just kidding — “use what applies” is the 
rule here).
Because the U.S. national government has a keen interest in biometrics and 
the applications of biometrics technologies, the NIST has devoted an entire 
section of its Web site to the topic at the Biometrics Resource Center Web 
site, located here:
www.itl.nist.gov/div893/biometrics/
This section of the NIST Web site rather broadly covers standards in biomet-
rics including some of the interoperability and data interchange standards 
and testing. The site, however, also talks about test tools and applications 
that the NIST has developed as reference standards.
International Center for Disability 
Resources on the Internet
The International Center for Disability Resources on the Internet (ICDRI) 
focuses generally on the equalization of opportunities for persons with dis-
abilities. We include its page on resources related to biometrics because 
we’ve noted an interesting contrast: The EFF raises concerns about denying 
equal access because of a lack of specific biometric traits — but the ICDRI 
sees biometrics as a potential enabling technology that will allow disabled 
people to interact with society on a more equal basis . . . if applied correctly.
The Web page is located here:
www.icdri.org/biometrics/biometrics.htm
It’s really a launching point for links to other resources (so you get your 
money’s worth in this Part of Tens) that describe how biometrics can be 
used to enhance a disabled person’s access to society and in some cases 
how to avoid impairing that person’s access when biometric systems 
are contemplated.
With all the currently available biometrics technologies, there will be a 
percentage of the population that will not be able to use the device due to a 
physical limitation. Blind people who may have perfectly good irises will 
struggle to use iris recognition because getting a good image requires that 
the eye be positioned by focusing on something for a moment. There are 

222
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
many other examples of this sort of thing, but these “exceptions” do not 
absolve people who are planning biometric projects from doing their best to 
plan around foreseeable issues. Resources that the ICDRI tracks on its site 
can help with that task.
findBIOMETRICS.com
This site is trying hard to be a complete resource for anyone preparing to 
undertake a biometric project. It has tons of information and links to informa-
tion that will be useful in making decisions about your upcoming biometric 
project. For example, it does a great job of the following:
 
 Pulls together vendor lists categorized by biometric type (such as fin-
gerprint or iris), or by biometric application (such as physical or logical 
access).
 
 Provides links to a large number of featured reports, articles, and news 
releases, all of which are good reading for someone contemplating a 
biometric project.
 
We really have just two caveats for readers who visit the site:
 
 The site makes its money from advertising biometric products. We are 
appreciative of the fact that sponsors as well as advertisements are clearly 
identified. As with any commercial interaction, however, users of the 
site should be aware that some of the biometrics technologies mentioned 
on these pages are helping the site pay the bills — and some are not.
 
 Where biometric vendors are categorized by the application of their 
technology, HIPAA is listed as an application area. The Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act is most certainly a place 
where biometrics can be used to satisfy some of the requirements of 
Security Rule, we have two bones to pick with this link/categorization:
 
• No biometric technology is “HIPAA-compliant.” That’s a term 
without meaning in most cases. They don’t use the term, but a link 
to technology categorized as “HIPAA” comes close to saying that.
 
• Many of the technologies mentioned are there just because they 
provide authentication. Authentication is one HIPAA security rule 
requirement. You might as well make that link just points to the 
“logical authentication” section and be done with it.
Caveats aside, we like the information and the site, and you can find them at
www.findbiometrics.com/
The site’s name should come as no surprise.

Third Factor Biometric 
Authentication News
This site is in a very simple blog form, and focuses entirely on biometric 
news. The articles are short and to the point, developed it would appear from 
press releases and other sources, but we like the simplicity of the site and its 
search capability (the unlabeled box at the upper right).
The site is owned and operated by AVISIAN, a company that makes its money 
primarily from consulting in the area of identity management, and uses their 
various publications in this topic area to promote the companies consulting 
practice. We have to say that promoting your business by providing a valu-
able information resource is a great way to get people to like you, and we 
appreciate their efforts.
Because it’s bloglike and news-related, this site is a prime candidate for a 
Real Simple Syndication (RSS) feed. If you already use an RSS reader, the link 
you want is this:
www.thirdfactor.com/xml/rss20/feed.xml
If you want to read it with a Web browser, you’ll want this link:

If you’re not already using an RSS reader but read a lot of news online, you 
might be interested in reading up on RSS; it can be a real timesaver.
Biometrics Catalog
The Biometrics Catalog isn’t really much like a catalog at all. According to its 
intro page it’s free to use, U.S. government-sponsored, and a “database of 
public information about biometric technologies.”
The site boasts some very handy features:
 
 A news section, which should be free of commercial bias (but with 
plenty of government bias, of course)
 
 A comprehensive searchable list with links to U.S. government publica-
tions about biometrics

224
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
 A gigantic database of research reports, totaling more than 6,000 docu-
ments, also searchable
 
 A section with links to papers and reports on biometrics privacy
 
 Conference presentations, legislative reports, and lists of commercial 
products and vendors
This site, combined with the lack of commercial bias, is an excellent search-
able resource for folks wanting to understand a bit more about what’s happ-
ening in biometrics. It’s not as focused as some others are on providing 
answers to questions such as, “What should I buy?” It will, however, help 
educate you to a point at which you can answer that question for yourself. 
The “catalog” can be found here:
www.biometricscatalog.org/
John Daugman
We thought a bit about what to put into the last slot here in the Web sites, 
and settled on John Daugman’s Web site at the University of Cambridge. 
Unlike most of the other biometrics, which owe their origins to many sources 
and parallel development, iris recognition — provably one of the most 
accurate biometrics available — owes much of its history to just one man: 
John Daugman.
Since all commercial applications of iris recognition use algorithms originally 
developed by John, and iris recognition is poised to play such an important 
role in many of the high-volume biometrics installations that value ease of 
use, throughput, and accuracy, it seemed fitting to include his Web page as 
an important biometrics Web site.
John’s site is updated with current work in computer vision, iris recognition, 
and good data from some of the more interesting installations using his 
algorithms. You can find him at

Ten Essentials for Biometrics 
Success

T
here are a lot of ways to measure success, and biometric projects pose 
some interesting challenges that require a careful understanding of what 
it means to “succeed” — and exactly how we will measure that. If we’re too 
narrow in our definition, we risk being spectacularly unsuccessful in some 
aspect of the project — even while still meeting our general success criteria. 
Accidentally locking everyone out of the building by setting the False Accept 
Rate (FAR) too low would be a good example of this. If your success criterion 
was to keep unauthorized people out of the building, you clearly met it; if 
everyone else is also left standing outside in the rain (while you hide in the 
server room relaxing the FAR a bit), the project might not enhance your 
bonus this year.
Align with the Goals of the Organization
No project can succeed if it doesn’t accomplish something meaningful for the 
organization. In most fields, that’s never a problem, because nobody ever 
even proposes a project without very specific organizational goals that the 
project will accomplish. IT, however, sometimes seems to see a need for new 
technology when there are no clear tactical or strategic benefits to the orga-
nization beyond “It will do X better and faster than we’re doing it today” — 
especially if what you do today is good and fast enough.

226
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Don’t get us wrong. Both authors have worked in IT, IS, MIS, DP, or whatever 
name you want to put on the management of information technology for 
quite a long time; we know and understand the need to keep current and not 
let information technology in the organization go stale. We also know that 
being on the bleeding edge means that someone or something is going to 
bleed — usually the very business processes that support our paychecks. 
There is a time and a place for using the coolest, newest version of some cool 
new technology — but usually that isn’t in production systems with a low tol-
erance for downtime, odd behavior, and the whole list of symptoms from a 
television drug commercial.
Biometric projects should be trying to solve an identified problem in an 
organization for which biometric technology is best suited. Such identified 
problems crop up when organizational needs go unmet in (for example) 
these categories:
 
 Identification or authorization that is tied directly to an individual and 
not sharable
 
 Strong authentication that doesn’t require memorizing long, difficult 
passwords
 
 Identification or authorization that does not depend on any level of trust 
with the subject
Above all, successful biometric installations are usually accomplished as a 
response to an expressed need from outside the information-technology 
organization. The expressed need may not mention biometrics, but it will 
name requirements that biometrics can best fulfill.
Consider and Address Privacy Concerns
One measure of success for a new technology is that people using it do not 
resent its being forced upon them and feel that it’s affecting their lives in a 
negative fashion. Unfortunately, if you’re not careful to consider the potential 
privacy concerns associated with a new biometrics project, that is exactly 
how many users will feel about it.
Are their concerns valid? Is their privacy really being invaded and compro-
mised by the system? Being able to answer “no” to each of these questions 
doesn’t really buy you anything within your user community unless you 
can also explain why and how their privacy is protected — in terms that 
they understand.

227
 Chapter 14: Ten Essentials for Biometrics Success
For example, telling a sales manager that the fingerprint scanner is only stor-
ing a hash of specific minutiae from the fingerprint (and not a photographic 
image of the print) may not mean much to the sales manager. Explaining that 
it’s not storing an image at all, but just some numbers that could never be 
used to re-create the original print, might make more sense. Further explain-
ing that it’s one-way-encrypted (like boiling an egg — no way to unboil it) and 
the only thing that the database is good for is comparing a new scan (also 
boiled) to the previously boiled version of an old scan might give them a 
handier picture of what’s happening.
 
For the following two reasons, we recommend that you never ever dismiss 
users’ concerns as “not based on the facts.” Here’s why:
 
 Reality or no reality, the users are concerned. Remember that a user’s 
perception is always right, even if it’s not based on facts. Telling them 
they don’t know what they’re talking about will not alleviate their con-
cerns — not even a little bit.
 
 It’s your job to make sure users have all the facts before them, and in 
a form they can understand. If they don’t, it’s not their problem, it’s 
yours. In some ways, it’s like editorial feedback to an author. Even if 
what you wrote is perfectly correct, the fact that the editor didn’t under-
stand is a big indicator that you need to try and explain it another way.
Survey the Users
Although privacy may be the most common concern for users, it’s by no 
means the only one. Since your success is based at least partially on their 
acceptance of the system and comfort in using it, we suggest that you 
have some discussions with representative users about your candidate 
solutions — and about the impact of a biometric installation on their work.
As with privacy, it’s important that you take their concerns seriously; don’t 
just dismiss ideas that are clearly uninformed. We’re reminded of people who 
complained in the late 1980s that computers and cellular phones were going 
to eliminate direct human contact and impose great barriers to real comm-
unication. Way back then, we saw the great potential for better electronic 
communications having the opposite effect — bringing together people with 
similar interests and allowing diverse groups to communicate who would 
otherwise have ignored each other. Even though we didn’t agree with their 
assessment, we worked with these users to help them see positive uses for 
the tools provided. For all we know, some of those users went on to create 
some of the first social-networking sites . . . nahhhh.

228
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
As we mention in Chapters 9 and 10, there are lots of things to think about in 
a biometric installation that have nothing to do with protecting assets with 
biometrics — and have everything to do with people interacting with some-
thing new. For example, touching a fingerprint or palm-vein reader imparts 
exactly the same amount of germs as touching a doorknob on the same asso-
ciated door; because the biometric device is new, however, people think 
about the implications of touching it right after the sneezy guy in front of 
them — and want to know what you’re going to do about it.
 
If you perform a wide survey of your potential users, the one thing we can 
almost guarantee is that you’ll see questions crop up that you never expected 
to hear.
Stick to the Plan
Part III is where you get a plan to stick to; it’s all about putting a formal pro-
cess together to select a solution, plan its implementation, put the solution in 
place, and use it for its intended purpose. If you’re a little rusty on Part III, 
skip back there for a refresher. We’ll wait.
Back already? It’s good material, maybe you’d like to take some time and go 
over it all again? All kidding aside, some of the more spectacular failures of 
any IT implementation come not so much from a poor plan as from failure to 
follow an excellent plan. Both of us tend to get called into projects when 
things are not proceeding well; we’ve each been around the block a few 
times, and have reputations for being able to fix projects on the edge of 
failure (we fondly call these “rescue jobs”). When we’re called in on cases 
like this, we see the same scenario about seven or eight times out of ten: 
The project manager hands us a great plan that details the particulars of the 
selection process, testing, and implementation — a plan that was abandoned 
a few months earlier because “the landscape changed.” It’s as though 
they’ve thrown their oars into the water and then wonder why they’re 
drifting off course.
About one time in a hundred, the basic parameters for the original project 
actually did change, for good business reasons, partway through the execu-
tion of the original plan. In those cases, you really need to completely review 
the whole project to make sure it will satisfy organizational objectives. The 
other ninety-nine times out of a hundred, what really changed was more like 
staffing for the project, or timelines, or (our favorites) funding and priority. In 
those cases, the original plan is still the path to success; you’ll need to make 
sure that management knows that new obstacles have been placed in the way 
of your project. They should also be made aware that the original plan was 
carefully considered, and the resource changes that happened mid-course 
are threatening the eventual success of the biometric project (which is still 
directly linked to the success of specific business objectives).

 Chapter 14: Ten Essentials for Biometrics Success
Be Flexible
Be flexible is really the corollary to “Stick to the Plan” and not the opposite. A 
really great plan will anticipate some of the kinds of kinks that come up in the 
execution of the plan, and allow flexibility without deviation from the final 
project goals.
A lack of flexibility in the plan, or in the execution of the plan, can be almost 
as damaging to the success of a project as a total lack of a plan. In a perfect 
world, the circumstances of your biometrics project will exactly match the 
assumptions made during the planning process, and every detail of the plan 
will execute exactly the way it was committed to paper — without deviation, 
delay, or lack of crossed t or dotted i. We’ve never lived in a perfect world, 
though; when implementing a technology that’s as new on the scene (and as 
fast-developing) as biometrics, the chances of everything happening exactly 
the way we expect are near zero.
 
How do you balance adherence to a good plan with flexibility? As a part of 
your plan, implement the following concepts:
 
 A formal change-control policy with a review process for proposed 
changes to the plan
 
 An approval process for stuff that makes it through review
 
 A process for examining the effects of the change once it’s in place
If your plan anticipates and accommodates changes in a formal way, changes 
can be a part of the plan.
Research the Problem
Here’s an effective way to build on the idea that the whole reason you’re 
contemplating a new biometric solution is to meet an organizational require-
ment: Express the problem in familiar business terms, like this:
We need a way to accurately and effectively identify personnel in access-
management situations.
There is an excellent chance that your organization is not the first one to 
encounter such a problem, and that others have already done a fair amount 
of work toward understanding the nature of the particular problem you’re 
trying to solve. And they probably have something to say about it.

230
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
In some rare cases, the problem may be entirely unique to your organization 
and nobody has anything to say about it. You can still increase your chances 
of success greatly if you do some research into the basics of the problem 
before you start thumbing through the catalog for solutions.
For example, suppose you work in health care and you’ve been told that the 
doctors are sharing their credentials with their administrative staff, so you 
never know who really logged in to look at a patient record — it always 
shows up as the doctor. (Maybe this situation came to a head when the 
systems showed that the doctor accessed a patient’s information when you 
know the doctor was on a cold-air balloon flight across the Pacific Ocean.) In 
this case, you know that biometrics is a good way to tie authentication to a 
particular individual, so you’ve started thinking about some kind of biometric 
solution to this problem.
Additionally, suppose you like fingerprint readers because they’re inexpen-
sive and readily available; you’ve tossed out that idea, though, because many 
workers have to be authenticated while wearing latex gloves — and clearly 
that won’t work. A little bit of online research will show that there are actually 
several fingerprint readers that work just fine through latex gloves — because 
many people have found themselves in your situation, and manufacturers 
have moved to fill the need.
In some cases, you will also find while researching the basic problem that 
other people have solved the same problem without the use of biometrics. 
Depending on the solution, that can be the best discovery of all, since it 
might save the organization the expense of the biometrics project entirely. 
Sometimes success in information technology means finding another,
simpler way to accomplish the original goals that may not even be 
technology-related.
Research the Solution
Given that you have researched the problem and that you understand the 
parameters of the problem well, the next obvious way to improve your 
chances for success is to identify some potential solutions and do some 
research into each of them to really understand the differences and potential 
implications of choosing each of them.
For example, you know you’d like to use a technology that has as little impact 
to the user as possible, but is accurate to 99.99 percent, so only one person 
in 10,000 would be accepted when he or she shouldn’t have been. You figure 
that since you’re using this solution for authentication rather than identifica-
tion, chances for a false acceptance are even lower than the 1-in-10,000 and 

231
 Chapter 14: Ten Essentials for Biometrics Success
that will work for you. While identifying several nonintrusive methods, you 
decide you like facial recognition, gait recognition, and iris recognition as 
your favorite candidates. You toss out gait immediately, because it doesn’t 
have the accuracy you require and is typically used for identification rather 
than authentication. After further research, you also toss out facial recogni-
tion — even though the manufacturer “guarantees” the level of accuracy that 
you require — because your research led you to discover that there’s enough 
similarity within some family groups to skew the False Acceptance Rates for 
facial recognition, and the installation is a high-tech home with specific 
access rules for family members. Iris recognition for the game room it is!
A complete understanding of the peculiarities of the biometric solutions 
you’re considering is a requirement for success — and biometrics sometimes 
have some pretty odd quirks.
Don’t Get Fancy
Given two solutions, each of which solves the same problem equally well, 
which solution is the least likely to get you paged at home on a weekend in 
the middle of something fun? The answer is always the simplest solution.
Biometric solutions can be as complicated as a multi-site, multi-modal system 
that does identification, tracking, and authentication — watching your gait to 
guess who you are while you walk up to the iris-recognition system that per-
forms a faster search of the iris database. (What do you do for a living? No, 
on second thought, don’t tell us.) They can also be as simple as a finger 
swipe on a laptop to log you in.
When purchasing technology, there’s always a tradeoff between two 
competing concerns:
 
 Getting something sophisticated enough to meet the needs of the organi-
zation, even as its anticipated growth sprouts additional needs
 
 Providing a simple, inexpensive solution that meets the current need
Both are valid viewpoints, but you should ask yourself the following questions:
 
 Will you outgrow the technology before it becomes technologically 
obsolete anyway? If not, buy the cheaper, gets-it-done-now version.
 
 How hard and/or expensive is it to upgrade to something better if and 
when you need to?

232
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
 How good is your organization at predicting growth and future needs? 
Are you confident you know how long the basic system would last?
 
 What are the chances that the next iteration of this problem will require 
a different solution entirely — in which case, you’ll have wasted the 
money spent on flexibility and growth planning?
The simpler you can make your biometric solution — while still meeting 
current needs, anticipated growth, and additional requirements — the better 
you’ll sleep at night, and the more money will be available for bonuses at the 
end of the year.
Talk to People with Working 
Installations
You might think of this as an extension of the “Research the Solution” topic 
earlier in the chapter, but it’s actually much more than that. Unless you’re 
riding the bleeding edge and implementing the newest technology well before 
anyone else, there’s an excellent chance that you can get in touch with 
other people who have already made huge mistakes in implementing bio-
metric systems — and find out what those mistakes were so you can avoid 
repeating them.
Of course, you should also include a discussion of exactly what those folks 
did right, and try to re-create those moments if they apply to your project. Be 
aware, though, that most people don’t remember when everything went per-
fectly nearly so well as they remember when parts were flying through the air 
and the fire trucks were still ten minutes out.
 
The problem with starting up a conversation about someone else’s painful 
moments is that if they don’t already know you well, they might be a little 
reluctant to recount they day they almost got fired. The best way to resolve 
this dilemma is to get to know a bunch of people who do jobs similar to yours, 
long before you need to ask them these questions. There are lots of groups 
out there organized around meeting and discussing information security 
among peers. We strongly advise that you find one you’re comfortable with, 
and spend some time getting to know those folks; not only will they become a 
valuable information resource, you can rest assured that somebody some-
where actually knows what you’re talking about.

233
 Chapter 14: Ten Essentials for Biometrics Success
Do Not “Fire and Forget”
The final item in this list of ways to succeed is to pay attention to how your 
biometric system is doing after the installation. For most projects, you’ll 
spend a lot of time preparing for the first day of operation, making sure that 
it will come off without a hitch, making sure that all the work you’ve done in 
selecting and implementing your biometric solution comes together in a 
blinding flash of absolute perfection. (Good luck with that.)
Keep in mind that for most of the users of the system, the first day is just 
that — a day like any other day, but one that required them to learn a new 
biometric system and start using it. Depending on the system, they’ll go on to 
use it several more times that day, and then hundreds of times over the next 
few months. The fact that it worked perfectly on the day it was installed will 
pale in comparison to the multiple annoying failures they have to endure 
after that brief shining moment — unless you’re paying attention to the 
system right along.
Not every technology will immediately start to deteriorate while you watch, 
but a lot of them do. A successful biometric installation will be one that 
catches new problems quickly as they crop up, and deals with them efficient-
ly. In most organizations, once you design and build a solution, you own 
all the problems attached to that solution until you move on to new 
employment — and in some cases, users will still track you down and ask 
questions.
 
The perceived success of the system in the minds of users will be how well it 
works over time, so do yourself a favor and heed these two tips after that first 
day of deployment:
 
 Watch the installation carefully for the first month or so, noting trends 
in false rejects, failures to enroll, and any other biometrically unique 
attribute that seems to be drifting or careening out of control.
 
 Watch resource utilization at the levels of individual computer and net-
work; make sure they’re running well and won’t exhaust their available 
resources any time soon.

Chapter 15
Ten Biometrics Scenarios 
to Plan For
In This Chapter
 Surveying some common uses
 Watching out for pitfalls
 Dreaming up uncommon uses
B
iometrics encompasses a pretty large field of study, and there are a lot 
more use scenarios than you might think. In this chapter, we consider 
some of the common use scenarios, some possible pitfall scenarios for bio-
metrics, and some uncommon, but interesting, uses of biometrics technology.
Alternate Entryway Access
If your building has a lobby with either a security guard or receptionist, you 
may have no need for a biometric entry control for the lobby. Depending on 
the size of the company and the size of the building, the person at the desk 
may recognize everyone who has a legitimate need for access. Even if that 
isn’t the case, there isn’t really any way for an unauthorized person to know 
for sure which personnel the person at the desk knows or doesn’t know — so 
a human being is still a pretty decent deterrent to attempted unauthorized 
entry. Only in the most risk-averse companies with very high security require-
ments will you see biometric entry systems in the lobby or front entrance.
Side entrances and parking lots are a different matter entirely. Most side 
entrances and parking-lot elevators have no human supervision, so anyone 
who happens to know the door code from watching someone else punch it in 
(or has a proximity card picked up from the parking lot) would be able to 
gain access to the facility.

236
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
If you use even a simple fingerprint scanner at side doors or parking-lot eleva-
tors, you greatly reduce the likelihood that someone can get into the facility 
with stolen credentials.
High-Security Hosting
In some cases, even with a security guard at the door, so many people require 
access to a facility — and the access list has such high turnover — that it’s 
impossible for even for a great security guard to remember everyone who 
should be allowed in. Even someone with a great memory for such things 
can’t be expected to know (say) that Johnny was just fired an hour ago, and 
we don’t want him allowed back into the building, especially if he’s mad.
There are probably many examples of this sort of thing, but the one we 
encounter most often is entry access to computer-network hosting facilities. 
In these scenarios, a hosting company offers rack space, network connec-
tions, environmental controls, and power to customers who want to host 
services at such a facility instead of building it themselves. Since the hosting 
provider has a lot of customers, and one of the things they are providing to 
customers is physical security for the servers, they carefully control who has 
access to the hosting floor.
Each customer submits a list of people who are allowed to enter the facility 
on their behalf, updating that list as people are hired and as they leave the 
company. The hosting company, in turn, is expected to only allow authorized 
persons into the facility. The hosting company has really only two options for 
accomplishing this goal:
Keypad insecurity
Keypads can be reasonably good access 
security in some circumstances, but there are 
a lot of things that can go wrong with keypads 
to make them far less secure. For example, 
if everyone uses the same code, not only is 
it likely to get scribbled on a scrap of paper 
and lost, the actual keys used for that shared 
code will become more worn unless changed 
weekly. Our favorite keypads to break into are 
the shiny-surfaced ones or touchpad screens, 
since you can see what keys folks are using by 
just adjusting the lighting. You may not know 
the order, but you’ve dropped the number of 
combinations you have to try to a manageable 
number.

237
 Chapter 15: Ten Biometrics Scenarios to Plan For
 
 Keep a list of authorized persons and manually check each incoming 
person’s identification (usually a photo ID).
 
 Keep the same list in the form of enrolled biometrics and have the system 
sort people out.
Either way, you’re using biometrics, but manual verification takes too much 
time (besides, it’s not as impressive when you’re showing the facility to pro-
spective clients).
 
We’ve used the example of a hosting company here, but really any place 
that performs high-throughput authentication for third parties is a good 
candidate for this scenario. If you’re in that situation, just make sure that the 
processes for adding and deleting authorized personnel are simple, efficient, 
and prompt.
Port-of-Entry Identification
Port-of-entry scenarios are a bit like high-security hosting, only on a massively 
larger scale, and without the advantage of a master list of authorized persons. 
The traditional port-of-entry system involves the use of a hard to duplicate 
identification (a passport) which users carry with them. Manual biometrics 
are accomplished when the officer at the gate compares the passport picture 
with the person presenting it. This system depends to a large degree on how 
hard it is to modify or create a passport without being detected.
 
One of the simplest ways to use biometrics to assist in this process is to 
include electronics with the passport itself so it has these two features:
 
 An electronic key to verify that the information on the passport was 
encrypted using a key belonging to the country of origin.
 
 Encrypted biometric data that can be compared to the biometrics of the 
person presenting the passport.
This system isn’t perfect, but it does make the data somewhat harder to 
forge — and still doesn’t require a master database. 
Another port-of-entry concern is the identification of persons known to be on 
watchlists, or those who have been expelled from the country for some 
reason. In these cases, it’s often possible to collect biometric information 
from the subjects — with or without their cooperation — and then use that 
information to identify them as they try to cross the border. This scenario 
does require a master list of persons and their biometrics, but it’s much 
smaller than the list of everyone on Earth who might decide to travel.

238
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Law Enforcement
We don’t always think of law enforcement when we consider biometrics 
scenarios, but law-enforcement uses probably constitute 90 percent or more 
of the known applications for biometric technology. Law-enforcement agen-
cies use biometrics in the same way as any organization with a need for high 
levels of security and accountability, but their use of biometrics for authenti-
cation are much the same as those in use by everyone else.
It’s the use of biometrics for identification that distinguishes law enforcement 
from most other use cases. For many years now, law enforcement has used 
fingerprints collected at crime scenes to later establish the identity of the 
person holding the knife, gun, or pogo stick when the crime occurred. More 
recently, police have been able to use blood and other biological evidence 
they collect to identify persons through DNA comparisons. Although these 
uses are also part of biometrics, they’re pretty well known by anyone who 
watches crime shows on television.
The more interesting biometric scenarios in law enforcement these days 
involve the use of images collected from sources such as ATM cameras, 
surveillance video, and private citizens with cameras to identify people using 
facial recognition, gait recognition, and even body-mass-and-movement bio-
metrics. Although many of these techniques are not nearly accurate enough 
for an identification that would hold up in court, they are useful tools to help 
eliminate some suspects and spotlight others to guide an investigation.
If you ever wonder just how much potential biometric information is being 
collected from you on a given day that could be used in this way, take a look 
around when you’re walking through parking lots or checking out at the 
store — and smile nicely to the ATM camera behind the dark plastic. Some 
cities in some neighborhoods even have police video cameras watching 
public places.
That Biometric Doesn’t Work for Me
Depending on the size of your user population and how long you operate a 
biometric solution, this scenario will present itself sooner or later. Some of 
these situations you probably anticipated — where, for some reason, the spe-
cific biometric you’re capturing just doesn’t apply to someone because the 
right hand (or other required body part) is either missing or just doesn’t con-
form to the parameters that the biometric system expects.

239
 Chapter 15: Ten Biometrics Scenarios to Plan For
The scenarios that will surprise you (or would have if you’d skipped this 
chapter) are where everything physically seems okay, but the biometric mea-
surement nearly always fails for a specific person. The problem is that there’s 
a pretty broad variation across our species, and some measurements make a 
lot of assumptions that are based on statistical norms. Two examples of par-
ticular biometrics methods that don’t work well for all people are
 
 Fingerprinting: Some people just don’t fingerprint well. A good print is 
taken from a finger with deep furrows and good color contrast — but if 
your furrows are shallow or your fingertip color isn’t contrasting well 
enough with the light source, it could be almost impossible to get a 
usable fingerprint from you.
 
 Signature recognition: This is another example of a biometric that works 
well for some people and not for others. Both of your authors have a 
constant battle with keeping their signatures consistent enough so banks 
and credit-card companies don’t start rejecting their transactions.
About all we can say about this scenario is that if you’re in charge of making 
the biometric solution work, you will need to make accommodations for 
people who aren’t able to use the system.
I Object to the Invasion of My Privacy
We don’t have any silver bullet for this objection to the implementation of 
biometrics, but it’s a scenario you need to be prepared for. Keep in mind that 
not everyone will have the same perspective as you on biometrics, and there 
are a lot of well respected security analysts that have gone on record object-
ing to the widespread use of biometric information. People who express this 
concern are not crazy Luddites who want the whole computer society thing 
to just go away (well, okay, not all of them are). Some are thoughtful people 
who have put a lot of that thought into the subject — and feel that collecting 
and storing biometric information about them is a personal violation of 
their privacy.
In such cases, it may help to get to the practical root of the problem. Ask 
folks exactly what bothers them about the fingerprint scanner and database; 
the idea is to fully understand their concerns and try to address them. Here’s 
an example of the sort of worry you may hear voiced: What if the stored bio-
metric data could be used to create a false version of the same biometric 
data (such as fingerprints) — and somebody does that, goes down to the 
dealership, and uses that data to okay the purchase of a new Ferrari? If your 
company and the Ferrari dealership use the exact same technology, and the 
car thief can steal the fingerprint database — and then inject the correct 
record into the transaction while the dealer watches — then the thief might 
drive off the lot with your user’s retirement.

240
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Scary? Sure. But the actual risk of that happening is small, for the following 
reasons:
 
 How biometric data is stored. Often very specific to the equipment used, 
making it impossible to recreate a print or other biometric original, just 
a record of the information details.
 
 You have to inject the stolen biometrics into exactly the right place in 
the system at exactly the right time to fool it into thinking you’re some-
one else.
 
 You still have to convince the dealer, the credit-card company, and a lot 
of other folks that you’re someone else by using a fake ID and some 
fancy talking.
It’s not impossible for the worst case scenarios to come about, but for now 
there are far easier ways to steal someone’s identity than stealing and using 
biometric information — and, for that matter, easier ways to steal biometric 
information than hacking into the database (such as photographing someone 
or picking up fingerprints from a discarded drink container). We discuss 
addressing users’ concerns in this area in greater detail in Chapter 8.
If the argument is more philosophical than practical, we can’t help you much 
there except to suggest debate classes.
We Found Malware on the Biometric 
Database Server
There’s a raging debate in information-security circles as to exactly what it 
means to discover malware on a server that contains sensitive information. 
This scenario happens hundreds or thousands of times each day around the 
world, and it may trash you least if you’ve already considered what it means 
to you — and how you would prefer to handle it.
The problem in this scenario is what you don’t know: Suppose you’ve just dis-
covered that a program with some sort of ill intent has been installed on a 
system containing your biometric database, and you don’t know for sure 
what that program code may have done, or had access to. In the worst-case 
scenario, it granted hackers direct access to that server (and possibly the 
rest of your network) and the hackers downloaded all the information to see 
what they could do with it. All the information on that system may be in the 
hands of someone that intends to do you harm.

241
 Chapter 15: Ten Biometrics Scenarios to Plan For
The debate mainly circles around the concept that the existence of malware 
on the host does not imply or in any way guarantee that information was 
compromised. If the information was not compromised, all you need to do is 
eliminate the malware and you’re good to go. The other side of that coin is 
that since it could all be exposed, you need to act as though it actually was.
Our perspective on this scenario is that it all depends. Ask yourself these 
questions:
 
 What are the security requirements for the installation?
 
 What is the legal, regulatory, and public relations environment for the 
organization?
 
 If the malware is well known to the antivirus/antispyware community, do 
you also know what it really does?
If you can answer those questions, you’ll have a much better picture of what 
to do in this scenario.
Biometric Readers in Objects
Since biometrics can be a good way to grant authorized access to stuff, why 
not put biometrics into actual stuff we want to control access to — such as, 
say, credit cards? It might sound a little futuristic and farfetched, but a 
Danish firm — Scanecotech A/S — developed exactly this technology. More 
interesting than its specific application though is the thought that if you can 
embed biometric readers into something as small and thin as a credit card, 
it’s possible to consider using biometric authentication for almost any object 
or device.
For example, some of the high-end portable music and video players are 
magnets for theft because they are small and very valuable, and the same 
goes for portable GPS receivers, cell phones, and cameras. It would likely 
deter theft a bit if the device wasn’t accessible without a biometric login, and 
bypass techniques all set off the autodestruct (nothing big, just a good 
memory meltdown). If a thief had no chance to get a working unit, there’s 
really no reason to steal it.
In the case of cell phones, there’s an added dimension to the idea of having a 
biometric reader on the phone, which is the ability to authenticate transac-
tions enabled by the phone either as a network connected device or as a 
cellular phone.

242
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
As a connected network device, the phone can operate just like any other 
biometric scanner you might have on your network, only this one is portable. 
A transaction that was initiated via a network-aware program on the phone 
or a web browser on the phone could be authenticated by asking the user to 
present their biometric information at the proper time.
As a cellular phone, a typical phone tree transaction (‘press 2 to buy the 
Ferrari’) could at some point also be authenticated by asking the user to 
present their biometric information. In the case of a cellular telephony trans-
action, the biometric authentication would likely trigger a DTMF number 
sequence (Dual-tone multi-frequency — the sounds the phone makes when 
you touch a number, which would work like touching the numbers on the 
keypad) that corresponds to an authorization code.
Behavioral Biometric Driving Sensors
Some kinds of behavioral biometrics can identify someone through that 
person’s interaction with a system entirely unrelated to identification or 
authentication. Examples include driving, typing, or even just watching how 
you move a mouse to accomplish routine computer tasks. Depending on the 
measurement, the sample size, and the reliability of the specific biometric, 
these identification events can be more or less accurate.
Sometimes accuracy is not critical to a particular use of biometrics, and the 
more important concern is to prevent the biometric measurement from 
having any significant impact on the user. As a good example of that, imagine 
a biometric system built into a family car. The system watches how you drive, 
brake, signal, and even steer so it knows and understands who is behind the 
wheel. Since the list of enrolled drivers is small, the system doesn’t have to 
make very many comparisons, and if the system’s purpose is to help decide 
what music to play from the on-board mp3 collection, making the wrong 
decision won’t have all that big an impact (unless it decides that you “are” 
your teenage son and chooses music and volume levels to match . . .).
In the driving scenario, you could even have the system perform more com-
plex decisions such as ensuring that there is someone of adult size in the 
passenger seat when the teenager is driving, or having the inboard cellular 
phone start calling you when someone completely unknown seems to be 
driving the car. Doubtless we’ll see other scenarios where biometrics can be 
applied for identification purposes and then used to perform low-impact but 
helpful actions.

243
 Chapter 15: Ten Biometrics Scenarios to Plan For
Biometric Neighborhood Watch
Have you ever lived in a neighborhood with a well-organized neighborhood 
watch? Some people like the idea, and it makes them feel more secure know-
ing that neighbors are keeping an eye on things even when they’re not at 
home. On the other hand, the very idea that folks are watching what’s going 
on and taking notes really creeps some people out.
We haven’t seriously seen anyone considering the idea of a biometrically 
enhanced neighborhood-watch program, but as a concept it actually might 
help alleviate the creepiness factor a bit. Instead of retired folks with binocu-
lars sweeping the ’hood for strange activity, you could have video cameras 
watching public places and identifying strangers. A learning system would 
even figure out that people who walk through your neighborhood to the bus 
stop every morning at 8:00 a.m. are not strangers, but those same people 
walking down the alley at 2:00 a.m. are strange to that place and time.
The monitoring and collection of this kind of data is one thing, but it’s what 
you do with it that makes this a scary neighborhood with cameras watching 
your every move, or a safe place where criminals learn not to hang out. For 
example, you could choose not to even record video that depicts well-known 
people in places where we expect to see them — and only record strangers 
or unfamiliar people in particular places, at times when you don’t expect to 
see them. Further, the policy could be that even the footage of strangers 
doesn’t get looked at until someone notifies the watch that something 
specific happened and there is footage recorded for that time and place.

A
ll too common when a new technology becomes popular, it gets plugged 
into any technological nook or cranny that anyone with a budget can 
imagine. In most cases, that frenzy leads to some level of overload — for 
information-technology professionals and for users (is anyone else tired of 
using Flash to fill out a simple Web form yet?). Biometric technologies are not 
immune to over-application, but there are some clear benefits to using 
biometrics in the appropriate situations.
Here, we list benefits to authentication and identification that are unique 
to biometrics, as well as benefits with wider impact than just identification 
and authentication.
Cooperation Not Required
In some cases, you need to identify or authenticate persons who may not be 
much interested in helping you with the process. For example, you might be 
screening for wanted felons at the entry to a ballgame with facial recognition, 
or looking for known assassins at a government function using gait recogni-
tion from surveillance video. The key here is that you can accomplish the 
identification while the person being identified is actively trying to conceal it.
This is a characteristic that’s really unique to biometrics in that biometrics 
are something that is a part of you, and about the only way to escape bio-
metric identification is to somehow change that part of your appearance or 
actions. Some biometric techniques — such as facial thermography and 
certain behavioral biometrics — are pretty good at seeing right through 
disguises. That’s because they aren’t looking at surface features at all.

246
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
In the “not as beneficial to society” column is the idea of using this same 
concept in public spaces (such as shopping malls and retail stores) to 
identify previous customers and send a salesperson over that way to do 
some directed marketing. Imagine the following conversation from a 
salesperson five minutes after you walk in the door of a nationwide clothier, 
2,000 miles from your original purchase; “How’s that new black suit you 
bought last February, Mr. Smith? It would really look great with these silver 
cufflinks, don’t you think?” Creepy, to say the least.
Guarantees Physical Location
Biometric technology requires the presence of the actual person associated 
with the specific biometric measurements at the biometric sensor. As long as 
you know for sure where your sensors are, you will always know exactly 
where someone was when that person was authenticated (or identified him-
self or herself) using that sensor. Because of that requirement, it’s possible to 
use biometrics in places where you have to make sure the users cannot later 
claim they “were never there” and “did not authorize” actions taken in their 
names. This concept of non-repudiation is important to financial transactions, 
military orders, and really any place where someone might suffer a change of 
mind later and not really want to accept responsibility for a damaging action 
that someone (guess who?) performed.
Biometrics can accomplish the task of non-repudiation in a couple of differ-
ent ways — each creating a different level of confidence in the action:
 
 Using biometrics as an authentication method to prove that the people 
logging in are who they say they are.
 
 After logging in, users then go about their tasks, and the system makes 
three assumptions:
 
• The person who logged in is the authenticated user.
 
• The person who logged in is present.
 
• The person who logged in is responsible for each action taken by 
the authenticated user.
 
 
This method has a weakness: The authenticated user may have walked 
away from his or her workstation after the initial authentication, allow-
ing someone else to take action using the authenticated identity. For 
high-value and high-importance transactions (like stock trades), you 
might have the user authenticate again to approve the transaction.
 
 Special actions that require non-repudiation require the user to 
submit biometric information when initiating the action.

247
 Chapter 16: Ten Benefits of Biometrics
 
 This method has a better confidence level because notwithstanding the 
initial login, ensuring that the expected person is still in control of the 
workstation at the time of the special action. It’s hard to claim (for exam-
ple) that you “weren’t there” when 30,000 shares of stock were pur-
chased if we can prove that your living finger, eyeball, or hand veins 
were there.
High-Throughput
When you consider the many alternative methods used to authenticate or 
identify people, especially where there is some danger of fraud or false 
identification, biometrics quickly rises to the top of the list for being able to 
process lots of persons’ identities very accurately.
Passwords are not typically used in such scenarios, because they can be 
stolen or shared. Also, typing in a password of sufficient length or complexity 
takes a lot longer than swiping a finger or palm against a scanner — and that’s 
not even taking into account shy password syndrome, where people flub their 
password two or three times in a row, just because they’re under pressure or 
being watched.
Manual comparison of photo ID is the only other method that is typically used 
in high-throughput scenarios where accuracy in authenticity is important. 
First, even manual comparison to a photo ID is a form of biometric authentica-
tion — it’s just not quite as accurate or as good at spotting deception as a 
good fingerprint or iris-recognition system.
High-throughout identification systems are another story entirely. When 
the identity of a subject is assumed to be unknown and the population 
to be searched is larger than a few dozen people, automated biometric 
identification systems are really the only choice that works. For instance, 
spotting known terrorists via facial recognition at airports and other 
transportation centers — or making sure that everyone walking around in a 
secure area is really authorized to be there — is possible with gait, facial, or 
even iris identification.
Unforgettable
Most people have more than one account with corresponding usernames, 
passwords or Personal Identification Numbers (PINs). At the very least, if you 
aren’t retired, you have a work login and a PIN for your ATM card. For people 
who work in information technology, the number of accounts and passwords 

248
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
to remember can be closer to seven or eight, with no real upper limit. If you 
routinely shop online or participate in members-only online communities, 
you could have dozens of accounts.
The problem with having lots of accounts is that there’s a strong temptation 
to do something that most security folks would consider to be very insecure — 
namely, to use the same password on as many of the accounts as possible. 
The problem with this practice is that if attackers can figure out the password 
for any one of your accounts, then they automatically have access to many 
(or all) of your accounts.
 
The best practice is to choose complex passwords for each account that 
aren’t related to any human language (nope, not even to Orc, Klingon, or 
Hobbit), never write them down anywhere, and change them periodically.
A real benefit of using biometrics to authenticate users instead of passwords 
is that the user gets to use the same “password” for multiple accounts with-
out compromising security. Since the biometric is always with the user and 
really unusable by anyone else, an attacker doesn’t gain anything by knowing 
that the same right index finger, eyeball, or hand-vein pattern is used to log in 
to multiple accounts. Sure, an injection attack that steals the data as it’s being 
transmitted from the sensor and then re-injects the data into another system 
might be successful, but if your attacker is that sophisticated and has that 
much access to your network already, it’s safe to assume you’re already 
using encrypted connections for the biometric scanners, right?
The use of biometrics allows users to have multiple accounts and use the 
same biometric measurement for each, or even different biometrics for each 
and still not have to remember multiple passwords. Making it easy for users 
to operate in the most secure fashion is always a benefit to both the users 
and the organization.
Unlosable
Not all forms of authentication are passwords. Some are physical, such as
 
 Proximity cards that activate door entry systems when waved over the 
sensor pad
 
 One-time password tokens that display a password that can be used 
only once
 
 USB keys that allow access to systems when they’re physically 
plugged in

249
 Chapter 16: Ten Benefits of Biometrics
Unlike these objects — which might accidentally end up in the washing 
machine, dog’s chewy-bits pile, or at the bottom of the ocean, lake, or coffee 
cup — your biometric measurements are much harder to lose. Another plus: 
They’re pretty much never just misplaced (of course, maybe the phrase 
“he’d forget his index finger if it wasn’t screwed on” will catch on in the age 
of biometrics).
The various situations mentioned in the preceding paragraph have all hap-
pened to the authors, so we can say from experience that losing the item that 
authenticates you to various aspects of your job is inconvenient at best and 
semi- to completely disastrous at worst. For example, while watching the USB 
key do a triple flip from the center console of the car into the coffee (intended 
to keep him awake at 2:00 a.m. while he fixed the Web server for a client), 
Mike was reminded that a good biometric server-access system would have 
meant not having to call his client at 2:00 a.m. on a Monday.
Unsharable
People share access codes to systems. You can explain until you’re blue in 
the face that it’s not really a good idea and that your organization requires 
individual accountability for each person and the responses will range from: 
“Yeah, but it’s more convenient to give my admin my password than to figure 
out how to give him access to the files he needs . . .” to “I’m busy trying to 
make money for this company, and this person (with whom I share my 
account) is helping me. How important can this really be?”
In some environments — health care, for example — sharing accounts and 
access codes is legally forbidden and punishable by fines (or even stronger 
sanctions if the circumstances warrant). In any organization, at the very least, 
it’s a sloppy practice that can lead to serious confusion when trying to track 
the actions of an individual for personnel, forensic, or other reasons. The 
mechanisms for sharing are many, including telling others your password or 
letting them borrow your ID badge or authentication token.
 
One of the few ways to effectively combat this practice technologically is to 
use biometrics as a primary authentication method. Sure, you can still allow 
someone to use your login by walking over and logging them in, but at that 
point it probably becomes more inconvenient to share a login than to just 
share the required resources the right way.

250
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Cost Reduction
Biometrics systems are not simple or inexpensive to install, but applied cor-
rectly they can realize significant cost reductions in several areas. Two 
places where you can look for these savings are
 
 Improved compliance to company policies: Companies that pay hourly 
frequently have a problem known as buddy punching. This is the practice 
of having one of your buddies grab your timecard and punch you in, 
even though you’re running a little late for work. Both of you punch in 
promptly at 8:00 a.m., and you arrive at a more leisurely 8:55 to begin 
your shift. In the mean time, the company is paying for an hour of your 
time that you were not really at work. This is a common enough problem 
that biometric timecard systems are a readily available item. Employees 
might grumble a bit about trust, but it’s hard to argue against the point 
that these systems are completely fair to both sides.
 
 Reduced workloads for some IT areas: Another way that a company 
can see cost savings by using biometric systems for authentication is 
through a reduction in time spent on password resets or replacing one-
time password tokens. Every time a user forgets his or her password 
(or flubs it enough times to get locked out of the system), a phone call to 
the helpdesk is involved. The helpdesk then has to verify that callers are 
who they say they are, and then spend a few moments resetting that 
pesky password or account. In the case of a lost token, there’s a direct 
cost of around $70 to $120, and a somewhat longer, more involved call 
to the helpdesk.
By using biometrics, you eliminate the forgotten-password calls and lost 
tokens — and should greatly reduce the number of lockouts (or you need to 
adjust the system for too many false rejections). Fewer calls to the helpdesk 
means less helpdesk expense (or more helpdesk productivity, which is 
almost the same), as well as not having to replace lost or destroyed tokens. 
Next best thing to money in the bank.
Compliance
Virtually all regulation directed towards making data protection more 
effective addresses access controls. The people who wrote regulations have 
gotten this pretty much correct: Passwords are a very weak link that is 
protecting some highly valuable and sensitive information.
Many regulations, including PCI, require two-factor authentication for admin-
istrative access, and in many cases even for end-user (non-administrative) 
access. While tokens and digital certificates qualify as two-factor, biometrics 

251
 Chapter 16: Ten Benefits of Biometrics
are a heavy favorite, particularly since it’s far more difficult for a user to lose 
his or her finger or eyeball than a security token.
Given the growing popularity of biometrics for access controls, if your 
current regulation doesn’t require biometrics today, it still might someday.
Emergency Identification
There are times when persons need to be identified, but are in no position 
to assist with the process. In some ways, this is a little bit like dealing 
with uncooperative persons, except here we’re talking about people who 
are incapacitated.
In the case of an unconscious or incapacitated person in need of medical 
help, proper identification is sometimes critical to saving that person’s life — 
and you can’t always count on finding some form of identification on the 
victim. For example, someone struck by a car while riding a bicycle may not 
have ID on his or her person; for that matter, homeless people often have no 
ID with them at any given time.
Although biometrics has a tremendous potential to help in these situations, 
we currently have no national database that could be used for such a 
purpose. There are discussions about how to generate health-care records 
that would include such information strictly for use in health care — but 
serious privacy questions will need to be answered before this problem can 
really be solved.
No Identity Theft
This benefit is pretty obvious, given the nature of biometric authentication 
and identification, but since identity theft is the fastest growing crime in 
America — possibly the world — we thought it was worth separate 
mention here.
Identity theft depends on a thief being able to use enough private information 
about you to impersonate you and use your credit, as well as other assets. 
The typical approach is to apply for credit using your correct name, Social 
Security number, and other information, providing an address that the thief 
controls as the billing address. The faker then receives credit cards, checks 
from your bank, and other financial instruments at that address.
One of the biggest faults in the system here is that the organization issuing 
credit or other financial documents is not sufficiently authenticating the 
person applying for credit in your name. Instead, someone in-house who 

252
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
should know better is using information that is assumed to be private and 
known only to you (such as your Social Security number and mother’s 
maiden name). Since these items can often be found in dumpsters, online, 
and a host of other public places, that assumption doesn’t hold nearly as well 
as we’d like.
If we introduce any level of biometric authentication into this process — and 
we are careful about the registration process — stealing identities suddenly 
becomes a whole lot harder. Pretty simple, huh?
In practice, credit-card companies are so focused on getting new cards into 
the hands of eager consumers of credit that they would never consider 
putting a biometric registration and authentication process in place. Doing so 
would seriously slow down the frantic pace of card issuance and revenue. We 
aren’t being cynical here — honest — we’re paraphrasing from actual 
conversations we’ve had with card companies. The money they make from 
new customers more than offsets the money they lose from identity theft, so 
they don’t feel a need to change the system.
Coolness
Let’s face it. Biometrics are just cool. Walking up to a door, glancing at the 
camera and having the door open because your iris was a registered user of 
the system is James Bondian no matter how you, uh, look at it. Houses that 
vary the room temperature based on knowing who is in the room, computers 
that black out portions of the screen because they recognize that the person 
looking over your shoulder isn’t allowed to read those parts, refrigerators 
that allow the teenager to grab a midnight snack, but remind you of your diet 
and remain locked to you at that hour — all super-cool stuff.
The thing is, the stuff we’ve listed here isn’t even scratching the surface of all 
the cool things we’re likely to see from biometric identification and authenti-
cation systems. These technologies have only been in use for a short time 
and have yet to see really mainstream applications, so we’re just using our 
limited imaginations to describe a world where computers, refrigerators, 
children’s toys, and ATMs all know who we are when we walk up and con-
sider using them.
Sure, there are privacy issues, they aren’t perfectly accurate and some aren’t 
the most convenient to use — but that doesn’t really detract much for their 
coolness. We’re confident that all these issues will be addressed (as well as 
additional ones we haven’t considered yet), to allow a technology with such 
potentially positive impact on our lives to progress — and allow our coffee 
makers to address us by name in the morning and make our coffee the way 
we like it.

We’ve tucked in an appendix for IT professionals who

technology is one of those “convergence” technologies 
that brings together security pros in the IT and physical/
facilities professions.
The world of biometrics practically has its own 
language — and sometimes you just have to talk the 
talk. Because we don’t want you getting tripped up in it, 
we’ve included a listing of the key terms that you’ll

oth authors were avid readers in their youth, and enjoyed poring 
over statistics, specifications, and product-comparison charts. We 
recognize and appreciate the unfamiliarity of a new technology, and how a 
visual and graphic comparison can help the reader easily understand 
the differences and similarities of various technologies — in this case, 
biometrics technologies.
The two-page chart in this appendix compares most of the biometrics 
technologies discussed in this book — in particular, their costs and other 
factors — all in one place.
You should use this chart to help clarify your practical understanding of how 
different biometrics technologies compare to each other, but not as the sole 
means for choosing a technology. If you’re considering biometrics as a tool 
for better control of access to computers or physical spaces, this chart might 
help you easily eliminate technologies that would be a poor fit. (Note: In the 
chart, H=High; M=Medium; L=Low.)
If you’re doing some of your comparison shopping here, then we suggest 
that — after you’ve narrowed the field to a few types of biometrics 
technology — you turn to the chapter(s) that describe those biometrics in 
more detail. Those chapters are

Column definitions
Here are the descriptions of the columns in the tables on the preceding 
pages:
 
 Biometric type: This is the specific approach to biometric measurement 
used. Many of the biometric types discussed in this book appear in the 
table.
 
 Cost: The relative cost for biometric hardware, software, or other means 
of equipment. The symbols ($, $$, $$$, $$$$) are relative only, and 
don’t reflect a specific price range; $ means the biometric technology 
is inexpensive; $$$$ means it’s too costly for most business purposes. 
(Alcohol, dessert, and tip not included.)
 
 Moore’s Factor: This refers to Gordon Moore, the originator of Moore’s 
Law that cites the exponential increase in the power of microprocessors. 
Here, we mean the relative amount of computing power required to 
support a given biometric approach.
 
 Maturity: This column refers to how well developed the technology is 
that supports the measurement and processing of this type of biometric. 
High would indicate high maturity; Low would indicate an emerging or 
young technology.
 
 Subject uniqueness: Here, we’re talking about the probability that a bio-
metric system will be able to distinguish any two subjects in the world. 
High would indicate solid distinction; Low would mean that the biometric 
system would have more trouble distinguishing the subjects.
 
 Weaknesses: Any weaknesses associated with a particular type of bio-
metric measurement.
 
 Countermeasures: Steps — such as providing extra credentials — that 
can be taken to overcome specific weaknesses.
 
 Collectability: How easily the biometric measurement can be taken from 
the subject.
 
 Reliability: How reliable is biometric technology for collecting this 
type of biometric. Is this type of biometric free from high FAR (false 
acceptance rate) and FRR (false rejection rate).
 
 Permanence: This refers to the rate at which a measured biometric will 
change over time. High means the biometric does not change over time 
(such as fingerprint or DNA). Low means the biometric changes signifi-
cantly over time (signatures, for example).
 
 Convenience: How easily a subject can provide a biometric 
measurement.
 
 Acceptance: How willing a subject is to provide a biometric 
measurement.

Notes
 
1. Retina biometric measurement is mature but giving way to iris 
recognition.
 
2. Keystroke recognition is more accurate when sampling takes place over 
a longer period.

Appendix B
Controlling Physical Access
I
n this appendix, we look at physical security using biometrics, a subject 
that might be unfamiliar to readers with backgrounds in information 
technology. Physical security requires many components that you’re familiar 
with, such as authentication and authorization, but also some concepts that 
don’t have any real mapping to IT, such as wall thickness, sightlines, and 
observability. Fear not, we make some sense of all these non-electronic terms 
and provide some basic understanding of how biometric systems interact 
with physical-security systems to control access to buildings, rooms, 
and campuses.
Understanding General Principles
Physical security includes those aspects of a protective system that prevent 
access to assets via material means such as physical intrusion. In the average 
home, that means a fence, doors, windows with locks, and possibly the 
family dog — trained to sound like a killer when someone approaches the 
door. In more corporate settings, it will include several points of entry into 
the company offices, such as a gate to get into the parking area, a security 
elevator that requires an access key, or a door from the lobby into the inside 
space, and even guards watching key points or patrolling the areas.
As with information security, physical security is concerned with the confi-
dentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA for short) of the assets protected. 
However, it doesn’t stop there; we have to add in some aspects that informa-
tion security rarely has to address directly, such as:
  
 Safety: A breach of physical security can be a risk to the safety of people 
in the organization.
 
 Physical theft: Usually, when people steal information, they steal a copy, 
and you still have the information. When they steal your office equip-
ment, computers, or lobby art, you no longer have access to it. (We have 
a list of lobby art we would like to see stolen just so we don’t have to 
look at it anymore, but no such luck.)

262
Part V: Appendixes 
 
 Vandalism: Defacing property can make it pretty unsightly and poten-
tially embarrassing.
 
 Physical damage: As with theft, physical damage means you no longer 
have access to the asset that was damaged.
 
 Sabotage: This can take the form of physical damage, which is usually 
obvious, but people with physical access to a protected space might 
choose to sabotage something in a way that will be discovered when 
they’re long gone or when you might have forgotten about the incident.
The job of protecting an organization from physical threats is, in some ways, 
easier than protecting information assets, but in other ways, it’s harder. We 
compare the two in Table B-1.

Attacks easily 
recognized
Very difficult at times. Not 
all attacks look like attacks 
(for example, phishing).
Usually pretty easy. 
Social engineer-
ing attacks are the 
exception here.
Tools required to make 
the attack
Medium to good computer 
skills.
A hammer or a big 
rock.
Exposed attack surface 
(places that can be 
attacked)
Usually network-based, 
sometimes not well known, 
frequently larger than we 
thought.
Pretty well defined as 
gates, fences, doors, 
windows, and the like, 
but creative attackers 
will sometimes cut 
through walls.
Potential attacker 
population
Anyone with an Internet 
connection, all over the 
world, 24 hours each day.
People with physical 
access to the pro-
tected facility. 
Average success rate
Oddly, pretty low. Most 
hackers try hundreds or 
thousands of systems 
before they gain access 
to one, but the success 
depends on the skill of the 
hacker.
Depends on definition 
of “success.” Most 
folks are successful 
at gaining entry if they 
are determined, but 
other measures might 
still foil the attack.

263
 Appendix B: Controlling Physical Access
A quick browse of Table B-1 might make it seem that physical security is a 
snap, compared to information security, but we would like to highlight some 
items here.
The tools required to perform a physical attack are actually obtained more 
easily than a hammer in some cases. Consider a relatively innocent example: 
Mike has purchased two homes in the Seattle area that, for various reasons, 
had all the available keys locked inside. He was able to gain entry into both 
houses by using items found lying around in the yard, and without breaking 
any windows. The point is this: Protecting entrances to buildings from all 
forms of physical attack is nearly impossible unless you’re building a bunker 
(and even then, it’s a challenge).
If people ran around the neighborhood or the office park jiggling door 
handles and trying every single window to see if they happened to be open 
or could be opened with a good hard tug — pretty much how Internet 
hackers test firewalls — an enormous physical crime wave would result 
in a lot of barred windows and steel-reinforced doors. The reason this 
doesn’t happen is that the risk of detection and capture when jiggling a door 
handle is several thousand times higher than the risk of detection when 
port scanning (looking for open ports) on a firewall. Good physical security 
depends on multiple layers of barriers, alarms, and reactions to the threat.
Using Barriers
Creating obstacles to entry is probably the most commonly used physical-
security tool, and it’s simple to understand: If you make it hard to gain 
physical access by putting a steel-reinforced door with a great lock between 
the attacker and the asset, you’ve protected the asset. Some subtleties that 
can enhance this approach, especially when combined with biometrics, are 
worth giving some thought.
 
In the physical world, it’s also somewhat easier to see (literally) what avenues 
an intruder might use to gain entrance to your facility. For instance, if you 
have a big window next to that steel-reinforced door, then your intruder is 
going to toss a rock through the window and disregard that wonderful-and-
highly-protective door.
Time is not your friend
Nearly any physical barrier can be breached. Given enough time, anyone with 
a good drill and some diamond-tipped bits could eventually make it through 

264
Part V: Appendixes 
a bank-vault door. This almost never happens these days because bank-vault 
doors are guarded by people who would object when they saw you walking 
up to the door with your tools and one of those loot bags that cartoon 
burglars always seem to carry.
With some biometric systems, the drill and bits might not be necessary, 
but the system might be vulnerable to “gummy fingers” or injection attacks 
based on getting access to the database and to the wire between the biome-
tric sensor and the main system. Both of these techniques typically take a lot 
of time to set up and test (unless you get really lucky on your first try with 
the “gummy finger”). Therefore, you need to make sure that any would-be 
attacker can’t get comfortable near the door (or the sensor) and that there 
are good “sightlines” from the entry point to the public areas. Figure B-1 
shows an example of poor sightlines and visibility of a rear entrance.
Trees or shrubs can partially obscure the entrance from a parking lot to a 
building. In this example, an attacker could spend some time working on this 
door after hours without fear of being seen from the road or anyone near the 
front of the building. According to our friends in various police organizations, 
most physical break-ins occur through entrances or windows that are hidden 
from casual view.

 Appendix B: Controlling Physical Access
Never count on strength alone
When an attacker doesn’t have time to attack your physical security, they 
might get through just by using greater force than your protections are 
designed to repel. For example, a two-ton automobile traveling at 30 mph and 
chained to a door handle will produce more than enough force to shear all 
the hinge pins in a typical door. In the opposite direction, not too many walls 
are built to withstand a car traveling any faster than 25 mph, and if the assets 
you’re protecting are worth more than a stolen 1976 Chevy Vega, the attacker 
sees the Vega as no more than a large, expendable key to your door.
You can bolster the strength of your barrier defenses, both as a unit (by 
using stronger materials) and as a system (by requiring an attacker to break 
down more than one strong physical defense to gain access). In Figure 
B-2, we show a building’s main entrance with concrete and steel bollards 
(short anchored posts reinforced to provide a barrier to ramming vehicles) 
and anchored picnic tables that provide an outer barrier against someone 
attempting to gain access to the building by smashing through the doors.
As far as a biometric system is concerned, attacks on the barriers associated 
with an installation would be considered a bypass attack; technically, the 
attacker is attempting to gain access by going “around” the biometric system 
entirely, even if that means through the wall.

Part V: Appendixes 
It’s alarming
Alarms can take on many forms, from piercing loud klaxons (which can even 
act as physical barriers at certain volumes) to silent electronic messages in 
the form of e-mail or pages that alert the people (either professional monitor-
ing services or law enforcement) who then respond to the incident.
A fundamental difference between how information-security people work 
and how physical-security people work is in how they implement alarms. 
In an information-security capacity, we think of alarms as early warning 
systems, telling us that our systems are under attack. Part of the rationale 
here is that once someone has successfully attacked a computer system, the 
intruder becomes harder to detect than while performing the original attack. 
Depending on how much control the bad guys gain over the system, they 
might become impossible to detect after they get in.
Physical security works in almost the exact opposite way: Attackers might 
be almost impossible to detect while they’re testing the system (jiggling door 
handles, for instance, might look just like a legitimate person trying to get 
in), but once they breach the physical defenses, they’re actually easier to 
identify. Because physical attacks usually involve some level of destruction, 
force, or general mayhem to the facility, detecting a break-in of this type is as 
simple as inspecting the damage. Damage to an information system might be 
subtler — so much so that it’s nearly impossible to detect.
Going back to the obscured doorway example in Figure B-1, an attacker using 
a fake finger with a stolen fingerprint on it might need to try several times 
to get the fake finger to work. The information-security systems should start 
sending alarms at some point during this process, telling people that an 
intruder is likely trying to get in through that door. If the attacker gets fed up 
with trying to get the fake finger to work and uses a big SUV to yank the door 
open, the physical-security systems should start the audible alarms and 
electronic messages to tell people that this door was opened without first 
being unlocked.
Preventive measures
The subtlest preventive measure is (oddly enough) just having good physical 
security. Many of the aspects of good physical security are visible to pass-
ersby and show that the installation has taken some significant level of care 
in protecting the assets. In some cases, this will include visible video surveil-
lance (though that should always be combined with not-so-visible video sur-
veillance) and alarm systems. For the slow-on-the-uptake criminals (and there 
are a lot of these), you might even have signs posted that describe that the 
facilities are monitored, patrolled, or even (simply) protected by an installed 
alarm system.

267
 Appendix B: Controlling Physical Access
Reacting to attacks
The final line of defense for protecting your assets is by no means the last 
one you want the attacker to encounter, is the reaction to their physical 
attack. A reaction or response to a physical attack serves three purposes:
 
 Cost: To make the cost of attacking the resource greater to the attacker 
than the potential rewards.
 
 Prevention: To attempt to foil the attacker’s attempt to damage or 
steal the asset by convincing them that the reaction will be swift 
and unpleasant.
 
 Control: To regain control of the physical asset as quickly as possible to 
prevent further loss of or damage to the asset. 
 
The reason we say that this should not be the last defense the attacker 
encounters, is that the threat of a response should be made clear to any poten-
tial attacker before anyone actually carries out an attack. The idea is to stop 
attackers before the attack gets far enough to provoke a physical response— 
if possible, to deflect them in the first place.
Excessive response
If you’re going to put a threat in place, be careful not to over-promise or 
under-deliver your various responses to incidents. For example, if your sign 
says you have video surveillance and that you will detain trespassers, expect 
a potential attacker to test what it says. A few trips across the lawn without 
incident will put the attacker at ease about getting in; being detained will have 
the opposite effect. 
On the other hand, it’s also possible to over-respond. In the information-
security realm, specifically with intrusion-detection systems, we’re used to 
multiple false alarms per day (sometimes per hour); we just take them in 
stride, because we know that’s how these systems work. If your biometric 
system starts alarming every time someone fails to authenticate twice, and 
the guards are hustling back to the rear entrance several times each day, it’s 
not going to sit well with the guards (or the poor sap who got a paper cut 
this morning and can’t get a good read on his fingerprint). The subsequent 
(required-by-policy) manual authentication by visual verification of the user, 
usually by a manager, won’t win any friends either.

268
Part V: Appendixes 
Combining Efforts
For biometric systems that control access to physical assets, you’ll be 
working closely with the people who traditionally have been in charge of 
your facility’s physical security. Our advice is to listen carefully to what they 
tell you about how things work. You’re integrating new technology with ideas 
that people have been using since the invention of doors, fences, and gates; 
the people who study the physical side of things have a field with a couple 
more thousand years of maturity than the high-tech stuff.
In our personal experience, all that maturity in the field of physical security 
also means that if we pay close attention, we might learn something from the 
physical-security folks that helps us do our information-security jobs better. 
Keep in mind that information-security people didn’t invent the concept of 
“defense in depth” — we just took a few years to rediscover it and apply it to 
information rather than to literal moats and castles.
