About the Author
As a roving photojournalist for more than 20 years, David D. Busch illustrated
his books, magazine articles, and newspaper reports with award-winning
images. He’s operated his own commercial studio, suffocated in formal dress
while shooting weddings-for-hire, and shot sports for a daily newspaper and
Upstate New York college. His photos have been published in magazines as
diverse as Scientific American and Petersen’s PhotoGraphic, and his articles have
appeared in Popular Photography & Imaging, The Rangefinder, The Professional
Photographer, and hundreds of other publications. He’s currently reviewing
digital cameras for CNet and Computer Shopper.
When About.com named its top five books on Beginning Digital Photography,
occupying the #1 and #2 slots were the last edition of this book, Digital
Photography All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies, and Busch’s Mastering
Digital Photography. During the past year, he’s had as many as five of his
books listed in the Top 20 of Amazon.com’s Digital Photography Best Seller
list — simultaneously! Busch’s 90 other books published since 1983 include
best-sellers like Digital SLR Cameras & Photography For Dummies, and four
books in Wiley’s Digital Field Guide series, with topics ranging from travel
photography to guidebooks for the Nikon D50, D70s, and D200 cameras.
Busch earned top category honors in the Computer Press Awards the 
first two years they were given (for Sorry About The Explosion and Secrets 
of MacWrite, MacPaint and MacDraw), and later served as Master of
Ceremonies for the awards. 


Dedication
I dedicate this book, as always, to Cathy.
Author’s Acknowledgments
Thanks to Wiley Publishing for the continued innovation that has helped
keep this book fresh and up-to-date, and, now, in full color at a price anyone
can afford. Key personnel include Steve Hayes, Senior Acquisitions Editor;
Kim Darosett, Project Editor; and Andy Hollandbeck, Copy Editor. 
Technical Editor Michael D. Sullivan added a great deal to this book in addi-
tion to checking all the text for technical accuracy. A veteran photographer
(in the military sense of the word!), he began his photo career in high school
where he first learned the craft and amazed his classmates by having Monday
morning coverage of Saturday’s big game pictured on the school bulletin
board. Sullivan pursued his interest in photography into the U.S. Navy, 
graduating in the top ten of his photo school class. Following Navy photo
assignments in Bermuda and Arizona, he earned a BA degree from West
Virginia Wesleyan College.
He became publicity coordinator for Eastman Kodak Company’s largest 
division where he directed the press introduction of the company’s major
consumer products and guided their continuing promotion. Following a 
25-year stint with Kodak, Sullivan pursued a second career with a PR agency
as a writer-photographer covering technical imaging subjects and producing
articles that appeared in leading trade publications. In recent years, Sullivan
has used his imaging expertise as a Technical Editor specializing in digital
imaging and photographic subjects for top selling books.

Introduction
T
he future of photography is in your hands, and it’s becoming all digital!
Not since the 19th century, when photographers had to be artisan,
craftsperson, artist, chemist, and public relations expert rolled into one, has
so much of the photographic process been entirely in the control of the
person taking the picture. Now you can compose and view the exact picture
you’re going to take by using your camera’s full liquid crystal display (LCD)
screen. Review the picture an instant after pressing the shutter. If your com-
puter is nearby, you can upload it seconds later, view a super-large version
on your display, crop it, enhance it, and then make your own sparkling full-
color print — all within minutes!
When you go digital, you never need to buy film or wait while your photos
are processed in a lab. You decide which images to print and how large to
make them. You can display your digital photographic work framed on your
wall or displayed proudly over your fireplace. You can make wallet-size
photos, send copies to friends in e-mail, or create an online gallery that can
be viewed by relatives and colleagues over the Web.
And if alchemy is in your blood, you can transform the simplest picture into
a digital masterpiece by using an image editor. Correct your photos, delete
your ex-brother-in-law from a family portrait, or transplant the Eiffel Tower
to the seashore.
Digital photography gives you the power to take pictures on a whim or to
create careful professional-quality work that others might be willing to pay
for. The choices are all yours, and digital photography puts all the power in
your hands. All you need is a little information about how to choose and use
your tools and how to put them to work. That’s what you’ll find within the
pages of this thick, comprehensive, all-in-one guidebook.
The most exciting aspect of digital photography is how rapidly the technology
is changing to bring you new capabilities and features that you can use to
improve your pictures. Today, digital cameras with 4-megapixel (mp) or less
resolution are difficult to find except in photo-capable cell phones — and
some cell phones offer 10-megapixel or more resolution! Even the leanest 
digital camera you’re likely to find in stores will have 5–6 megapixels of 
resolution. I’ve tested models in this range that cost less than $150! You’ll find
7-megapixel and 9-megapixel cameras for $500 or so, and even 10-megapixel
models are widely available for quite a bit less than $1,000. Digital single-lens
reflex cameras (dSLRs) with interchangeable lenses are available from compa-
nies like Nikon, Canon, Olympus, and Sony if you’re willing to pay top dollar.

About This Book
2
Adobe Photoshop has bumped up the image editing ante with lots of new
capabilities of interest to digital photographers, and even inexpensive appli-
cations like Adobe Photoshop Elements have more features than you could
find in the most powerful image editor four or five years ago. Your new hard-
ware and software tools make working with digital images easier while giving
you important new capabilities.
About This Book
This book, now in its third edition and freshly enhanced with full-color
images throughout, has been updated to include all the latest technology
and gadgets available to the digital photographer. It is written for the person
who has a good grasp of using a computer and navigating an operating
system and has at least a cursory knowledge of the operation of a digital
camera. It would help if you had some familiarity with an image editor, such
as Corel Paint Shop Pro, Corel Photo Paint, or Adobe’s Photoshop or
Photoshop Elements. It is intended to be a comprehensive reference book
that you can read cover to cover or reach for when you’re looking for spe-
cific information about a particular task.
Wherever I can, I sneak in a useful tip or an interesting technique to help you
put digital photography to work for your project needs.
If you have some knowledge of conventional photography, this book will
help you fine-tune your capabilities. If you know very little about photography,
there’s help for you here, too. One large chunk of the book — Book IV — is
devoted to tips on the most popular genres of photography, from close-up
and sports photography to travel photography and shooting for publication.
Check out the helpful section on getting the best composition. If you’re puz-
zled over what equipment to buy, look to the sections on choosing cameras,
photo accessories, and related equipment, such as printers and scanners.
There’s a new book in this edition especially for you digital single-lens reflex
(dSLR) users, although you’ll find that another book of mine, Digital SLR
Cameras & Photography For Dummies, goes into more detail on the special
features of these more advanced cameras.
What’s in This Book
This book is broken down into minibooks, each covering a general topic.
Each minibook comprises chapters, each covering a more specific topic
under the general one. Each chapter is then divided into sections, and some
of those sections have subsections. I’m sure you get the picture.

What’s in This Book
3
You can read the book from front to back, or you can dive right into the mini-
book or chapter of your choice. Either way works just fine. Any time a con-
cept is mentioned that isn’t covered in depth in that chapter, you’ll find a
cross-reference to another book and chapter where you’ll find all the details.
If you’re looking for something specific, check out either the Table of
Contents or the index.
The Cheat Sheet at the beginning of the book provides helpful information
you’ll use often. Tear it out, tape it to your monitor, and don’t forget to say,
“Thanks.” (You’re welcome.)
And finally, you get pictures. Lots of them. Many of these pictures illustrate
good photo techniques as well as traps to avoid. You’ll find examples of the
kinds of pictures you can take right away and maybe a few that you’ll want
to strive to equal or exceed.
This book contains eight minibooks. The following sections offer a quick syn-
opsis of what each book contains.
Book I: Digital Photography Overview
This section is your digital photography short course, providing all the infor-
mation on a variety of topics that you really need to know to get started. Each
of the six chapters is an overview of topics covered in depth later in the book.
You’ll find the essentials of good digital photography, equipment basics, and
how to acquire digital pictures. Buzz through the quickie introduction into
some of the ways you can edit or restore a photo electronically and take a look
at how you can store and organize your digital photos. Then, if you’re inter-
ested in what’s involved in selecting a printer or scanner, you’ll find all the
basic information summarized for you in an easy-to-understand way.
Book II: Building Your Digital Photography Studio
This book helps you choose the right camera, whether it’s your first digital
camera or the one you’re dreaming about as a replacement for your current
model. You’ll read all the facts on resolution, lens settings, storage, and acces-
sories. One chapter shows you the requirements for setting up a PC for digital
photography. The good news is that you probably already have everything
you need in your computer. I’ll give you some advice on recommended
upgrades that can make your system work even better with digital images.
You’ll also discover your options for getting pictures from your camera into
your digital darkroom. And, if you want to get the most from your pictures,
you’ll want to read up on how to add a scanner and printer, too.

Book III: Using Digital SLRs
This book provides a concise overview of the tools and capabilities you’ll
find in the latest digital SLR cameras. You find out why these cameras can do
things that their non-SLR counterparts cannot and how to use those features
to improve your photography.
Book IV: Taking Great Pictures
This is the meat of the book for veteran and aspiring photographers alike.
Each of the six chapters is devoted to a different kind of photography. You’ll
see the basic rules for composing great photos — and when to break them.
You’ll discover the secrets of close-up photography and how to make pleas-
ing portraits of individuals and groups.
Whether shooting for publication is part of your job description or just a
goal, you’ll find tips on how to take publishable photos and how to market
them. I also include chapters on sports and action photography as well tips
on travel photography.
Book V: Basics of Image Editing
This book is your introduction to image editing, providing general tips on what
you can — and can’t — do with popular image editors such as Paint Shop 
Pro, Corel PhotoPaint, PhotoImpact, or Adobe Photoshop and Photoshop
Elements. You’ll see the capabilities of these programs, discovering the full
range of tools at your disposal.
The book winds up with a chapter that compares and contrasts the most
popular image editors so you can choose which image editing program you
really need (or whether you might even benefit from owning two!).
Book VI: Editing with Photoshop 
and Photoshop Elements
This book goes into a little more detail on the use of the two most popular
image editing programs: Adobe Photoshop (favored by professionals) and
Adobe Photoshop Elements (an inexpensive younger sibling that has lots of
power but is still easy to use). You discover the power of making selections,
brush away problems in your digital photos, correct your colors, and apply
special effects with filters.
Although this book is not a complete guide to Photoshop, you’ll find lots of
good information you can use right away to try out your digital photo editing
muscles. (For tons of in-depth coverage, read Photoshop CS2 All-in-One Desk
Reference For Dummies, by Barbara Obermeier [Wiley].)

Conventions Used in This Book

Book VII: Restoring Old Photos
Continue your study of Photoshop and Photoshop Elements with this book,
which shows you how to restore old photos and make some common repairs
to your digital images. Read chapters on scanning in print images, tips for
working with slides and negatives, and some common fixes for vintage
photos.
Book VIII: Printing and Sharing Your Digital Images
Your digital photos are going to be so good that you won’t be able to keep
them to yourself. This book provides more information on printing your
photos and shows you ways to share your pictures over the Internet. You’ll
become more comfortable with your printer’s capabilities, discovering all
the things that you can do with photos online, whether it’s showcasing your
pictures among your friends and colleagues or making photo greeting cards,
T-shirts, or other gift items.
Conventions Used in This Book
Digital photography knows no operating system limits. All digital cameras and
many software applications work equally well on a PC and a Macintosh. To
that end, this book is cross-platform. Understandably, some differences do
crop up, particularly in the chapters that deal with image editing. In this book,
Windows commands are given first, followed by Mac commands, like this:
Press Enter (or Return on the Mac) to begin a new line.
Occasionally, text will be specific to one platform or another. Commands
listed often involve using the keyboard along with the mouse — for example,
“Press Shift while dragging with the Rectangular Marquee tool to create a
square,” or “Alt+click (Option+click) the eyeball to redisplay all layers.”
When you see a command arrow (➪) in the text, it indicates that you should
select a command from the menu bar. For example, “Choose Edit➪Define
Custom Shape” means to click the Edit menu and then choose the Define
Custom Shape option.
Although this book was written based on the latest digital cameras and the
newest software (such as Print Shop Pro and Photoshop), if you’re still
bouncing around with earlier versions, you can still glean valuable info. You
might just have to poke around a little more to find a tool or option that has
moved — and of course, the topics covering new features won’t be applica-
ble. But hey, seeing the cool new features might just be the impetus you need
to go out and upgrade!

Icons Used in This Book
While perusing this book, you’ll notice some icons in the margins beckoning
you for your attention. Don’t ignore them; embrace them! These icons point
out fun, useful, and memorable tidbits about digital photography, plus facts
you’d be unwise to ignore.
This icon indicates information that will make your digital photography 
experience easier. It also gives you an icebreaker at your next cocktail party.
Whipping out, “Did you know that many digital cameras can focus down to
within an inch of an object?” is bound to make you the center of conversation.
This icon is a reminder of things that I want to gently re-emphasize. Or I
might be pointing out things that I want you to take note of in your future
digital photography excursions.
The little bomb icon is a red flag. Heed these warnings, or else your camera
or image editor might show its ugly side.
This icon points out info you don’t necessarily need to know. If you’re 
interested in getting more technical, however, you’ll find such information
interesting.

coverage you’ll ﬁnd in the other sections.
This minibook outlines the essentials of good 
photography and shows you how to decide which
digital equipment will do the best job for you.
You’ll discover the best ways to acquire digital
pictures — whether you choose to use a camera
or scanner — and ﬁnd out the fundamentals of

Chapter 1: The Essentials of Good
Digital Photography
In This Chapter
 Choosing equipment
 Making great digital photos
 Converting other photos to digital format
 Making hard-copy prints
I
n 1888, George Eastman began promoting the first hand-held Kodak
camera with the slogan, “You press the button, we do the rest.” His idea
was to make the film camera as convenient as the pencil. However, the film
king’s dream didn’t really come true until the invention of the digital
camera.
Certainly, conventional photography has long been as
simple as pressing a button, but the “we do the rest”
part — taking the film to a photo lab, deciding what
size and kind of prints to make, and then waiting for
the results — is a lot less convenient than using a
pencil.
Digital photography has finally put the entire
process of making pictures in the hands of the
person holding the camera. You press the button,
and you can do as much of the rest yourself as
you’re comfortable with. If all you want to do is point
and shoot, you can do that. If you want to get more
involved in the picture-taking and picture-making process,
digital photography gives you the tools for that, too.
You compose the picture through the viewfinder (as always), but now, you
can preview the exact photograph that you’re going to take on a bright LCD
(liquid crystal display) screen on the back of your camera. After snapping a
shot, you can instantly review the photos you’ve taken and erase the bad
pictures on the spot or “mark” the ones you want to print.

Knowing What Equipment You Need
10
You don’t need to remember to stop and buy film. Your digital film is almost
infinitely reusable. You don’t have to drop off your digital film for finishing:
It’s “processed” instantly and ready for viewing or printing using your own
inexpensive color printer. No more sifting through stacks of prints of mar-
ginal images. You decide which images to print and whether to make them 
4 x 6 inches or 5 x 7 inches or some other size. You can print them at home
inexpensively or take a tiny digital memory card to a nearby retailer and
have even more inexpensive prints made for you in minutes by an in-store
digital print lab.
On the other hand, if you want to have full control over your photos, digital
photography gives you that, too, to a degree that has never before been 
possible. Perhaps your images aren’t exactly right or could benefit from a
little cropping or other improvements. You can fix bad color, remove your
ex-brother-in-law from a family photo, or adjust the borders of an image to
focus on the most interesting subject matter. All you need is an image editor,
such as Photoshop or Photoshop Elements.
This chapter provides an overview of the sorts of things you find out how to
do in this book. I cover each topic in more detail later on in a minibook and
chapter of its own. I’ll keep the repetition to a minimum; the chapters in
Book I are intended to offer an introduction to topics that are explored more
deeply elsewhere in the book.
Knowing What Equipment You Need
I realize that you might not be curled up with this book in one hand and a
digital camera in the other. You might already have a digital camera, and you
purchased this book to find out exactly what you can do with it. You’ll find
the tips and information you need throughout this volume.
However, I’m guessing that some of you haven’t taken the plunge yet. You’re
ready to stop being a hold-out and want to join the digital camera revolution.
So you bought this book to find out more about digital photography before
spending your hard-earned money on the equipment you need. Good plan!
After all, there are so many choices available that it’s easy to buy a camera
that’s not quite right for the kind of pictures you want to take. All digital
cameras do a good job with general picture-taking for family activities,
travel, informal portraits, and other kinds of shots. But some are better than
others for taking close-up photos, sports action pictures, or photos indoors
where a wide view is needed.
So, you’d like some of your questions answered before you buy: Can a camera
I can afford do the things I need to do? Can a computer fumble-fingers like me

Knowing What Equipment You Need

really do digital photography? What’s the best camera to buy? Will I be able
to expand my camera’s capabilities if I find I need more advanced features?
Or, perhaps you are a digital camera veteran who is already thinking of
upgrading. You, too, need some advice about equipment, which you can find
in this book.
Choosing a digital camera that’s right for you can be tricky because a lot
more goes into your selection than simply the specifications. Two cameras
with identical specs can perform quite differently. One may exceed your
expectations, while the other one frustrates the heck out of you. I explore
some of the subtleties of camera selection in Book I, Chapter 2.
The digital camera world has changed dramatically since I wrote the first 
edition of this book. I warned readers against trying to do serious photo-
graphy with cheap Web cams or low-end 1-megapixel cameras. Today, some
camera phones have a lot more resolution than that, and even the lowest
priced digital cameras (in the $100–$200 range), have 4 megapixels (millions of
pixels of information). They are more likely to have at least 5 to 6 megapixels
of resolution. They feature automatic exposure, a color LCD viewing screen for
previewing or reviewing your photos, and removable storage, so you can take
out your digital film card when it’s full and replace it with a new one to keep
shooting. Most have a 3X zoom lens, so you can magnify an image without
moving forward, which is invaluable when you want to take pictures of differ-
ent subjects from one spot.
Those minimum specs give you everything you need to take great photos.
After all, the photographer, not the camera, produces the best images. I once
wrote an article for a photo magazine in which I presented photos of the
same subjects, side-by-side, taken with an inexpensive point-and-shoot film
camera and a full-blown professional system that cost 100 times as much.
After both sets of photos had been subjected to the vagaries of halftone
reproduction, it was difficult to tell them apart.
Spending a lot on a digital camera buys you a few new capabilities, like
better zooms, enhanced resolution, or a more sophisticated built-in flash. If
you have a full-featured model, you can find lots of information in this book
on how to get the most from your camera’s capabilities. But this book also
contains workarounds for those who own more modest equipment.
You can find digital cameras suitable for the most exotic of photographic
pursuits, such as the underwater set-up shown in Figure 1-1. It’s a waterproof
case for a Canon PowerShot digital camera. It provides full access to all your
camera’s controls while letting you photograph those colorful coral reefs in
Tahiti at depths of up to 100 feet!

For most of this book, I assume you have a digital camera with at least 
4 megapixels of resolution. (If you don’t understand resolution right now, see
Book I, Chapter 2, for an explanation.) Such cameras are becoming harder to
find; it’s likely that 5 and 6 megapixels will become the minimum resolution
for new cameras introduced during the lifespan of this book.
A camera with a 4-megapixel sensor corresponds to about 2300 x 1700 pixels,
which is enough detail to give you decent 6-x-8-inch prints or larger at 200 dpi
printer resolution. A 4-megapixel camera also can capture enough information
to allow some cropping, especially if you plan to use the image on a Web page,
where high resolution isn’t necessary.
However, if you happen to have an older camera with less resolution, you
can still do plenty of things. You can prepare images for dynamite Web pages
and make sparkling 4-x-5-inch prints. One of my favorite cameras is an
ancient 3.3 megapixel Nikon CoolPix 995 that is excellent for close-up
photos, and I use it from time to time to take pictures for eBay auctions.
Cameras with up to 6 megapixels or more of resolution have dipped down
into the inexpensive camera range (under $200), and if you have a little 
more to spend, you can find point-and-shoot cameras with 10 megapixels of
resolution for only a few hundred dollars more. Digital single lens reflex
(dSLR) cameras, which boast faster operation and interchangeable lenses,
offer around 6 to 8 megapixels of detail in the sub-$1,000 price range, and 
10 to 12 megapixels (and more) if you’re willing to pay at least $1,500 for
your camera. (You can read more about dSLRs in Book III.)

Extensive coverage of digital SLR cameras is new to this latest edition, but
very little in this book actually requires a dSLR to achieve. Those of you with
these high-end cameras should still find lots to like in this book; one of my
goals has been to present pro-level techniques in ways that can help anyone.
If you have a digital SLR like the one shown in Figure 1-2, you’ll find these
techniques especially useful. If you want to find out even more about these
cameras, I recommend my book, Digital SLR Cameras & Photography For
Dummies, from Wiley Publishing.
If you own a more sophisticated camera, whether it’s a digital SLR or an
advanced non-SLR camera, there are lots of additional capabilities at your
fingertips. You can make tack-sharp 8-x-10-inch prints (and even larger prints
if your printer supports them or if you take your digital files to your retailer).
You can crop out the center of an image and still have sharpness to spare.
Your camera will have loads of automated features, such as automatic brack-
eting (taking several exposures at different settings to make sure one is
ideal) or a very long zoom lens (to reach way out and capture distant
objects). Your camera may be able to take time-lapse photos and stitch
images together to create panoramas.
Although I seem to focus on the number of pixels a camera has, other con-
siderations, such as the range of the zoom lens, may also be important to
you. Even the least expensive cameras may have a 2:1 to 3:1 zoom, which
can magnify an image 2X and 3X (respectively). Better cameras have 4:1 or
longer zooms, up to 12:1 or more. Digital SLRs offer the best zoom capabili-
ties of all: You can remove one lens and swap it for another with a longer
range or with wider or longer perspectives. Your camera probably has
macro, or close-up, capability, which lets you grab images from inches away
from your subject. Book IV, Chapter 2 is devoted to close-up techniques.
Most of the other components (such as the amount and type of memory
storage, manual/automatic exposure and focusing options, built-in flash
capability, and so on) can vary widely. You can find discussions of these in
Book I, Chapter 2.
One thing I avoid in this book is mentioning the names of specific camera
models, except as a matter of interest from time to time. It’s more likely that
I’ll mention 10- or 8- or 5-megapixel models in a generic sense. You won’t find
extensive discussions in this book about the relative merits of the latest Nikon
or Canon cameras or other references that will be hopelessly outdated in a 
few months. (Those of you reading this in 2008 with your $500 12-megapixel
cameras should refrain from laughing as you encounter some of my quaint
advice.)

Taking Great Digital Shots
So, when you have a camera in hand, what do you need to know to take great
digital photos? In this section, I discuss the knowledge that needs to reside
in your brain (or be otherwise available) to take great pictures.
Understand how your camera works
No digital photography book can tell you how to turn on your camera, how
to adjust the auto-exposure settings, or how to use your model’s self-timer to
take a picture with you in it (although Wiley Publishing’s Digital Field Guide
series does offer editions for specific camera models). Those are things 
best found in your camera’s instruction manual. Read it. I promise that the
information you seek is in there; it may just be hard to find. The instructions
for one of my own digital cameras were so cryptic that I found myself creat-
ing a cheat sheet with lists of steps, such as, “To turn off the auto-sharpening
feature, press the Menu button, then. . . .”
Some of the techniques in this book call for using a specific exposure mode
or lens setting. I may ask you to switch to your camera’s close-up mode 
to take photos a few inches from your subject. You may need to use your
camera’s built-in flash. Learn how to do these now so that you can add some
simple but effective tools to your shooting repertoire.

Taking Great Digital Shots

Know some photography fundamentals
Certainly, you can point your camera and snap off a picture that may turn out
great. Some prize-winning shots were taken in an instant as a fast-breaking
news event unfolded without warning. Amateur photographers took more
than a few of those photos, such as the famous Pulitzer Prize winner of a
woman falling from a burning hotel, captured by a 26-year-old Georgia Tech
student. However, whatever part instinct and luck take in the production of
great pictures, a little knowledge can be much more important.
✦If you know a little about composition, you can nudge your images into a
more pleasing arrangement. (See Book IV, Chapter 1, for a full course in
photographic composition.)
✦Understanding how focus can make parts of your image sharp or blurry
gives you the freedom to use focus selectively to isolate or emphasize
subjects (Book IV, Chapter 2). 
✦Some background in how shutter speeds can freeze action can improve
your sports photography (Book IV, Chapter 5).
✦And you don’t need to become an expert in lighting effects, but under-
standing how light works can improve your people pictures (Book IV,
Chapter 3).
Find out how to use an image editor
In digital photography, the pseudo-snap of an electronic shutter is only the
beginning. You can do lots of things after the shot to improve your photo —
or transform it into an entirely new one. Simple image editors enable you to
crop pictures, fix bad color, or remove defects, such as those glaring red
eyes found in many flash photos. However, you can find even more creative
freedom in more-advanced image editors that let you do anything from 
eliminating trees that appear to grow out of your subject’s head to bringing
seriously damaged photos back to life. If you want to polish your reputation
as an all-around digital photographer, plan on developing at least a modicum
of skill with a decent image editing program. You’ll find general information
on a broad range of image editors in Book V, and specifics on Adobe
Photoshop and Photoshop Elements in Book VI.
Master a scanner
Digital photographers don’t have to own a scanner, but you don’t have to
own a camera bag or an extra digital film card, either. Like other digital
accessories, a scanner provides you with some supplemental techniques
that let your scanner complement or substitute for your digital camera. For
example, if you have a large stock of images that originated on film and now

exist only as prints or negatives, a scanner can help you convert them to 
digital format. A scanner also can be used for producing close-up images of
relatively flat three-dimensional objects, such as coins. A scanner can grab
pictures of very small objects (less than 1 x 1 inch) that are difficult to cap-
ture with a digital camera.
The exact kind of scanner you have isn’t important, as long as it’s a flatbed
model, like the one shown in Figure 1-3. I explain the differences between the
major types of flatbeds and how their capabilities diverge (that is, some
scanners can be used to scan three-dimensional objects, whereas others
can’t) in Book II, Chapter 4.
Figure 1-3: This scanner’s novel design lets you view the photo through the glass while it is
being scanned.
Making Any Photo Digital
In this book, you can also find out how to transform any photo you happen
to have into a digital image. Scanners are one way to do this: Slap an existing

photo down on the scanning bed and scan it into your image editor, and you
have a digital image that’s the equal of anything you might capture with your
digital camera — except it’s likely to have dust spots!
Or, drop off your film at your local photo lab and request a Photo CD or
Picture CD along with (or instead of) your prints. These CDs can be pro-
duced from slide film, too, or even from stacks of existing prints. What you
receive for your money is a scan of your images, perfect for manipulating in
your image editor and printing on your own color printer. You don’t even
need to own a scanner: Your photo lab does all the work for you.
Another option is using a local or mail-order service that processes your film
and puts the finished images on the Internet. You can download your photos
to your computer or make them available for viewing by family, friends, and
colleagues on a Web page. What could be easier? You can find more informa-
tion on this topic in Book VIII, Chapter 2.
Printing Your Final Pictures
The final piece of the digital photography puzzle is the hard-copy print. You
may create photos electronically, view them on your computer, post them on
your Web site, and send them to others as e-mail, but nothing beats having a
stack of prints to pass around or an enlargement to hang over the fireplace.
So, in Book I, Chapter 6, you can find basic information on making prints, and
you can find more advanced advice in Book VIII. The good news is that the
equipment you need is inexpensive and easy to use. A photo-quality inkjet
printer can set you back $100 or so. It probably plugs directly into a USB
port on your computer and requires little or no setup. Making the prints can
be a point-and-click operation. A variety of printers can do the job for you.
The one shown in Figure 1-4 can produce prints directly from your digital
camera or storage media, with no computer required at all!
The bad news, if it can be called that, is that the cost of materials can seem a
little high. You can pay $1.00 or more just for the paper and ink for a single 
8-x-10-inch print. However, I show you some money-saving tips in Book VIII,
Chapter 1. The best news is that you don’t make a print of every single photo
you take. You can view your prints on your computer display and make hard
copies of only the very best. From that angle, making your own prints isn’t
expensive at all. You’re printing only the pictures you want, and in the long
run, probably paying a lot less overall than you used to spend on those
prints that wound up in a shoebox.

hoosing a digital camera isn’t a once-in-a-lifetime thing any more than
buying a car, choosing a computer system, or purchasing a television
would be. Your goal should be to select the digital camera that can do the
job you want today and for the foreseeable future but not for the rest of
your life. Odds are, you’ll be making the decision all over again two or three
years down the road, when prices have dropped even further and new fea-
tures are available.
So, you want to choose wisely now, while planning to 
make future upgrades. In that sense, purchasing a 
digital camera is more like buying a television than
a computer system. Most computers can be easily
upgraded to add features or improve performance.
You can increase the amount of memory, substi-
tute a DVD burner for an older CD-ROM drive, and
perhaps even double or triple the speed with a
new processor.
Digital cameras aren’t easily overhauled. You’re
pretty much stuck with the sensor and storage
system built into the camera on the day you 
purchased it. If you don’t have a digital SLR with 
interchangeable lenses, you’re more or less married to the
lens that comes attached to your camera. You can certainly
enhance your camera with add-ons, such as lens attachments, additional
removable storage, or a better external electronic flash unit. But, essentially,
no matter how much digital cameras improve over the next few years, yours
will stay the same. Just as you wouldn’t purchase a 45-inch conventional
projection TV now if you’re going to need a 42-inch HDTV set next year, you
want a digital camera that’s ready for everything you plan to throw at it.

Deciding What You Need
20
This chapter is an overview of what to look for when choosing the digital
camera that’s best for you, whether you’re a well-heeled amateur who
changes cameras as often as many of us change clothes, or you’re a frugal
buyer who wants a camera that will do the job for two or three years. You
find out the basics of the features that you need to evaluate before you lay
down your cash. In Book II, I go into more detail as you build your digital
studio, starting with a detailed look at cameras and features in Book II,
Chapter 1.
Deciding What You Need
What’s the best car on the market? It’s hard to say without knowing your driv-
ing plans, isn’t it? Will you be making a 40-mile commute on crowded freeways
every day? You might find that a 40-miles-per-gallon econobox suits your
needs. Do you have six kids to transport? Plan on driving off-road? Need to
impress the country club set? Will you be running in road rallies during the
weekends? You can see why the automotive world has so many options.
The same holds true in the digital camera realm. Some kinds of cameras do
some kinds of things better or more easily. Although you can use workarounds
to get great sports photos or close-ups with cameras that aren’t particularly
suited to those situations, you’re better off carefully defining your expecta-
tions before you purchase a camera.
Unfortunately, price isn’t the best indicator. If you want to take lots of different
kinds of pictures, you can’t just buy the most expensive camera and figure
that it has every feature you can possibly need. It’s more likely that you’ll end
up with a camera that’s so complicated you’ll spend more time trying to figure
out how to access a feature than actually taking the photo. I’ve used digital
cameras that forced me to access a menu, press several buttons, and then
turn a dial just to be able to manually focus.
In the following sections, I discuss some of the things you need to consider
before you begin to narrow your choice to a particular category or brand of
digital camera.
How much resolution do you need?
Digital cameras are often categorized simply by the amount of detail they
can capture, measured by the number of pixels available in the sensor,
regardless of their other features. While the resolution of the camera may be
3000 x 2000 pixels (or some other figure), they’re advertised only by the
total number of pixels they can grab. Thus, they’re classified as 5-megapixel,
6-megapixel, or 9-megapixel cameras, as if that resolution figure is the only
measure of the camera’s value. I can almost visualize digital cameras on
shelves with unit pricing stickers like you find at a supermarket. Hmmm . . .

Book I

Basics of Equipment
Deciding What You Need
21
one camera offers 8000 pixels per $1.00, whereas this other one gives you
12,000 pixels per $1.00. The second one is clearly a better deal!
In practice, the resolution you require depends a lot on what you plan to do
with the photos you take. Do you plan on making excellent 8-x-10-inch or
larger prints? If so, you need a camera with a minimum of 5 to 6 megapixels.
Is it likely you’ll crop a small section out of the center of an image and make
a 5-x-7-inch print out of that? You’ll need one of those high-resolution cam-
eras, too. You may be able to see the difference between the left photo in
Figure 2-1, taken with a 6-megapixel camera, and the version to the right,
taken seconds later at a 3.3 megapixel resolution. (Both images have been
cropped so you can see fine detail in the brickwork of the structure.). But,
given the loss of detail that occurs any time a photo is reproduced for the
printed page, you might not see much difference. In that case, wouldn’t the 
6-megapixel camera be overkill?
Figure 2-1: A 6-megapixel image (left) provides more detail than the 3.3 megapixel version
(right) — or does it?
Do most of the photos you take end up in digital presentations viewed on your
computer screen? Are you creating newsletters or other desktop publications?
Will you rarely make prints larger than 4 x 6 inches? A camera with 5 to 6
megapixels will probably do the job for you. With the money you would have
spent on pixels, you can invest in a camera with a better zoom lens or more
digital film (so that you can take more vacation pictures).

Deciding What You Need
22
Perhaps you’ll be taking pictures of things you plan to sell on eBay. Figure 2-2
shows a photo I took for an eBay auction when I began unloading my
beloved older film cameras so I could buy new digital equipment. This photo
was resized to 600 pixels wide so that people who viewed the auction page
could download the photo quickly, so virtually any digital camera, from 2
megapixels on up, would have done the job. Or, you might be setting up a
Web page of your own with lots of individual photos. A camera with as few
as 4 to 5 megapixels might have plenty of resolution for that application. You
can find tiny digital cameras in this range that slip in a pocket and are always
available for a quick snapshot. There really are times when less is more.
Figure 2-2: Photos used in eBay auctions, such as this one of a classic film camera, rarely
need to be wider than 600 pixels, so the lowest resolution digital cameras can do the job.
As you decide the amount of resolution you need, remember that digital
cameras are downwardly compatible. A higher resolution camera has 
shooting modes at lower resolutions, so your 8-megapixel camera can take
4-megapixel photos if you need them, which saves space on your digital film
and hard drive when the extra resolution isn’t required. If 90 percent of
your photos require only 4 megapixels of resolution, but a solid 10 percent
could benefit from a bit more pixel-grabbing capability, seriously consider
getting a higher-res model. I look at resolution in more depth in Book II,
Chapter 1.

Do you plan to manipulate your photos?
Many digital photographers don’t want to mess with image editing programs.
All they want to do is take pictures and either make prints or view them in
digital albums on-screen. They see the need to spend extra time with an
image as a drawback and find tasks such as cropping or correcting colors to
be a needless waste of time. Such snap-shooters fall into two broad cate-
gories. Many are amateurs with little interest in photography itself; their
interest is in the pictures that capture memories of vacations or document
their little ones as they grow up. Others are business professionals who use
photographs as a means to an end and who want the process to be as fast
and as simple as possible. If you were a real estate agent preparing an online
database of homes for sale, would you want to spend a lot of time editing
hundreds of photos of your listings?
On the other hand, others take great joy from the ability to edit their photos,
using image manipulation as a creative outlet or, at the very least, a means to
perfect their photographic vision as they tweak the image to look exactly as
they planned.
If you belong in the latter camp, you’ll want a camera with lots of features and
lots of options so that you can get sharp images worthy of your image-editing
efforts. But if all you want are pictures, consider a basic point-and-shoot digital
camera.
Are you a photo hobbyist?
If photography was in your life long before you considered buying a digital
camera, you’ll want all the manual features you can get, a powerful zoom lens
to give you a variety of perspectives, and compatibility with as many add-on
gadgets as possible. In fact, you probably want a digital SLR. Dedicated photo
hobbyists talk about the importance of composition, darkroom skills, and the
photographer’s eye. But I haven’t met one yet who didn’t think that a bit of
technology, properly applied, couldn’t make a good photo even better.
Photo hobbyists tend to spend a lot on their pastime and understand and
value all those features that others seldom use. If you’re an avid amateur
photographer, don’t try to scrimp when the time comes to buy your digital
camera. You’ll regret it later.
How often do you plan to upgrade?
If you don’t intend to replace your digital camera for a long time, consider
spending a little more now on a camera that will avoid the shadow of 
obsolescence a little longer. On the other hand, if you know you’ll buy a 
new camera next year, go ahead and buy one that suits your needs today.
Tomorrow will take care of itself.

Defining Camera Categories
24
Believe it or not, you can purchase a digital camera for the long term if you
opt for more than a basic model. For example, you can use a 6- to 7-megapixel
digital camera with a zoom lens and a standard removable storage system,
such as CompactFlash, for most applications for a long time to come. Such a
camera has enough resolution for good-looking 5-x-7-inch and 8-x-10-inch
photos and is versatile enough to take a broad range of pictures. Unless your
needs change drastically, a good digital camera in that range can serve you
well for two or more years.
If you find yourself yearning to take different kinds of photos and are con-
stantly upgrading your expectations, however, you’ll probably want to
upgrade cameras more frequently. Digital cameras are adding features at
reduced prices at an amazing rate. When I wrote my first digital photography
book in 1995, a 6-megapixel SLR digital camera could cost as much as a new
car. By the turn of the century, 6-megapixel dSLRs were available for $5,000;
today, they cost $800 or less.
If you can afford it, you might want to upgrade every year or two. Even if you
can do that, it’s wise to take your upgrade plans into account when buying
today. You’ll want to use the accessories you buy now with your new
camera. Or, if your pocketbook has restrictions, you might want to scale
back your expectations today so that you can afford to dump your current
camera when you upgrade.
Defining Camera Categories
Digital cameras fall into several overlapping categories, which are usually
defined by the number of pixels they can capture plus some other features,
such as lens type, availability of manual controls, add-on accessories, and
other features. Specifications that define a category change over time. Point-
and-shoot cameras once had 640 x 480 to 1024 x 768 resolution (less than a
megapixel). Today, even the most basic cameras have 4 megapixels or more of
resolution. However, the categories themselves have remained fairly constant
in terms of types of snap-shooters or photographers they attract.
Web cams/phone cams
This book more or less ignores Web cams and cell phone cameras. They’re
not toys, but they’re not digital cameras within the scope of this book. 
Web cams are low-cost (often less than $30) TV cameras that can supply 
low-resolution (640-x-480 or 320-x-200/240-pixel), full-motion images that can
be transmitted over the Internet, put on Web pages, or attached to e-mails.
Most can also capture low-resolution still images.
These cameras frequently have no removable storage, no controls, and
lenses that don’t zoom and may not even have a facility for changing focus.
Only a few years ago, they made a good first camera for kids or a spare

digital camera, but today that function is more
likely to be found in the cell phones that virtu-
ally every person in the country seems to carry
constantly. I have one in my Nokia cell phone,
shown in Figure 2-3, and I find it useful for 
sending photos to family members along with a
text message on the order of “Is this what you
wanted me to pick up on the way home?” They
can also be handy for note-taking (say, to docu-
ment the various steps of a science experiment).
However, most Web and phone cams aren’t flexi-
ble enough for serious digital photography. That
may change during the life of this book, how-
ever; at least one vendor has introduced a cell
phone camera with 10 megapixels of resolution.
Point-and-shoot models
Point-and-shoot digital cameras cost about $200
and can do anything a simple film camera can do.
Most have 4- to 6-megapixel resolution, a built-in
flash, some sort of removable storage (although
the memory card is probably an optional pur-
chase), and a 3:1 zoom that provides a little magnification. Expect automatic
exposure and no manual controls. Figure 2-4 shows an innovative two-lens
point-and-shoot model.
Figure 2-4: A typical point-and-shoot camera will have basic features, including a 3X zoom 
lens — and a few have two lenses, like this model.

phone cams are fun, but they
aren’t ready for prime time.

Intermediate models
Intermediate digital cameras are priced in the $200 to $500 range, and 
cameras in this category are the most widely used. As such, they have 
the best compromise of features to suit most consumer needs. 
Look for 6- to 10-megapixel resolution; a 5:1 zoom lens; and at least a few
special options, such as different exposure modes, close-up focusing, or
manual controls. Figure 2-5 shows a selection of intermediate-level digital
cameras.
Figure 2-5: Intermediate digital cameras offer more features, such as longer zoom lenses or
ultra-compact size.
Advanced consumer models
In the $500 to $600 price range, you can find digital cameras aimed at those
who want some special features, extra resolution, or a longer zoom lens. Many
of these, like the one shown in Figure 2-6, provide two LCD viewfinders: the 
traditional back panel display and a second, “electronic viewfinder” (or EVF)
inside the camera that provides a dimmer, but still SLR-like view. These are 
6- to 10-megapixel models with 6:1 to 12:1 zooms (or better) and plenty of add-
on accessories, such as wide-angle and telephoto attachments, filters, external
flash units, and more. 
You can also find lots of optional exposure modes, customizable settings, and
other (potentially confusing) features. Advanced consumer cameras usually
require a session or two with the instruction manual to master all their capa-
bilities, but they have few limitations.

Figure 2-6: Advanced consumer models may offer both a back-panel 
LCD and a second EVF display seen through a viewing window.
Prosumer dSLR models
Prosumer digital SLR cameras (see Figure 2-7) are the models that photo buffs
and even a few professional photographers favor. The avid photographer
doesn’t countenance much in the way of compromises and is willing to spend
the $600 to $1,800 sticker price for these cameras in order to get the advanced
features. Pros find them useful as backup cameras, even if most aren’t quite
rugged enough to take the beating that professional equipment is subjected to.
Prosumer dSLR cameras feature interchangeable lenses and are prized for
their ultra-fast response. Such cameras have virtually no shutter lag (the
delay between when you press the shutter release all the way and when the
picture is actually taken) and can crank out 3 to 5 pictures per second for
action sequence photography. They can be purchased just as a camera body
alone (in case you already own compatible lenses, perhaps for an older film
camera) or in a kit that includes an inexpensive but serviceable zoom in the
18mm–55mm or 18mm–70mm range.
Expect a minimum of 6 to 10 million pixels to shoot with, plus a lot of extra
weight to lug around compared to point-and-shoot cameras. All controls and
features of a prosumer digital SLR match or beat those found on conventional
film cameras. You get automatic and manual focus, multiple automated 
exposure modes, plus manual shutter speed and lens opening settings if you

want them. The key differences between high-priced prosumer digital SLR
cameras and professional digital SLR cameras is resolution (pro models have
12 to 16 megapixels or more), speed (pro cameras can usually snap off digital
pictures at a 5 to 8 pictures-per-second clip; prosumer models may be limited
to 3 pictures per second), and ruggedness.
Figure 2-7: Prosumer digital SLR cameras offer interchangeable lenses and other advanced
features.
Professional models
Pro digital cameras still cost $3,000 and up and have both the pedigree and
features to match. These high-end models are the equal of their film camera
counterparts in every way, and, indeed, some vendors are already phasing
out their film camera production. If you can’t do it with one of these, it can’t
be done.
You’ll find 12- to 22-megapixel sensors in these cameras, although the 
highest-resolution cameras are currently found in the so-called “medium
format” digital SLR arena, where cameras start out at $10,000! You can fit
standard interchangeable lenses to them while retaining all the sophisticated
autoexposure and autofocus modes originally introduced in their film
camera counterparts. As I mention earlier, one feature pros demand is
speed. If you use a pro camera, you’ll see just how this speed is applied.

Book I
Chapter 2
Basics of Equipment
Defining Camera Categories
29
With lesser cameras, there is often a tiny time lag while the autofocus system
locks in; with pro cameras, this interval is hard to detect.
With a pro camera, such as the one shown in Figure 2-8, you can usually snap
off pictures as quickly as you can press the shutter release, or else trigger the
motor drive continuous shot mode. You may be able to snap off 5 to 8 pictures
per second for as long as you like, or at least until the storage media fills up.
That can be a long time, because pro digital cameras usually accept humon-
gous storage options, such as 4GB (or larger) memory cards.
Some pro dSLR cameras (as well as prosumer models) with interchangeable
lenses boost the effective magnification of your lenses as well, because the
sensors are smaller than the nominal 24-x-36mm 35mm film frame. A 35mm
lens or zoom setting has the same field of view as a normal lens on a film
camera. A 105mm portrait lens becomes a longer telephoto. However, some
of the latest professional cameras have a true 24-x-36mm sensor and can use
lenses at their marked focal lengths.
You can read more about the advantages and challenges of using a digital
SLR in Book III.
Figure 2-8: Professional digital SLRs have rugged bodies, extremely fast focusing and 
shooting, and ultra-high resolution.

Checking for Key Camera Features
30
Checking for Key Camera Features
Check out Book II, Chapter 1 for a close look at all the features to consider
for your digital camera. In this overview chapter, I provide a list of the key
features that you should think about. I discussed resolution earlier because
resolution is one of the key ways of categorizing cameras, but I’ve only
touched briefly on other features. Here’s a summary of what to look for:
✦Resolution: Again, resolution determines how sharp your image will be,
how much you can enlarge a photo before the pixels start to become 
distracting, and how much you can crop a photo and still be left with a
decent image that you can enlarge and manipulate.
✦Lens: The lens is the eye of your digital camera. Look for the following in
your lens:
• You’ll want good-quality optics that focus a sharp image on your
camera’s solid-state sensor. The best way to gauge the quality of the
lens is to take a test photo or two. A vendor’s reputation or lab tests
in magazines are other ways to evaluate a lens.
• The lens also needs enough light-gathering power to let you shoot in
reduced light levels. A camera’s light-gathering capabilities are meas-
ured in something called f-stops, and I explain this in more detail in
Book II, Chapter 1.
• The magnification power of the lens (how large or small an image
appears to be from a particular shooting position) is another factor.
A digital camera’s lens magnification can usually be varied by zooming
in and out to make the image larger or smaller.
• A related factor, the zoom range, is another key characteristic to 
look at. Where magnification tells you only how large or small the
image can be made to appear, the zoom range tells you the difference
between the two. As I mention under the discussion of general
camera categories, some lenses have only a small zoom range, say 2:1,
whereas others have a longer range, up to 12:1 or more (which means
the image size can be varied up to 12X).
What’s the difference between magnification and zoom range?
Magnification deals purely with how large or small an image appears to
be. For example, one lens may extend from a 28mm (35mm equivalent)
to 85mm (35mm equivalent) magnifications, a 3:1 zoom range. Another
lens might go from 35mm to 105mm (both 35mm equivalents) and 
also qualify as a 3:1 zoom range optic. However, the second lens would
provide more relative magnification.
✦Storage: The kind and amount of removable storage is another key 
feature. The more storage space you have for photos, the more pictures
you can take before “reloading” your digital camera. Most cameras use
CompactFlash, Secure Digital, or other electronic “film” media. You can
find more on this topic in Book II, Chapter 1.

Book I
Chapter 2
Basics of Equipment
Checking for Key Camera Features
31
✦Exposure controls: Except for the least expensive models, all digital
cameras include automatic exposure controls that adjust the amount of
light reaching the sensor based on the lighting conditions of your sub-
ject. If the illumination is low, an autoexposure system uses a wider lens
f-stop or exposes the sensor for a longer period of time. If there is a lot of
light, the exposure system reduces the amount of light reaching the
sensor. Cameras with more versatile automatic exposure controls let you
specify what type of exposure to use.
For example, when shooting action, it’s often preferable to use the short-
est shutter speed possible to freeze the motion and to adjust the size of
the lens opening instead. Conversely, if you want a lot of your image to
be in sharp focus (say, objects very close to the camera and very far are
both important), you may be able to choose an exposure mode that
favors maximum depth of field. You probably want a digital camera that
can handle several different exposure modes and lets you set exposure
yourself. I explain more about these modes in Book II, Chapter 1.
✦Focus controls: Most digital cameras also have an automated system for
sharply focusing your images. Some are more versatile than others, and
many cameras also let you focus manually to ensure that the subject
matter you want to emphasize is the sharpest.
✦Viewfinders: Digital cameras generally have four ways to let you preview
and compose your images prior to exposure. The color LCD panel on the
back of the camera shows you the same image that the sensor is captur-
ing. The LCD is often hard to view in bright light, so digital cameras also
may have optical viewfinders that let you see a nonelectronic version of
the frame. More-advanced cameras might include a second LCD (EVF) in
the camera, where it is shielded from the glare of the surrounding light.
Single lens reflexes (SLRs) let you see an optical version of the picture
through the same lens used to take the photo. I explain more about your
viewfinder options in Book II, Chapter 1.
✦Other equipment, other features: Finally, as you choose your digital
photography gear, think about accessories, such as tripods, filters, 
add-on lenses, external electronic flash units, scanners, printers, and
additional stuff. Even the storage media you use to archive your photos,
such as CDs or DVDs, can all be important.
I reveal the mysteries of these extra pieces of equipment in various parts
of Book II. This overview has given you enough to think about.

H
ow do you acquire digital photos? The quick answer is, “With a digital
camera!” However, the digital photography process involves more
than simply snapping a picture. Indeed, you can use other ways of acquiring
a digital picture that don’t even involve a digital camera. Scanners, for exam-
ple, can convert any printed image into a digital image. Some scanners, such
as those with slide scanning attachments or dedicated slide scanners,
can even capture color transparencies or negatives.
This chapter provides an overview of all the ways you
can acquire digital pictures and points you to chapters
that explore these topics in more detail.
Transferring Images from Your 
Camera to Your PC
The first challenge you have to face is getting your
digital images from your camera into your computer
so that you can edit them (if necessary), store them on
some archival medium (such as CD or DVD), and make
prints.
Today, transferring images to your computer is a fairly painless
process. It wasn’t always so. My first digital camera back in the last millen-
nium had no removable storage. It was bad enough that when the camera’s
internal storage was full, I had to stop taking photos. But what was even
worse was that it often took 10 to 20 minutes to move those photos from the
camera to my computer. The only option was an old-fashioned serial cable
that moved an image one bit at a time, like a line of soldiers, from the
camera to the serial port on my computer at about 64 kilobits per second.

Transferring Images from Your Camera to Your PC
34
Even at a prehistoric resolution of 640 x 480 pixels, I had roughly 2.5 million
bits (307 kilobytes) to move per picture. So at best, I spent a minimum of 40
seconds transferring one photo. It seemed longer.
To make things worse, this was back in the days when PCs didn’t share
peripheral ports very well, so my computer really had only two functional
serial ports. I used one for my mouse, and the other for both a modem and
my camera’s serial cord. I had to unplug one to use the other. This may seem
bizarre in these days of USB (Universal Serial Bus) ports, which enable you
to connect a mouse and dozens of other peripherals at once, and FireWire
connections, which speed files between computers.
Today, you have multiple options for transferring your images. I can plug a
USB cable directly into my favorite camera and transfer multi-megapixel
images in a few seconds. I also have a card reader that accepts memory
cards and lets me move images between the card and my hard drive as if the
memory card were another disk drive.
Card readers are so inexpensive these days that they are often built right
into computers or printers, as you can see in Figure 3-1, which shows the
slots of a reader included below the DVD drive in a Windows PC. Usually,
such a reader will be your best choice for transferring photos. Compared to
transferring using a cable connection, the reader is faster and uses less juice
from your digital camera’s battery.
Figure 3-1: Card readers built into computers allow transferring photos quickly without the
need for a cable.
I outline all the options and explain the pros and cons of each storage medium
in Book VIII. You can find everything you need to know about transferring
images from camera to PC or Mac there.

Acquiring Your
Digital Pictures
Grabbing Digital Images of Prints and Slides
35
Grabbing Digital Images of Prints and Slides
Another way to create a digital image is to capture an existing print or slide
with a scanner. As far as your image editor or printer is concerned, these
kinds of digital images are just as digital as those that began their lives in the
sensor of a digital camera.
Indeed, before digital photography became common, the only way most of us
who worked with images could acquire a digital picture was with a scanner.
Scanners remain a valuable tool for anyone who needs digitized graphics from
hard copy originals. The good news
is that the price of scanners has
come down since the late 1980s,
while the features have improved.
Whereas my first “real” scanner 
(forgetting about toys such as the
ThunderScan, available for the
Macintosh in the mid-1980s) cap-
tured a whopping 16 levels of gray at
300 samples per inch, my latest has a
true resolution of 2,400 samples per
inch and can grab a few billion differ-
ent colors. It’s about 10 times faster
and includes a capable transparency
scanner. My first scanner cost me
about $2,500; the list price of my
latest is about $200. A typical scan-
ner is shown in Figure 3-2.
You can find a lot of information about scanners in Book II, Chapter 4, but I
can summarize a lot of what you need to know here in this overview.
Kinds of scanners
A variety of nonprofessional scanners has drifted off into the fog of history.
My first scanner was a ThunderScan unit that (I am not making this up)
replaced the ink ribbon in an Apple ImageWriter printer with an optical
imager that captured a scan of a photo as it fed through the roller. Other
scanners have included the hand scanner of the early 1990s, which looked
like an overgrown mouse.
Yesterday’s sheet-fed scanners became obsolete but lived on for awhile in
the form of dedicated fax machines that sucked your documents past a 
stationary sensor. The flatbed scanner, which looks and works a little like a
photocopier, has become today’s standard.
Figure 3-2: Scanners have become less
expensive, thinner, faster, and capable of better
resolution.

Grabbing Digital Images of Prints and Slides
36
Today, unlike times past, you don’t have to agonize over what category of
scanner to buy. That should be obvious from the kind of scanning you want
to do:
✦Flatbed scanners are used for scanning reflective copy, such as docu-
ments, photographs, articles torn from magazines, and other similar
material. You simply place the
original face-down on the scan-
ner’s glass platen, and a moving
bar with a light source and a
sensor (or a mirror that reflects
the light to a sensor located else-
where in the scanner) captures the
image a line at a time when you
close the lid and activate the scan-
ning software.
Some flatbed scanners have a 
light source built into the lid (or
another component), as shown in
Figure 3-3. This light source can
transilluminate a negative, slide, 
or transparency so that you can
use the flatbed to grab images
from transparent originals. These
scanners can do a good job in non-
critical applications.
✦Slide scanners are specialized scanners designed to scan slides and
transparencies. They often have the higher resolution needed for scan-
ning the 24mm x 36mm area of 35mm slides and often cost quite a bit
more than flatbed scanners. There are also dedicated transparency
scanners for larger size film, too, such as 120/220 roll film and sheet film,
including 4-x-5-inch, 5-x-7-inch, and larger sizes. They’re largely used by
professional graphics workers.
✦Photo scanners are simplified scanners that convert snapshots to digital
format. Deposit your standard-sized photo in the scanner, and it grabs
an image for you to edit. Photo scanners are sometimes mated with
color printers so that you can make copies of prints as quickly as you
can feed them into the scanner. Although popular at one time, this type
of scanner is no longer widely available.
What to look for in a scanner
When shopping for a scanner, you’ll want to look for a few important things.
Here’s a quick summary (see Book II, Chapter 4 for more details):
Figure 3-3: A light source built into the lid
allows a flatbed scanner to capture slides.

Book I
Chapter 3

Digital Pictures
Grabbing Digital Images of Prints and Slides
37
✦Resolution: Scanners generally have a lot more resolution than you need,
measured in samples per inch (spi). You’ll also see the terms dots per inch
and pixels per inch applied to scanners, even though scanners don’t have
dots (printers do) or pixels (monitors do). Scanner resolution varies from
600 x 600 spi to 2400 x 2400 spi or higher. Unless you’re scanning tiny, very
high-resolution originals (such as postage stamps), anything more than
300 or 600 spi is overkill. I explain why in Book II, Chapter 4. The difference
between 300 spi and 2400 spi resolution is shown in Figure 3-4.
Figure 3-4: A 300 spi scan of a small, detailed object (left) isn’t sharp enough. The 2400 spi 
scan (right) looks much better.
✦Color depth: This is the number of colors a scanner can capture. The
color depth is measured using something called bit depth. For example, a
24-bit scanner can capture 16.8 million different colors; a 30-bit scanner
can grab a billion colors; and a 36-bit or 48-bit scanner can differentiate
between . . . zillions of colors. You’ll never have an original with that
many different hues, however. In practice, the extra colors simply pro-
vide the scanner with an extended range (called dynamic range) so that
the scanner can capture detail in very dark areas of the image as well as
in very light areas.
✦Speed: Some scanners are faster than others. If you’re scanning a lot of
photos, you’ll want one that works quickly.

Letting a Professional Do It
38
✦Convenience: So-called “one-touch” scanners have buttons mounted on
the front panel so that you can trigger the scanner to make a copy (that’s
sent to your printer), scan to a file, route a scan to e-mail, capture text
with optical character recognition (OCR), or perform other functions.
✦Bundled software: The best scanners are furnished with an easy stand-
alone software interface plus a more professional scanning program that
gives you total control over every scanning function. You also get drivers
that let you access these interfaces from within programs, such as
Photoshop. You may even get Photoshop Elements bundled with the
scanner, plus software to create panoramas, build Web pages, manage
documents, and do other fun stuff.
✦Accessories: Some scanners include sheet feeders (for scanning a stack
of documents) or can be fitted with them as an option. Others have slide-
scanning attachments or built-in slide-scanning tools. Depending on the
kind of work you do, these accessories can be a perk or a necessity.
Letting a Professional Do It
Sometimes you don’t need to convert an image to digital format yourself.
Professional services can do that for you. These range from stand-alone
kiosks at your local department store (with a built-in scanner and printer) to
services that your local photofinisher offers. When you take in your film for
processing, your local lab can give you the same set of prints or slides that
you have always received or return your images already scanned onto a
Kodak Photo CD or Picture CD. Some mail-order firms offer the same service.
As long as your images are being scanned anyway, your professional service
may post them on the Internet for you — as Web pages or as files that you
can download directly to your computer. You can find more about these
options in Book VIII.

R
emember when getting free double prints of your photos was a big
deal? It was so convenient to have a spare copy of every photo on 
the roll. With the advent of digital cameras and scanners, however, the
excitement of double prints has worn off. Today, it’s routine for your local
digital print lab to offer double prints of every shot you took with
your digital camera, along with an index print or CD with all
your images on it. In addition, you can make as many
prints as you want at home with your own printer.
Today, the most exciting part of photography is that
you no longer need to put up with images that
don’t look exactly like you want them to. While a
retail digital print lab can make many fixes to your
images, you can apply these adjustments in your
own computer with an image editor. Why put up
with damaged images or photos that are too dark
or too light if you can fix them electronically?
With digital photography and a good image editor, you
have the power to reproduce and repair your own photos
or the photos others have taken, whether they originated 
digitally or were scanned from prints or slides. This chapter is an
overview of what’s possible with photo-editing software, which applications
do the best job for the money, and how to make some quick corrections 
of common photographic problems, such as fixing red-eye and removing
dust spots.

Choosing an Image-Editing Program
40
In this chapter, I also explain how you can improve the image quality and
content of your photos by removing the tell-tale signs of age, poor photo-
graphy, or bad lighting. (I even show you how to remove unwanted people or
things — ex-boyfriends/girlfriends and the like — from the picture.) If the
last remaining photo of a long-departed relative is looking shabby or has
faded with time, there’s no need for alarm or regret. Just open your favorite
image-editing application (some programs to consider are discussed later in
this chapter) and add color, remove spots, improve contrast, and in general
make the image look like new. For example, Figure 4-1 shows before and after
versions that illustrate how you can spruce up an old photo.
You can also remove unwanted content — that dumpster that nobody
noticed when the picture was taken or the brother-in-law you really don’t
miss — and replace it with more desirable stuff, such as a hedge, a pet, or an
extension of the background. You can make the photo look as though the
item was never there in the first place.
Figure 4-1: Here’s an old photo that’s faded and scratched (left) and spruced up in an image
editor (right).
Choosing an Image-Editing Program
In a digital photograph, you can fix just about anything — as long as your
image-editing program has the tools you need. You don’t want a program to
limit what you can do, but you don’t want to spend $600 when you could pay
just $100. This section helps you figure out what type of editor meets your
needs, and I offer you a guide to some of the different programs on the
market.

Determining your needs
If you’re using a powerful application, such as Photoshop Elements, the
repairs and improvements you can make are almost unlimited:
✦You can use a flexible and powerful set of selection tools to control
where the edits and repairs take place, preventing changes to areas of
the photo that are just fine as they are.
✦You have access to a nearly unlimited set of brush tools for painting,
drawing, and erasing anything you want.
✦You can use filters to blur and sharpen images.
✦You can work with a vast assortment of color, brightness, and contrast-
adjustment tools (see Figure 4-2) to fix the results of an overachieving
flash, a cloudy day, or old photo paper that allowed images to fade and
colors to change with time.
Figure 4-2: Tinker with color, brightness, and contrast to bring images back to life.
If you’re using Photoshop Elements, the tools at your disposal are virtually
the same set of tools found in the full version of Photoshop. Some of the fea-
tures that only hardcore professional photographers use have been weeded
out in Elements, but the basic set of tools and features is still there.
Checking out different applications
So how do you know which application to use? Your needs are your most
effective guide, but of course, your budget will have some impact as well.
After you start pricing these applications, you’ll notice that the prices vary

Choosing an Image-Editing Program
42
from more than $500 to less than $50. How can that be? Is the least expen-
sive software terrible? Is the priciest application great? No, and yes. It all
depends on what you want to be able to do, how intuitive you are with soft-
ware, and how much photo editing you’ll be doing.
You can find a more detailed comparison of the various software packages in
Book V, Chapter 3, but Table 4-1 gives you at least an overview of what vari-
ous applications have to offer. We discuss these and other applications in

Adobe Photoshop CS2 and Photoshop Elements
Photoshop CS2 is the photo-editing software for professional photographers,
graphic artists, Web designers, and the like. Photoshop Elements was
designed to put a good number of Photoshop’s tools in the home and small
business user’s price range. The interface for these two products was similar
until the most recent versions of Elements arrived dressed in a spiffy new
interface. They’re not “sit down and use it” applications. You’ll want to read
the guide that comes with either editor or buy a book about the software
(or use Book VI of this title).
The top-of-the-line software (Photoshop) costs as much as $649 for a full 
version, but it offers the most powerful set of image creation, editing, and
retouching tools you can lay your hands on. Photoshop Elements, which has
functions similar to Photoshop for the average person’s photo-editing needs,
is only $99. Considering that, it’s a steal at the price, and both Photoshop and
Photoshop Elements are available for both the Mac and Windows PCs. You
may even find Photoshop Elements bundled with your digital camera for free!
Corel Paint Shop Pro
Corel Paint Shop Pro is inexpensive (on par with Elements) and powerful.
The interface is pretty intuitive, and it lets you do all the standard image
editing stuff (resizing, cropping, rotating, color and contrast adjustments,
and adding textures). It has some quick and useful tools for eliminating red-
eye, scratches, tears, and so forth. If you feel intimidated by Photoshop or
aren’t big on using Help to figure stuff out, you’ll like Paint Shop Pro. It was
designed for regular folks, but it includes photographer-quality tools.
Corel PhotoPaint and Ulead PhotoImpact
Applications like Corel PhotoPaint and Ulead PhotoImpact are intended 
as true competitors to Photoshop, although neither does everything that
Photoshop can do. 
Corel Painter
Many serious digital photographers and artists own both Photoshop and
Painter because Painter’s natural media tools let you paint on image canvases
in ways that are completely different from what you can do with Adobe’s flag-
ship image editor.
Lower-end products, shareware, and freeware
The lower-end products — such as Ulead Photo Express and others you can
find by searching the Web — are great for quick adjustments to size, rotation,
and even simple color and contrast changes. If all you want to do is capture
images from your digital camera and make minor adjustments to their size

and general quality before sending them to friends via e-mail, these packages
may be just what you need. If you really want to restore and edit photographs
for prints or Web pages, you’ll probably be happier with one of the more 
powerful (and pricier) applications.
Want to find freeware and shareware for photo editing? Search for “Photo
Editing” at www.hotfiles.com or www.tucows.com. A search of either site’s
software libraries will yield a long list of downloadable freeware and share-
ware applications. Note that shareware is not free. If you keep and use the
product, be sure to pay its author or manufacturer — it’s the right (and
legal) thing to do.
Performing Photographic Triage
How do you decide what needs to be done to a given image? Well, some
problems are obvious. A torn photo (where the tear shows in the scanned
version) is in definite need of plastic surgery. A photo with a row of red-eye-
plagued children needn’t look like a lineup of demons. You can remove the
red-eye and return the little darlings to their normal states.
Some photos, however, have several problems, and you may not be sure
which problems to tackle first. There may be fading from age, scratches and
scuffs from improper storage, yellowing, stains, or maybe the picture was
too dark or too light from the start. If your photo suffers from two or more
problems, solving one might solve another if you attack them in the right
order. Here’s a series of tips to help you do a little image triage:
✦Handle structural problems first. If there’s a torn corner or a rip or hole
in the photo, scan the image and repair the tear first in your image
editor so that you’re working with an intact “canvas” as you continue to
fix other problems.
✦Adjust light and dark problems before tinkering with color. Why?
Because if you add color to an image and then adjust brightness and
contrast, the color added with the software can become too bright or
too dark or can change to a color you don’t want.
✦See if any of the content removal or replacing that you want to do will
solve other problems, as shown earlier in Figure 4-1, in which the miss-
ing left edge of the photo was fixed by removing the person standing
behind the boy on the bicycle. For example, if you need to get rid of a
person’s hand or shoulder, or some other content that was inadvertently
included in a shot, maybe replacing that content with something else
will also get rid of a big scratch that’s occurred on that part of the photo
as well.

Making Quick Fixes
For the purposes of this portion of the book, I use Photoshop Elements to
demonstrate some quick fixes, or simple, fast techniques for solving the most
common photographic problems. You can find similar techniques in other
applications, assuming the applications can perform these tasks to begin
with. If you’re still up in the air about which photo-editing program to use,
the inability to perform some of these quick fixes would be a good reason to
take one or more of your alternatives out of the running!
Fixing red-eye
Red-eye results from the camera flash reflecting off a subject’s retina. We’ve all
had it happen, especially when taking pictures of children who get too close to
the camera and of pets, whose pupils are quite large, letting in a lot more light.
So what do you do when your niece’s eyes look like two red marbles? You can
use tools designed specifically to get rid of red-eye (see Figure 4-3), or you can
use conventional editing tools to exorcise the demons that have possessed
your image.
Figure 4-3: This tool gets the red out!

To use the Photoshop Elements new-and-improved red-eye tool, follow these
steps:
1. Click the Red Eye Removal tool; it’s about halfway down the Tool
Palette when it’s docked (or press Y to select it).
2. Go to the Options bar that runs just above the document window and
make sure the Pupil Size and Darken Amount are both set to 50%.
3. Drag a rectangle around one eye, as shown in Figure 4-4 (or just click
in the area of the pupil and let Elements locate the red-eye unassisted).
You don’t have to be too precise. When you release the mouse button,
the Red Eye tool locates the red pupil, removes the red coloration, and
darkens it. (It works only with red pupils; the yellow or green pupils
found in animals are not affected.)
Figure 4-4: Drag a rectangle around the eye. You don’t have to 
be precise.
4. If the pupil is too dark, press Ctrl/Ô+Z to reverse the action and then
change the Darken Amount to a lower value and try again.
Your results should look like Figure 4-5.
5. Select the other eye, or try clicking inside the pupil. The Red Eye tool
works either way.

Figure 4-5: The Red Eye tool removes the red coloration from the pupil.
If your image editing software doesn’t have a red-eye tool, you can still get
rid of red eyes. Doing so just requires a few more steps and tools:
1. Set your application’s paintbrush tool to a size that matches the 
diameter of the red eye.
2. Manually choose a color to replace the red.
Choose a color that’s darker than the person’s real eye color so that the
colorization looks natural.
3. Zoom in tight on the eye so that you can apply the color to the right
spot.
4. Click with the brush to fill the red area.
This step should require just one click if your brush is set to the right size.
Removing dust spots
Dust spots and scratches are common problems for old photos or photos that
have been stored in desk drawers or shoeboxes or were tucked inside a book
or a wallet. If the front of a photo has been rubbing up against other stuff —
other photos, papers, pens and pencils — chances are that the photo has
highly visible scratches. Dust can collect in these scratches, compounding the
problem, or you may simply have scanned the photo without dusting it off
first. Mold, things spilled on the photo, or just places where the emulsion has
cracked and come off the photo can also create small, unpleasant blemishes.
Any image editing program provides the basic tools to clean up this sort of
defect. Although the Clone or Rubber Stamp tool (discussed later in this

Making Quick Fixes
48
chapter) is useful for touching up dust, if the background is a solid color,
you can use your software’s Paintbrush tool instead, along with color selec-
tion tools, to correct the problem by following these steps:
1. Use your program’s Eye Dropper tool to sample the color near the
scratch, spot, or stain. If you’re using Photoshop Elements, skip to
Step 2.
Most applications have an Eye Dropper tool for selecting a color in the
image and setting it as the paint color. You’ll use the color you choose to
paint over your blemish.
2. Click the Paintbrush in the tool palette to activate it, and if possible,
set the size of the brush so that you control how much color is
applied. (If you’re using Elements, hold down the Alt/Option key
while clicking near the dust spot to sample the color; you don’t need
to access the Eye Dropper tool directly.)
Be sure to use a very small brush so you don’t paint over nonblemished
areas — to do so can leave obvious signs of the touch-up.
3. Zoom in on the area you want to touch up and then click and drag in
the image to paint that color over the blemish, as shown in Figure 4-6.
Figure 4-6: The Paintbrush tool can touch up dust spots on a solid background.

If your image editing software has filters or other similar tools designed
specifically for cleaning up an image, you can use them instead of repairing
the spot or scratch manually. Photoshop Elements includes a Dust &
Scratches filter, which allows you to select the portion of the photo to repair,
and it provides settings so that you can control to what degree the photo is
cleaned up. Figure 4-7 shows the Dust & Scratches filter dialog box, which
you open by choosing Filter➪Noise➪Dust & Scratches.
To use the filter, follow these steps:
1. Select the area to be repaired, using
any of Photoshop Elements’ selec-
tion tools.
2. Open the Dust & Scratches dialog
box by choosing Filter➪Noise➪
Dust & Scratches.
3. Inside the dialog box, adjust the slid-
ers by dragging both the Radius and
Threshold sliders to the far left.
4. Ease back the Radius slider, drag-
ging it slowly to the right until you
see the scratches and spots in the
preview area disappear.
You may have to tinker with the slid-
ers to achieve a pleasing result.
5. When you like how the preview looks, click OK to apply the repairs to
the selected area in your photo.
If the entire surface of your photo is damaged, you can select the whole thing
or repeat the filter procedure on several different selected areas. The latter
approach is probably best, unless the damage is absolutely uniform over the
entire image. If it isn’t, then you’ll benefit from applying different levels of 
the Dust & Scratches filter to the different areas of the image.
Don’t go too far when removing scratches and dust because you could end
up with a blurry image or a portion thereof that looks obviously smoothed
out. If the photo is old or is clearly an amateur photo, nobody expects
absolute perfection, and going too far in removing every little tiny blemish
can have an undesirable effect overall. However, Photoshop and Photoshop
Elements share a handy feature under the Edit menu: You can choose to
revert to a previous version of your image — and you can do this in steps if
you go too far in the correction process.
Figure 4-7: The Preview window shows
how the settings affect the final results.

Correcting color
Colors on printed photos can fade, and scanning a photo can magnify this
problem. If you take a picture with a digital camera, you can lose color accu-
racy and depth, depending on the quality of the camera, the lighting at the
time, and the file format and quality you choose when you save the captured
image to your computer. No matter what the cause, though, your image-
editing software should offer at least one or two options for fixing the color
in a photo. These options are either automatic correction tools that do an
all-over sweep for bad color or manually controlled tools that allow you to
increase or decrease tones in your image.
In Photoshop Elements, the quickest fix is the Auto Levels command, which
you can employ by using the following steps:
1. Issue the Auto Levels command by choosing Enhance➪Auto Levels.
After it’s issued, the Auto Levels command goes over your entire image (or
a portion thereof if you made a selection first) and adjusts the color levels.
2. You can repeat the process for further adjustments or press Ctrl+Z
(Ô+D on the Mac) to undo it if you don’t like the results.
Figures 4-8 and 4-9 show before and after views of the same photo.

Figure 4-9: . . . producing results that look like this.
Typically, even the lower-end image editing applications offer a similar tool for
correcting color quickly. If your application doesn’t offer this tool or doesn’t
do what you want, you can switch to
a more effective application.
Photoshop Elements offers a handful
of commands (each with its own
dialog box) that allow you to adjust
brightness, contrast, tones, hues,
and color casts. You can find these
tools on the Enhance menu, under
the Color and Brightness and
Contrast submenus. Figure 4-10
shows the dialog box that appears if
you choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪
Hue/Saturation. The box’s three 
sliders are for adjusting Hue (color),
Figure 4-10: Adjust multiple color attributes
all in the same dialog box.

52
Saturation (amount of color), and Lightness (amount of white in the colors).
To use this and similar dialog boxes, simply drag the sliders for whatever
levels you are able to adjust (Hue, Saturation, and Lightness in this case) 
and watch the Preview. When you like what you see, click OK to apply the
changes to your image. You can find out more about these specific tools in
various chapters in Book VI, which focuses on Photoshop and Photoshop
Elements.
Restoring, Replacing, and Removing 
Photographic Content
When my aunt was a child, she liked to draw on photos, especially those
that included pictures of my mom. So we have a lot of old pictures with
crayon and pencil strokes on them, and many of those strokes run through
people’s faces and parts of the picture that you couldn’t crop away without
losing the charm of the image. Other photos in our family’s collection are
torn or ripped, bear deep scratches, and generally look tattered. I’ve sal-
vaged many battered photos by using Photoshop and Photoshop Elements
to replace the missing content. Various tools in these applications enable
you to take content from another spot in the photo and use that content
to rebuild what’s missing. For example, in the photo shown in Figure 4-11,
rough handling resulted in a tear, and an unfortunate fold cost this photo
its corner. Figure 4-12 shows the image after I repaired it.
Figure 4-11: A photo with tears and lost content.
Another problem you might encounter is unwanted content. Perhaps a truck
is parked in front of the house you’re trying to sell, and you can’t take the
picture without including the truck. Never fear — if you have the right soft-
ware, you can easily get rid of the truck and replace it with a curb, grass, and

Book I
Chapter 4
Editing or Restoring
a Photo

Restoring, Replacing, and Removing Photographic Content
53
even a few shrubs that may not really exist. You can do the same thing to get
rid of people in a picture or to add people (or pets!) to a photo when they
weren’t there the day the picture was taken. How do you think the tabloids
make it look like two people who haven’t really even met went to a party
together? Is that really Elvis in the background of Lisa Marie’s wedding? It’s
all a matter of taking existing content, placing it in the image, and leaving
unwanted or unimportant content in its wake.
Figure 4-12: I restored the missing parts by using other content 
in the image.
Replacing missing or unwanted content
So you want to replace a missing corner, which was lost to a big rip or deep
scratch, or you want to cover up something that’s undesirable in the photo.
You can use a variety of tools, and most of the more powerful image editing
applications let you take content from one spot in the image and repeat it in
another spot. To finish the job, you may need tools to make the pasted con-
tent blend in, and those tools are normally available even in midrange image
editing applications.
The tools you use to replace the missing content or cover up the unwanted
content depend on the size of the area being filled. To cover a thin seam
(such as a deep scratch) or fix a tiny corner, you can use the Clone Stamp in
Photoshop or Photoshop Elements (other higher-end applications have their
own versions). If the missing or unwanted content represents a large area of
the image, it’s better to copy and paste content from one part of the photo to
another. I explain both techniques in this section.
Figure 4-13 shows a shot of two gargoyles perched on the Cathedral of Notre
Dame in Paris. Unfortunately, a guard-rail protrudes on the image. The Clone
Stamp is the best bet for getting rid of that rail.

Restoring, Replacing, and Removing Photographic Content
54
Figure 4-13: Cloning can remove the guard-rail.
If you use the Clone Stamp, you can paint other content into the area that’s
lacking, filling as much or as little as you want. If you use the copy-and-paste
technique, you may have to paste repeatedly to fill in the missing content.
Fixing small areas
To replace content in a small area with the Clone Stamp, follow these steps:
1. Click the Clone Stamp in the tool palette to activate it.
2. Choose an appropriately sized brush.
3. Find the spot that contains the content you want to use to cover some-
thing else.
Zoom in if necessary to zero in on the spot.
4. Press and hold the Alt key (or the Option key if you’re on a Mac) and
click to sample that spot.
Now, the software knows this is the area you want to clone and use 
elsewhere. The size of your brush dictates the size of the sampled area.
You can set the brush size on the Options bar while the Clone Stamp is
active.
5. Now, click the spot that you want to cover to deposit the cloned content,
as shown in Figure 4-14.
You can click over and over, and the cloned content appears wherever you
click.

55
Figure 4-14: Your copied content is painted over the guardrail.
Be sure to turn off the Aligned option on the Clone Stamp Options bar so
that the original sampled spot is used as the source each time you click to
deposit the cloned content. If Aligned is on, the Clone Stamp continuously
resamples content, and you can end up with undesirable results.
Fixing larger areas
To replace larger areas with the Edit, Copy, and Paste commands, follow
these steps:
1. Using the Marquee or Lasso tool, select the area you want to use to
cover up something else in the image, as shown in Figure 4-15.
You can find more information about these selection tools in Book VI,
Chapter 1.
2. Choose Edit➪Copy from the main menu. 
You can also press Ctrl+C on a Windows computer or Ô+C on a Mac to
do the same thing.
This places a duplicate of the selected area in your computer’s memory,
and it waits there until you tell your software where to place the copied
content.

Restoring, Replacing, and Removing Photographic Content
56
3. Paste the content by choosing Edit➪Paste from the main menu. 
The keyboard shortcut for this is Ctrl+V for Windows and Ô+V for Macs.
4. Click the Move tool in the Tool palette to activate it and then drag the
pasted content into the desired position.
5. Blur the edges of the added content so that it blends with the rest of
the photo.
If you’re not sure how, read on.
Figure 4-15: Select the area you want to use to cover up 
something else.
Adding the finishing touches
After you’ve positioned your cloned or pasted content, you can use the Blur
tool to blend any obvious sharp edges. To do so, follow these steps:
1. Click the Blur tool to select it. 
2. Using a small brush size, scrub (brush) over the edges of the pasted
content to make the edges disappear.
The content should look as if it were always there, as shown in Figure 4-16.

57
Figure 4-16: The guardrail and overlapping gargoyle are gone!
If you merge the layers of your image (Layer➪Merge Visible), the photo
becomes one layer again, and you can blur both the pasted content and the
surrounding content, all with one stroke.
Rearranging parts of the picture
Moving part of your image requires selecting it with the Marquee or Lasso
tools (or the equivalent tools in the software you’ve chosen to use). After you
select the content, you activate the Move tool and then drag the selection to
a new spot.

Restoring, Replacing, and Removing Photographic Content
58
One thing to remember when moving content is that it leaves a hole where
the content originally was. The hole is filled with the current background
color, which is normally white. If you want to move content and also leave it
in place, press and hold the Alt key (or Option key if you’re using a Mac) as
you drag. A duplicate of the content is moved, instead of the original con-
tent, as shown in Figure 4-17.
If you’re wondering whether you can move content between images, the
answer is yes — if you’re using the higher-end image editing applications.
Some of the lower-end applications don’t allow more than one image to be
open at a time, making it impossible to drag content from one image onto
another or to easily use the Edit➪Copy command in one image and then use
the Edit➪Paste command in another image.
Figure 4-17: Holding down the Alt/Option key as you drag a selection creates a duplicate 
of the selection.

Getting rid of unwanted content
After you select an area of your image by using any of the selection tools,
you can press the Delete key to get rid of it. Doing so leaves a hole, and the
background color shows through. You can then use any tool you want —
such as the Paintbrush or the Paint Bucket (which fills the area with a solid
color or a pattern) — to occupy the hole where the content used to be.
You can also use the Clone Stamp or the Edit➪Copy and Edit➪Paste com-
mands to fill the hole with content from elsewhere in the image.
Another way to get rid of content in one place, but to not lose the content 
altogether, is to use the Edit➪Cut command. This command removes content,
but instead of simply deleting it forever, the content is placed in the com-
puter’s memory (in a space called the Clipboard), where it waits for you to
paste it somewhere. This is similar to the copy-and-paste process, except for
the fact that the Cut command deletes the selected content where it currently
is. The Paste portion of the process is the same, whether you use Cut or Copy.

e all have at least one box or drawer full of photos that we’ve never
had the time to put in an album — vacation photos, pictures of the
family at holiday dinners for the last 10 years, even collections of vintage
photos, all waiting for someone to take them out of their envelopes and put
them in a book so that people can actually look at them. What about your
digital photos? They may not be languishing in a drawer, but if they’re
in different folders scattered all over your hard drive, they may
as well be in a shoebox under the bed.
The most important things you can do with your digital
images are first to organize them and then to store
them in a way that keeps them safe from accidental
erasure, unwanted changes, or loss due to fire,
flood, or computer meltdown. You can easily
achieve the proper organization and reliable stor-
age of your digital images, and plenty of tools are at
your disposal to make it all happen. The key, how-
ever, is to do it — so don’t put it off any longer!
Organizing Your Photos
When it comes to taking control of your photo organization, you
have a few different approaches to choose from. Your personality, your 
computer, and your access to the Web all dictate your choice. Here are
some approaches to consider:
✦Setting up a file structure on your computer
✦Working with software that makes it easy to organize and store your
images and view them through a special interface
✦Organizing and storing your images in an online gallery

Organizing Your Photos
62
What do I mean about your personality influencing your choice of organiza-
tional tools? If you’re a very organized person who enjoys straightening out
closets and dresser drawers, always knows where the remotes are, and
always puts things away after using them, then using the file management
tools already on your computer might appeal to you.
If, on the other hand, you aren’t too tidy and often forget where you left your
glasses or your keys, you might prefer either using software that organizes
things for you or posting your images to an online gallery. The tidy person
might like these latter approaches as well.
Using your computer’s file-management tools
You already have some great tools for organizing your images, and the tools
have been on your computer all along. If you’re running Windows, you have
My Computer and Windows Explorer right there at your fingertips. If you’re
using a Mac, you can use the file-management tools that you’ve already been
using to create folders on your desktop or hard drive.
Using these tools requires devising some sort of filing system — one or more
folders that will help you categorize your images. You might start with one
called Photos and create subfolders called, perhaps, Family Photos, Vacation
Pictures, and Scanned Vintage Photos. You can create folders on your com-
puter for whatever groupings fit the pool of images you have. After you create
the folders, all you have to do is move your images into the appropriate fold-
ers and remember the folder names when you store new images in the future.
Using Windows Explorer to store and organize your photos
Working with folders under Windows is pretty basic but deserves a review in
the context of organizing your digital image files. To create folders to store
your images by using Windows Explorer, follow these simple steps:
1. Choose Start➪Programs➪Windows Explorer.
You can also right-click the Start button and choose Explore from the
context menu.
2. When Windows Explorer opens, click the C: drive icon (see Figure 5-1).
If there’s a plus sign next to the icon, click that plus sign to display the
folders currently on the drive. If there’s a minus sign next to the icon,
that means you can already see all the folders.
The Windows Explorer window is divided into two panes: the Folder
pane on the left and the Content pane on the right. When you click a
drive or folder in the Folder pane, that drive’s or folder’s contents are
displayed in the Content pane. This two-sided display makes it possible
to drag items from one folder to another simply by displaying the source

Book I
Chapter 5
Storing and
Organizing Your
Digital Photos
Organizing Your Photos
63
(where the content is now) and target (where you want the content to
be) folders in the separate panes.
If you don’t see the Folder pane, you can open it either by choosing
View➪Explorer Bar➪Folders or by clicking the Folders button on the
toolbar.
Figure 5-1: Navigate your hard drive to locate the folder you want to use.
3. If there’s a My Pictures or other folder you want to use as the basis 
for your image organization, click it. If you want to start a new 
folder for your photos, choose File➪New➪Folder from the menu bar.
If you go the New Folder route, a New Folder appears in the Content
pane, with its temporary name highlighted, waiting for you to type its
real name (see Figure 5-2).
4. If you go the New Folder route, give your new folder a name and press
Enter to confirm it. 
With a folder created to house some or all of your photos, you can begin to
place them in a single location. You can also make subfolders in that main
folder to categorize your photos. For example, if you have a Photos folder,
you can create a Vacation Photos subfolder and a Baby Pictures subfolder to

Organizing Your Photos
64
keep those two, distinct photo subjects separate. Figure 5-3 shows just such
a folder system.
Figure 5-2: Create a new folder if necessary.
To create subfolders of the main folder, simply click the main folder to select
it (on the left side of the screen, in the Folders pane), and repeat Steps 3 
and 4 from the preceding steps list. You’re going to use the File➪New➪
Folder command to create a new folder, but because you’re in an existing
folder when you do it, the new folder appears inside the active folder.
The process is like taking one of those green hanging Pendaflex folders and
putting one or more manila folders in it. The green folder represents the main
Photos folder, and each of the manila folders is the same as the subfolders
you create to categorize your photos. You can create as many subfolders as
you want, and even create subfolders within subfolders. The folder hierarchy
can become as complex as you want or need it to be, but be careful not to
make managing files so cumbersome that the process becomes confusing
when you need to place an image in the right folder.
If you don’t need to categorize your photos by subject, consider creating
folders that separate your photos by date. You can have a separate folder 
for individual years, months, or weeks, depending on how prolific a photo-
grapher you are.
Working with My Computer
You can also use the My Computer program on your Windows-based computer,
and it works much like Windows Explorer. Instead of a two-paned window, how-
ever, you have separate windows for each drive and folder on your computer.
The command for creating new folders is the same (File➪New➪Folder), but
you have a visually different environment in which to work when creating and
using your folders. Figure 5-4 shows the main My Computer window, displaying
the C: drive, D: drive, E: drive, and other computer components.

Organizing your photo images on a Mac
If you’re using Mac OS, you can easily create folders to store your photos
and other digital images. You can choose to store them on your hard drive
or make them quickly accessible from your ever-visible desktop. 
To create a new folder in OS X, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪New Folder from the menu bar.
A folder called Untitled Folder appears on the desktop. You can also
press Shift+Ô+N, or Control-click the desktop and choose New Folder
from the context menu that appears.
2. Give your folder a short yet relevant name that will make it easy to
find the folder in the future.
3. You can leave the folder on the desktop or open your hard drive and
drag the folder there.
If you store the folder on the desktop, it is quickly available at any time,
but you also make it quickly available to anyone using your computer.
If you don’t want people poking around in your photos, store the new
folder somewhere on your hard drive other than the desktop.
4. If you want folders within the folder you just created, open the folder
and then repeat Steps 1 through 3 to create the subfolders.
You can duplicate an existing folder by choosing File➪Duplicate. Alternatively,
drag the existing folder to a new location on the same hard drive while holding
down the Option button; this approach makes a copy of the original folder and
leaves the original where it was.
Using photo album software
Setting up a series of folders to store and categorize your images is easy
enough. To view them after they’re stored, however, you either have to
open them in the software you used to edit/retouch them or use the generic
software that came with your computer to see the images. If you find that
inconvenient (and you probably will, especially if you like to look at and
work with your images frequently or to view them side by side), you’ll proba-
bly be glad to know that several great photo-album applications are on the
market. (I list a selection of them in Book V, Chapter 3.) These applications
enable you to view one, two, or several of your images at the same time, all
in one easily navigated workspace. 
Figure 5-5 shows a group of photos viewed through Adobe Photoshop
Album, which started out as a standalone application but is now part of
Photoshop Elements. Similar programs are often furnished with cameras and
software bundles from other vendors.

amazon.com, where you can do similar searches for the photo album soft-
ware each site has to offer.
Your criteria for actually selecting photo album software is a personal thing.
You may prefer ease of use and not care if you don’t get a lot of fancy func-
tionality. If you want a lot of bells and whistles, you may not mind it if the
product is a little more complicated to use. Some photo album software
serves as both an organizational tool and a vehicle for creative display of
your photos, and some just do the latter job. If you already have a system for
organizing your images, you may not need software that does double duty.
You can download and test many photo album products for free (with a time
or number-of-uses limitation), making it possible to test-drive two or more
products before plunking down any cash and making a commitment. It pays
to shop around if you plan to use this software frequently. ThumbsPlus,
available for evaluation at www.cerious.com/download.shtml, is shown in
Figure 5-6. Other popular album applications include ACDSee, iPhoto, and
Adobe Bridge, a standalone program included with many Adobe products,
including Photoshop and Elements.

Here are some features to look for when choosing photo album software:
✦Ability to categorize and classify each photo, using built-in or custom-
designed categories
✦Provision for adding your own captions and other annotations
✦Search capabilities, so that you can locate all the images classified as
Vacation pictures by using keywords such as beach and 2006
✦Sorting abilities, so that you can permanently or temporarily arrange
your photos by filename or other criteria (these features go hand-in-
hand with search capabilities)
✦Features for uploading from your local album to your own Web space
or picture sharing services, such as SmugMug (www.smugmug.com) or
PBase (www.pbase.com)
✦Viewing capabilities that include looking at single photos and arranging
them into slide shows
✦Simple image-editing features such as cropping, resizing, and rotating, so
that you can make small changes to your pictures without firing up your
image editor

Using online galleries
You probably already e-mail photos to friends, sending the images as mes-
sage attachments that the recipients must open to view. Then, your recipi-
ents can save any images they want to keep on their hard drives. There may
be a better way to share your images, assuming you don’t mind having your
images posted on the Internet, by using online galleries to display your
photos. This section is an overview of using online galleries. You’ll find a
complete look at this valuable tool, including a discussion of some leading
gallery providers in Book VIII.
The online approach to image distribution has some great advantages and
some drawbacks. Check out the advantages first:
✦You can avoid the hassle of having to e-mail photos to lots of different
individuals because you’re placing all your photos on one Web site.
All you have to do is let people know to check the site for your images.
This makes it possible to share images that are larger than some e-mail
services can handle (many services have a 2MB limit).
✦You can share more images with more people. Anyone with an Internet
connection can view the images without owning any special software —
other than a browser, which people need to surf the Web anyway.
✦You have yet another relatively protected repository for your images. 
If you lose the original files, you can download them from the online
gallery.
Possible disadvantages — and only you can decide if they are real 
disadvantages — are as follows:
✦Your photos are on the Web, and, unless you use the provider’s privacy
provisions, anyone can view them. This can expose you and your family
to people with whom you would not normally share your vacation, 
holiday, and otherwise personal photos. You have to be careful about
posting photos that show your house number, last name, or any other
identifying information.
✦Most online galleries charge a fee for providing space on their site for
your photos. The fees are usually reasonable, but compared to e-mailing
photos, which is free (you’re already paying to have e-mail anyway), the
cost may be more than you’re willing to pay.
To find an online gallery to post your photos, you can search online for
“Online Galleries”. You’ll see quite a few that are devoted to actual artists
(and this may be of interest if you are an artist), and some that are for the
general public to use. If you add “+free” to the search criteria, you’ll ferret
out those sites that offer the space for free or that will let you test their 
services for free or for a limited time.

Archiving and Backing Up Photos

Archiving and Backing Up Photos
Not all your photos will require instant, easy access. Vacation photos from the
past — especially if you visited a not-too-exciting place — may be a waste of
valuable hard-drive real estate. But what if you don’t want to delete those
infrequently viewed images? There’s no reason to make rash decisions; you
can simply archive the ones you don’t need to access quickly or frequently. If 
a photo is valuable to you on some level in the long run, but you don’t imagine
wanting to look at or print it within the foreseeable future, just save it to 
disc — a CD or DVD.
Backing up your best shots
First, because you’ve already organized your photos (assuming you’ve
read the beginning of this chapter), you should already have your photos
categorized and know which ones are especially dear to you. These cher-
ished shots need to be backed up, stored in some way in order to protect
them from anything that can happen to your computer or your photo
albums (printed or electronic).
Your backup options are simple:
✦Store the photos on a spare hard drive. This isn’t as freaky as it sounds.
Plug-in external hard drives that connect to your USB or FireWire port
may cost less than $100, and they can make a large-capacity, relatively
inexpensive backup system. External hard drives in sizes of 160GB or
less can cost less than $100 and will hold thousands of images. You can
unhook the drive and store it in a safe place when you’re not actually
using the images you’ve backed up. Of course, hard drives are prone to
failure (eventually), and even an extra external drive shouldn’t be used as
your only backup destination.
✦Write them to a disc, using a CD or DVD burner. This method enables
you to store up to 800MB on a single CD, or almost 5GB on a DVD. If your
computer already has a burner in it or attached to it, all you need is a
package of writeable CDs or DVDs. The discs are so inexpensive that you
can make two copies. To be 100-percent safe, you should plan on copying
your important discs to fresh media every few years. Even good-quality
CDs and DVDs can “fade” over time. Also plan to copy your media to
whatever new kind of storage replaces CDs and DVDs five or ten years
down the road. You don’t want to end up with “antique” discs and no
way to access them!
✦Store them online. Many Web sharing sites also can provide you with 
a sort of backup for your images. It’s best to use these as a secondary
backup (sort of as a backup to your backup) because there’s no guarantee
how long these services will be around!

Using CD-R and CD-RW
For a brief period, virtually every computer sold came with a built-in CD
burner. These have largely been supplanted by combo drives that can burn
both CDs and DVDs. So it’s very likely that your computer has a burner of
some sort that can make archival copies on CDs.
With the ability to write to a CD, you now can save up to 800MB of data on a
very reliable medium. Unlike older magnetic media, such as floppy and Zip
disks (remember them?) that could be ruined by exposure to magnets, heat,
cold, sunlight, water, and rough handling, CDs are pretty stable. Other than
breaking or scratching them, you can’t really hurt them. They might eventu-
ally fade on their own, but it won’t be your fault!
Although DVDs are the new (if temporary) standard, the old CD format still
has a lot of life left in it. Here’s a refresher course in CD media:
✦Writeable CDs come in two types: CD-R and CD-RW. CD-Rs can be written
to (the R stands for Recordable), but only once. CD-RWs can be written to
and erased, and written to again.
✦You can use a CD-R or a CD-RW like a floppy or Zip disk by using a mode
called Packet Writing. In that mode, you can copy files or groups thereof
to the CD. However, you can’t interrupt the writing process as you can
with a floppy or Zip disk, and the process takes a bit longer.
✦Commercial CDs (like the discs that contain software or audio tracks) are
pressed from a mold. CD-Rs and CD-RWs are marked with a laser, creating
spots that represent data (in binary form). CDs are virtually indestructible
(unless you crack, break, or severely scratch them) and can withstand a
sunny day in the car or a night below freezing in that same glove box. Even
so, CD-Rs and CD-RWs shouldn’t be exposed to direct sunlight or extreme
heat, although they are less vulnerable to such conditions than floppy or
Zip disks.
DVD storage
DVD burners have largely replaced CD-only burners in most computers.
Indeed, the older single-layer, 4.8GB DVD drives are themselves being phased
out by double-layer drives that can record 8.5GB of data. In the home theater
arena, there’s even a bit of fierce competition going on between Blu-Ray style
and HD-DVD formats, which can handle as much as 50GB of information!
For the digital photographer, plain old 4.8GB DVD drives make a lot of sense
until the technology settles down more. For one thing, single-layer DVDs 
cost much less than half what dual-layer blank discs sell for. And you can be
assured that your dual-layer drive will read your old single-layer discs when
you do migrate. The only real problem with sticking with the older technology
right now is that the 4.8GB drives are becoming harder to find.

Archiving and Backing Up Photos
72
Like CDs, DVDs also come in more than one variety:
✦DVDs (the prerecorded kind) come with stuff prewritten to them. You
can view what’s on them, but you can’t erase and then rewrite to them.
✦DVD+R and DVD-R discs (note the use of the plus and minus signs) can
be written to only once. The plus/minus varieties are separate formats,
but most drives and burners can read both types. The -R version can be
slightly more compatible with some television DVD players.
✦DVD+RW and DVD-RW discs can be written to, erased, and written to
again.
✦DVD+/-RW burner/players can play DVD discs and play or write to DVD+/-R
and DVD+/-RW discs.
If your older computer has a DVD player in it, that doesn’t mean you can
write to DVDs; it simply means you can play them. To write to a DVD,
you need the burner version.
✦DVD Dual Layer discs require a dual-layer compatible drive or player.
Offsite storage for maximum safety
If your photos are so precious that you’d be devastated if anything happened
to them, or if they’re important for legal, financial, or other compelling rea-
sons, don’t risk losing them to a fire or burglary. You can store your archives
off-site in one of three ways:
✦Use a bank safe deposit box.
✦Use a safe located in a secure storage facility.
✦Arrange to keep one of two archive copies with a friend or family member.
If you save your precious images to a CD or DVD, you can make two sets and
store one set offsite, selecting one of the aforementioned places based on
the level of security you need. The bank could burn down, but the safe
deposit boxes are usually in or near the vault and are protected from very
high temperatures, even in the event of a fire. If you keep a safe in a paid 
offsite storage space, the place is likely to be fireproof or well-protected by
sprinklers and video cameras, so it’s probably more secure than your home.
If neither of these is an option, find a friend or relative you trust and give the
extra set to him or her.

U
ntil the cost of those huge flat-panel digital displays that hang on the
wall like a picture frame dip below their current stratospheric price
levels, you’ll probably want to use hard-copy prints of your best digital 
pictures to decorate your home or office. You’ll also find that prints are
more fun to pass around when you’re sharing your vacation with
coworkers. And have you ever tried to tuck an electronic
image of a loved one in your wallet?
No, prints are here to stay. Digital technology is just
making prints easier for anyone to produce. Instead
of stacks of photos of every single picture you’ve
ever taken (plus shoeboxes full of “lost” negatives),
you can have great-looking enlargements of the
photos you want to keep, perfectly cropped and
carefully corrected in your image editing program.
The ability to make prints is one of the best things
about digital photography.
An alternative to sharing prints is sharing your pictures
online through commercial sharing services or your own
personal Web space. Such options let friends and colleagues
view your photos even if they aren’t close by.
This chapter provides a quick overview of printing and printers and picture
sharing services. You can find a lot more detail in Book VIII.

Creating Prints on Demand
74
Creating Prints on Demand
One of the reasons you’ll want a printer for your digital camera is the sheer
joy of being able to produce your own prints any time in only a few minutes.
If you’re used to dropping off negatives at a local photofinishing outlet and
then waiting hours or even overnight to get sparkling 5-x-7-inch enlargements,
you’ll love your color printer.
For example, on the day I began this chapter, I was called over to my daugh-
ter’s school to take a picture of her science class performing the infamous
Egg Drop experiment. I snapped off a couple shots of carefully-cushioned
eggs surviving (hopefully) a two-story plummet and then ran home and
made two 5-x-7-inch enlargements (one for the class, and one for our local
newspaper). It actually took longer to write the caption for the newspaper
than it did to print the photos. Less than 30 minutes after the last egg fell to
an untimely end, I returned to the school with prints in hand. Try that with a
film camera!
Color printers have never been cheaper or more ubiquitous. Our local super-
market sells $50 inkjet printers in the school and office supplies aisle, just
across from the microwave ovens. It’s a 24/7 market, too, so if I’m ever stuck
in the middle of a project at 3 a.m., I can dash out and pick up some ink or
even a whole new printer before sunrise.
Here are your main options for making prints from digital cameras:
✦Use your local MegaMart’s print kiosk. These typically accept a broad
range of digital media, from CompactFlash and Secure Digital film cards
to CDs or Picture CDs. They let you choose a photo, crop, rotate, and
resize your pictures, maybe add some text, and perform other simple
manipulations using a touch-screen video display. When you’re happy
with your picture, press a button and wait a few minutes until your
photo emerges. If you don’t make many prints, this can be a viable
option. The quality will be equal to or better than the prints you can
make at home.
✦Try out your retailer’s digital lab. You didn’t think that photofinishers
would roll over and play dead after film was abandoned by a fickle
public, did you? Although dropping off your film for overnight process-
ing may be an activity that’s riding off into the sunset, many finishers are
building a thriving business from making prints, enlargements, and spe-
cialty items from your digital images. Many retailers now have in-store
digital minilabs that can accept your digital film and produce prints
while you wait. There are many advantages to this approach. For one
thing, your retailer can probably make prints a lot more cheaply than
you can, can do it faster, and can give you better quality.
✦Do it yourself with an inkjet printer. Inkjet printers can produce prints
that look exactly like traditional silver-based photographs, on glossy or

matte paper, at a cost of about $1.00 for large prints and about $0.25 per
snapshot. Most digital photographers own an inkjet printer, and unless
you are very fussy, they’ll do the job for you.
✦Upgrade to alternative technologies. Other types of printers, such as
dye-sublimation printers, thermal wax printers, and solid wax printers,
do a great job with color photos. Of these, only dye-sub printers are still
easy to find, with Kodak and Olympus among the vendors offering high-
quality dye-sublimation printers that are actually economical enough to
compete with inkjets. You can find more information about all these
printers in Book II, Chapter 4.
Getting the Most from Your Printer and Supplies
If you want to get the best from any of these printers, just follow a few
simple tips:
✦Calibrate your monitor so that what you see is what you get in your
prints. Check the manual that came with your image editing software for
instructions on calibrating your monitor to your application.
✦Use the best-quality glossy photographic paper you can afford. You can’t
go wrong using the paper recommended by your printer manufacturer.
✦Clean your inkjet’s print heads from time to time and keep the paper
path clean to avoid visible lines or blurry prints.
✦Wait until your prints are completely dry before you touch them. Wet ink
can smear easily, which spoils a $1 investment.
✦Have fun with those special printing media offered to let you make trans-
parencies or T-shirt transfers, print on fabrics, or create greeting cards.
✦Don’t ruin a perfectly good sheet of paper by making a print that’s too
large for your digital camera’s resolution (and thus comes out a bit fuzzy-
looking). Table 6-1 shows good sizes and maximum sizes for typical digital
camera resolutions, past and present.

Sharing Your Photos
You can always e-mail your photos to friends and colleagues, but there’s a
better way. You can post them to your own Web site or use one of the com-
mercial photo sharing services. You can share your vacation photos, pictures
from school, and brag shots of your new house or car, or you can create an
online holiday newsletter.
Your ISP (Internet Service Provider) probably provides some free Web space
you can use to create pages for your pictures. Check with your provider for
instructions on how to use this space. Even easier is using the services pro-
vided by online companies like SmugMug, Yahoo!, and PBase. Their Web sites
lead you hand-in-hand through the process.
If you use an online sharing system or online gallery to display your images,
you’ll find that many of them offer some space for free. In the case of an
online community, such as America Online, your monthly fee to AOL includes
access to the company’s AOL Pictures (formerly You’ve Got Pictures) feature,
which enables you and others to view your images online. You get free Web
space, too, which you can use to store and display your photos.
Other commercial sharing services known as online galleries allow you to
post your images for free in exchange for posting a few ads on your Web
pages. Other sites make their money through software they sell, such as
image editing or photo album applications.
Some sites, like Kodak’s EasyShare Gallery, let you upload your photos for
viewing but also offer the ability to send picture postcards and order prints,
enlargements, mugs, T-shirts, and other related items.

treasures online.

hoosing the right digital camera has gotten a lot more
exciting recently! Digital single lens reflex (dSLR)
cameras — the ones that have interchangeable 
lenses and show you an optical (not electronic) 
preview image through the same lens that takes the
picture — have dipped under the $1,000 price point
and are nosing around the $600 neighborhood,
making them a reasonable choice for many more
serious amateur photographers. Affordable 
8-megapixel (and up) cameras provide sharper,
better pictures without busting your wallet. Digital
cameras are becoming smaller and easier to use and
are packed with special features we never dreamed were
possible as recently as a year ago. This is a great time to be
choosing a digital camera, whether you’re a snapshooter or a
dedicated photo hobbyist.
Yet, selecting the right digital camera isn’t as daunting a task as it might
appear to be on the surface, even with the increased number of features and
options to choose from. Most of the leading vendors of digital equipment 
produce fine products that take great pictures. It’s really hard to go wrong.
All you need to do is a little homework so that you’re aware, when you make
your purchase, of the features you need — and features you don’t need. The
vendors write their brochures and ad copy so that those who don’t sort out
features and benefits ahead of time might think that every feature is essential.

Choosing a Camera Category

Trust me: They’re not. The ability to shoot several pictures consecutively,
each using different color settings to make sure that one picture is perfectly
color-balanced, might sound cool, but it’s not something many people need
every day. But if you find yourself constantly taking pictures under varied
lighting conditions, and color accuracy is very important to you, a feature
like that might be a lifesaver. Only you can decide for sure.
The key is having the upfront information you need to wisely choose the
camera that has the largest number of your must-have features — and a nice
sprinkling of nice-to-have features — at a price you can afford. In Book I,
Chapter 2, you can find an overview of the choices you need to make. There,
you can find an introduction to the chief things to consider, which are
✦Lens requirements
✦Viewfinder options
✦Sensor resolution
✦Exposure controls
✦Storage options
✦Ease of use
This chapter looks at each of these considerations, plus others, in more detail,
with a brief mention of the newest digital SLR cameras (which are covered
more exhaustively in Book III). Although much of the information can help you
select a camera, you can also find some basic explanations of digital camera
nuts and bolts that will be helpful as you take pictures. If you ever wanted to
know what shutter speeds and lens openings do, this is your chance.
Choosing a Camera Category
Digital cameras fall into several different categories, each aimed at a particular
audience of buyers, as well as particular kinds of applications for them. You
can find an extended discussion of camera categories in Book I, Chapter 2.
However, as a recap, the major types include
✦Web cams: Web cams are cheap TV cameras that also offer low-resolution
full-motion and still images. They’re fun to use and essential for things 
like videoconferencing. They aren’t covered in this book because most
don’t have the kind of image quality and capabilities required for serious
photography.
✦Camera phones: Camera phones are those multipurpose cell phones that
also have photographic capabilities built in. Some have 2-megapixel or
better resolution that exceeds the picture quality available from some
$500 digital cameras from only a few years ago. In Japan, cell phones with

Book II
Chapter 1

cameras built in have already cut heavily into the market for one-time-use
film cameras. Folks who sometimes forget to take their digital cameras
with them wouldn’t be caught dead without their cell phones, so they’re
always ready for the kind of spur-of-the-moment photography that single-
use cameras have traditionally served. I’m not covering these useful (but
specialized) devices in this book (even though I own and use one myself),
nor cameras built into other products, such as personal digital assistants
(PDAs). None of them are intended for use as a primary camera.
✦Point-and-shoot models: These entry-level digital cameras, priced at
$100–$200, offer 4 to 5 megapixels of resolution (although it’s becoming
very difficult to find a 4-megapixel camera in stores), simple lenses (usu-
ally with zoom), and autoexposure. I recently tested a 6-megapixel camera
with a 3X zoom lens and 32MB of built-in memory (a memory card was
optional) that could be purchased for $169! Clearly, even the most basic
point-and-shoot cameras are gaining resolution and features almost faster
than we can keep track. This kind of camera is an excellent choice for
someone looking for a basic camera with few manual adjustments, and for
casual shots that will be enlarged no more than about 5 x 7 inches.
✦Intermediate models: Priced in the $200–$400 slot, intermediate digital
cameras have 5- to 8-megapixel resolution, a 3:1 or 5:1 or better zoom
lens, and Secure Digital (SD), xD, or CompactFlash storage. Many have
close-up focusing, burst modes that can snap off seven or more frames
in a few seconds, and some manual controls. The average snapshooter
would be very happy with a camera in this category and would be 
satisfied with the few tweaks that can be made to add a little creativity
to selected photos.
✦Advanced consumer models: In the $400–$800 range, you can find
deluxe digital cameras with roughly 6 to 10 megapixels of resolution,
decent 5:1 to 12:1 zoom lenses, lots of accessories, optional exposure
modes, and a steep learning curve. These cameras are easy to operate
so the average snapshooter can use them with a little training and prac-
tice. Yet, they are also versatile, with features like electronic viewfinders
and manual settings, that serious photographers can invoke for those
special picture-taking situations.
✦Prosumer non-SLR models: Serious amateurs and some professional
photographers use these. They cost $600—$800 and have all the features
you could want, including 8 to 10 megapixels or more of resolution, the
highest-quality lenses, an electronic viewfinder (EVF), and every acces-
sory you can dream of. Expect automatic and manual focus, multiple
automated exposure modes, and motor drive multishot capabilities.
(Read more about motor drive capability in Book IV, Chapter 5.)
✦Prosumer SLR models: The prosumer SLR is very nearly a whole new
category of camera, created in 2003 when Canon introduced the Digital
Rebel for $999 (with lens), and other vendors, including Nikon and

Examining the Parts of a Digital Camera
82
Pentax, followed. In price, there is some overlap with the prosumer non-
SLR cameras. However, the true SLR type offers interchangeable lenses
and other features found in the traditional advanced-amateur favorite.
✦Professional models: Professional-quality digital SLR cameras used to
cost $5,000 and up and had 6–14 million pixels of resolution. Today, you
can still pay around $5,000 or more for a pro camera (without lens), and
resolutions now go up to 22 megapixels, but some very fine professional-
worthy models are available for a few thousand dollars less, too. 
The manufacturers of the top-end cameras are feeling the pressure of
competition from the sub-$1,000 digital SLRs, so you can expect prices
to drop even further as features proliferate. However, professional pho-
tographers will continue to pay a premium for these cameras because
they frequently operate more quickly, allowing the pro to grab shot after
shot without pausing for breath. They’re rugged, too, which means they
can withstand the harsh treatment pros often subject their equipment to
(not because they’re mean, but because they’re working).
You can find some general tips in Book I, Chapter 2 that can help you deter-
mine what category of camera you should look for. Read here, though, for
the lowdown on everything you need to consider.
Examining the Parts of a Digital Camera
If you’re very new to digital cameras, you might be wondering what all those
buttons, LEDs, and windows are for. Here’s a quick introduction to the key
components of the average non-SLR digital camera. Not every camera will
have all these features, and some will have additional features not shown in
Figures 1-1 and 1-2.
✦Shutter release: Pressing this button halfway locks exposure and focus;
press all the way to take a picture.
✦Control buttons: Miscellaneous control buttons might turn on/off close-up
mode, automatic flash, or other features; set picture quality; or activate
the self-timer.
✦Shooting mode dial: Most cameras use this button or dial for changing
among different scene modes (such as Night, Portrait, or Sports), adjust-
ing automatic or manual exposure choices, selecting Movie mode, or
switching into close-up mode.
✦Microphone: This captures audio for movie clips and voice annotations;
it can even activate a sound-triggered self-timer.
✦Focus-assist light: This is an auxiliary illumination source that helps the
camera focus in dim lighting conditions.

Figure 1-1: The front of a typical digital camera.
✦Electronic flash: This provides light under dim conditions or helps fill in
dark shadows.
✦Optical viewfinder: This window, which doesn’t show exactly the same
view that the lens captures, is for framing and composing your picture.
✦Zoom lens: This magnifies and reduces the size of the image, taking you
closer or moving you farther away.
✦Lens cover: This protects the lens when the digital camera is turned off.
✦Tripod socket: This allows you to attach the camera to a firm support,
such as a tripod or monopod, plus other accessories, such as an external

Evaluating Your Lens Requirements
The lens and the sensor (or film, in the case of a conventional camera) are
the two most important parts of any photographic system. The lens gathers
the light from your scene and focuses it onto the capture medium, digital 
or analog. The sensor or film transforms the light into something that can 
be stored permanently and viewed as a picture after digital or chemical 
processing.
Sharp lenses and high-quality sensors (or film) lead to technically good
images; poor lenses and bad sensors lead to poor photos. Indeed, in one
sense, most of the other components of a camera are for your convenience.
Theoretically, you could mount a simple lens on one end of an oatmeal box,
focus it on a piece of film or a sensor affixed to the inside of the other end of
the box, and make an exposure by covering and uncovering the lens with a
dark cloth. Of course, the digital version of this science fair project would
require some additional electronics to handle the captured signal, but such 
a system could work.
When you’re choosing a digital camera, the first thing to concentrate on is
the lens furnished with it. You probably don’t need to go into as much detail
as I’m going to provide, but understanding the components of a camera lens
does help you use your optics as much as it helps you choose them. The
major things you need to know fall into four simple categories:
✦The optical quality of the lens itself: Just how sharp is the piece of glass
(or, these days, plastic)? The better the lens, the better it can capture —
resolve — fine details. In most cases, the optical quality of digital camera
lenses marches in lockstep with the price of the camera and the resolution
of the sensor. Even at the low and medium ends of the price spectrum,
digital cameras have good-quality lenses that usually can resolve a lot
more detail than the 4- to 5-megapixel sensor can capture.

Understanding How Lenses Work
86
Camera vendors have been mass-producing lenses like these for film
cameras for decades, and any film camera can capture a lot more detail
than an inexpensive digital camera. At higher price levels, lenses have
better-quality optics, which are necessary to keep up with the detail-
capturing capabilities of 6- to 8-megapixel (and higher) sensors.
✦The amount of light the lens can transmit: Some lenses can capture
larger amounts of light than others, generally because they have a
greater diameter that can transmit more light. This factor, called lens
speed, is a bit more complicated than that. Think of a 1-inch-diameter
pipe and a 2-inch-diameter pipe and visualize how much more water
(or light) the wider pipe can conduct; now you’re thinking in the right
direction. Lens speed, in part, controls how low of a light level you can
take pictures in. If you take many pictures in dim light, you’ll want a
faster lens. I look at this factor in greater detail later in this chapter.
✦The focusing range of the lens: Some lenses can focus closer than
others. The ability to get up-close and personal with your subject matter
can be very important if your hobbies include things like stamp or coin
collecting or if you want to take pictures of flowers or bugs. Indeed,
close-focusing can open whole new worlds of photography for you,
worlds you can explore in more detail in Book IV, Chapter 2.
✦The magnification range of the lens: Virtually all digital cameras have a
zoom lens, which allows you to vary the amount of magnification of the
image. You might be able to take your basic image and double it in size
(a 2:1 zoom ratio), triple it (a 3:1 zoom), or magnify it 12X or more
(a 12:1 zoom). The zoom range determines how much or how little of a
particular subject you can include in an image from a particular shooting
distance. As you might expect, the ability to zoom enhances your creative
options significantly. At the widest settings (wide-angle settings), you
can take in broad sweeps of landscape, whereas in the narrowest view
(telephoto), you can reach out and bring a distant object much closer.
Understanding How Lenses Work
You don’t need to have a degree in optical science to use a digital camera,
but understanding how lens openings (f-stops) and some other components
work can help you use those components more effectively.
Lenses consist of several optical elements made of glass or plastic that focus
light in precise ways, much like you focus light with a magnifying glass or
with a telescope or binoculars. The very simplest lenses, like those used on
the least expensive digital cameras, are fixed focal length lenses, usually com-
prising just three or four pieces of glass. That is, the elements can produce
an image only at a single magnification. You find these in the simplest point-
and-shoot cameras that have no zooming capabilities. There aren’t many of
these around, but I did run into a camera with no “real” zoom recently: an

extra-compact model that used a 3:1 digital zoom as a substitute for optical
zooming capabilities.
Most digital cameras have zoom lenses, which have very complex optical
systems with 8, 10, 20, or more elements that move in precise ways to pro-
duce a continuous range of magnifications. Zoom lenses must be carefully
designed to avoid bad things, such as stray beams of light that degrade the
image bouncing around inside the lens. For that reason, when choosing a dig-
ital camera with a zoom lens, you need to pay attention to the quality of the
image. All 4:1 zooms are not created equal; one vendor might produce an
excellent lens with this range, whereas another might offer a lens that is less
sharp. Among digital cameras with similar or identical sensors, lens quality
can make the biggest difference in the final quality of an image. You’ll discover
how to select the best lens for your needs as we go along.
You can get a top-quality lens and still save some money if you know how to
interpret digital camera specifications. Many vendors share lenses and sen-
sors among similar models in their product lines. I tested two cameras from
the same manufacturer that had identical resolution and lens specifications,
but one model was more compact, was outfitted with a rechargeable battery,
and included rubber gaskets that made it water resistant. (It also cost $100
more!) A penny-pinching photographer who doesn’t mind a tiny bit more
bulk, is willing to use AA batteries, and doesn’t plan any photography in rain
showers could buy the less expensive version and save enough money to
buy some extra memory cards or other accessories.
Magnifications and focal lengths
Comparing zoom ranges of digital cameras can be confusing because the
exact same lens can produce different magnifications on different cameras.
That’s why you usually see the zoom range of a digital camera presented
either as absolute magnifications or in the equivalents of the 35mm camera
lenses that the zoom settings correspond to.
Zoom range doesn’t relate to lens quality. You’ll find excellent 4:1 zooms and
average 4:1 zooms. However, the longer the zoom range, the more difficult it
is to produce a lens that makes good pictures at all zoom settings. You should
be especially careful in choosing a lens with a longer zoom range (8:1 or
above); test the camera and its lens before you buy. However, lenses from the
major manufacturers (Canon, Sony, Nikon, Fuji, and so forth) are all generally
quite good.
Until the advent of digital cameras, figuring the magnification of consumer
camera lenses was relatively easy because, in recent years, most consumer
(and the workhorse professional) film cameras used a standard film size —
the 35mm film frame — which measures a nominal 24mm x 36mm. Some
cameras also used Kodak’s now-discontinued Advanced Photo System (APS)
film format, which produced images in three different configurations.

Understanding How Lenses Work
88
The magnification of any particular lens with a standard film size is easily cal-
culated by measuring the distance from the film the lens must be positioned
to focus a sharp image on the film. (This is the focal length of the lens.)
By convention, in 35mm photography, a lens with a 45–50mm focal length is
considered a normal lens. (The figure was arrived at by measuring the diago-
nal of the film frame; you can calculate the focal length of a normal lens for
any size film or digital camera sensor by measuring that diagonal.)
Lenses with a shorter focal length, such as 35mm, 28mm, 20mm, or less, are
described as wide-angle lenses. Those with longer focal lengths (such as 85mm,
105mm, or 200mm) are described as telephoto lenses. We’ve lived happily with
that nomenclature for more than 75 years, since the first 35mm camera was
introduced. Wide-angle and telephoto images are shown in Figure 1-3.
Then came the digital camera, and all the simple conventions about focal
lengths and magnifications went out the window. For good and valid techni-
cal reasons, most digital camera sensors do not measure 24mm x 36mm. You
wouldn’t want a sensor that large (roughly 1" x 1.5") anyway in a compact
digital camera because the camera would have to be large enough to accom-
modate it. In addition, as with all solid-state devices, the larger a device such
as a sensor becomes, the more expensive it is to manufacture. Sensors that
are as large as the full 35mm film frame are available for an increasing
number of digital SLR cameras, which means the magnification effect I’m
about to describe doesn’t apply for those models.
Most sensors for non-SLR cameras are more likely to measure, say, 16mm x
24mm or less. Even the larger digital camera sensors might be no bigger
Optical zoom versus digital zoom
Non-SLR digital cameras have two kinds of
zooming capabilities: optical and digital. Optical
zoom uses the arrangement of the lens ele-
ments to control the amount of magnification.
Usually, optical zoom is the specification men-
tioned first in the camera’s list of features.
Digital zoom is a supplementary magnification
system in which the center pixels of an image
are enlarged using a mathematical algorithm to
fill the entire image area with the information
contained in those center pixels.
Digital zoom doesn’t really provide much in the
way of extra information; you could zoom in on
an image in your image editor if you like.
However, digital zoom is a way of turning a 4:1
zoom into an 8:1 (or better) zoom lens even if the
results aren’t as good as those you’d obtain with
a true optical 8:1 zoom. I tend to discount digital
zoom capabilities when buying a camera
because I want the sharpest picture possible,
and many of the digital zoom pictures I’ve taken
have looked fuzzy and pixelated. The feature
doesn’t cost you anything, and you can usually
switch it off so you won’t accidentally grab a
digital zoom picture by mistake.

than about 38mm x 38mm. So, a normal lens on one digital camera might be
8mm, whereas another normal lens on another camera might be 6mm. A 4:1
zoom lens can range from 8mm–32mm or 5.5mm–22mm. What a mess! How
can you compare lenses and zoom ranges under those conditions?
Figure 1-3: Telephoto (top) and wide angle shots (bottom) provide different perspectives on 
a subject.

Understanding How Lenses Work
90
Camera vendors have solved the problem by quoting digital camera lens
focal lengths according to their 35mm equivalents. If you’re already familiar
with 35mm camera lenses, that’s great. If you’re not, at least you have a stan-
dard measurement to compare with. That’s why you often see digital camera
zoom ranges expressed as “35mm–135mm equivalent (roughly 4:1)” or some
similar expression. You can safely use these figures to compare lenses in
your quest for the perfect digital camera.
Because digital camera lenses have such short focal lengths in the first
place, most models tend to be deficient in the wide-angle department.
Expect to see most digital cameras with no better than a 35mm–28mm wide-
angle equivalent. That’s barely acceptable because 35mm isn’t very wide. If
you really need a wide field of view, consider a wide-angle attachment that
fits on the front of your lens.
What focal length (equivalents) do you look for? Your preferred range will
depend on what kind of photos you want to take. If you shoot architecture or
indoor photos, you’ll want the shortest focal length possible. An alarming
number of digital cameras seem to have settled on a 38–39mm (equivalent)
focal length as their widest setting. There are several reasons for that. First,
a lens with that meager wide-angle field of view is easier to design (and usu-
ally more compact) than one with a broader perspective.
In addition, a lens with a particular magnification will have a longer tele-
photo effect if you’re starting from a base focal length that’s narrower to
begin with. Consumers tend to get more excited about long telephotos than
they do about wider wide-angles, even though both perspectives have an
important place. Table 1-1 shows how a 4:1 zoom lens gains a more impres-
sive telephoto “look” when the vendor snips millimeters from the wide-angle
portion of the range.

Hey, wouldn’t you prefer a 152mm medium telephoto over a 112mm short
telephoto? You would until you find yourself with your back up against the
wall trying to take a picture of an entire (albeit moderately small) room and
discover that your 4X zoom lens would give you no more than the field of
view of a 38mm lens. You might be happier with a lens that has a wider mini-
mum focal length but which accepts a telephoto attachment for those times
when you really need to reach out and touch something.

Lens apertures
The lens aperture is an adjustable control that determines the width of the
opening that admits light to the sensor. The wider the aperture, the more
light that can reach the sensor, making it possible to take pictures in dimmer
light. You can think of an aperture as the pupil of your eye. When it’s bright
outside, your pupils contract (and you squint), letting in less light. When it’s
dim, your pupils dilate.
A narrow aperture reduces the amount of light that can reach the sensor, 
letting you avoid overloading the imaging device in very bright light. These
lens openings are used in tandem with shutter speed (the amount of time the
sensor is exposed to the light) to control the exposure. (I explain more about
exposure later in this chapter.) Your digital camera needs a selection of lens
apertures (f-stops) so that you can take pictures in a broad range of lighting
conditions.
F-stops aren’t absolute values; they’re calculated
by measuring the actual size of the lens opening
as it relates to the focal length of the lens, using a
formula that I won’t repeat here. The easiest way
to visualize how f-stops work is to imagine them
as the denominators of fractions. Just like 1⁄2 is
larger than 1⁄4 or 1⁄8, f/2 is larger than f/4 or f/8. 
The relationship is such that as the amount of
light reaching the sensor is doubled, the f-stop
increases using an odd-looking series of numbers:
f/2 is twice as large as f/2.8, which is twice as large
as f/4, and so on through f/5.6, f/8, f/11, f/16, and
f/22 (which is just about the smallest f-stop you’ll
encounter in the digital realm). Figure 1-4 shows a
lens opening that’s partially closed down.
If you’re taking photos in automatic mode, you don’t need to know what 
f-stop you’re using because the camera selects it for you automatically. Your
digital camera probably displays the f-stop being used, however, either in 
the viewfinder or on an LCD panel, and the information can be helpful. Just
remember these things (see Figure 1-5):
✦The larger the f-stop (the smaller the number), the more light that is
admitted (faster). An f/2 lens (small number, large f-stop) is a fast lens,
whereas one with a maximum aperture of f/8 (larger number, smaller 
f-stop) is slow. If you need to take photos in dim light, you want to buy a
camera with a fast lens.
✦The smaller the f-stop (larger the number), the more of your image that
is in sharp focus. (More on this later.)
Figure 1-4: Lens opening, 
f-stop, aperture — all mean
the doorway that light passes
through to the sensor.

Understanding How Lenses Work
92
✦As the f-stops get smaller (larger number), exposure time must be
increased to let in the same amount of light. For example, if you take a
photo at f/2 for one-half second, you need to double the exposure time to
one full second if you stop down (reduce the aperture) to f/4. I look at
exposure a little later, too.
Figure 1-5: As the f-stop gets larger (the number gets 
smaller), more light is admitted.
Typically, you’ll find that among non-SLR digital cameras, the speed or maxi-
mum aperture of camera lenses is smaller than is common among 35mm film
cameras, and the range of available apertures is more limited, too. For exam-
ple, even an inexpensive snapshooter 35mm film camera might have an f/1.9
lens (pretty fast), and serious photographers with 35mm SLRs probably own
f/1.4 or faster normal and wide-angle lenses. Although zoom lenses usually
have smaller maximum apertures, in the 35mm film world, f/2.8–f/3.5 are
common numbers.
In the digital camera realm, things are a bit different primarily because the
very short focal lengths of the lenses are more difficult to design with large
lens openings. So don’t be alarmed if your favorite digital camera has an f/4
or f/5.6 maximum aperture. You might even find that the lens is labeled
f/4–f/5.6 because the effective widest opening can vary as a lens is zoomed in
and out. A lens might have an f/4 opening when zoomed out to 38mm but
only f/5.6 at its maximum telephoto setting of 152mm. (In most cases, as the
focal length increases, the lens opening itself moves along with the optical
glass, so the opening is farther away from the sensor and looks smaller.)
To make things really interesting, your digital camera lens might have only a
limited number of different f-stops available, perhaps f/4, f/5.6, and f/8, or
maybe none at all. You won’t miss the lack of f-stops: Modern electronic shut-
ters are fast enough to provide the proper exposure without smaller lens
openings. Further, in 35mm photography, smaller lens openings have been
used to increase the range of sharpness (called depth of field). As you can

read in Book IV, Chapter 2, though, the short focal length of non-SLR digital
camera lenses usually means that just about everything is sharp, anyway.
Focus range
The focus range of a digital camera is simply how close it can be from a sub-
ject and still create a sharp image. Digital cameras vary in their close-focusing
(also called macro) capabilities. If you want to photograph flowers, hobby col-
lections, items for sale on eBay, or anything else up-close, you want to make
sure that your camera is up to it. Close focus can vary from model to model.
Some vendors deem anything less than about a foot as macro capability. Other
cameras take you down to 1/2 inch from your subject. Here are some things to
consider when evaluating focus range:
✦There’s such a thing as too close. When you get to within a few inches of
your subject, you’ll find that the subject is difficult to light. The camera
itself can cast shadows and keep sufficient light from reaching your sub-
ject. You’ll find more about lighting close-ups in Book IV, Chapter 2.
✦Some lenses don’t allow close focus at all zoom settings. You might
want to step back a foot and zoom in to get the best view of your sub-
ject. However, some lenses don’t allow automatic (or even manual)
focus at longer zoom settings. Some restrict macro capabilities to
midrange or wide zoom settings.
✦Close focusing is tricky. You want to make sure your digital camera
includes automatic macro-focusing capabilities so that you don’t have
to focus manually when shooting up tight to the subject.
✦Keep attachment friendliness in mind. If your favorite digital model
doesn’t have sufficient built-in macro options, see whether you can
attach close-up lenses to the front of your lens. Not all digital cameras
can accept screw-on attachments of this type.
Exposure controls
Because light levels vary, digital cameras must vary the amount of light
reaching the sensor. One way to do that is to change the f-stop, as described
earlier in this chapter. The second way is to alter the length of time that the
sensor is exposed to the light. This is done either electronically or with an
actual mechanical device — a shutter — that opens and closes quickly to
expose the sensor for a set period — the shutter speed.
Like f-stops, shutter speeds are the denominators of fractions. The larger the
number, the less light reaches the sensor. Typical shutter speeds include 1/60,
1/125, 1/250, 1/50, and 1/1000 of a second. Your digital camera readout might
show them as 60, 125, 250, 500, or 1000 because the numerator is always 1.
However, a recent trend has been to include the numerator anyway to avoid
confusion with longer shutter speeds, which are whole numbers. Otherwise,
you’d have no way of telling whether an 8 in the viewfinder means 1/8 second
or 8 seconds.

Understanding How Lenses Work
94
Cameras (chiefly film models) that use mechanical shutters might have only
exact intervals, although most film cameras have electronic shutters these
days. Electronic shutters aren’t limited to fixed incremental values and can
provide you with any actual interval from a few seconds through 1/2000 (or
sometimes even 1/4000) of a second. The traditional shutter speed values
are useful only when calculating equivalent exposures.
For example, suppose a basic exposure were 1/250 of a second at f/16 (which
is a typical exposure for a digital camera in bright daylight). If you wanted to
stop some fast-moving action, you might want your camera to switch to
1/500 of a second to freeze the movement with the shorter exposure time.
(You can find out more about stopping action in Book IV, Chapter 5.)
Because you’ve cut the amount of light in half by reducing the shutter speed
from 1/250 to 1/500 of a second, your camera needs to compensate by dou-
bling the amount of light admitted through the lens. In this example, the lens
is opened up from f/16 to f/11, which lets in twice as much illumination.
Usually, all this happens automatically, thanks to your digital camera’s
handy autoexposure modes, but you can set these controls manually on
some models if you want. It’s probably a better idea to choose a different
autoexposure mode (described later) that gives you the flexibility you need.
Sometimes, you’ll look at an image on your LCD review screen and decide
that the picture is too dark or too light. A digital camera’s autoexposure
modes can take care of this, too. When shopping for a digital camera, you’ll
want to look for the following exposure options.
Plus/minus or over/under exposure
With these modes, you can specify a little more or a little less exposure than
the ideal exposure that your camera’s light-measuring system determines.
These adjustments are called exposure values (EV for short), and most digi-
tal cameras let you fine tune exposure +/– about 2EV, using half- or third-stop
increments. The most conveniently designed cameras have the EV adjustment
available from one of the main buttons on the camera, such as the Up-cursor
key. Beware of cameras that make you wend your way into the menu system
to make an EV adjustment. Fortunately, after it’s set, the EV setting “sticks”
so that you can continue to take pictures in the same environment with the
modified setting.
Full autoexposure
With this option, your digital camera selects the shutter speed and lens
opening for you by using built-in algorithms, called programs, that allow it
to make some intelligent guesses about the best combination of settings.
For example, on bright days outdoors, the camera probably chooses a short
shutter speed and small f-stop to give you the best sharpness. Outdoors in

Book II
Chapter 1

Camera

95
dimmer light, the camera might select a wider lens opening while keeping
the shutter speed the same until it decides to drop down to a slower speed
to keep more of your image in sharp focus.
Some digital cameras have several autoexposure program modes (sometimes
called scene settings) to select from, so if you’re taking action pictures and
have chosen an action-stopping mode, the camera tries to use brief, action-
stopping shutter speeds under as many conditions as possible. These program
modes are different from the aperture/shutter-preferred modes described next
because they frequently include other factors in their adjustments. They might
have names like Sports, Night, Night Portrait, Landscape, Fireworks, or Portrait.
I used a camera with a scene setting called Cuisine (I kid you not), which
(after a little digging) I discovered also increased the sharpness and color
richness of the picture to supposedly make food pictures look better. Some
cameras have both an Auto (A) and Program (P) setting.
Aperture-preferred/shutter-preferred exposure
These options let you choose a lens opening (aperture-preferred) or shutter
speed (shutter-preferred), and then the camera automatically sets the other
control to match. These settings might be indicated by A or S markings —
commonly, Av and Tv (Time value). For example, by choosing shutter-
preferred, you can select a short shutter speed, such as 1/1000 of a second,
and the camera locks that in, varying only the f-stop.
Unlike the programmed modes described in the preceding section, if your
camera finds that the selected shutter speed, for example, can’t be mated
with an appropriate aperture (it’s too dark or too light out), it might not take
a photo at all. I’ve run into this at soccer games when I’ve set my camera to
an action-stopping shutter speed, but clouds dim the field so much that even
the largest lens opening isn’t enough to take a picture. Figure 1-6 shows an
action shot taken with the camera set on shutter priority.
Full manual control
With this option, you can set any shutter speed or aperture combination you
like, giving you complete control over the exposure of your photo. That means
you can also completely ruin the picture by making it way too dark or much
too light. However, complete control is good for creative reasons because
seriously underexposing (say, to produce a silhouette effect) might be
exactly what you want.
Other factors to consider
In addition to exposure options themselves, you must consider other factors
when evaluating the exposure controls of your dream digital camera. Here is
a quick checklist of those you should look out for:

Understanding How Lenses Work
96
Figure 1-6: Choosing shutter priority lets you select an action-stopping shutter speed.
✦Sensor sensitivity: Like film, sensors have varying degrees of sensitivity 
to light. (For film, this is its speed.) The more sensitive the sensor is, the
better it can capture images in low light levels. Most digital cameras have
a sensitivity that corresponds roughly to that of ISO 50 to ISO 100 film (so-
called slow film), and the specs often use that terminology. Many cameras
let you specify the sensitivity, increasing from the default value of, say, ISO
100 to ISO 400 or even ISO 800 (fast) to give you a “faster” camera. 
Unfortunately, upping the ISO rating usually increases the amount of
random fuzziness — noise — in the image. It’s like turning your radio up
really loud when you’re driving a convertible with the top down. The
wind flying past your ears tends to cancel out some of the audio informa-
tion that your too-loud radio produces. Increasing the ISO boosts image
information while increasing background noise in the image. If you plan
to shoot many pictures in very dim light, any camera you buy should be
tested first to see whether ISO settings can be set manually. Then check
how noisy the pictures become when you increase the sensitivity.
✦Measurement mode: Just how does your digital camera’s exposure
system measure the light? Sometimes it measures only the center of the
picture (which is probably your subject anyway); sometimes, it might
measure the entire frame and average out the light that the sensor sees.
You don’t always want the camera to measure the light the same way.

Book II
Chapter 1
Choosing the Right
Camera
Selecting Your Resolution
97
Measuring a center spot sometimes produces the most accurate read-
ing. Other times, such as when the scene is evenly lit, an averaging
system works best. On still other occasions, say, when there is a lot of
sky in the photo, you might want the camera to measure only the light 
in the lower half of the picture. Many cameras have multiple exposure
modes that allow you to choose what part of the image is measured. 
One clever exposure system I’ve used works in conjunction with the
camera’s automatic focus, selecting the part of the image that is in
sharpest focus to calculate the exposure.
✦Compensation systems: Many exposure systems can sense when a pic-
ture is backlit (most of the light is coming from behind the subject) and
add exposure to make the subject brighter. Sophisticated cameras can
analyze your scene and choose an exposure mode that best fits each
individual picture, compensating for potential trouble spots in the 
photograph. Or the camera might have an override to the exposure
system, allowing the sensor to receive more light from backlit subjects
when you choose to activate it.
✦Manual exposure: If you’re seriously interested in photography, you’ll
want at least the option of setting exposure (both f-stop and shutter
speed) manually so you can custom-tailor your exposure to the artistic
effect you’re trying to achieve.
Selecting Your Resolution
The best lens can’t produce any more sharpness than the sensor used to 
capture its information. For that reason, the resolution of most digital 
cameras is the specification most people use to choose their equipment.
They want a 4-megapixel camera or a 5-megapixel model or maybe a 6- to 8-
megapixel camera. They figure (with some justification) that the more pixels
they have, the more features the vendor packs into the camera. After all, you
can expect a 6-megapixel camera to have a decent zoom lens, lots of exposure
control choices, close focusing, and all the other goodies, right?
Most of the time, that’s true. The sensor is usually the most expensive part
of any digital camera, so if you’re building a camera that’s going to cost $600
anyway, you might as well load on the other goodies to justify the price.
However, as sensors get less expensive, you’ll see cameras with (supposedly)
equivalent sharpness with widely varying feature sets. For example, I’ve used
cameras in the 6-megapixel range that cost as little as $169 (and had sparse
lists of features to match) and others with the same nominal resolution that
cost $800 and were chock-full of advanced capabilities.
And even when dealing with sensors, all pixels are not created equal. For one
thing, the true resolution of a sensor is likely to be somewhat less than you
might think. Take a sensor measuring 3008 x 2000 pixels. You’d think that
such a sensor could image about 6 million different details. Bzzzt. Wrong

answer! That would be possible only if the camera were designed to capture
an image only in black and white.
In practice, the sensor has to capture red, green, and blue pixels. With current
sensors, each pixel can capture only one particular color, so those 6 million
pixels are actually divided up into red-sensitive pixels, green-sensitive pixels,
and blue-sensitive pixels. If the pixels were divided up evenly, you’d wind up
with three 2-megapixel sensors — one each for red, green, and blue — rather
than the 60-megapixel sensor you thought you had.
However, the pixels aren’t divvied up in that way. Because our eyes are more
sensitive to green light than to the other colors, sensors typically divide up
their pixels unevenly: 50 percent are green, 25 percent are red, and 25 per-
cent are blue. That’s done by alternating red and green on one line, and
green and blue on the next, as shown in Figure 1-7.
Figure 1-7: The typical sensor pixel is sensitive to red, green, 
or blue light.
Your camera’s brain examines the picture and calculates (or interpolates)
what the red and blue values probably are for each green-sensitive pixel posi-
tion, what the green and blue values are for each red-sensitive pixel position,
and the likely green and red values for each blue-sensitive pixel.
Other digital cameras use technologies that are a little different — or a lot dif-
ferent. For example, Sony offers a sensor that captures what it calls RGB+E (for
emerald) light, producing what it describes as color fidelity that is closer to
human color perception, with more life-like rendering of blue, blue-green, and
red hues. Another vendor, Foveon, produces a sensor that has separate layers
for red, green, and blue light, as shown in Figure 1-8, so that each pixel is capa-
ble of capturing any color light without interpolation. This sensor has been
used only in a couple digital cameras from Polaroid and Sigma.

Figure 1-8: The Foveon sensor has separate layers for each color of light.
Beyond the capture scheme used, other factors affect sensors. Some sensors
are more sensitive than others, and other factors make a particular sensor
not perform as well as another one with the same number of pixels. For
example, some sensors don’t register some colors well or have pixels that
bright light can easily overwhelm.
When choosing a digital camera, you want to choose one with the resolution
you want. If possible, compare the pictures taken with each camera under
consideration to see whether that resolution is being put to good use.
When it comes to megapixels, you can estimate the resolution you require
with these guidelines:
✦Low res (short for resolution): If you’re shooting pictures intended for
Web display, for online auctions, or for pictures that either won’t be
cropped or enlarged much, you can get by with a lower-resolution
camera in the 4- to 5-megapixel range.
✦Medium res: If you often need to crop your photos, want to make larger
prints, or need lots of detail, you want at least a 6- to 8-megapixel camera.
✦High res: If you want to extract small portions of an image, make 8-x-10-
inch prints or larger, or do a lot of manipulation in an image editor, you
want a 6- to 12-megapixel (or more) camera.

Keep in mind that most digital cameras allow shooting in a reduced mode, so
if you own a high-resolution camera, you can still shoot in low resolution to
pack more images on your digital film or to reduce file sizes on your hard
drive. Resizing images is rarely a good idea, even with a good image editing
program, so you usually want to shoot at the resolution you intend for your
finished photo. Resize later, if you want, but keep your full-size version for
printing, just in case.
The mode in which your camera stores the image on your digital film can
affect the final resolution of your image, too. Digital cameras usually store
photos in a compressed, space-saving format known as JPEG (Joint Photo-
graphic Experts Group). The JPEG format offers reduced file sizes by discard-
ing some information. In most cases, a JPEG file is still plenty good, but if you
want to preserve all the quality of your original image, you might want to set
your camera to store in a lossless image format (that is, one that doesn’t dis-
card any image information when compressing the file), such as TIFF, RAW, or
EXIF. You might be able to choose from different JPEG quality levels, too.
Expect these alternate formats to eat up your exposures quickly. One of my
digital cameras can store 200 images on a particular digital film card in JPEG
format but only 150 in RAW and 40 in TIFF. TIFF and RAW also take more time
to store on the film card, too, so they’re not a good choice when you’re
shooting sports or other sequence-type photos.
Some cameras generally label their resolution choices with names such as
Large, Medium, Small; Standard, Fine, Superfine, Ultrafine; and so forth.
These terms can vary from vendor to vendor.
Choosing Your View
Generally, you want what you see to be what you get, but that’s not always the
case with digital cameras. That’s because the viewfinders available are usually
a compromise between what works best and what can economically be pro-
vided at a particular price level. In the digital photography realm, the solution
has long been to provide you with two viewfinders per camera, each with its
own advantages and disadvantages. In a non-SLR camera, you usually find
✦A color LCD screen on the back of the camera, which you can use to
preview and review your electronic images.
✦An optical viewfinder, which you can peer through to frame and 
compose your image. Some digital cameras with large LCDs don’t have
optical viewfinders at all.
Some cameras have two LCDs: one on the back in the traditional location,
and a second one inside the camera and visible through an optical system.

This variety is an electronic viewfinder or EVF. None of these are ideal for
every type of picture-taking application.
LCD viewfinders
In a non-SLR, the liquid crystal display, usually measuring 1.5–2.5 inches
diagonally, shows an electronic image of the scene as viewed by the sensor.
(Digital SLRs can’t preview images on their LCD because the mirror, shutter,
and other components get in the way of the sensor until the moment of
exposure.) On the one hand, that’s good because you can view more or less
the exact image that will be captured. It’s also not so good because the LCD
screen is likely to be difficult to view, washed out by surrounding light, and
so small that it doesn’t really show what you need to see. Moreover, the
backlit LCD eats up battery power. I’ve used digital cameras that died after
20 minutes when the LCD had depleted their rechargeable batteries. Luckily,
some digital cameras let you specify that the LCD is turned on only when
composing a picture or only for a few seconds after a picture is taken (so
that you can quickly review the shot).
Although often not usable in bright daylight, LCDs, such as the one shown in
Figure 1-9, are better in more dimly lit conditions. Some third parties offer
LCD hoods that fit over the back panel of the camera to shield the LCD from
direct illumination. If you mount your camera on a tripod and make sure all
the light is directed on your subject, an LCD is entirely practical for framing,
focusing, and evaluating a digital image (even outdoors, if you use one of
those protective hoods). 
Figure 1-9: LCD screens work fine in dim light.

Choosing Your View
102
As you shop for a digital camera, check out the LCD under a variety of condi-
tions to make sure it passes muster. Here are some things to look for:
✦Brightness controls: Many cameras include a brightness control that
allows you to increase the brightness of the LCD to make it easier to view
in full sunlight, or to decrease the brightness indoors to use less battery
juice. A related factor is whether the LCD automatically “gains up” by
amplifying a dim image to provide a usable view when it’s very dark.
✦Swivel mount: The LCD doesn’t have to remain fixed rigidly to the back
of the camera. Some swivel and rotate, allowing you to point the camera
in one direction and move the LCD so that you can easily view it at an
angle. (Alternatively, the part of the camera with the lens can swivel
while the part with the LCD remains in place.)
✦Resolution and size: Ultracompact digital cameras often have tiny LCD
displays, on the order of 11⁄2 inches (measured diagonally), and others
have more generous 2.5-inch LCDs. The size of the LCD and the number
of pixels it contains will partially determine how easy it is to preview
your image. Some may have as few as 80,000 pixels; others may have
230,000 pixels or more. Guess which is easier to view!
✦Display rate: Some digital cameras update their LCD images more 
efficiently, so the view is smooth even when the camera or your subject
is moving. Others offer up blurry images or ghost trails that make it diffi-
cult to view images in motion.
✦Vanishing images: What happens when you press the shutter release?
Does the image instantly freeze as soon as you start to press the button
but before you actually take the picture? If so, what you saw might not
be what you get because your subject matter might have changed in the
time between the initial press and the actual photo. Or, does the LCD go
completely blank, leaving you with no clue about what you’re shooting?
Ideally, the LCD should display a real-time image right up until the
instant before the picture is taken.
✦Accurate viewpoint: Believe it or not, even though an LCD viewfinder’s
display is derived from the same sensor used to make the exposure, the
LCD might not display 100 percent of the sensor’s view. Instead, it might
trim a little off the sides, top, and bottom, and show you 80 to 90 percent
of the actual picture. That’s not good when you’re carefully composing a
photo to make the most of your pixels, particularly with lower-resolution
cameras that don’t have pixels to spare.
✦Real-time corrections: Some cameras have live histograms — graphs
that show the distribution of the tones in the image — that can be
viewed on the LCD and used to correct exposure manually while you
shoot. These are all non-SLR types, of course. With a dSLR, a histogram
is visible only after the exposure.

Book II
Chapter 1
Choosing the Right
Camera
Choosing Your View
103
✦Accurate rendition: I’ve found that some LCDs don’t let you evaluate
just how good (or bad) your picture is because they provide an image
that’s more contrasty, or brighter, or with more muted colors than the
actual digital picture. You don’t want to reshoot a picture because you
think it looked bad on the LCD, or worse, make a manual exposure or
other adjustment to correct a defect that appears only on the LCD and
not in the finished photo.
Optical viewfinders
Most of the time, you use an optical viewfinder, which is bright and clear,
uses no power, and lets you compose your image quickly. However, optical
viewfinders have problems of their own, most notably parallax. Parallax is
caused by the difference in viewpoint between your camera’s lens and the
optical viewfinder. They don’t show the same thing.
If the optical viewfinder happens to be mounted directly above the camera
lens, its view will be a little higher than that of the lens itself. This becomes a
problem chiefly when shooting pictures from relatively close distances (3 feet
or less). Such a viewfinder tends to chop off the top of any subject that is close
to the camera. Optical viewfinders usually have a set of visible lines, called
parallax correction lines, which you can use to frame the picture. If you keep the
subject matter below the correction lines, you can avoid chopping off heads.
Of course, you get more of the lower part of your subject than you can view.
Parallax becomes worse when the 
optical viewfinder is located above
and to one side of the lens, as shown in
Figure 1-10. In that case, a double set of
parallax correction lines is needed to
help you avoid chopping off both the
top and the side of your subject. Yuck!
Here are some things to look for in opti-
cal viewfinders:
✦Magnification: I get to use dozens of
digital cameras in a year, and one of
the first things I notice is the differ-
ence in magnification of the optical
viewfinders. Put the camera up to
your eye, and you might see a tiny
image floating off in the distance,
with the details of your scene barely
discernible. Other cameras provide
a big view that makes it easy to
frame and compose your photo.
Figure 1-10: Parallax correction lines help
you avoid chopping off heads or worse.

Choosing Your View
104
✦Zoom: Believe it or not, some digital cameras with zoom lenses have
optical viewfinders that don’t zoom! Ideally, the image should match the
view of your LCD and lens, but some cameras keep a fixed view and use
indicator marks to show the picture area.
✦Parallax correction: As I mention earlier, optical viewfinders might not
accurately frame the image when you move in close to your subject. The
position of the viewfinder window can have an effect: If the viewfinder is
directly above the lens, the side-to-side view will be accurate, but you
might cut off the top of your subject if the camera doesn’t provide paral-
lax correction. If the viewfinder is immediately to the side of the lens, your
problems will involve accidentally cutting off the side of your subject.
Some viewfinders are both above the lens and to one side, which can 
produce parallax problems in both directions.
✦Accurate viewpoint: As with LCD screens, the optical viewfinder might
not show everything you’re framing, with some image area clipped off
the top, bottom, or sides.
✦Diopter adjustment: Eyeglass wearers might want an optical viewfinder
that offers adjustment for common prescriptions so the camera can be
used without wearing glasses. 
✦Extended eyepoint: The eyepoint is the distance your eye can be from
the viewfinder’s window and still see the entire view. Some viewfinders
mandate pressing your eye up tightly against the window. Others let you
back off a few millimeters, which is handy when you want to be able to
see around the camera to monitor the whole scene (and not just what
appears in the viewfinder) or prefer to wear your glasses while using the
camera (and are thus not able to get close to the window because the
glasses get in the way).
✦Readouts: What information is available within and around the optical
viewfinder? Some cameras show nothing but the unadorned image.
Others have framing or parallax correction lines or perhaps a faint grid
to help you line up the image. Perhaps some camera status indicators
appear in the viewfinder, too, such as a flash-ready LED, within the field
of view or located just outside the viewfinder window where it can be
detected by the eye.
Electronic viewfinders (EVFs)
Some affordable cameras are available with hybrid viewfinders that work
like optical viewfinders (that is, you put your eye up to a window to view
your subject) but that use an electronic display to show you the image.
These LCDs are much like the LCDs found on the backs of cameras, but
because they are automatically shielded from extraneous light, they are
much easier to view. Because they form an image by using the signal from
the sensor, when compared with optical viewfinders, they offer a potentially
more accurate and SLR-like picture-taking experience.

Chapter 1

Camera

However, poorly designed EVFs can be a pain to use, so you’ll want to exam-
ine the view through any camera so equipped before you sink your money
into one. Here are some of the considerations to think about:
✦Magnification: EVFs can suffer from the same viewfinder magnification
issues as optical viewfinders. Because you’ll be composing and (in some
cases) focusing manually via the internal LCD, make sure your view is as
large and sharp as possible.
✦Extended eyepoint: Just as with optical viewfinders, you might not be
able to (or want to) press your eyeball up to the viewfinder window, so
an EVF with an extended eyepoint is a plus, particularly with eyeglass
wearers.
✦Readouts: Compared with optical viewfinders, EVFs usually contain a lot
of information, including status readouts, grids, focus and exposure area
indicators, and so forth, as shown in Figure 1-11. Make sure you can turn
off these distracting elements when you don’t want to see them.
Figure 1-11: Electronic viewfinders can contain a lot of 
distracting information.
✦Swivel mount: Some eyepieces for EVFs can swivel 90 degrees to allow
taking pictures from especially low or high angles. I find this capability
handy when I have the camera mounted on a tripod at about waist level
and I don’t want to crouch down to look through the viewfinder.
✦Resolution and size: The LCDs in EVFs typically have more detail than
their camera-back counterparts. Vendors have raised the bar on EVF 
resolution, with at least one offering a full megapixel display on its 
top-of-the-line camera. These high-resolution electronic viewfinders are
easier to see to discern detail and more reliable when used for focusing.

Choosing Your View
106
✦Display rate: EVFs can have ghost images, too. A brand-new feature on
some models is so-called smooth mode, which refreshes the EVF image
60 times a second (about twice as fast as normal), providing an espe-
cially good preview of your photo.
✦Vanishing images: Obviously, the EVF can’t provide a continuous image
because the sensor’s view must be collected and captured at the instant
the photo is taken. During that interval, the image might freeze onscreen
or vanish entirely. Some cameras switch into high-gain mode under dim
lighting conditions, in which the image signal is amplified to provide
better viewing, sometimes offering only a fuzzy or black-and-white view
in that mode. Better cameras give you an accurate, full-color preview up
until the exact moment the photograph is taken.
✦Accurate viewpoint: EVFs don’t always display 100 percent of the
sensor’s view, either. The best show at least 92–99 percent of the actual
picture area in the viewfinder.
✦Accurate rendition: As with any LCD, the image you see might not be
exactly like your final photograph, but the results should be close.
SLR viewfinders
And there’s always the single-lens reflex (SLR) camera, which shows you
(more or less) the exact image the sensor sees through the lens via an 
optical system. It’s done with mirrors (really). In the most common config-
uration, you view the subject through the lens by using an image bounced
off mirrors and (sometimes) a glass prism. When you take the picture, the
mirror moves out of the way to expose the sensor. You lose sight of the
image for a fraction of a second, but film SLR users have been tolerating that
inconvenience for decades.
Both general types of SLR viewfinders use a mirror to bounce light upward,
where it then reflects off a series of surfaces until the final image (erect and
nonreversed from left-to-right) is viewed through an optical window. Less-
expensive cameras use a series of mirrors (often called a pentamirror
because of the five total surfaces in the structure), and more costly models
use a solid glass prism, called a pentaprism. The latter provides a brighter,
higher-contrast image that looks better and is easier to use for viewing and
focusing. However, pentamirror viewfinders can also be very good, particu-
larly if you don’t compare them directly with models using a pentaprism.
The light path for an image viewed by a pentamirror/pentaprism viewing
system is shown in Book III, Chapter 1.
Regardless of what optical or SLR viewing system you use, if you wear
glasses and want to shoot without them, you want to make sure your camera
either has built-in eyesight (diopter) correction to adjust for your near/
far-sightedness or can be fitted with corrective lenses matched to your pre-
scription. This vision correction enables you to get your eye close enough to

the viewfinder to see the whole image. Some viewfinders make it difficult for
those wearing glasses to see through the optical system because a bezel or
other part of the viewfinder prevents the glasses from getting close enough.
Considering Your Storage Options
The kind of storage your digital dream camera uses will never be a factor in
making your selection (unless it’s a truly odious choice, and that’s a matter
of personal taste). The days of the digital cameras that used floppy disks and
other oddball media are long gone. Today, all digital cameras use one (or
more) of the following options:
✦Secure Digital (SD): Among non-SLR cameras, the SD format is by far the
most popular memory card format. These postage-stamp-size cards,
which allow manufacturers to design smaller cameras, are available in
roughly the same capacities as CompactFlash, and cost about the same.
The chief drawback (to date) is that there are no mini hard drives in the
SD format. If you want to use a mini hard drive, you need a camera with
a CompactFlash slot. Some digital cameras can also use the similar (but
slower) MultiMediaCard (MMC).
✦CompactFlash (CF): CompactFlash is the second-most-favored format in
the United States. Although physically larger than SD, CompactFlash
cards are still very small and convenient to carry and use. As larger
capacities are introduced, they usually appear in CF format first. As a
bonus, the CompactFlash slot can also be used for mini hard drives,
such as those from IBM, with capacities of a gigabyte or more. They are
the most popular memory card format for digital SLRs.
✦xD and mini-xD: The xD and mini-xD formats are new, smaller than Secure
Digital, and supported by fewer vendors (currently only Olympus and
Fuji). Although it’s wise to avoid getting stuck using a Betamax format
when everyone else has converted to VHS, you’re safe in choosing a
camera using an xD variant. The vendors are important enough that even
if the format eventually fails, you should be able to purchase memory
cards for as long as your camera works. Indeed, because memory cards
are typically used over and over forever, the cards you purchase with your
camera or shortly thereafter are likely to serve you throughout your
camera’s useful life.
✦Sony Memory Stick: About the size of a stick of gum, Sony’s Memory
Sticks are useful because you can also use them with other devices, such
as MP3 players. They’re not going to replace CompactFlash, though. Sony
has had an unfortunate tendency to flip around among memory choices
for its digital camera, and didn’t stop when the Memory Stick was intro-
duced. It’s now available in Memory Stick (up to 128MB sizes), Memory
Stick Pro (larger capacities), Memory Stick Duo (a smaller version that

No Flash in the Pan: Determining Your Lighting Needs
108
needs an adapter to fit memory card readers outfitted for Memory Sticks),
and, most recently, Memory Stick Pro Duo (in capacities up to 4GB).
Whew!
✦Mini hard drives: For a long time, mini hard drives were your only
option when you needed more than a gigabyte of storage. If you’re using
a 6-megapixel or better camera and like to save your images as TIFF files
or in another lossless format, you need more than a gigabyte of storage.
However, with CompactFlash cards now available in 4–8GB sizes, the
mini hard drive is losing its capacity edge, and it has always cost more
than the equivalent silicon memory card. Although not excessively
prone to failure, mini hard drives do have moving parts and must be
handled with more care than memory cards.
✦CD-R/RW: Sony, in its never-ending quest to change its digital camera
media options annually, actually tried out both floppy disks and mini 
CD-R and CD-RW discs for its digital cameras. Although not really a bad
idea, because the media is relatively inexpensive (a 240MB mini CD-R is 
a lot cheaper than a 256MB CompactFlash card), this option never
caught on because digital camera memory requirements eventually
exceeded the capacity of mini CDs. Sony seems to have settled into an
ever-changing Memory Stick groove now.
Digital memory cards might be offered in various speeds, such as standard,
high-speed, 40X, Ultra, and Extreme, depending on the nomenclature used by
the vendor. The faster, more expensive media are able to store images more
quickly. Unless you’re shooting sequences and don’t want to wait even a
short time between pictures, standard media will probably do the job for
you. Some newer digital cameras that provide a high-speed burst-photo mode
require these higher-performance digital cards to function as advertised,
however. With memory cards now being offered in 133X and 150X speeds,
there’s no telling where the speed race will end.
No Flash in the Pan: Determining Your Lighting Needs
Your digital dream camera’s electronic flash capabilities (or lack of them)
should be on your list of things to evaluate before you make a purchase deci-
sion. Not every photo is possible using existing light. Even if there is plenty of
light, you might still want to fill in those inky shadows with an electronic flash.
Your camera’s built-in flash features are definitely something to consider.
Most digital cameras have a built-in flash unit that can be turned on or flipped
up or swung out or otherwise activated when you want to use a flash — or
when the camera decides for you that the flash is required. (Usually, a tip-off is
a flashing red light in your viewfinder or next to it. Time to flip up that flash!)

Book II
Chapter 1

No Flash in the Pan: Determining Your Lighting Needs
109
You should be aware that most flash units are good only over a particular
range. If you’ve ever seen a fan stand up in the balcony at a Bruce Springsteen
concert and take a flash picture of the Boss from 100 feet away, you’ll under-
stand just how limited flash is at long distances. Some units are so feeble that
they can only illuminate subjects 2 to 12 feet away. Others have special set-
tings to spread the flash illumination for wide-angle shots or tighten it up for
telephoto pictures.
Here are some features to look for in an electronic flash:
✦Auto-on: It’s useful to have a flash that can be set to flash only when it’s
needed. Some cameras require you to flip up the flash to use it. Others
build the flash into the body of the camera in such a way that the flash
can be used anytime.
✦Autoexposure: An electronic flash can sense the amount of light reflected
back from the subject and turn itself off when the exposure is sufficient. 
✦Red-eye prevention: Some flashes can be set to produce a short preflash
just before the picture is taken. That causes the subjects’ irises to con-
tract, reducing the possibility of the dreaded red-eye effect. Alternatively,
the preflash can fool your subjects into thinking that their ordeal is over
and produce some priceless weird expressions.
✦External flash capabilities: At
times, you want to use an external
flash, either in concert with or
instead of your camera’s built-in
flash. See whether your camera
has either a built-in flash-sync
socket or a hot shoe that you can
use to mount an external flash and
connect the camera to the flash.
Keep in mind that many digital
cameras require that you use only
a particular brand of flash to retain
the automated exposure features
or (in some cases) to avoid frying
your camera’s flash triggering cir-
cuit with too much voltage. If
you’re thinking of using a slave
sensor to trigger the flash, make
sure that it can be used with your
camera. The preflash of some cam-
eras will set off the slave unit.

unit fitted with a diffusing dome to
soften the illumination.

A Dozen Exotic Digital Camera Features

A Dozen Exotic Digital Camera Features
After automobile manufacturers introduced heated seats and the Global
Positioning System (GPS) for their luxury cars, everyone wanted them, so the
designers had to come up with other high-end features, like holographic
rearview mirrors and rocket-powered ejection seats. Digital camera vendors
are in a similar race to develop features that are similarly too-cool-for-school.
(Believe it or not, some high-end cameras can use GPS to record the camera’s
current geographical location when each picture is taken!) Here are some of
my favorite features that are exotic now but probably won’t be exotic by the
time you purchase your next camera:
✦Sound-activated self-timers: I had a ball playing with a new camera that
could be triggered by sound. Just set the audio sensitivity, go get in the
picture yourself, and shout, “Cheese!” No more racing to beat the self
timer or ending up with a photo showing you holding your camera’s
infrared (IR) remote control.
✦Ultra-fast shutter speeds: At least one camera has a shutter speed of
1/16,000 of a second. You might need a supernova as your illumination
source, but you can stop the fastest action with this baby.
✦Image stabilizers: Several cameras offer internal stabilization that cancels
the effects of shaky hands or the blur induced by the high magnification
of a telephoto lens. My favorite is the camera that automatically moves
the sensor in time with your camera jiggles.
✦Night shot capabilities: Digital camera sensors are inherently sensitive
to IR illumination, so vendors like Sony provide enhanced night photo-
graphy capabilities by taking advantage of this sensitivity.
✦Infrared photography: Many cameras have a device called a hot mirror
to filter out infrared light but allow flipping this filter out of the way or
leaving enough remaining IR sensitivity to allow you to take interesting
weird-tonal infrared pictures.
✦Predictive focus: Slow autofocus is the bane of digital cameras, which is
why I was glad to see the introduction of high-end models smart enough
to figure out where focus should be set ahead of time when you’re photo-
graphing subjects for which the focus changes rapidly.
✦Enhanced movies: Traditionally, digital cameras have been able to
shoot only short video clips (perhaps 15–30 seconds) at abysmal resolu-
tions (some no better than 320 x 240 pixels) and not necessarily with
sound. That’s changing with the latest crop. Some recent digital cameras
are virtual camcorders, letting you grab VHS-quality clips for as long as
your digital memory card holds out. Make sure your card is a capacious
one because digital video can eat up a megabyte a second!

✦Unlimited burst mode: I loved using an advanced digital camera that uses
a technique called pipelining to keep the images flowing onto the memory
card at high speed (when used with a high-speed card). I managed to take
more than 150 3.3-megapixel resolution photos in a row at around 4 frames
per second (fps) before my 256MB memory card filled up. Set to a lower
resolution, I took 1,500 shots in a little more than five minutes. My finger
got tired before this ultra-fast camera started slowing down. Think how
well you can analyze your golf swing with a camera like this!
✦Panorama photography: A growing number of digital cameras have cool
panorama capabilities that make it easy to shoot a series of pictures that
can be automatically stitched together in your computer. You find out
more about panorama photography in Book IV, Chapter 6.
✦Two-in-one shot: Don’t have a tripod but want to get in the photo 
yourself? Some cameras let you take a picture of the background,
have someone else take a picture of you, and then merge the two shots
automatically.
✦Underwater photography: I once purchased a Nikonos underwater film
camera specifically so I could take surfing photos at Huntington Beach,
California. (I wasn’t surfing; I was photographing surfers.) Now, anyone
with a digital camera and an inexpensive underwater housing offered for
Canon and other models can take pictures in, around, and under the sea.
Digital cameras are much better than my old Nikonos: You get to see
exactly what you shot right away, so you can jump back in and do it over
until you get it right.
✦Time-lapse photography: Thirty or forty years ago, the big thing was
time-lapse photos of flowers opening and paint drying. Today, every tele-
vision show includes a sunset-to-sunrise time-lapse sequence to demon-
strate that time marches on. Whether you have some flowers you want
to watch opening or you need to document a construction project, digi-
tal cameras with time-lapse capabilities can snap off a picture every few
seconds or every few hours, depending on how you set them. This is a
great feature that’s fun to play with.
Checking Out Ease of Use
I’ve saved the most important topic for last because I want it to sink firmly
into your mind as you put this book down and continue to think about what
you’re looking for in a digital camera. Usability is one of the most important
factors to keep in mind when choosing a camera. The sharpest lens, the
most sophisticated sensor, and the most advanced features are all useless 
if you can’t figure out how to operate the stupid camera! I’ve owned digital
cameras that absolutely could not be used without having the manual at

Checking Out Ease of Use
112
hand. Even common features were so hard to access that I sometimes
avoided taking certain kinds of pictures because activating the feature took
too long.
Ease of use is not limited to digital cameras, of course. Difficult-to-operate
cameras have been creeping up for 15 or 20 years. This was not always so.
When I began my photographic career as a newspaper photographer, film
cameras had a limited number of controls. There was a shutter speed dial, 
f-stops to set on the lens, focusing, and maybe a rewind knob to move the
film back into the cassette when the roll was finished. Over the years, elec-
tronic exposure controls were joined by exposure modes and a ton of other
features as film cameras became more and more computer-like.
Today, even digital cameras that most resemble their film counterparts bris-
tle with buttons, command dials, mode controls, menus, and icons. That’s
not necessarily a bad thing. What is evil is an interface that’s so convoluted
that even advanced users might have problems. You might have to wade
through nested menus to change the autofocus or exposure control mode.
Switching from aperture-priority to shutter-priority can be a pain. Something
as simple as changing from automatic focus to manual focus can be difficult,
particularly if you don’t make the switch very often and forget which combi-
nation of buttons to press.
Ease of use varies greatly, depending on which sets of features are most
important to you. A camera that one person might find a breeze to use might
be impossible for another person to manage simply because a particular
must-have feature is hard to access.
I urge you to try out any digital camera that you’re seriously considering
buying before you plunk down your money. A camera’s feature set, the
vendor’s reputation, or recommendations of a friend won’t tell you how the
camera will work for you. Hold the camera in your hand. Make sure it feels
right — that its weight and heft are comfortable to you. Be certain your 
fingers aren’t too large or too small to handle the controls. Can you see
through the viewfinder?
If possible, take the camera for a test drive, borrow a similar camera from a
friend or colleague, or at least shoot some photos in the store. Can you find
the features you use most? Can you figure out the menus and buttons? Is the
camera rugged enough to hold up under the kind of treatment you’ll subject
it to?
As much as I like buying by mail order or over the Internet, a digital camera is
too personal a tool to buy from specifications lists and photos. If you’re read-
ing this book, you’re probably serious enough about digital photography that
you’ll be spending a lot of time with your camera — and probably will spend
more than you expected to get the camera you really want. Make sure it really
is the one you want by giving it a thorough workout.

You might be ready for digital photography, but is your computer up to
the task? The good news is that virtually any computer of recent vintage
probably has the horsepower and features you need to work with the
digital images that you capture with a camera or scanner.
Even so, the differences between a computer that’s
good and one that’s good enough can be significant.
Your system might be exceptional, or it might be the
exception. You probably don’t want to work with
the minimal system possible even if you’d rather
invest your money in a better digital camera. (I
know, if faced with the choice of a new, superfast
computer and a digital single lens reflex, I’d
choose the camera every time.)
This chapter helps you develop your own checklist
of recommended hardware, shows you how to upgrade
to make your work even easier, and offers tips on setting
up your computer to make working with digital images a

Hardware Wars Revisited
Macs versus PCs. Why are we even having this conversation?
Well, it wasn’t my idea. Then Steve Jobs and his crew decided to abandon
the IBM microprocessors that have been inside every recent Macintosh and
replace them with something called a “dual core” chip from Intel. The new
Intel-based Macs are faster, still sexy, and have aroused the interest of even
dedicated Windows PC operators. Anyone weary of the weekly “critical 
security flaw updates” that plague Windows computers or who covets the
stylish and common-sense design of the Mac is now taking a serious look at
the computer arena’s “other” platform. That’s become especially true with
the introduction of the Macintosh Boot Camp software, which lets you install
Microsoft Windows XP on the new Intel-based Macs and boot either operat-
ing system.
Of course, digital photography, graphics work in general, and multimedia
production were the key arenas in which the Macintosh versus PC battle
never died out. In most other areas, Windows-based systems have taken
over the desktop, with Macs relegated to specialized or oddball applications.
Apple keeps coming up with compelling hardware, interesting computer
designs, and lots of quirky but cool applications (Garage Band, anyone?), but
those computer troops solidly camped in the Windows realm usually take
notice of what’s going on only when those cute Macintosh commercials
interrupt prime-time TV.
Not so in the digital photography world. Visit any newspaper or magazine
that relies on digital cameras, and you’ll find Macs. Drop in to any profes-
sional digital photographer’s studio, and you’ll see a brawny Macintosh
perched on the desktop. Talk to the top Photoshop users in the country.
Most of them are using Macintoshes, too, either exclusively or in tandem
with a Windows box.
Indeed, for a long time the only logical choice for most photographers has
been the Macintosh. The decision was along the lines of selecting a 35mm
Nikon or Canon SLR for photojournalism or a Sinar view camera for studio
work: a no-brainer. Although I don’t have hard figures, my gut feeling is that
Macs outnumber PCs in many imaging production environments by at least 
8 to 1. In the rest of the business world, the figures are reversed, except on
television, where anyone shown with a laptop computer is always using an
Apple PowerBook.
By and large, the latest Macintoshes provide enough muscle for virtually any
still-image work, particularly when equipped with dual processor chips (which
provide extra speed with applications designed to work with multiple CPUs)
and gigabytes of memory. No photographer need be ashamed of driving a
properly equipped Mac.

In the digital photography world, Macs are not only viable but are often the
system of choice. However, in some cases, you might not have a choice —
maybe you already own a computer or need to use a particular system to
remain compatible with friends and colleagues.
Yet, if you aren’t locked into a particular platform and operating system,
should you be using a Macintosh or a Windows computer? If you want a
definitive answer, I’d say, “It depends.” (Which isn’t very definitive, is it?)
Each platform has its pros and cons. Here is a summary of some of the
things you should consider:
✦The bandwagon effect: If you plan to make your living (at least in part)
from digital photography, you need to learn two things: how to use a
Mac and how to perform image magic with Photoshop. Both skills are
expected to be part of your résumé. Jump on the bandwagon while you
can. On the other hand, Windows proficiency is expected for most jobs
outside imaging. Unless you’re a full-time graphics professional, you
might have to learn to wear two hats.
✦Ease of use: The Macintosh is generally acknowledged to be a bit easier
to learn and somewhat easier to use for many tasks. Of course, the
Macintosh system’s vaunted ease of use has been subverted over the
years as Apple has tried to catch up with Windows systems. (For exam-
ple, if you want to stick with the Mac’s sublimely simple single-button
mouse, you must augment it by holding down the Control key while
clicking to reproduce the Windows two-button mouse’s right-click
option. You can also reprogram certain Macintosh mice to provide the
same results.) If you’re just starting out in computing and don’t want to
climb a steep learning curve, the Mac is your computer.
✦Software compatibility: Not all applications are available for both Mac
and PC. Most key applications are offered for both, including the
Photoshop CS2 image editor, shown in Figure 2-1 in both Mac and
Windows incarnations; the StuffIt archiving tool; browsers such as
Netscape and Internet Explorer; and word processing applications such
as Microsoft Word. Plus, Microsoft is now offering Virtual PC for the
Macintosh, making it possible to run Windows XP and Windows appli-
cations under Mac OS X on many different Macs. Boot Camp does the
same thing for the latest Intel-based Macintosh models. But if you must
be totally compatible with Windows, you still need Windows.
✦The cost factor: Macs have generally been more expensive than PCs,
although the cost difference has decreased over the years. Even so, with
powerful Pentium systems available in barebones configurations for
$500 or so, even the least expensive Mac capable of image editing still
costs a bit more. In the Mac’s favor, however, most peripherals and add-
ons, such as memory, hard drives, DVD devices, monitors, and so forth,
cost the same whether you’re purchasing them for a Mac or a PC.

117
✦Hardware reliability: Reliability is a double-edged sword. Macs are won-
derfully crafted machines, a beauty to behold when you dismantle one,
and filled with high-quality components. The insides of some of the
assembly-line-built PCs have a decidedly industrial look, and if you
examine the parts, you might find a mixture of known brand-name pieces
and what’s this? components. On the other hand, if something does break
on your PC, you can run down to the local MegaMart and buy a new
floppy drive, a CD burner, and maybe some memory off the shelf next to
the cell phone batteries. My local grocery store carries these items. Macs
also use many off-the-shelf components, but some specialized parts for
your Mac might be harder to come by, and it’s unlikely you’ll know how
to replace them anyway. So, even assuming the Mac is more reliable than
the average PC, is that always an advantage?
✦Operating system reliability: Trust me, Macs do crash, especially when
Apple is making a transition, as it did from Mac OS 9.x to OS X or from
the current version of OS X to the next one. Early versions of a Mac OS
can crash and burn as spectacularly as any Windows release. On the
other hand, Mac users don’t add hardware or new applications at the
same clip as Windows users, who seem to be constantly trying this new
utility or that, applying the monthly patches Microsoft issues for its soft-
ware and OS, and doing other fiddling that can lead directly to the Blue
Screen of Death (BSOD).
Anyone who swears his or her Windows installation never crashes is
probably using Windows XP, never runs more than two or three applica-
tions at once, and avoids installing new software more often than once
every six months. I’m an exception to that rule: I haven’t had a crash in
more than a year. That’s when I uninstalled XP Service Pack 2 and
stopped applying Microsoft’s monthly patches. The secret is that none
of the updates in the past year fixed any operating flaws in Windows XP;
they were all repairs for security defects. As long as I hide behind my
firewall, don’t use Internet Explorer, and am careful about what Web
sites I visit, I’m able to run my antique installation of Windows with no
crashes. Still, if avoiding crashes is on your holiday gift list, the Mac still
has the edge. This may eventually change as Apple completes the transi-
tion to Intel processors, and virus-happy hackers turn their attention to
producing viruses and ill-behaved applications that exploit the weak-
nesses that exist in Mac OS.
✦Technological superiority and coolness: If owning a computer that
looks like a Tensor lamp or is built into an LCD screen is your cup of tea,
and you like the idea of having cool stuff before anyone else, you really,
really need a Macintosh. The most exotic hard drive interfaces (from
SCSI in the ’80s to FireWire in the ’90s) came to the Mac first, along with
flat-panel displays, DVD burners, and other radical innovations that
turned out to be a little (or a lot) before their time.

What Equipment Do You Need?
118
Hardware differences aside, the most visible differences between Macs and
PCs (after you get past transparent, multicolored cases and eye-catching
design tricks) stem from the two competing operating systems. A few years
ago, a dual-barbed joke was circulating, implying that the current version of
Windows was almost identical to the Macintosh operating system of 1984.
But of course, the same observer noted, the current Mac OS was also almost
identical to the Macintosh operating system of 1984. The more things
change, the more they stay the same.
The gibe is no longer true. Windows has been transformed into Windows XP,
which is the most stable, easiest-to-use operating system Microsoft has ever
offered, even if it does still resemble some of the older versions of Mac OS. At
the same time, Mac OS is completely different, too. Mac OS X is now a thinly
disguised version of Unix, which is both good news and bad news. Unix is more
stable than the OS 9.x and earlier versions that preceded it, but Mac-Unix has
some underlying complexities (including — horror of horrors — a command
line interface if you want it) that didn’t intrude themselves on Macintosh
users in the past.
Windows has its advantages and disadvantages. One advantage is that it’s
almost universally available and has the broadest range of widely used appli-
cations written for it. One disadvantage is that Windows still forces you to
do things the Microsoft way when you’d really rather do them your own way.
For example, Windows XP is fond of setting up your network the way it likes,
bludgeons you into using Internet Explorer even if you prefer Firefox, Opera,
or Netscape, and has a tendency to coerce you into using the Windows
Media Player for everything and anything.
Mac OS, on the other hand, lets you do things your own way quite easily.
Would you prefer that your digital camera application be installed on your
secondary hard drive rather than the one you first installed it on? Just drag
it to the new hard drive; there’s no need to uninstall it and reinstall it as you
must do with Windows.
Although you probably won’t choose a computer based on the operating
system, these things are nice to know.
What Equipment Do You Need?
Digital cameras themselves make few demands on a computer system, of
course. The real drain on your system is running your image editing program
and storing your images for editing or archival purposes. Make no mistake,
image editing is among the most demanding types of work you can lay on a
computer, so before you start down this road, you’ll want to know about the
minefields that lie along the way. If you want the flying short-course, the ten
most important things you’ll need to consider are

Determining How Much Memory You Need
119
✦Memory
✦More memory
✦Even more memory
✦Adequate local storage (a fast, big hard drive. Or two.)
✦A fast microprocessor
✦Archival storage
✦Advanced video display capabilities (maybe two monitors)
✦Other peripherals, such as digitizing tablet and pen devices
✦A little more memory
✦More RAM than you thought you’d ever need
The rest of this chapter examines each of these needs thoroughly.
Determining How Much Memory You Need
If you noticed that I listed memory five times in the preceding top ten list,
there’s a reason for that. Memory makes everything else possible. A fast, big
hard drive is also important because it gives you room to work with your
current project’s files and can substitute for RAM (memory) when you finally
do run out. But nothing can replace memory when decent performance is
your goal.
You can finish reading the rest of this section if you want to know the hows,
whys, and how muches of memory, but I can give you a two-word recommen-
dation that will let you skip ahead, if you want:
Two gigabytes!
That much RAM will cost you very little, perhaps a couple hundred dollars;
it’s the most RAM the current version of Photoshop can use; and it will solve
most of your problems. We now continue with the technical portion of our
program (for those of you who aren’t skipping ahead).
I can’t emphasize this point enough: When you’re working with images, you
must have, as a bare minimum, at least six to ten times as much RAM as the
largest image file you plan to work with on a regular basis. With inexpensive
8-megapixel cameras now available for a few hundred dollars, many digital
photos in their native RAW format can be huge, requiring 180–600MB of RAM
for each image you want open at once. If you’re working with more reason-
ably sized 4MB images but need to have ten of them open at one time, you
still need tons of memory to do the job.

Choosing Local Storage
120
Without sufficient RAM, all the bucks you spend on a super-speedy micro-
processor are totally wasted. Your other heavy-duty hardware is going to
come to a screeching halt every time you scroll, apply a filter, or perform
any of a number of simple functions. That’s because without enough RAM to
keep the entire image in memory at once — plus your image editor’s Undo
files (basically copies of the image in its most recent states) — your com-
puter is forced to write some or all of the image to your hard drive to make
room for the next portion it needs to work with.
Digital photography can produce some large images, too, especially if you’re
working with a serious camera in the 8- to 12-megapixel range and choose to
save your files in the highest-quality mode. An 18MB image is fairly common
these days, so you should be prepared with as much RAM as you can cram
into your computer.
Most systems have two to four memory slots, which can each hold a
256–1024MB memory stick. Loading your computer with 2GB of memory is
not at all outlandish and is relatively inexpensive. You can purchase that
much memory for a few hundred dollars. Any Mac or PC with 512MB or less
of RAM is hopelessly under-equipped for digital photography. Beefing up
your memory can be the least expensive and most dramatic speed enhance-
ment you can make.
Indeed, a few years ago, when I upgraded from my ancient 800 MHz Windows
computer to a spiffy new 2.8 GHz Pentium 4 model, I was annoyed to find that
my new computer seemed to be significantly slower than my old one. It didn’t
take long to discover the reason. My older computer had 2GB of RAM, but my
new “faster” one was initially equipped with a mere 512MB of memory. When
I worked with large digital photos, Photoshop didn’t have enough RAM to
keep more than one or two images in memory at one time. It was forced to
continually swap image information out to the hard drive to make room for
the changes I made. Having a processor that was more than three times faster
made no difference: Lack of memory was slowing everything down through a
poky hard-drive bottleneck.
Within a week, I upgraded the Pentium system to 2GB of RAM, and guess
what? It really flew! If you feel your current computer is slow, try adding
memory before upgrading to a faster processor. You might be surprised. With
any luck, an upcoming version of Photoshop will be able to use more than 2GB
of RAM, and we’ll get even better performance. (With real luck, that version
will be available when you’re reading this!)
Choosing Local Storage
Your graphics powerhouse is only as fast as its narrowest bottleneck, so
you should pay special attention to that looming potential roadblock I just

Choosing Local Storage
121
mentioned: your mass storage subsystems. You need one or more big hard
drives for several reasons:
✦To keep as many images as possible available for near-instant access:
A large hard drive enables you to store all your current projects — plus
many from recent months — all in one place for quick reference or
reuse. With a large hard drive, you can store a vast library of your own
photographic clip art, too, and avoid having to sort through stacks of
archive CDs.
✦To provide working space for your current projects: You’ll want scratch
space — space on your hard drive — to store images that you probably
won’t need but want to have on hand just in case. Alternate versions of
images eat up more space as you refine your project. Image editors such
as Photoshop also need spare hard drive space to keep multiple copies
of each image you’re editing.
✦To let you store additional applications: Good bets here would be
panorama-generating programs, a second or third image editor for spe-
cialized needs, utility programs, extra plug-in programs, and so forth.
In the recent past, your hard drive storage options were limited to internal
hard drives in one of two categories: fast, expensive hard drives using a
Small Computer System Interface (SCSI; SKUZ-zee); or inexpensive, slow hard
drives using the Enhanced Integrated Drive Electronics (EIDE) interface or
ATA (Advanced Technology Attachment). Today, the technologies have con-
verged. SCSI drives no longer cost that much more than ATA disks, but they
are now used only for specialized applications, such as file servers, where
the SCSI interface’s ability to address many drives simultaneously comes in
handy. Fortunately, ATA drives have gotten much, much faster. Moreover,
new options have appeared, chiefly in the form of external hard drives that
link to your computer via FireWire or Universal Serial Bus (USB) and a new
kind of internal drive called Serial ATA (or SATA.)
SCSI and EIDE hard drives
You don’t see SCSI disks used much outside server environments these days.
Their chief advantage is that your computer can transfer information to and
from several SCSI disks simultaneously. That’s because SCSI is a system-level
interface that conveys information in logical terms: Multiple devices can use
the same connection in parallel fashion, although more intelligence is
required to decode requests from the computer. Other kinds of hard drives,
particularly EIDE/ATA drives, might have to take turns talking to your com-
puter, which can reduce performance. Peripherals are so fast these days that
the difference in performance between SCSI and other systems is seldom
important outside the server farm.
The chief advantage of drives in the EIDE/SuperATA and the very latest serial
ATA (SATA) categories is that they are almost free. As I was writing this book,

Archiving and Backing Up
122
even mammoth 500GB hard drives could be purchased for a lot less than 
50 cents per gigabyte, and I expect the cost per byte will drop even more
dramatically during the life of this book as the latest 750GB and larger disks
become standard. However, even at 50 cents per gigabyte, hard drives aren’t
that much more expensive than CD-R media.
External hard drives
With external hard drives, you’re no longer limited to the number of disk
drives you can cram into your computer’s housing. These disks link to your
computer using an IEEE 1394 (FireWire) or USB 2.0 interface, such as the one
shown in Figure 2-2.
Figure 2-2: This drive uses slide-out trays to allow hot-swapping one disk drive for another.
The advantage of external storage is that you can install and remove FireWire
and USB 2.0 drives without opening your computer’s tower, and you don’t
need to worry about how to fit them in the case. You can also easily move
such an external drive from computer to computer.
Archiving and Backing Up
Digital photos can fill even the largest hard drive faster than Yankee
Stadium on Bat Day. Your graphics powerhouse needs open-ended storage

123
that is relatively cheap and reliable and that provides near-online (perma-
nent storage) access speeds.
Zip disks (R.I.P.)
I mention Zip disks because they eventually became a part of popular cul-
ture, almost turned into a generic term, and threatened to replace the floppy
disk before $40 CD and DVD burners killed them off. Today, you see Zip disks
only in old spy movies in which a secret agent copies crucial data while a
bar graph on the computer display shows the progress. Today, solid state
“thumb” or “jump” drives do the same thing more cheaply and plug right
into your USB port. (The latest spy movies show the agents using a thumb
drive, but the bar graph remains maddeningly slow because the need for sus-
pense hasn’t been eliminated by the pace of technology.)
CD-Rs and CD-RWs
CD-R and CD-RW discs have a bit more credibility in this arena because you
can cram a healthy 700MB on a CD that can cost as little as a nickel. You still
wouldn’t want to back up your 160GB drive to 200 CD-RW discs (even though
the media itself might cost you only $20), but it’s entirely practical to archive
your digital photos on this media if you are using a camera with no more
than 5 or 6 megapixels of resolution. For cameras that produce larger files,
even CDs don’t have much capacity.
DVDs
DVDs have become a more viable long-term storage medium, even though
the basic one-layer DVD barely holds the contents of a 4GB memory card.
(And those of us with higher-resolution cameras can fill up a 4GB card very
quickly; on a recent trip I snapped roughly 4GB of photos every day for ten
days running.) Depending on how many layers are used, DVDs can store up
to 8GB or more each. The cost of DVD burners is coming down, and this
medium should become more popular when the industry settles on a single,
standard format. In a world with DVD-ROM, DVD-RAM, DVD+RW, and DVD-
RW, the best plan is to buy a DVD burner that supports them all. Things
might become more complicated in the future when the newer, extra-high
capacity DVDs (including the blue-laser Blu-ray discs) become available.
Avoiding Microprocessor No-brainers
The fastest microprocessor might not be absolutely essential for image edit-
ing if you’re using a digital camera with about 5 megapixels of resolution.
Higher resolutions call for more horsepower, however, and if you’re buying a
new machine, there’s no reason not to buy one with the fastest microproces-
sor available, within reason. The microprocessor is what processes many of

Determining What’s Most Important
124
your program instructions — everything that isn’t handled by a separate dig-
ital signal processing chip. So the faster the microprocessor runs, the faster
your image editing software will work, generally speaking.
Each individual element of an image involves from 1 to 4 or more bytes of
information. An RGB (red/green/blue) image requires 3 bytes per pixel, a
CMYK (cyan/magenta/yellow/black) image needs 4, and additional alpha
(selection) channels take up 1 byte each. Even a relatively minuscule 640 x
480, 24-bit image can involve nearly 1MB of data.
If you ask your image editor to apply an image-processing filter to an entire
image, your microprocessor must calculate the effects of that filter on each and
every one of those million bytes. That can take a second or two with a very fast
system or as long as a minute or much more with very slow computers.
And although there are other constraints (such as memory or hard drive
speed), the speed of the microprocessor affects nearly everything you do on
your system. As you might guess, a fast CPU should be a major considera-
tion when assembling a graphics workstation from scratch. You might not
need the fastest microprocessor available, but then again, you never hear
anyone complaining that a computer is just too darn fast.
Determining What’s Most Important
Even though I went three years between new computers, I generally buy a
new system more often than that, and upgrade most other components more
frequently than that. However, I keep three pieces of equipment for years
and years. I lavish all available funds on the original purchases and hang
onto them as long as possible. Those three items are my display screen, my
keyboard, and my mouse.
This trio involves the components you interface directly with all day, every
day, usually for long periods of time. For efficiency and sanity’s sake, you
should insist that these pieces of equipment be only the very best available,
and don’t change them capriciously. I liked the IBM keyboard that came with
my IBM PS/2 in 1987 so much that I am still using it about two decades later
(even on my Macintosh, thanks to a keyboard/video/monitor switch). My
ball-less, cordless, infrared wireless mouse has been serving me well for sev-
eral years, and I only recently replaced my beloved 19-inch CRT monitor
with an almost-identical model. I look at or touch these components all day,
every day, and they’re worth every penny I spent.
For digital photographers, your display and video card are two of the most
important components in your system. You need a video card with 64–128MB
of fast memory (or more) so that you can view 24-bit images with 16.8 million
colors at resolutions of up to 2048 x 1536 (or more) on a 19- to 24-inch monitor.

A combination like that enables you to examine your photos closely, array 
several large images side-by-side, and view pictures at a size very close to
their printed size. Here are some specific recommendations:
✦Unless you also play computer games, you don’t need to spend hundreds
of dollars on video cards with video accelerators so powerful that they
require their own fans. Instead, sink your funds into a video card with
enough RAM to display images at high resolution. Think 2-D instead of 3-D.
✦Consider buying a dual-head video card capable of displaying separate
images on two different monitors. You’ll find that most serious Photoshop
users and digital photographers work with two monitors (at least). One
monitor can contain your image editor, and another can display a Web
browser or another application. Or, you can move Photoshop’s palettes to
the second monitor to make more room for your images.
Another trick is to use different resolutions for each monitor, say 1920 x
1440 on one for a high-res display, and 1024 x 768 for a larger view on the
second monitor. If a Web page is hard to read on my main display, I often
just slide it over to the second monitor at 1024 x 768 for a closer view.
Figure 2-3 shows a dual monitor setup in the Display control panel.
Figure 2-3: Dual monitors can be set up in your Control Panel.

✦Two video cards can also give you dual monitor capabilities. When I
upgraded, I purchased an “obsolete” 64MB PCI video card for about $40
and installed it in tandem with my system’s original AGP card. I then pur-
chased a 17-inch monitor with multiple rebates for a net cost of $49. For
less than a C-note, I was in dual monitor heaven.
✦Check out the monitor you buy in the store before you purchase it.
You’ll be staring at it all day, so you want a sharp image that you can
live with.
✦If you’ve been using CRT monitors for awhile, expect a surprise when
you go to replace your display, as I was when I got my latest 19-inch
tube-based monitor. These displays are starting to become hard to find
and are being replaced wholesale with LCD monitors. That’s not good
news for the budget-minded because LCD displays are still a bit more
expensive than the CRT type, and the cheapest models are not suitable
for image editing. The cheap-o models have colors that aren’t accurate,
they don’t offer an easy way to calibrate them, and their fixed resolution
may not be fine enough for image editing.
Of course, on the plus side for LCDs, you can tuck one of these flat beau-
ties into the most confined desktop or even hang one on the wall. And
they don’t require geometry (shape), convergence (alignment of the
electron guns), or focus adjustments. They’re easier on the eye, emit no
radiation, use as little as ten percent of the power of a tube-based dis-
play, and are not affected by electromagnetic fields.
However, LCDs might not be as bright as your trusty CRT monitor, and
most have a rather limited viewing angle, making it difficult for more than
one person to see the screen clearly. Most LCDs also have a narrower
color gamut than a CRT and are more difficult to calibrate. But if you are
able to do so, they rarely need to be recalibrated.
Look for an LCD with a high contrast ratio (700:1 to 1000:1 is good), and
with the resolution you need. A 20–21 inch LCD should offer 1920 x 1200-
pixel resolution. You don’t want to edit images on a 1280 x 960-pixel dis-
play. Also find one with a DVI interface so you can connect to your video
card’s digital connector rather than analog link.
If you insist on a CRT monitor, you must consider a few monitor specifica-
tions and controls. For example, sharpness is often measured in terms of dot
pitch, which is supposed to be the distance, measured diagonally, between
the centers of two RGB phosphor dot triads (found on a CRT). Some ven-
dors, however, measure horizontally, yielding a smaller dot pitch figure that
doesn’t reflect the true sharpness of the image (anything between .22mm
and .27mm is acceptable).
Other specs, such as color convergence (how accurately the electron guns are
aimed); video bandwidth (measured in megahertz; determines how well an
analog signal is displayed onscreen without ghosting or the loss of brightness

in thin lines); or refresh rate (the number of times per second an image is
renewed) affect your viewing experience. Of these three, the refresh rate is
the most important. Most people perceive a 75 Hz refresh rate at most resolu-
tions as flicker-free, compared with, say, a 60–68 Hz refresh rate. The less
flicker, the longer you can stare at your monitor without going blind (or at
least getting a whopping headache). When buying a monitor, your best bet is
to try one out in the store and purchase the one that looks good to you.
Choosing Pointing Devices
Can you sign your name with a bar of soap? No? Can you sign your name with
a pen? If so, you probably would be more comfortable doing graphics work
with a pen-based graphics tablet rather than a clunky old mouse. Pressure-
sensitive tablets with cordless pens are especially cool. Used with applications
that support pressure-sensitive pads, such as Photoshop, they enable you to
draw thicker lines just by pressing harder. Tablets and pens are a very natural
way of working with graphics; if you can draw, you can use one faster and
more accurately than you can sketch with a mouse. Trackballs and alternate
mice are also choices if you prefer them. A typical pressure-sensitive pad and
stylus are shown in Figure 2-4.

and stylus.

hen you take pictures with a conventional film camera, you end up with
a roll of exposed film that must go to a photo lab (or the minilab at
your local drug store) for processing and printing using special chemicals and
darkroom equipment. When you get the prints back a few hours or
days later, you get to see how your pictures turned out. Often, a
fair number of pictures end up in the trash, and you keep
the rest. If you want extra prints or enlargements of the
good shots, it’s back to the lab to order reprints.
One of the great things about digital photography
is that you don’t have to process and print every
single image you shoot. Most digital cameras let
you preview your images right in the camera, so
you know immediately how you did. And you can
discard the obvious blunders and bloopers before
anyone else sees them. What remains are the pic-
tures you want to print.
With digital photography, there’s no need to go to a
photo lab to get prints from your pictures. The darkroom
and lab are as close and convenient as your own computer. But
unlike conventional photography, there’s no roll of exposed film to send off
for processing. Instead, you move your digital pictures from your camera to
your computer by copying the image files from one device to the other.
How you do that depends on the features of your camera (and to a lesser
extent, your computer). This chapter first addresses the various camera-to-
computer connections you’re likely to encounter and then describes the
process of transferring images from camera to computer.

Making the Connection between Camera and Computer
130
Making the Connection between Camera and Computer
Before you can use your computer as a digital darkroom to process and
print pictures from your digital camera, you must get your picture files out
of the camera and into the computer. After you save the images as files on
your computer’s hard drive, you can manipulate them with the image editing
software of your choice and print them on your printer. Books V and VI
describe the basics of editing images and working with Photoshop products
to do so.
Some printers are capable of accepting images directly from a digital camera
and printing them without going through an image editing program or other
software on your computer. These use the PictBridge standard, which was
created for printing from digital cameras to printers by using a direct con-
nection, without the need of a PC. The camera and printer can be made by
different vendors; all devices that support the new PictBridge specification
(and the number is growing all the time; check your camera manual) should
work fine with any other device that conforms to the standard.
Several technologies for transferring pictures from your camera to your
computer are available. The range of options might seem confusing, but you
don’t need to worry about most of them because a given camera rarely sup-
ports more than one or two options.
In general, the image-transfer technologies fall into three broad categories:
✦Wired connections: A cable, wire, or other connection enables you to
transfer picture information from the camera to the computer. Some ven-
dors offer docks with a niche for certain model cameras, like the one
shown in Figure 3-1, allowing direct transfer between the camera and the
printer and/or your computer. The communication between your com-
puter and your camera is similar to that between your computer and
other peripheral devices, such as printers, scanners, or external
modems. I discuss wired connections in the following section.
✦Wireless connections: In the future, more digital cameras will use wire-
less transfer to beam pictures directly to a computer or printer. Today,
you’ll find such connections chiefly on high-end digital SLRs and a few
consumer cameras, including new Kodak EasyShare models, and cam-
eras that use Bluetooth technology.
✦Removable media: The camera stores picture data on a memory card
that you can remove from the camera and then insert into a drive, slot,
or reader on your computer. This process is much like saving files to a
floppy disk and then moving the disk to another computer and access-
ing the files there. For information about different types of removable
media, see the later section, “Memory cards.”

Figure 3-1: Docks allow slipping your digital camera into a connector that’s already wired 
to your printer or computer.
Getting Wired
When you look at the back (or, often, front) of a typical computer, you see a
variety of sockets and ports in different shapes and sizes. Some of them
probably have cables attached that lead to assorted peripheral devices,
such as your mouse and your printer. Camera manufacturers can choose
from several of these ports in order to connect the camera to the computer.
However, you rarely find any one camera with more than one type of wired
connection.
Serial cable
The serial port was the old standby for connecting miscellaneous peripheral
devices to a computer. It was used for everything from external modems to
pointing devices, and, of course, it was used in the past for many digital cam-
eras. Nowadays, most digital camera manufacturers use a USB connection
instead of the older serial connection, and USB connections are also used for
modems, mice, and keyboards. There is very little application for the origi-
nal serial connection these days, and I mention it just for completeness.
Enough said.

Getting Wired
132
USB
The USB (Universal Serial Bus) port is the all-purpose connection that has
largely replaced the older serial, parallel, and PS/2 (mouse/keyboard) ports.
The older alternatives haven’t gone away completely yet, but USB is increas-
ingly becoming the connection of choice for many computer devices, includ-
ing digital cameras. The original USB 1.1 port has already been supplanted
by the faster USB 2.0 version now found on new computers. Cameras and
other peripherals will work with either type, although at a slower speed
when connected to a USB 1.1 port.
USB connections are capable of moving data faster than the older serial and
parallel connections. Because USB connections are also hot swappable, you
can safely plug in and unplug USB cables without shutting down your com-
puter. You can also expand the number of USB ports available by adding a
hub (a small box containing multiple USB ports) or a device, such as a key-
board or monitor, that has extra USB ports built in. Then, you can plug your
camera or other USB device into the added ports, just as you can the USB
ports on the back of your computer. Your USB hub may need a power
adapter to run some equipment. Some gear works from the unadorned port,
drawing power from your computer, but others require more juice.
Some older computers might not have
USB ports built in. You can upgrade
most of those computers with a 
relatively inexpensive add-in card to
provide the needed USB ports.
The USB port is a small, flat, rectan-
gular socket approximately 3⁄16 x 1⁄2 inch.
You usually find at least two of them
on the back of your computer, clearly
marked with the special symbol
shown in the margin. USB ports
might also be available on the front
of the computer, on a USB hub (like
the one shown in Figure 3-2), or on a
keyboard or other device that has a
built-in hub.
You can use any of these ports to connect your camera to the computer. Just
follow these steps (with your computer turned on):
1. Plug one end of the cable into the USB port on your camera.
The USB connector is often hidden behind a small door on your camera.
It’s sometimes a squared-off, D-shaped socket, approximately 1⁄4 x 5⁄16 inch.
If your camera includes a standard USB port, you can use a standard USB

connecting many different peripherals 
at once.

cable, which has a rectangular plug on one end and a square plug on the
other. However, most digital cameras now use a smaller mini-USB connec-
tion to save space. In that case, you may need to use the special cable
supplied with your camera if it’s not a standard mini-USB connector.
2. Plug the other end of the cable into the USB port on your computer or
USB hub.
3. Insert the camera manufacturer’s driver disc into your computer if
prompted to do so.
Windows automatically recognizes when a new device is added to a USB
port. The first time you connect your camera to the computer, Windows
versions prior to Windows XP might need to load drivers supplied by the
camera manufacturer in order to access the camera. Mac OS also recog-
nizes new peripherals when plugged in.
4. Use the camera manufacturer’s software (or other file-management
software) to transfer image files from the camera to the computer.
FireWire
FireWire connections (formally known as IEEE 1394) are an alternative to
USB connections. Like USB, FireWire transfers data faster than serial 
and parallel ports and is hot-swappable. You can also connect multiple
FireWire-equipped devices to the computer. FireWire connections are a 
standard feature on all Macintosh computers built in the last few years.
FireWire is also available for PCs, but built-in FireWire on a PC is only now
becoming common because USB does most of what Windows users need to
do. You might need to purchase and install an add-in card for your PC if your
camera needs a FireWire connection.
FireWire isn’t common on digital still
cameras; you encounter it more fre-
quently on digital video cameras. But
because some digital video cameras can
capture still images as well as digital
video, I guess that qualifies them as dig-
ital photography devices.
The FireWire port (shown in Figure 3-3)
is a small, rectangular socket that looks
similar to a USB port. The FireWire port
is a little fatter than a USB port, however,
so there’s no chance of mistakenly plug-
ging a FireWire cable into a USB port or
vice versa.
Figure 3-3: The two business ends of a
FireWire connection look like this.

Getting Wired
134
Follow these steps to connect your camera to your computer via a 
FireWire port:
1. Plug one end of the cable into the FireWire port on your camera.
The FireWire connector is often hidden behind a small door on your
camera and is identified with the symbol shown in the margin. If your
camera includes a standard FireWire port like the one on your computer,
you can use a standard FireWire cable, which has identical plugs on each
end. However, if your camera uses a special cable configuration to save
space, you need to use the special cable that came with your camera.
2. Plug the other end of the cable into the FireWire port on your computer.
3. Insert the camera manufacturer’s disc into your computer if prompted
to do so.
Like USB, Windows and the Mac automatically recognize when a new
device is added to a FireWire port and will prompt you for a disc if it
needs to load drivers supplied by the camera manufacturer in order to
access the camera.
4. Use the camera manufacturer’s software (or other file management
software) to transfer image files from the camera to the computer.
Riding the (infrared) light wave
An IrDA (Infrared Data Association) port enables you to transfer computer
data from one device to another by using pulses of infrared light instead of a
physical wire. The process is similar to how most TV remote controls send
channel and volume adjustment instructions to the TV. Infrared connections
are slow and not very reliable, but those drawbacks are countered by the con-
venience of not having to poke around the back of your computer every time
you want to make a connection or deal with wires that get tangled and lost.
An IrDA port looks like a small, dark red (nearly black) lens or window. You
find them on some digital camera models from Kodak and Hewlett-Packard,
and on a few printers and laptop computers, but rarely as standard equip-
ment on a desktop computer. If your computer doesn’t have an IrDA port,
you can purchase an adapter that will probably connect to your computer
via a cable to one of the standard serial or USB ports.
To use an IrDA port to transfer pictures to your computer, follow these steps
(with your computer turned on):
1. Turn on your camera and set it for infrared data transfer.
Use the camera’s controls to select the infrared data transfer mode.
Each camera model is different, so refer to your camera’s instructions
for details.

2. Position the camera’s infrared port so that it points toward the
infrared port on your computer.
Although it’s possible to make an infrared connection from several feet
away, you generally get better results when the two infrared ports are
close together (just a few inches apart). Ensure that no obstructions are
between the two IrDA ports and that no bright lights (such as sunlight
from a nearby window) are shining on the infrared sensors.
3. Use the camera manufacturer’s software on your computer to start
transferring picture data.
Transfers with teeth (blue)
Some computers and printers have Bluetooth adapters that can be used to
accept images from Bluetooth-enabled devices (which these days are mostly
cell phones). To transfer images from your device, you must first “pair” your
two Bluetooth components so they recognize each other. Then follow the
instructions that came with your camera and computer or printer to make
the exchange.
Memory Cards 
All digital cameras have some form of built-in memory to store the pictures
you shoot. In many cases, the memory medium that the camera uses is a
card that you can remove from the camera. Using removable media to store
image data has a couple of advantages over fixed, built-in memory.
First, you can swap out a full memory card (sometimes referred to as a digi-
tal film card) and insert another to increase the number of digital photos you
can take without erasing some from memory. It’s like putting a fresh roll of
film in a conventional camera.
Second, you can use the removable memory media to transfer images to
your computer for processing and printing. All you need is a suitable card
reader on your computer, and you can read the image files directly from the
memory card without attaching the camera to the computer.
The following points give you some insight on inserting, removing, and access-
ing files on cards (which can be a trickier endeavor than you might think):
✦To remove a memory card of any type from your digital camera (or com-
puter), just press the eject button next to the card slot (for some kinds
of cards) to pop the card loose from its connection. Then you can grab
the end of the card and pull it out of its slot. Other kinds of cards pop
out automatically when you press them.

Memory Cards
136
✦To insert a memory card into a laptop computer, card reader, or digital
camera, insert the card connector-edge first into the slot. Slide the card
all the way in and press it firmly but gently to seat the connectors along
the edge of the card. If the card won’t go all the way into the slot, it’s
probably upside down. Flip it over and try again.
✦After you insert the memory card into your computer, you should be
able to access it as a virtual disk drive. You can use your normal file-
management techniques to copy and move image files from the memory
card to your computer’s hard drive. See Book I, Chapter 5 for more on
managing your digital photo files.
Windows XP and Mac OS X will usually recognize your digital memory card
in a card reader or when you connect your camera and will pop up a dialog
box like the one shown in Figure 3-4. You can choose one of the actions 
available, including copying the files to your computer and erasing them
from the memory card when finished. Some applications, such as Photoshop
Elements, come with a utility that recognizes a memory card and performs
the transfer under your direction.
Figure 3-4: Your computer may recognize when a memory card 
is inserted and offer to make the transfer for you.

Memory Cards
137
CompactFlash cards
CompactFlash cards, like the one shown at right in Figure 3-5, are used as
removable memory in a few other devices, but their primary application is
for image storage in digital cameras. They provide a much smaller and more
efficient form of removable memory than PC cards (which I discuss a bit
later).
Figure 3-5: Secure Digital (left) and CompactFlash (right) are the 
most popular digital memory card formats.
At about 11⁄2 inches square, a CompactFlash card isn’t much larger than a
postage stamp, and it’s just a little thicker than a credit card. Still, there’s room
for two rows of holes for connector pins along one edge. All CompactFlash
cards are physically about the same size (there are Type I and a thicker Type II
variety), but they can have various memory capacities ranging from 4MB (gen-
erally no longer available) to 8GB or more. A higher-capacity version seems to
come out every few months.
Card-reader adapters are available for your computer, or may be built into
the computer itself. These adapters enable you to read and manipulate the
contents of a CompactFlash card. The card reader is usually a small, external
device, like the one shown in Figure 3-6, that attaches to your computer via a
FireWire, USB, or serial cable. Sometimes, a card reader for your computer
comes with the camera. If not, you can purchase one from most computer
supply stores for less than $30. PC card adapters are also available. The
adapters enable you to access your CompactFlash cards via a PC card slot in
a laptop computer.

Memory Cards
138
Figure 3-6: Card readers generally have multiple slots that accept every kind of memory 
media used in digital cameras.
For tips on removing, inserting, and accessing files on CompactFlash cards,
see the bulleted list in the preceding section.
Secure Digital/MMC cards
Secure Digital (SD) cards and the identically sized but less flexible
MultiMediaCard (MMC) are still other memory card formats similar to
CompactFlash. Secure Digital cards are a newer format that has swept the
industry in a relatively short period of time because the smaller size
(roughly 7⁄8 x 11⁄4 inches) of the SD card allows designing smaller cameras. One
key difference between MMC and SD cards is that the Secure Digital version
allows encryption of the files to prevent tampering. SD cards also offer higher
performance and thus are preferred over MMC cards for digital cameras.
Using a Secure Digital card for image storage is essentially the same as using
a CompactFlash card except that the card itself is slightly smaller, which
means that the sockets in the camera and the card reader must be made to
fit the Secure Digital card. The Secure Digital format is not interchangeable
with the other formats.

Memory Cards
139
Memory Stick
The Sony Memory Stick is one more form of memory card, functionally similar
to the CompactFlash and Secure Digital cards. Sony uses the Memory Stick in
several of its high-end digital cameras and also in digital video cameras, music
players, and so on, which means that you can move your Memory Sticks
between devices and use them for storing pictures, music, and other files.
The Memory Stick is about the size of a stick of chewing gum and comes in
capacities of 32 to 128MB. The newer Memory Stick Pro offers higher capac-
ity but is not backward-compatible with earlier devices that used the original
Memory Stick. There is also the half-sized Memory Stick Pro Duo. The latest
versions can be purchased in sizes up to 4GB.
Several models of Sony laptop computers include a built-in Memory Stick
slot so that you can use the laptop computer to access the contents of your
Memory Sticks. You can also use a card reader similar to the card readers for
CompactFlash and SmartMedia cards to access Memory Sticks from your
desktop computer. The card reader is usually supplied with your camera and
attaches to your computer via USB cable.
Here are some pointers for removing, inserting, and accessing files on a
Memory Stick:
✦To remove a Memory Stick from your digital camera (or card reader),
press the eject button next to the slot to pop the stick loose, grasp the
exposed end of the stick, and slide it out of its slot.
✦To insert a Memory Stick into the camera (or card reader), insert the
stick into the slot in the direction of the arrow marked on the surface of
the stick. The arrow and a clipped corner help you orient the stick prop-
erly. The stick goes into its slot in only one way. Push the stick in firmly
but gently to seat it properly.
✦Like the other memory cards, after you insert a Memory Stick into the
card reader attached to your computer, you can access and manipulate
the files on the stick as if they were located on a virtual disk drive. Copy,
move, and erase the files using your normal file management tools.
The Memory Stick includes an Erasure Prevention Switch that lets you pro-
tect the contents from accidental erasure. Make sure the switch is in the Off
position when you want to record images onto the stick in your camera or
erase files in the card reader.
CompactFlash cards, Secure Digital cards, Memory Sticks, and the like are
often called digital film because inserting a memory card into a digital camera
is analogous to loading a conventional camera with a fresh roll of film.

Memory Cards
140
SmartMedia cards
SmartMedia cards have faded almost completely from the scene and exist
today only as memory options for older digital cameras. They are similar to
CompactFlash cards but in an even smaller package, and they are limited to
only 128MB capacity.
PC Cards
The oldest format for a memory card still in use is the PC Card, also known
as ATA Type II PC Cards or PCMCIA cards. PC Cards come in many different
forms and are not limited to memory configurations. They are typically used
to provide plug-in components, such as modems or network interface cards,
for laptop computers equipped with a PC Card slot. Memory cards and
miniature hard drives have in the past also been furnished in the PC Card
form. Today, PC card slots are used primarily for plugging in devices like
wireless network cards. My own Toshiba laptop has a memory card slot for
SD cards, but accepts Compact Flash cards only through an adapter plugged
into its PC Card socket.
Mini-CD
To combat the problem of the limited capacity of floppy disk drives (used in
some very early Sony digital cameras), Sony built some digital cameras with a
mini-CD drive in place of the floppy disk drive. The camera actually includes a
CD burner to record picture data onto mini-CDs, which are smaller-diameter
versions of standard CDs. A standard CD-ROM drive can read the mini-CDs,
and because CD drives are standard equipment on almost all computers, the
mini-CD enjoys the same universal accessibility as floppy disks. The down-
side is that the mini-CDs aren’t readily available for purchase like floppy disks
or even memory cards are.
Microdrive
The Hitachi (formerly IBM) Microdrive is a tiny hard drive that’s a little
thicker than the standard CompactFlash card but otherwise the same. Such
drives are also available from other sources, including Seagate. If your
camera is equipped with a CompactFlash Type II slot, you can use the
Microdrive. The Microdrive has recently been less expensive than solid-state
CompactFlash cards of the same capacity. It’s available in sizes up to 8G or
more. Using the Microdrive is just like using a standard CompactFlash card
except that because it is actually a miniature hard drive, it must be handled
with more TLC than a CompactFlash card.

Transferring Images from Camera to Computer
As the previous section shows, different digital cameras offer different tools
for connecting the camera to your computer. It might be a direct connec-
tion, such as a cable from the camera to a port on your computer, or it 
might be an indirect connection, such as a memory card that you can
remove from the camera and then insert into a reader or drive attached to
your computer.
After you make the connection between your camera and your computer,
you might have a few more options available regarding what software you
use to transfer pictures from the camera connection to your computer.
Most digital camera manufacturers supply a program with the camera that is
designed to handle the task, but you might also have the option of transferring
pictures to your computer via image editing software or your computer’s
normal file management utilities.
Transferring pictures using camera utility software
Windows XP and Mac OS X can recognize memory cards or cameras and
offer to transfer your photos for you. However, you’ll often prefer to use the
utility software provided with your digital camera because such software fre-
quently has additional features, such as the ability to edit your photos after
you transfer them.
Just about every digital camera on the market today ships with a disc con-
taining software designed specifically to transfer pictures from the camera to
your computer. Often, the software has a number of other features as well,
but its main purpose is to allow you to use your computer to access the pic-
tures you shot with your camera.
The details of the installation and use of the software accompanying the vari-
ous digital cameras vary as much as the cameras themselves. Covering all
the different programs in detail in this book is not possible, but the general
process goes something like this:
1. Make sure the camera (or card reader) is connected to the computer
and is turned on.
This ensures that the software can find the camera/card reader connec-
tion if the installation searches for it.
2. Insert the disc that came with your camera into your computer’s 
disc drive and launch the installation utility (if it doesn’t start 
automatically).

Transferring Images from Camera to Computer
142
The software disc is usually a CD, and the installation routine usually
starts automatically a few seconds after you insert the disc into your
computer. However, if the installation doesn’t start automatically, you
can usually get things going by using Windows Explorer to double-click
a file icon labeled Setup or Install. You can probably find the file in the
root folder of the drive where you inserted the disc. With Macs, click the
program’s icon on the Desktop.
3. Follow the onscreen instructions to install the software.
A couple of mouse clicks to accept defaults are all it usually takes.
4. Start the camera utility software.
Sometimes the utility software sits in the background and waits for your
camera to be connected. Then it pops up automatically and goes to
work. If not, double-click the Desktop icon that the installation program
added or look for the new addition to your Windows Start menu. If the
camera or card reader is connected and turned on when you start the
program, it will usually find your camera automatically. In some cases,
you might need to help the program locate the camera by choosing a
command such as File➪Connect and selecting the appropriate location
in a dialog box.
Figure 3-7 shows the Photoshop Elements transfer utility.
5. Click an icon or menu command to view the image files on the camera
or removable media.
Here’s where the different software programs really go their own way.
There is usually an icon or menu command that you can use to display a
list of picture files on your computer. You might even be able to preview
the pictures as thumbnail (small) images.
6. Select the picture files you want to transfer and click an icon or menu
command to begin moving the files to your computer.
Again, the details vary greatly in the different programs, but there is usu-
ally a prominent icon that you can click to start the transfer process.
If you don’t see an obvious icon, check the File menu for a command
such as Import.
The same utility program that enables you to transfer pictures from your
camera to your computer often includes features that enable you to edit or
manage your image files. You can also erase pictures from your camera’s
memory after transferring them to your computer so that you have room to
shoot more pictures with the camera.
After you transfer the images to your computer, you can view, edit, and print
them using any appropriate program on your computer. Windows’ and Mac 
OS X’s built-in utilities are sufficient for basic viewing and printing, but you’ll
undoubtedly want to use more capable programs for most image editing tasks.

Copying files to your hard drive
Perhaps the simplest and most straightforward way to move pictures from
your camera to your computer is to treat them like any other computer file.
In other words, you simply use your standard file-handling utilities to copy,
move, and delete the image files. This is the technique you use with most
forms of removable media, and you can often use it with direct camera con-
nections via USB or FireWire as well.
The biggest advantage of this approach is that you don’t need to deal with a
specialized program in order to access your pictures. Instead, you use famil-
iar tools, such as Windows Explorer and the Open dialog boxes, in your
favorite programs.
In order for this technique to work, your computer operating system
(Windows or Mac) must be able to access your camera or card reader
adapter as part of the computer’s file system. Fortunately, that’s exactly how
most memory card readers and many cameras (most cameras that connect
via USB or FireWire) work. They appear to your computer as virtual disk
drives, and you can read, write, and erase the files on those devices just like
you can files on your hard drive or floppy disk (if your computer has one).

Transferring Images from Camera to Computer
144
To transfer pictures from your camera to your computer, you can use any of
the same techniques you would use to move files from one disk drive to
another. The only exception is the extra steps needed to connect a virtual
drive (your camera or card reader) to the computer. The following steps
summarize the process for the Windows environment (similar techniques
work for Mac OS):
1. Connect the camera or card reader to your computer and turn it on.
After a moment or so, Windows displays a message box saying that it has
found new hardware and is installing the necessary software drivers. An
icon appears in the system tray portion of the taskbar next to the clock.
2. If prompted to do so, insert the manufacturer’s disc containing drivers
for your camera or memory card reader.
You only need to do this the first time you attach your camera or card
reader to the computer.
3. Open Windows Explorer and navigate to the virtual disk drive repre-
senting your camera or card reader.
You can double-click the My Computer icon on your desktop to open 
an Explorer window and then double-click the appropriate drive icon 
to display the contents of the camera memory or the memory card in
your card reader, as shown in Figure 3-8. Look for a new drive letter that
doesn’t correspond to one of the standard disk drives installed in your
system.
Figure 3-8: In Windows Explorer, double-click the appropriate drive icon to 
display the contents of your memory card.

The name of the drive might be the brand name of your computer or
card reader.
4. Open another Windows Explorer window and navigate to the folder
where you want to store the picture files from your camera.
Be sure to position the two Explorer windows on your desktop so that
you can drag and drop between them.
5. Drag and drop one or more files from the first Explorer window onto
the second window.
That’s all it takes to copy pictures from your camera to your computer. If
you copy them in this way, you’ll need to delete them from the memory
card if you no longer want them there.
Of course, after you connect your camera (or the memory card from your
camera) to your computer as a virtual disk drive, you can use all the stan-
dard Windows tools and techniques to manage your picture files. The default
action for a drag and drop is to copy the files to their new location. However,
if you click and drag with the right mouse button instead of the normal left
button, Windows displays a contextual menu that gives you the option to
move the files instead of copying them. The Move command copies the files
to their new location and then erases them from the old location in one step.
You can also return to the first Explorer window and erase the picture files
from your camera memory in a separate operation.
After you finish transferring pictures from the camera to your computer, don’t
forget to disconnect the camera properly. To do so, you need to right-click the
Safely Remove Hardware icon in the system tray, and in the dialog box that
appears, choose to unplug, eject, or stop the device. Then, select the camera
from the list in the dialog box that appears next and click the Stop button to
tell Windows that you want to disconnect the device. Windows displays a con-
firmation message, after which you can physically disconnect the camera and
its cable from the computer. With a Mac, you should drag the camera’s icon to
the Trash before disconnecting your camera.
Importing images into image editing software
The normal sequence of events is to use your camera’s utility software to
transfer one or more picture files from your camera to your computer. Next,
you launch your favorite image editing software and open the image file to
make some adjustments before finally saving or printing the picture.
However, several image editing programs can do the transferring for you,
which shortens the whole process.
If Windows recognizes your camera or card reader as a mass storage device
(and most such devices that connect to the computer via USB and FireWire
are), the device and all the files on it appear to Windows just like any other

Transferring Images from Camera to Computer
146
disk drive. Consequently, you can open a picture for editing in your image
editing program by simply selecting it in the program’s Open dialog box. The
only thing you have to do is make sure the camera is connected and turned
on (and recognized by Windows) before you attempt to open files in the
photo editor.
Macs operate in the same way, recognizing your camera or card reader and
offering to open the photos in iPhoto.
To transfer images from your camera directly to your image editing software,
you first need to tell the program what camera you use and where to find it.
Make sure that the camera manufacturer’s software has been installed and is
operating properly on your computer and then configure your image editing
software to access images from the camera. The setup process varies in the
different programs, but the following steps are typical:
1. Connect your camera to the computer and turn it on.
2. Choose File➪Import➪Digital Camera➪Configure (or an equivalent
command) in your image editing program.
The program usually opens a dialog box, but it might present a submenu
instead.
3. Select your camera and (if necessary) the port where it’s connected;
then click OK to close the dialog box.
After you configure your image editing software, you can use it to access
images from your camera. Here’s how:
1. Connect your computer to the camera and turn it on.
2. Choose File➪Import➪Digital Camera➪Access (or an equivalent com-
mand) in your image editing program.
A dialog box appears, giving you access to the images stored on your
camera. This is usually a subset of the camera manufacturer’s access
software.
3. Select the image or images you want to open in the image editing 
program and then click the button or choose the command to begin
the transfer.
The software transfers the selected pictures from your camera to the
image editing software.
4. If the image editing software doesn’t return to the foreground auto-
matically, click its taskbar button.
The selected images appear in the image editing program window, ready
for you to begin working with them.

N
othing reveals more dramatically how digital technology has changed
the face of photography as the ways in which we use prints. We’ve
gone from the days of the daguerreotype (in which every photographic
image was a unique and original hard copy) to the digital age in which (if we
wish) a photograph can exist entirely and solely in electronic form
and never be transferred to a piece of paper or film. The
photo-graphic print has gone from being the normal and
expected result of taking a picture to nothing more
than an option.
In the digital age, prints have taken on an addi-
tional role as a source for digital images. If you
have a scanner, the photographic fodder for your
image editing software can come as easily from a
hard-copy photograph that you’ve scanned as
from your digital camera. Indeed, some of the hap-
piest marriages of imagery come from mixing and
matching photos that originate in digital form with
pictures that have been created on film, printed on
paper, and then scanned.
Even when you have the choice of viewing your finished photo-
graphs on a computer screen, there are so many good reasons for making
prints. A better color printer is probably the first accessory that a digital
photographer purchases after upgrading to a digital camera. And a scanner
used to convert existing prints and slides into pixels is probably the second
accessory considered.
This chapter looks into the factors that you need to take into account when
choosing a printer and a scanner for your digital photography outfit.

Why You Want Prints
148
Why You Want Prints
Digital pictures are great when you want to show them on your computer
screen, project them on a screen during a presentation, or incorporate
them into your Web page. Even old-fashioned color slides have their uses.
Professional photographers like transparencies for their unsurpassed repro-
duction capabilities. Amateurs have long used slides as a tool for lulling
neighbors to sleep during discussions of their vacations.
Yet, when it comes time to share your photographic efforts seriously, noth-
ing beats a print. You can hang a print in a frame over your fireplace. You can
pass around a stack of photos of your kids without worrying whether your
captive audience has the right viewing hardware or software. Photo prints
are used as proofs submitted for approval or as samples in a portfolio. When
you open an old shoebox of memories tucked away in your closet, you hope
to find a slew of old prints inside, not a stack of CDs or DVDs.
Indeed, students of photography have already noticed a dramatic change in
how the work of the very best photographers can be studied and evaluated
since digital photography became common. The photographic masters of
illustration and photojournalism of the past worked with prints and often
made proof copies, called contact sheets, that contained a rough, uncropped,
and uncorrected version of every picture they took. We can look at those old
prints and see how photographic ideas evolved into the famous photos we
know today.
With digital photography, though, test shots, alternative angles that didn’t
work out, and other material can be erased and forgotten. A digital camera’s
Quick Erase feature can obliterate unwanted photos before they ever reach a
computer. Only the best images survive, and only the best of the best make
it to print form (at least, theoretically.)
That doesn’t mean that prints are an endangered species. The same digital
technology that has eliminated some of the need for prints has given us whole
new capabilities that make them more useful than ever. For example, when
shooting pictures on film, you probably let your photofinisher make a print of
every single shot on the roll so that you can see which ones are the good ones.
(In these days of double prints, you probably get at least two copies of every
shot, including the blurry ones and the pictures of your shoes.)
With digital photography and inexpensive color printers, you don’t need to
accumulate stacks of prints that you don’t want. Not only can you print (or
have your retailer print) just the pictures you like, but you can also easily
crop them the way you want to see them, fix the color, sharpen the blurry
parts, and print them as glorious 5 x 7s or 8 x 10s. Digital photographers
might not end up with more prints, but they do have better prints, and they
like them better, too.

Choosing a Printer for Digital Photography
The good news is that printers capable of producing photo-quality images
are inexpensive, and printers from all the vendors are comparable in quality,
ruggedness, and image quality. If all you want are a few photos now and
then, it’s hard to go wrong. All the well-known printer manufacturers and
many of the companies that sell cameras are hard at work building faster,
better, and less expensive printers for you to choose from.
The bad news is that the vendors have a
nefarious purpose behind their industri-
ous efforts. Those who sell printers
these days want to make their devices
so easy to use and to produce hard
copies that are so pleasing to the eye
that you’ll be tempted to make more
and more prints. And that’s where the
money is: The cost alone of special
photo papers and inks used during the
first few months can easily exceed the
price you paid for a color printer. As you
read the descriptions of the printing
options that follow, you need to keep
foremost in your mind not how much
the equipment costs to buy, but how
much it costs to use. I provide some
guidelines and tips as you go along.
Here are your primary options:
✦Let somebody else do it. If you
don’t need many prints, you can
probably get by quite well without
owning any color printer at all.
Color ink cartridges tend to dry
out and clog up if allowed to sit for
a week or two without being used,
so if you really aren’t making many
prints, you should consider just
stopping by your local discount or
drug store with your images on a
disk/disc/media card and using 
a desktop Kodak Picture Kiosk, or
a stand-alone kiosk such as the
Kodak Picture Maker, shown in
Figure 4-1. You pay $5 or so for a
sheet of photos, but think of the
Figure 4-1: A stand-alone kiosk might be
your best source for quick, high-quality
prints.

money you’ll save on equipment and dried-out ink cartridges! Many photo-
finishers have digital minilabs that use conventional paper and chemicals
to produce high-quality photographic prints; they can accept your digital
film and deliver a stack of 4 x 6 prints. You can even send your images to
labs on the Internet for delivery to you by mail.
✦Use a laser printer. If you have a black-and-white laser printer, you can
make quick-and-dirty monochrome prints of your digital images that
might be good enough for many applications, such as pasting up in pub-
lishing layouts or creating simple posters to promote your rock band’s
upcoming club date. Color laser printers, at less than $500 (and up), can
create fairly decent full-color pictures, although these pictures don’t
have the glossy sheen and true photographic appearance of some of the
other options. Color laser printers can be fairly economical, too, if used
in moderation because their color toners can be applied to inexpensive
ordinary paper stocks rather than more expensive photo paper. If you
have some other use for a color laser printer (say, printing documents,
newsletters, or other work that uses spot color), these devices can fill in
for you as an output option for the occasional digital photograph.
✦Use an inkjet printer. These are the most popular color-output option
for digital photography right now because they cost very little (decent
inkjets can be purchased for $50–$100) and supplies for them can be
purchased everywhere, including at your average, all-night grocery
store. Their output looks almost exactly like a color photograph when
printed on special glossy photo papers. 
Unfortunately, for each photo you
print, you can pay as much as
$0.50 to $2 for the materials (ink
and paper) alone. After paying $35
for an ink cartridge that was good
for only 20–30 8 x 10 prints and
then repeating the process once a
week for a month, I junked a per-
fectly good inkjet printer and
replaced it with a model that uses
separate ink tanks for each color.
Now, when I run out of yellow ink, 
I drop in a new $8 yellow ink car-
tridge instead of replacing the
whole thing. I tried several of the
inkjet refilling kits, but the ink
seemed more easily applied to my
hands and clothing than to the car-
tridge being refilled. So I like using
separate, replaceable tanks, like
those shown in Figure 4-2.
Figure 4-2: Using replaceable separate
ink tanks is more economical.

✦Use a dye-sublimation printer. Dye-sublimation (dye-sub) technology,
although gradually being replaced by inkjet printers for most applica-
tions, is still used at the consumer level in small photo printers that are
limited to, say, 4 x 6 prints. In those sizes, a dye-sub printer can be fairly
economical even though it uses a fairly complex printing system that
involves a roll with a continuous ribbon of color. 
A dye-sub ribbon cartridge is shown in Figure 4-3. Each section of the
color ribbon is used only once, so you always know exactly how many
prints you’re going to get before it’s time to refill. The quality of these
printers is unsurpassed, but unlike inkjet and laser printers, you can’t
use them for printing documents. Photos are all they can print. These
printers cost $149 and up.
Figure 4-3: Individual color panels apply one hue at a time to your print.
✦Use a different type of printer. You can also find various alternate print-
ing technologies, such as thermal wax printers, solid-ink printers, and a
few other offbeat types, each with its own advantages. Some of them,
called phase-change printers, for example, can print photo-quality
images on ordinary paper, partially offsetting the cost of their solid wax
or resin inks. These are generally expensive printers, often costing $600
to $3,000 or more.

Choosing a Scanner
152
Choosing a Scanner
In many ways, digital cameras and scanners are two sides of the same coin,
each with their own advantages and limitations. Both use solid-state sensors
to capture a digital image of an object, providing you with fodder for your
image editor’s magic. Cameras are portable and can grab images of three-
dimensional objects of virtually any size, at any distance (up to the moon
and beyond!). Scanners pretty much reside on your desktop next to your
computer, are limited (for the most part) to two-dimensional originals such
as photographs, and can work only with objects that are 8.5 x 11 inches or
smaller.
Digital cameras capture an image in an instant; a scanner takes a minimum of
20–30 seconds to produce a scan. High-resolution digital cameras are expen-
sive; if you want 12 megapixels of information, you can pay $3,000 or more.
A scanner fully capable of grabbing 135 megapixels of image information
(1200 samples per inch over an 8.5 x 11 photo) can cost less than $100.
Whereas digital photographers carefully select what goes into a digital
camera image through use of composition and lighting, scanners pretty
much capture whatever is already on the original you slap down on the
glass. The purposes and capabilities of digital cameras and scanners are so
very different that if you’re serious about digital imaging, you’ll want both a
digital camera and a scanner.
What you can do with a scanner
One of the best things about scanners is that you can do a lot of other things
with them in addition to scanning photographs. Here are some highlights:
✦Turn printed text into editable text. If you create newsletters and want
to convert hard-copy text documents (such as newspaper clippings)
into editable text, a scanner can use optical character recognition
(OCR) to capture the text. Using software usually bundled with the
scanner, the scanner translates the image of the text into text files
(often with formatting and photos preserved). You can also use OCR
with faxes that are clear and perfectly legible to convert those faxes
back into editable documents.
✦Photocopy documents. Most scanners have a Copy button on their front
panels. Slap an original down on the glass, press the button, and the
scanner captures the image and directs it to your printer. It’s almost as
good as having a dedicated copy machine.
✦Send faxes. If a scanner can serve as a copier, it also works admirably as
half a fax machine. Whether or not your work environment has a dedi-
cated fax machine, there’s nothing quicker (or more confidential) than
using your scanner with your computer’s fax modem.

✦Manage documents more easily than you can with microfilm. Some
types of records must be retained in some semblance of their original
appearance, such as documents with signatures, checks, illustrated
reports, and so forth. Offices used microfilm for this sort of document in
the past. Today, you can manage documents by using a scanner as an
input source and using a specialized document-management application
to file and retrieve the images.
✦Capture non-photographic images. Perhaps you have line art, charts,
logos, cartoons, or other artwork you’d like in digital form. A scanner
works as well with non-photographic images as it does with photos.
Types of scanners
You can find a pretty good overview of the various types of scanners in Book I,
Chapter 3. For digital photography, your choices really boil down to one of
three kinds of technology as well as several categories based on price and 
features. I can dispose of the scanner technologies quickly:
✦Photo scanners: These are small scanners designed specifically for scan-
ning snapshots and are often used in tandem with equally compact photo
printers. You feed in a snapshot and get a digital image for editing, or you
might skip the editing step and direct your scanned output to a photo
printer. You can use such a setup as a sort of photocopier for prints,
which is great when your scanning needs are limited to snapshots. These
scanners can cost less than a few hundred dollars and are slowly being
phased out as the use of film declines.
✦Flatbed scanners: These are the most widely used type of scanner. They
look and operate something like a small photocopier. You open the lid,
place your original face-down on the glass, and scan. Flatbeds are usually
limited to scanning 8.5 x 11 (or sometimes 8.5 x 14) material, but the mov-
able cover makes it simple to grab images of thick originals, such as books
or even some 3-D objects. Larger originals can be scanned in sections and
stitched together in your image editing software. Some flatbeds have an
alternate light source built into the lid or available as an add-on that can
illuminate transparencies, giving you slide-scanning capabilities. Flatbed
scanners can run anywhere from $50 to $500 or more.
✦Slide/transparency scanners: These are high-resolution scanners used for
scanning color slides (in 2 x 2 mounts), strips of film in sizes from 35mm
to 6cm in width, or sheet film up to 4 x 5 inches (or sometimes larger).
Photographers who use transparency (positive) or negative film — or who
have archives of these kinds of film — prize the specialized capabilities 
of slide scanners. These scanners cannot scan reflective copy, such as
photographic prints. A new crop of film scanners priced at $300 or less
has opened up this option to just about any interested consumer who has
slides or negatives to scan. However, at the high end, this type of scanner
can easily cost $1,500 or more.

Scanner Prices and Features
154
All three types of scanners use similar components. All have a place to posi-
tion the original to be scanned. A light source either reflects off the surface
of the original or transilluminates it (shines light through it, in the case of
transparencies or negatives). A high-resolution sensor captures the original
one line at a time, either by moving past the surface of the original or by cap-
turing light reflected from a moving mirror. Electronics inside the scanner
convert the analog information that the sensor captures into digital form.
You can find out more about using scanners in Book VII.
Scanner Prices and Features
Like digital cameras, flatbed scanners fall into several fairly well-defined price
and feature categories. You’ll find point-and-shoot scanners just like you’ll find
point-and-shoot digital cameras. There are also general purpose and advanced
(prosumer — advanced models that can be used both by advanced amateurs
and professionals) scanners as well as true professional scanners.
Unlike digital cameras, the primary criteria used to choose a scanner is not
the resolution of the scanner. Virtually all scanners on the market claim
roughly the same resolution, even though, in practice, the image quality of
these devices can vary widely, even among those with similar specifications.
The primary things you should look at when choosing a scanner are the
image quality, speed, and convenience. I address these separately later in
the chapter, concentrating on general specifications and features for the
main flatbed scanner categories first.
Entry-level scanners
Entry-level scanners are the $50–$100 scanners you see on special at your
local electronics superstore. They are designed for the casual scanner user —
someone who needs to grab an occasional photo or who doesn’t have partic-
ularly high quality standards.
All you get with one of these are simple scanning capabilities. They’re often
quite slow and use inexpensive sensors that often can’t capture the kind of
sharp image that a digital photographer expects. They’re easy to use, which
makes them ideal for scanning neophytes, but they usually aren’t expandable
with accessories, such as transparency adapters. Don’t expect Photoshop
Elements to be bundled with a scanner like this; many are furnished only with
the most basic image capturing/editing software or a driver that works with
your own image editing program as a plug-in.
Entry-level scanners are a good introduction to scanning for people who
don’t know whether they want to get heavily involved with image editing.
These scanners are also good for noncritical applications, such as photo-
copying, faxing, or grabbing images for Web pages.

155
Intermediate scanners
Spend $100–$200 and you can purchase an intermediate scanner with better
quality and speed, more features, and a great deal more versatility. These
scanners have enough quality to please all but the pickiest digital photo-
graphers and are fast enough that you won’t fall asleep between scans when
you’re capturing a stack of photos on a lazy afternoon.
Intermediate scanners usually have all the convenience features you’d want.
These include front-panel buttons that let you scan, make a photocopy, send a
fax, or attach a scan to an e-mail. Some can be augmented with simple attach-
ments for scanning slides and usually include a useful selection of software,
such as OCR programs, stitching programs that let you stitch together multi-
ple scans into a single image, and image management programs.
Advanced (or business) scanners
Serious digital photographers will probably be happiest with a scanner in
this category. Priced at $200 to $400 and up, these include everything you
need to scan and manipulate photos and other originals, produce better
quality, and are faster to boot.
You can find lots of flatbed scanners with slide-scanning capabilities in this
group, as well as a few models with automatic document feeders so that you
can scan whole stacks of originals one after another. The image quality is
better, especially when you need to pull detail out of inky shadows or bright
highlights. Improved speed can be very important because owners of these
scanners can spend a lot of time during the day using them.
Expect a rich treasure trove of software with a scanner in this class, includ-
ing a capable image editor (probably along the lines of Adobe Photoshop
Elements), OCR, document-management software, fax software, and special-
ized image manipulation applications, such as applications that let you
create panoramas from multiple photos (also called stitching applications).
Professional (or prosumer) scanners
I’m not sure there’s really a prosumer category in scanners anymore. The
advanced, or business, scanners described in the preceding category can
handle most of the needs of digital photographers and others who aren’t using
their scanner professionally. True graphics professionals are really the only
ones who need to spend $400–$2,000 or more for a flatbed scanner — and
then only if they need some of the special capabilities these scanners provide.
Scanners in this category have all the features found in the advanced category
but augment those features with the very best optics, sensors, and electronics
available. You truly get the very best scans with these models, particularly if
you know how to use the features.

What Scanner Features Do You Need?
156
These scanners are also very rugged, having what the automakers used to
call (euphemistically) road-hugging weight. You can bang one of these scan-
ners around without throwing anything out of alignment, and you can expect
them to scan hour after hour, day after day, without protest.
These are the scanners to consider if you are scanning larger originals. An
8.5 x 14-inch scanning bed is a must, and some models have 11 x 17-inch or
larger scanning beds.
Don’t expect to get a copy of Photoshop bundled with one of these models,
either. Anyone who can afford one undoubtedly already has a copy (or two)
of Photoshop on hand. You can expect to receive a high-end scanning pro-
gram, though, with dozens of controls and adjustments so that scans can be
both automated and fine-tuned to the nth degree.
What Scanner Features Do You Need?
There’s a lot of overlap in features within and between the various flatbed
scanner categories. Some features are more useful than others for the digital
photography–inclined. Other features can be deceptive. Later in this chapter, I
spend a little time on the two most misunderstood features — resolution and
the number of colors captured — and I describe the other features briefly in
this section.
Scan quality
Scan quality is different from resolution, as I describe in the later section,
“Resolution mythconceptions.” Resolution of the sensor is only one of the
factors that affect scan quality. The others include the number of colors
(dynamic range) of the scanner, the quality of the optics, and the electronics
used to translate the scanned image for your computer. The most important
thing you want to think about is how good the final scan looks. Often, you
need to rely on reviews in magazines or Web sites or your own testing to
determine this.
Scanner speed
Some scanners operate much faster than others. One scanner might capture
an 8 x 10 image at 300 samples per inch (spi) in 20 seconds, whereas another
might require a minute and a half. You might not care about the speed if you
make one scan a day. Conversely, if you’re making 100 scans a day, speed
matters. Reviews can tell you how fast a scanner is, relatively speaking, but
you still might want to test a scanner before you buy it, using your own doc-
uments and a computer similar to your own.

Scanning size
Flatbed scanners have a fixed-size scanning bed, usually 8.5 x 11.7 to 8.5 x 14.
Even though you might rarely scan a 14-inch-long original, the larger size is
handy to have. I often slap down a bunch of 4 x 6 prints and scan them all at
once, cropping and sizing within Photoshop. It’s nice to have a larger scan-
ning bed to accommodate more and larger originals when you need to.
Film scanning
If you have many color slides or negatives you’d like to scan and don’t want a
dedicated film scanner, a flatbed that can accommodate these originals is a
plus. A light source built into the lid of the scanner can transilluminate the film
so the sensor can capture your slides, negatives, or transparencies, using the
scanner’s highest optical resolution. Figure 4-4 shows such a scanner.
Figure 4-4: A flatbed scanner with a light source in its lid can scan film.
Physical size
If your desktop space is limited, you might want a tiny scanner. I favor larger
scanners because they tend to stay put without sliding and can better ignore

vibrations when heavy-footed colleagues or family members stride past. In
any case, even the largest flatbed scanners today are likely to be half to two-
thirds the size of the behemoths of ten years ago, so you won’t have to
worry about giving over half your desktop to your image grabber.
Configuration
Along with physical size, other scanner configuration features can be important
when desktop space is limited. For example, a few scanners can be set up ver-
tically so they occupy a minimum amount of space. At least one new scanner
comes apart, so you can place the scanning element directly on a large origi-
nal that wouldn’t fit in an ordinary scanner’s scanning bed. The scanner in
Figure 4-5 lets you see the original being scanned through a transparent lid.
Figure 4-5: Some scanners let you see the subject you are scanning through a glass sheet.
Bundled software
If you’re already well equipped with software, you probably don’t need to
worry about the bundle furnished with your scanner. I have several copies of
Adobe Photoshop Elements that came with scanners, but rarely use any of
them. Of more interest to me are the advanced scanning programs, such as
the versatile Silver Fast application that came with my high-end Epson scan-
ner. You can always upgrade to better software if you’re dissatisfied with the
applications furnished with your scanner.

You might be more interested in OCR software (to convert documents to
editable text), copy utilities (to let you use your scanner as a photocopier),
document management programs (to let you file document images and
retrieve them by keywords), and other software, such as applications that let
you stitch images together to create panoramas.
Type of sensor
The kind of sensor used in a scanner can affect how you use it. In the past,
charge coupled device (CCD) sensors were the most common sensors in con-
sumer scanners. These solid-state devices capture an image that is conveyed
by a sophisticated optical system, often a path measuring a foot or more in
length, as mirrors and optics convey the light reflected from the original to
the sensor itself.
More recently, a less expensive, solid-state sensor called a contact image
sensor (CIS) has been used, especially for lower-priced scanners. A CIS
sensor moves beneath the glass a few scant millimeters from the original in a
much-simplified system that requires no optical path at all. CIS scanners can
be very thin and compact (because there is no need to leave room for an
optical path) and use inexpensive red, green, and blue (RGB) light-emitting
diodes (LEDs) instead of the fluorescent light tube found in CCD scanners.
This makes for a cheaper scanner, in more ways than one:
✦CIS scanners often produce poorer quality than the more sophisticated
CCD sensor produces. Although quality is improving (some $150–$200 CIS
scanners produce great quality), this technology has not been associated
with the best overall quality.
✦CIS scanners typically have very little depth of field, which means they
can scan only flat originals held in tight contact with the scanning glass.
Even a wrinkle in a paper original can affect the sharpness of some CIS
scanners. You can also forget about scanning 3-D objects.
Until CIS sensors catch up with their CCD counterparts, you probably want
to stick with a CCD-based scanner when making your decision. Check the
box or specs to find out which you have or visit the vendor’s Web site if the
information isn’t easy to find.
Scanner interface
The kind of interface used to connect your scanner to your computer was
once an important consideration. You had to choose between SCSI or paral-
lel port scanners or even slow serial connections. Some scanners required a
proprietary interface card.
Today, all scanners come with Universal Serial Bus (USB) or IEEE 1394
(FireWire) connections or both. Either of these interfaces is fast enough for

Resolution Mythconceptions
160
the typical scanner; choose one with the interface that is available with
your computer.
Color depth
Color depth indicates the number of different colors a scanner can capture,
measured in bits, or bit depth. For example, a 24-bit scanner can capture 
16.8 million different colors, and 30–48-bit scanners can capture billions and
billions of colors. Most of the vendor-supplied specs about color depth are
misleading or false, so I don’t advise paying much attention to color depth
unless you’re scanning transparencies (which require so-called deep color
capabilities). Most everything you “know” about scanner resolution and color
depth is wrong anyway. I explain both in more detail in the next section.
Resolution Mythconceptions
I’ve written nine books solely on scanners since 1990, and I’ve tested and
reviewed hundreds of scanners for the major computer magazines and Web
sites. One thing that hasn’t changed in the last decade and a half is all the fuss
over scanner resolution. I’ve received scanners for testing packed in large
boxes with 12-inch lettering on the size proclaiming “2400 x 2400 RESOLUTION”
in garish tones. Scanners are invariably described as a 2400-dpi, 36-bit color
scanner or some similar terminology, as if those terms summed up the most
important qualities of that scanner. Well-meaning people write and ask me what
resolution they should look for in a scanner. All the scanner books I’ve seen,
including my own, include recommendations on what scanner resolution to use
for particular tasks.
I’m about to share a little secret with you: Resolution is not the most impor-
tant specification to use when choosing a scanner. It’s not even the most
important determinant of the scanner’s final quality. The optical system and
other attributes of the sensor are more important. Even the smoothness of the
sensor/mirror transport system can be important. To make matters worse, the
resolution figures vendors quote are likely to be false or misleading. And to
top it off, unless you are scanning tiny objects that have lots of detail, you will
rarely have any use for a scanner’s top resolution in the first place. Most reso-
lution figures you see are not only mythical, they’re dangerous.
Until you’ve seen a 600-sample-per-inch (spi) scanner that produces better
images than a 2400 spi scanner, you won’t believe this, but it’s true. To see
why this is true, you need to know how they arrive at those figures.
Resolution is calculated from the number of individual sensors in the sensor
array that captures an image. This array is a narrow horizontal strip that
extends along the width of the scanner. There is one element for each pixel

Book II
Chapter 4
Adding a Printer
and Scanner
Color Depth Confusion
161
in that width. For example, an 8.5 x 11.7 flatbed scanner with true optical res-
olution of 1200 spi has 10,200 elements along the array’s width. The sensor
itself is less than 8.5 inches wide, of course, because the optical system
focuses the image onto the sensor’s somewhat narrower width.
The scanner grabs one line at a time by moving the sensor (or a mirror that
reflects through the optical system to the sensor) some distance between
lines. If the scanner sensor/mirror carriage moves 1⁄1,200 of an inch between
lines in the vertical direction, the scanner is said to have an optical resolution
in that direction of 1200 spi. So, your scanner might be described as having a
true resolution of 1200 (horizontal) x 1200 (vertical) samples per inch.
Some vendors try to play tricks by moving the sensor a fraction of a full line
between scans — say 1⁄2,400 of an inch — so they can claim 1200 x 2400 spi res-
olution. In practice, blurring caused by the motion of the carriage probably
wipes out any resolution gained through this trick, so the spec reported by
the vendor is already wrong on at least one count.
True resolution also depends on the sharpness of the optical system used to
focus the image on the sensor, so unless the optics are top quality, even the
horizontal resolution measurement doesn’t really mean a lot.
Things get even more confusing when vendors quote interpolated resolution,
which is a figure derived from mathematical algorithms used to calculate
what pixels would exist if the scanner were capable of capturing them. So,
you might have a scanner that boasts 1200 x 1200 spi optical resolution and
up to 9600 x 9600 spi interpolated resolution, and neither figure tells you
much about the quality of the image.
If resolution really is important to you, the best way to estimate what kind 
of quality you can expect from a given scanner is to read the laboratory
reviews many magazines publish or to test the scanner yourself. I’ve seen
1200 x 1200 spi CIS scanners that were terrible and 600 x 600 spi CCD scan-
ners that were twice as good at half the resolution.
I offer some advice on choosing resolution for specific tasks in Book VII,
Chapter 1.
Color Depth Confusion
The other misleading specification quoted for scanners is color depth. Does it
really make a difference whether a scanner is a 24-bit, 30-bit, or 48-bit scanner?
In practice, color depth — which is better thought of as dynamic range — does
make a difference. Greater dynamic range lets you capture better-quality

Color Depth Confusion
162
images with more detail in the shadows and highlights. Unfortunately, most of
the dynamic range figures quoted by vendors are as misleading and inaccu-
rate as their resolution figures.
Why do you need all those colors? There are only 800,000 different pixels in a 
4 x 5 photo scanned at 200 spi. Even if every pixel were a different color, you
would need only 800,000 unique colors to represent them all. Surely, the 
16.8 million colors in a 24-bit image are enough? Alas, that’s not true. First,
scanners lose a lot of information because of noise in the electronic system.
Imagine trying to watch TV while a lively party is going on all around you.
Conversation, people walking, and even the tinkling of glasses provide extrane-
ous sounds that degrade the sounds you hear from the TV. You’re trying to
listen to something while surrounded, quite literally, by noise. Scanners are
subject to the same interference, but it’s random electrical noise. Even a 30-bit
scanner might barely end up with 24 bits of information after the signal-to-
noise factor is included.
Moreover, the greater range of colors in some types of originals, particularly
color transparencies, means that more colors must be available to represent
them accurately. If you want to capture detail in very dark areas (called 
D-max by the techies) as well as in the very lightest areas (D-min), you need
a heck of a lot of information. That’s where extra color depth is valuable.
Unfortunately, scanner vendors quote dynamic range figures based on theo-
retical constraints rather than on the real-world performance of their scan-
ners. I’ve seen 48-bit scanners that actually produced no better than 24-bit
scans. I’ve gotten superior results from scanners from more conservative
vendors who claimed no more than 36-bit dynamic ranges.
Usually, scanners touted for their transparency-scanning capabilities have
the best overall color depth performance. But, as with resolution, if dynamic
range is important to you, you’re better off relying on independent lab results
from magazines or Web sites or on testing the equipment yourself.

ost digital cameras have everything you need to take great pictures,
right? And they’re not really very expandable because they usually
have a nonremovable lens, built-in flash, close-up capabilities, and other 
features that you might normally purchase as accessories for film cameras.
What more could you want?
A lot. One of the most diabolical things about photography
is that as you use the capabilities of your camera equip-
ment, you always find even more interesting things
you could do if you just had this accessory or that
gadget. A digital camera with a long zoom lens, for
example, makes you wish you had a longer zoom.
Discovering ways to use your digital camera’s built-
in flash effectively can make you yearn for a bigger,
better external flash.
When the bug really hits you, you’ll start searching
for previously unknown accessories to help you do
things you didn’t even know could be done. You’ll even
think up ways in which having a second digital camera
can help you (as a spare, as a smaller camera to keep con-
stantly at hand, and so forth). After you become serious about
photography, accessory-itis is sure to strike. I say this from the viewpoint of
someone who currently owns more than a dozen single lens reflex (SLR)
cameras, a clutch of digital cameras, some 15 lenses, eight or nine flash
units, and a closet-full of close-up attachments, filters, and other add-ons.
Don’t fight it. Enjoy your incurable addiction. You can have a lot of fun playing
with your accessories, and most of them don’t cost all that much, anyway.

Getting Support from Tripods
164
They help you shoot better pictures, too. This chapter highlights some of the
most common and most needed accessories for digital photography.
Getting Support from Tripods
A tripod is a three-legged stand, like the
one shown in Figure 5-1, designed to
hold your camera steady while a pic-
ture is composed and taken. Although
a tripod might be a little cumbersome
to carry along, at times, you’ll find one
indispensable. Here are some of the
things a tripod can do for you:
✦Hold the camera steady for longer
exposures. You need a longer 
shutter speed to capture an image
in dim light.
✦Hold the camera steady for photos
taken at telephoto zoom settings.
Telephoto settings do a great job of
magnifying the image, but they also
magnify the amount of vibration or
camera shake. Even tiny wobbles
can lead to photos that look like
they’re out of focus when they’re
actually just blurry from too much
camera movement. A tripod can
help eliminate this sort of blur.
If pictures keep ending up fuzzy
when the camera’s set for its 
maximum telephoto zoom setting,
it’s more likely that the problem is
camera shake than a poor autofocus
mechanism. At long zoom settings,
most digital cameras often switch to
a slower shutter speed. The slower
shutter speed coupled with the telephoto’s magnification of the tiniest bit
of camera shake leads to a photo that appears out of focus. It’s not that the
picture is out of focus at all; it’s just that the camera has been vibrating too
much. Mounting the camera on a good, sturdy tripod is the best cure for
this problem.
✦Hold the camera in place so you can get in the picture, too, by using
your digital camera’s self-timer feature. This way, you only have to
worry about how you look as you make a mad dash into the picture.

✦Allow for precise positioning and composition so that you can get
exactly the image you want. This is especially important if you want to
take multiple shots from the same spot, and is also useful if you’re
experimenting with filters or trying different lighting ideas.
✦Hold the camera for multipicture panoramic shots that you stitch
together into one photo in your image editor, or hold the camera for
close-up photography. I discuss close-ups in Book IV, Chapter 2, and
panoramas in greater detail in Book IV, Chapter 6.
Because most modern digital cameras are fairly lightweight, you won’t have to
carry a massive tripod like many pros do; just be sure the tripod is strong
enough to keep the camera steady. Beware of the models that claim to go from
tabletop to full height (roughly eye-level at five feet or more); odds are that
they sway like a reed when fully extended. If you have one of the new, low-cost
digital SLR cameras like those available from Canon, Nikon, Sony, and Pentax,
you might discover that you need a slightly heftier tripod because these
models are a bit heavier than the run-of-the-mill digital camera.
Getting multiple shots with a tripod
Here’s a trick that shows you just how useful a
tripod can be. Multiple shots can be merged to
solve difficult lighting situations because using
a tripod also allows multiple images from exactly
the same camera position. This is important
because it can help the photographer correct
problems with lighting that’s too contrasty.
Many times, a scene is lit in such a way that the
difference between the brightest white and the
darkest black is greater than the sensor can
handle. When this happens, pictures end up
with areas that are solid white or solid black
and have no detail in them.
When circumstances permit, pros correct this by
taking two or more images of exactly the same
scene with the camera mounted on the tripod.
The first image is exposed so that the highlights
are properly exposed; the second image is
exposed so that the shadows have detail. Hint:
When in doubt, take one picture that’s a little
overexposed and one picture that’s a little under-
exposed. (One setting above what the camera
recommends and one setting below what the
camera recommends would be a good rough
estimate.) Some cameras have this capability
built-in, usually called auto exposure bracketing.
Back at the computer, the two images are
merged in an image editing program such as
Photoshop so that the combined image carries
detail throughout the picture. Using this tech-
nique might stretch your comfort zone with 
both your computer and your camera, but it can
also help you improve many photos, such as
scenics, that can be taken with the camera
mounted on a tripod. You can always take an
extra shot at the setting the camera recom-
mends so that you still have the shot you’d have
gotten anyway. That’s one of the nice things
about digital cameras; you don’t have to worry
about wasting shots!

Getting Support from Tripods
166
Types of tripods
Tripods come in several types of materials, styles, and sizes. Pro units are
capable of handling heavy cameras and extending 5 to 6 feet high. These
tripods are made of wood, aluminum, or carbon fiber and can cost anywhere
from a couple hundred dollars to a thousand dollars or more. You probably
don’t want one of these. Your ideal tripod is probably a compact model
made of aluminum. Here are the common types of tripods:
✦Less expensive units: May range in size from 1 to 5 feet tall and cost just
a few dollars to a hundred dollars or more.
✦Full-size models: These range from 4 to 6 feet tall (or even larger) when
fully extended and might have from two to four collapsing sections to
reduce size for carrying. The more sections, the smaller the tripod 
collapses. The downside is that the extra sections reduce stability and
provide more points for problems to develop.
✦Tabletop or mini-tripods: These are promoted as lightweight, expand-
able, and easy to carry, which they are. They can be small enough to
carry around comfortably. They’re also promoted to be sturdy enough
for a 35mm camera, which they probably aren’t unless they’re set to
their lowest height. Most can easily handle a digital camera, however. If
used on a tabletop or braced against a wall with a small digital camera,
these units can do a decent job. They can come in handy in places
where there’s not enough room to use a full-size tripod.
To use a mini-tripod against a wall, brace it against the wall with your
left hand while pressing your left elbow into the wall. Use your right
hand to help stabilize the camera while tripping the shutter. Keep your
right elbow tight against your body for added stability.
✦Monopods: While not exactly a tripod (monopods have only one leg), a
monopod does help reduce camera shake. These single-leg, multi-segment
poles, like the one shown in Figure 5-2, can just about double the steadi-
ness of the camera.
However, don’t try to use a monopod around some protected buildings,
such as museums and government facilities, because monopods resem-
ble guns from a distance.
✦Hiking stick monopods: Another option is a combination hiking stick/
monopod. If you do a lot of hiking, these can be very worthwhile. Although
not as sturdy or stable as a high-quality monopod, these hybrids can work
quite well with the typical small digital camera. Most of them have a
wooden knob on top that unscrews, leaving a quarter-inch screw that
mates with the camera’s tripod socket. (Check to make sure your digital
camera has one; not all models do.) Mount the camera on the hiking stick,
brace the bottom of it against your left foot, pull it into your body with
your left hand, and gently squeeze the shutter release button.

for heavier cameras, like this digital SLR.

Gitzo, Lenmar, Slik, Sunpak, and Smith Victor at your photo retailer.
Scrutinizing tripod features
Not all tripods are made alike, so I encourage you to take a close look at 
how the tripod you’re thinking of purchasing is put together. The following
subsections are a rundown of what to look for.
Locking legs
All collapsible tripods offer some way of locking the legs in position. Most
common are rings that are twisted to loosen or tighten the legs in place.

Getting Support from Tripods
168
Some manufacturers use levers instead.
When buying a tripod, check this part
closely. Remember, every time you want
to fully extend or collapse the tripod,
you’re going to have six or more of these
locks to manipulate. A good tripod lets
you open or close all the locks for one
leg simultaneously when the legs are col-
lapsed, as shown in Figure 5-3. (Cover all
three rings or levers at the same time
with your hand and twist; they’re all
released, and then with one simple
movement, they’re all extended. This
also works in reverse.)
Range of movement
Some tripod legs can be set to a right
angle from the camera mount. This fea-
ture can be handy if you’re working on
uneven ground, such as a hiking trail.
Extra mounting screws
Some tripods offer an extra mounting
screw on one of the legs. Hypothetically,
this is useful, but its use is rare enough that I wouldn’t choose one tripod over
another just for this. A more useful extra is a reversing center column post,
available on better tripods, that can accept a camera on its low end (for
ground-level shots) or that has a hook that holds a weight or camera bag.
Placing extra weight on a tripod makes it steadier for longer exposures, so this
capability is actually very useful.
Heads
A tripod head is the device that connects the camera to the tripod legs. On
inexpensive models, these are frequently permanently attached. On better
quality models (although not necessarily expensive ones), they are remov-
able and can be replaced with a different type. There are quite a few different
styles of tripod heads. Many tripod heads that offer a panning capability (the
ability to spin or rotate the camera on its horizontal axis) also offer a series
of 360 markings to help orient the camera for panoramas. Here are some of
the types of tripod heads to consider:
✦Pan/tilt heads: These allow you to spin the camera on one axis and tilt it
on another. These are generally the cheapest and most labor intensive
because you have to make adjustments to multiple levers to reposition
the camera.
Figure 5-3: Grip all three locks to open
or close them simultaneously.

Book II
Chapter 5
Picking Up Some
Accessories
Getting Support from Tripods
169
✦Fluid, or video, heads: These usually have a longer handle that extends
from the head. Twist the grip to loosen it, and you can pivot and tilt the
camera simultaneously.
✦Joystick heads: Similar to the fluid or video head, this type has a locking
lever built into a tall head. By gripping the lever and head and squeezing,
you can pan and tilt the camera quickly and easily. These were designed
and marketed for 35mm cameras, but they don’t work particularly well
for these cameras because they’re subject to creep. Basically, creep
occurs when you reposition your camera on a tripod head, lock it, and
then notice the camera move a little as it settles into the locked position.
Creep can be a very annoying problem with any tripod head, but the 
joystick models seem to have more trouble with it. Note: For a smaller
digital camera, these heads might be a better choice simply because
these cameras weigh so much less.
✦Ball heads: These are probably the most popular style with pro photo-
graphers because they provide a full range of movement for the camera
with a minimal number of controls to bother with. This type of tripod
head, shown in Figure 5-4, uses a ball mounted in a cylinder. The ball has
a stem with a camera mount on one end, and when the control knob is
released, you can move your camera freely until reaching the top of the
cylinder. A cutout on one side of the cylinder allows the stem to drop
down low enough for the camera to be positioned vertically. Ball heads
range in price from just a few dollars to $500 or more. The best ones
don’t creep at all, which is why photographers pay so much for them.
Figure 5-4: A ball head is the most popular style of tripod head.

Checking out tripod alternatives
Several other items on the market are also worth considering for those who
need to travel light. A tried and true classic for supporting bigger camera/lens
combinations is the beanbag. Whether you use the basic beanbag that you
tossed around as a kid or the one specially designed for photography, by put-
ting the bag on a wall or car roof and then balancing the lens on the bag, you
can maneuver your equipment easily while letting the wall or car take the
weight of the lens.
You can also find a number of clamp-like devices coupled with the quarter-
inch screw necessary to attach them to your camera’s tripod socket. You
then clamp the camera to a tree limb or fence post or any other solid object,
and voilà! Instant tripod (don’t add water).
These camera-holding clamps range from a modest C-clamp device for just
a few bucks up to the Bogen Super Clamp system (www.bogenphoto.com).
The basic Super Clamp costs around $30. The basic C-clamp style should do
the job for travelers using a shirt-pocket-size digital camera. Those working
with one of the larger, digital SLR cameras might want to consider a Super
Clamp. A local camera store can probably help you out.
Making Good Use of an Electronic Flash
Because available light (more commonly known as available darkness) is unde-
pendable, digital photographers should consider carrying an accessory flash
unit. Although most digital cameras have some sort of built-in flash capability,
these don’t produce a very powerful light. The built-in flash unit is usually
good only for a range of up to about 8 feet or so, which isn’t always enough.
Accessory flash units do more than just provide extra light when it’s too dark
to shoot without it. Although I cover accessory lighting more thoroughly in
Book IV, Chapter 3, here are some situations in which an accessory flash is
useful:
✦Fill flash: Is your subject standing in the shadows while another part of the
scene is brightly lit? If you rely on your camera’s light meter, you’ll either
get a properly exposed subject and overexposed area where the light was
too bright or an unrecognizably dark subject and an okay scene. Using an
accessory flash lets you balance the light throughout the scene by expos-
ing for the bright area and using the flash to light up the shadows.
✦Painting with light: Suppose you want to take a picture of a building or
other large structure, and it’s pitch dark out. One technique for handling
this situation is known as painting with light. Set your camera on a tripod
or something equally solid and then pull out your accessory flash unit.
Set your digital camera to its bulb (B) or time (T) exposure setting if it
has one — or if not, then use the longest exposure possible. While the
shutter is open, use your flash to light up sections of the building one

section at a time. Here’s where the true wonder of the digital camera
comes in: You can check your photo as soon as you’re done taking it.
Although film photographers have been using this technique for years,
they’ve always had to wonder whether they got it right until they got
their prints back or saw their negatives in the darkroom.
✦Macro, or close-up, photography: Getting in close requires lots of light
simply because as the camera gets closer to its subject, the area of
sharp focus — depth of field — diminishes. Using your external flash
helps provide enough light to allow an aperture setting for greater depth
of field. The external flash also provides more-even illumination for your
subject. It’s best if you use a setup that allows your flash unit to operate
while off the camera because lighting your subject from the side brings
out more detail than lighting from straight ahead. Some flash units, such
as ring lights, are specifically designed for macro photography. (I take a
look at ring lights a little later in this chapter.)
✦Bounce flash: Many accessory flash units include a tilt/swivel head that
lets you point the unit toward a reflective surface instead of right at your
subject. By bouncing the flash off the surface and toward your subject,
you create softer light and shadows than you would if the flash was
directed straight at your subject. Some include a built-in card or deflec-
tor that can help you direct the bounce light, as shown in Figure 5-5.
Bouncing a flash unit this way weakens its effective output because the
light has to travel a greater distance to reach the subject. This isn’t a
problem if the surface is reasonably close, but distance matters. Beware
of cathedral ceilings!
✦Multi-flash: It’s possible to use multiple flash units to create a lighting
setup that comes reasonably close to studio lighting. By positioning
these flashes properly, you can either create a nicer portrait lighting
setup or distribute the lights well enough to evenly illuminate an
entire room.
Built-in flash units can also speed the camera’s battery drain tremendously.
Because they’re positioned right above the lens, the built-in strobes are also
a prime cause of red-eye. This is a reddish tinge in human pupils (greenish or
yellowish in many animals). Red-eye is particularly difficult to prevent when
photographing (with flash) young children. An accessory flash can help
reduce this effect because you can position it farther from the lens than a
built-in unit.
Many higher-end digital cameras offer some method of triggering an acces-
sory flash unit, either by a cable connection or via a hot shoe — the device
on a camera that holds an external flash and provides an electronic connec-
tion to the camera. Many amateur and prosumer digital cameras, however,
offer no such provision. The answer in this case is a “slaved” flash specifi-
cally designed for digital cameras (which I discuss in more detail in the next
section).

Figure 5-5: An external flash unit can be bounced off any 
available surface.
Types of electronic flash units
There are as many different electronic flash units available as there are digi-
tal cameras. The following subsections provide a quick rundown of the kinds
you’ll want to consider.
Before buying flash equipment of any kind, be sure it works with your camera.
Flash units can be triggered via the camera’s hot shoe, by electronic slaves, by
wireless radio triggers, and via several different types of cables. Some cameras
can use a generic, old-fashioned connection called a PC cable (not named for a
personal computer but for the Prontor-Compur shutters of the early film cam-
eras that used this connection). These cables are inexpensive and work with
any camera that has a PC connection, but all they do is trigger the flash unit.
A camera’s manufacturer makes another type of cable, known by several dif-
ferent designations (TTL and E-TTL, for example); this proprietary type is
designed specifically for the manufacturer’s cameras (sometimes for just one

173
segment of its camera line) and no other, although these cables do work with
third-party flashes. The advantage to these types of flash cords (which are
much more expensive than PC cords) are that they allow the camera and
flash unit to communicate with each other so that the camera can turn the
flash’s output off when it determines proper exposure is reached.
Small, light minislaves
These units are electronic flash devices with built-in remote triggering and
are designed to help augment the camera’s built-in flash unit. They’re gener-
ally useful for adding a little extra dimension to your lighting and as a way of
filling in background areas. These units are slaved to fire when another flash
unit goes off. Such photographic slaves are photoelectric sensors designed
to trigger a flash unit when another flash is fired within the sensor’s field of
view (in the case of a digital camera, when the camera’s built-in flash fires).
These slave-triggering circuits are sold as independent units that you can
attach to existing flash units, or the circuitry can be built right into a flash.
Hot shoe mount flashes
These are more powerful than both the minislaves and the camera’s built-in
flash units. They might or might not offer a tilt or swivel capability. Some
camera systems (usually higher-end digital cameras) offer a cable that hooks
up to the camera’s hot shoe (shown in Figure 5-6) and allows the flash to com-
municate with the camera’s electronics while being positioned in ways the hot
shoe mount won’t permit. The advantage to these cables over slaves is that
they usually permit the camera/flash combo’s full range of capabilities.
(Some cameras are set to turn off the flash as soon as the correct exposure is
reached, whereas a slaved flash will continue pumping out light as set.)
Professional models
These units tend to be the manufacturer’s most powerful and most advanced
flash units. They have lots of features, including built-in slave capabilities
and the ability to work with wireless remote systems. In many cases, 
they’re also capable of taking advantage of the digital camera’s lack of a true
mechanical shutter at higher shutter speeds. This means the flash can be
used with faster shutter speeds than those used with film cameras. In addition
to the manufacturer’s flash models, dedicated flashes offered by third-party
manufacturers also work with many existing camera systems.
Many third-party flash units and lenses are reverse-engineered to work on
major brand-name cameras. Sometimes, this equipment might not work with
later equipment made by your camera’s manufacturer. If a third-party flash
causes damage to your camera (and today’s highly electronic cameras can
be susceptible to damage from improper voltage discharge), the camera
manufacturer might not repair the damage under warranty.

Making Good Use of an Electronic Flash
174
Figure 5-6: Dedicated electronic flash units use hot shoe connections.
Portable studio lighting
Portable studio lighting kits are available that enable a photographer to
carry a complete set of lights with lighting stands and reflectors or umbrel-
las. These kits usually offer two to three lights or more and might also
include a backdrop setup. Although these sets are fine for local or cross-
country trips, it might be easier to rent such a kit while traveling overseas
than it is to pack one along with all your camera equipment while flying. The
flash units in these kits often have built-in slaves as well, which are triggered
either via a connection to the camera or via a flash unit on or in the camera.
What to look for in a photographic slave flash
A basic slave unit is a small device designed to mate with the flash unit’s hot
shoe or other connection. The slave (good ones have on/off switches) trig-
gers the flash when another flash unit is fired. These slaves have their own
hot shoe foot (to mate with stands designed for such things or the L-bracket
described in a few paragraphs) and also have quarter-inch tripod sockets in
their base so that you can screw them onto an extra tripod.
Wireless or radio slaves also exist. These are significantly more expensive
(although I paid just $75 for my radio unit), but worth it when other photo-
graphers and their accompanying flashes are in the vicinity. A regular photo-
electric slave doesn’t care that it’s been triggered by the wrong photographer’s
flash unit; it simply does its job. Wireless triggers work via radio signals, 
not light. These devices generally offer multiple frequencies to minimize the
likelihood of another photographer triggering them.

Making Good Use of an Electronic Flash
175
A standard photographic slave won’t work properly with a digital camera
because most prosumer and amateur digital cameras emit a preflash (to help
the camera make some internal settings), which triggers earlier slave designs
prematurely. If you’re interested in a slaved flash unit, make sure it’s
designed to work with a digital camera. Nissin, an electronics firm, makes a
flash unit known as the Digi-Slave Flash. You can find about a half-dozen dif-
ferent units, ranging all the way up to a pro unit. Check out SR, Inc., for pic-
tures and descriptions of the models available (www.srelectronics.com).
Although the slaved flash doesn’t help reduce the drain on the camera’s bat-
tery, the more powerful light still helps improve photos. The photographer
also gains the ability to position the light higher up from the lens (usually
slightly to the right or left as well) to reduce the likelihood of red-eye and to
provide a more pleasing effect. Generally speaking, setting the camera’s
exposure system to automatic can handle the increased flash okay; if you’re
not satisfied with the result, switch to aperture priority and experiment! The
exception is with close-up photos, where overexposure is likely. Dialing in a
correction (usually a reduction of about two f-stops) through the camera’s
exposure compensation system solves this problem.
An electronic flash unit without power is an expensive paperweight. With the
exception of the portable studio lighting kits, which require electrical out-
lets, electronic flashes usually require AA batteries, although the smallest
might take AAAs instead. Rechargeable batteries generally provide an inex-
pensive option, although they tend to recycle (recharge the flash unit) more
slowly than alkaline batteries do. PC cables and manufacturer flash cords
malfunction (take care not to crimp them), so for important trips, carry
extras (especially if you’re going overseas, where it might be hard to find a
replacement). Some rechargeable batteries also tend to lose their charge
faster than alkaline batteries when stored.
Lighting/flash accessories
Depending on your shooting requirements and how much weight you can
afford to carry, some accessories out there can help improve your photo-
graphy. Here’s my list of possibilities:
✦Brackets: A nice complement to the accessory flash route is an L-bracket
flash holder. This device mounts to the camera via the tripod socket 
and has a flash shoe at the top of the L, where you position the flash. 
In addition to providing a secure hold for the flash unit, the L-bracket
tends to provide a steadier grip for the camera. You can even find
models designed for the shorter, thinner digital cameras, such as the
earlier Nikon Coolpix series (www.nikon.com).

Choosing a Camera Bag
176
✦Background cloths/reflectors: Garden enthusiasts interested in photo-
graphing flowers can bring swatches of colored cloth large enough to
serve as a background for a shot of a plant or bloom. Black is a good 
all-purpose color, whereas red, green, and blue complement common
flower colors. Another helpful item is a collapsible reflector; camera
stores sell small ones, or you can pick up ones designed as sun blockers
for car windows. These reflectors can kick some sunlight back into the
shadow areas to help create a more pleasing image. For the most serious
flower photographers, a ring light or circular flash unit that mounts in
front of the camera lens provides an even, balanced light for flower
close-ups. A Digi-Slave flash ring light unit can be configured for many
amateur and prosumer digital cameras.
Choosing a Camera Bag
Depending on the size of a digital camera and the accessories accompanying
it, a camera bag or pouch could be a necessity. For just the basics — a small
camera, extra batteries, extra memory cards, and a lens cleaning cloth — a
simple fanny pack does the job and leaves room for hotel keys, money, and
identification.
A more serious photographer who’s carrying a larger digital camera needs
more space. A larger camera bag might be the answer, but for the active
traveler, there are some interesting options. Because camera bags are espe-
cially useful for traveling photographers, I’ve included a longer description
of the options and features in Book IV, Chapter 6, which deals with travel
photography.
Acquiring Other Useful Devices
Gizmos. Gadgets. Thing-a-ma-jigs. Many of these items don’t fall into any 
particular type of category, except that they do something useful. Some are
quirky but cool, such as little shades that fasten onto the back of your camera
and shield your LCD readout screen from the bright sun. Others are serious
working tools, like the add-on battery packs described in an upcoming section.
Photographers love gadgets, and you’ll find lots of them for digital cameras.
Here are a few of the most practical.
A filter holder
A helpful device I especially like is a filter holder engineered by the Cokin
company (www.cokin.fr/) and sold by most camera outlets. One Cokin
holder, designed for cameras that can’t accept filters, mounts to the base
of the camera via the tripod socket. This adapter allows the use of Cokin’s

Book II
Chapter 5

square filters, which slide right into the adapter to provide a variety of
effects and corrections. Note, however, that you could achieve many of the
same results in an image editing program. To those who are more comfort-
able tweaking things on the computer, filters aren’t important. On the other
hand, if you’re new to computer photo editing, relying on traditional filters
might be easier. You can always take one shot with a filter and one without
and then try to tweak the filter-less shot to look like the filtered one. This
process can help you figure out how to get the most from your image editing
software.
A second camera
Sooner or later, you’ll think about buying a second camera — say, when
you’re ready to leave on that vacation of a lifetime. A small, inexpensive 
digital camera doesn’t cost much, and if the primary camera fails, it might
prove worth its weight in gold, photographically speaking. Shop for one — or
borrow one — that uses the same type of batteries and storage medium as
your primary camera, if possible. The extra camera can also entice a spouse
or child into sharing your love of photography.
Second cameras are easy to come by. Every time I upgrade to a new digital
camera, the old one gets passed down to a family member or kept in reserve
as a spare camera. My old 3.3-megapixel Nikon Coolpix 995 was great in its
day, but it became a backup when I upgraded to an EVF model with a super-
sharp 8:1 zoom lens. Then digital SLRs came along and I bought a Nikon D70,
with my EVF camera relegated to back-up duty.
Cleaning kits
You’ll also frequently need a good cleaning kit (see Figure 5-7). An inexpen-
sive microfiber cleaning cloth is great for cleaning optics, but first use a
blower to blow any dust particles from the lens. You can then hold the lens
near your head, fog the lens with your breath, and gently (very gently) wipe
the lens with the cloth. Canned (pressurized) air also does a good job of
blowing dust and dirt off the camera, but make sure the can is held level, or
solvents from the aerosol might contaminate the lens.
Damp or dusty conditions call for more serious efforts. Protect your camera
inside heavy-duty plastic freezer or sandwich bags while inside the camera
bag, thus reducing exposure to dust and moisture. Keep the little packets of
silica that come with electronic equipment and place one or two of these in
the camera bag to eat up moisture, too. The following section provides more
detailed information about dealing with extreme weather conditions and
bags and containers for protecting gear. (Call it the difference between
shooting at a dusty ball field on a windy day versus shooting in a windstorm
in the desert.)

Figure 5-7: Keep your camera clean with gear like this air blower, cleaning swab, and
cleaning liquid.
If you have a digital SLR, you might need a special cleaning kit for removing
dust from your sensor. Something as simple as a bulb air blower may work,
or you might need to buy a kit containing a brush and swabs for liquid
cleaning.
Waterproof casings and housings
Extreme conditions call for better protection for your camera. Better yet, 
photography in wet weather, or even underwater, can be fun, too. Waterproof
casings that still allow for photography are available from several companies,
including ewa-marine (www.ewa-marine.de). These are useful for both under-
water photography (careful on the depth, though) and above-the-water shots
when you’re sailing or boating. Keep in mind that salt spray is very possibly
the single worst threat to camera electronics. Make sure your camera casing
provides good protection against wind and salt spray.
Another option for those who want to shoot in wet conditions often is a
new underwater digital camera. The SeaLife ReefMaster underwater digital
camera series (www.sealife-cameras.com) comes in a waterproof housing
and works both on land and underwater. The cameras, which can be pur-
chased for as little as $400, produce 3.3 to 5 megapixel images, and save
you the trouble of trying to find a housing to fit an existing digital camera.
The cameras also have an LCD that works underwater and a fast delete 
function to make it easier to operate underwater.

For serious underwater enthusiasts, heavy-duty Plexiglas housings now exist
for small digital cameras. These housings are available for a wide range of
digital cameras and may be found for as little as a couple hundred dollars.
Filters
Filters, those glass disks that can be screwed onto your camera’s lens, are a
popular accessory. Here are some of the different kinds of filters you can buy
and play with:
✦Warming: Some filters produce what photographers refer to as a warming
effect. This filter can help make up for the lack of color in midday light and
tries to add some reddish-orange color to the scene. Usually, these are
coded in the 81 series as in 81A, 81B, 81C. Just ask for a warming filter.
✦Cooling: These do just the opposite of the previous type. They add 
blue to the scene to reduce the reddish-orange color. These fall into the
82 series for daylight conditions.
✦Neutral density: Another type of filter reduces the amount of light avail-
able. These neutral density (ND) filters (neutral because they have no
color, and density because they block light) come in handy for things such
as achieving the spun-glass effect from moving water. The filter blocks an
f-stop’s worth of light or more, making a slower shutter speed possible
and increasing the blur of the moving water. You can use ND filters to
operate at a wider aperture to blur the background in portraits, too.
✦Neutral density, take two: Sometimes a photographer wants to photo-
graph a street scene without cars driving through the photo. By stacking
neutral density filters, it’s possible to create such a long exposure that
no cars are in the scene long enough to register in the image. Obviously,
a camera support of some sort is required. (Hint: The ground’s pretty
stable, too, unless you’re visiting California.) Having a camera capable of
extremely slow shutter speeds is also necessary. A neutral density filter
is shown in Figure 5-8.
✦Split neutral density: Another version of the neutral density filter is a
split neutral density design. This filter provides half neutral density and
half clear filtration, preferably with a graduated transition from the light-
blocking half to the clear half.
The main use for a split ND filter is for occasions when half the scene is
brighter than the other. The most common example of this is a bright
sky against a significantly darker foreground. This condition is typical of
midday lighting conditions.
✦Polarizers: Polarizing filters can reduce the glare bouncing off shiny sur-
faces in your photos. Simply attach the filter and view the image through
your LCD. Rotate the polarizer until the glare disappears. Polarizers can
also help deepen the contrast of the sky from certain angles.

Battery packs
One of my digital cameras uses a lithium-ion (Li-Ion) rechargeable battery
that’s good for a couple hundred shots. Unless you’re involved in a serious
photographic project or leave home on vacation, a single battery (plus one
spare) might be all you need. However, that same camera can be fitted with
an add-on battery pack that fits under the camera body and holds two more
of the same model Li-Ion batteries (increasing the shooting capacity to
nearly 600 shots). More importantly, the accessory battery pack accepts
standard AA batteries, which the camera itself does not.
You’ll find an add-on battery pack like this extremely useful for those shooting
sessions that involve treks into back country far from AC power. Or if you’re
on vacation, you might be unable to recharge your digital camera’s batteries
until you check into your next hotel, so the additional juice might be handy.
If you need an accessory battery pack, you probably also need a charger that
works on multiple voltage settings (so it can be used overseas) or with an
automobile connector so that you can recharge your batteries on the road.

e honest: If you’re really serious about digital
photography as a hobby, you probably turned
to this book ﬁrst because digital single-lens reﬂexes
(dSLRs) have, in a few short years, become the
dream camera of almost every photo enthusiast.
Those point-and-shoot cameras are great to slip
into a pocket or purse for spur-of-the-moment 
pictures, but dSLRs are really where the action is
among photo hobbyists.
So, if you’re the type who loves to be on the bleed-
ing edge of technology, this minibook’s three
chapters will help slake your dSLR-knowledge
thirst. I show you exactly why these cameras can
do things that other types of picture-shooters
(both ﬁlm and digital) cannot. I’m even up-front
with explanations of a few things that dSLRs can’t
do (and why you shouldn’t care). I help you ﬁgure
out how to manage a dSLR’s controls to select 
the right focus mode, as well as choose between
aperture-priority, shutter-priority, programmed
exposure, or one of those intriguing Scene modes. 
I explain the differences between prime lenses and
zooms and how to select an add-on lens that gives
you the most ﬂexibility without sacriﬁcing image
quality. This book is a concise introduction to an
exciting camera technology.

ome folks will tell you that digital single-lens reflex (or dSLR) cameras
are destined to become the Next Big Thing. They’re wrong. Digital single
lens reflex cameras are already a Big Thing, and they’re destined to get even
bigger. Practically anything you can do with a traditional digital camera, you
can do with a dSLR — and do it faster, with more creative options,
and usually with a better picture. (I explain some of the
things a dSLR can’t do later in this chapter.)
Working with what most amateur photographers 
consider the “high end” of the digital photography
equipment realm won’t make you a better photog-
rapher. But upgrading to a dSLR will probably
make you a happier photographer, particularly
after you’ve mastered all the new controls and fea-
tures these cameras offer.
As you may (or may not) know, single-lens reflex
cameras are film or digital picture-takers that use
mirrors and/or prisms to give you a bright, clear opti-
cal view (not a TV-like LCD view) of the picture you’re
going to take, using the same lens that is used to take the pic-
ture. Best of all, that lens can be taken off (it’s interchangeable) so
you can substitute another lens that brings you closer to your subject,
offers a wider view, or maybe focuses down close enough to see the hungry
look in the eye of a praying mantis. Is that cool, or what?
Whether you already own a dSLR or you’re thinking of buying one, this
chapter and the two that follow are your introduction to the exciting fea-
tures of these top-of-the-digital-food-chain cameras. If you want to find out

but everything you really must know right off the bat is in this book.
Six Great dSLR Features
All digital SLRs have six killer features that make your job as a photographer
much easier, more pleasant, and more creative.
A bigger, brighter view
The perspective through a dSLR’s viewfinder is larger and easier to view than
what you get with any non-SLR’s optical window, back-panel LCD, or internal
electronic viewfinder (EVF). With a dSLR, what you see is almost exactly 
what you get (or at least 95 percent of it), although you might need to press a
button called a depth-of-field preview if you want to know more precisely what
parts of your image are in focus. The dSLR’s viewfinder shows you a large
image of what the lens sees, not a TV-screen-like LCD view. (See Figure 1-1.)
If you have your heart set on using an LCD, you can still review the picture
you’ve taken on your dSLR’s LCD after it has been captured.
Figure 1-1: A dSLR viewfinder gives you a big, bright view of your scene for easy composition
and focus.

Book III
Chapter 1
The Digital SLR
Advantage
Six Great dSLR Features
185
Faster operation
Any non-SLR digital camera suffers from something called shutter lag, which
is a delay of 0.5 to 1.5 seconds (or more) after you press the shutter release
all the way but before the picture is actually taken. Lag is a drag when you’re
shooting sports action or trying to capture a fleeting expression on the faces
of your kids. A dSLR responds to your command to shoot virtually instantly
and can continue to take pictures at a 3 to 5 frames-per-second clip (or even
faster). Try that with a non-SLR camera! All functions of a dSLR camera, from
near-instant power-up to autofocus to storing an image on your memory
card are likely to operate faster and more smoothly with a dSLR than with
other types of digital cameras.
Lenses, lenses, and more lenses
Certainly, many non-SLR cameras are outfitted with humongous zoom 
lenses with 12X or more zoom ratios. A typical “superzoom” range is the
equivalent of 35mm to 420mm on a full-frame digital or film camera. Yet,
these “do-everything” lenses don’t do everything. Only a digital SLR, which
lets you pop off the lens currently mounted on your camera and mount
another one with different features, has that capability. Non-SLR digital cam-
eras rarely offer wide angle views as broad as 24mm to 28mm. Digital SLR
lenses commonly offer views as wide as 10mm. You’ll also want a dSLR if you
need to focus extra-close or want a really long telephoto. The lenses offered
for dSLR cameras are often sharper, too. For many photographers, the ability
to change lenses is the number-one advantage of the digital SLR.
Better image quality
You’ll find non-SLR digital cameras today with 8 to 10 megapixels of resolu-
tion. (There are even camera phones with resolution in that range.) But a
good-quality dSLR will almost always provide better image equality than a
traditional digital camera of the same or better resolution. Why? Because the
dSLR’s sensor has larger pixels (at least 4 to 5 times larger), which makes
them more sensitive to light and less prone to those grainy artifacts we call
noise. An 8-megapixel dSLR usually provides better images with less noise at
a sensitivity setting of ISO 800 than an 8-megapixel non-SLR camera at ISO
400 — and the snapshooting camera probably doesn’t even have an ISO set-
ting of 800 or more.
Camera-like operation
The workings of a non-SLR digital camera have more in common with a cell
phone than with a traditional film camera. If you don’t like zooming by press-
ing a button, visiting a menu every time you want to change a setting, or fine-
tuning focus with a pair of keys, you should be using a digital SLR.

Six dSLR Drawbacks You Can Live With
186
More control over depth of field
Depth of field (DOF) is the distance range in which things in your photos 
are in sharp focus. DOF can be shallow, which is a good thing when you 
want to make everything in your image other than your subject blurry, 
so that your subject is isolated or highlighted. Depth-of-field can also be 
generous, which is great when you want everything in the picture to look
sharp. 
Digital SLR cameras allow you to choose between shallow DOF, extensive
DOF, and everything in between. Non-SLR cameras usually give you two
choices when you’re not shooting close-up pictures: having everything in
sharp focus, and having virtually everything in sharp focus. You can find 
out more about the technical reason for this (the extra depth of field pro-
vided by the shorter focal length lenses used in non-SLR cameras) in 
Book IV, Chapter 2. If you want to use focus creatively, a dSLR is your best
choice.
Six dSLR Drawbacks You Can Live With
Although dSLRs can do many things that non-dSLRs can’t, they do have
some limitations. However, I think you’ll find that those limitations make a
worthwhile trade-off, considering all the additional capabilities you gain 
with a digital SLR.
No LCD preview
“Where’s my preview?” That’s the number-one question asked by new dSLR
owners who started out using conventional digital cameras. Except for one
scientific model offered by Canon and a line of cameras from Olympus, no
digital SLR offers a live preview of the image you’re about to take on the
back-panel LCD. That’s because the mirror and shutter of a dSLR block the
sensor from receiving light until the moment the picture is actually taken.
So, you generally must be satisfied with viewing your image on the LCD only
after it has been taken, as shown in Figure 1-2. 
A dSLR can’t provide the real-time exposure “chart,” called a live histogram,
that many non-SLR cameras display on the rear LCD, either, although you
can view this chart after the photo is taken and make corrections then. You
can live with this drawback because the LCD preview isn’t all that great or
accurate, anyway.

Book III
Chapter 1
The Digital SLR
Advantage
Six dSLR Drawbacks You Can Live With
187
Figure 1-2: A dSLR shows an image only after the picture has been taken.
Limited viewing angles
Cameras that offer an LCD preview, particularly those with a swiveling LCD, 
let you hold the camera at arms length, overhead, or down low to compose
your pictures. With a dSLR, you must have your eye right up to the viewfinder
to line up your shot. You can buy add-on viewing attachments (including 
right-angle adapters) that can give dSLR owners a little more flexibility, but
this is one limitation you’ll probably have to learn to live with.
Lack/expense of super-wide lenses
If your dSLR has a sensor that is smaller than 24mm x 36mm (a 35mm film
camera’s “full frame”), the perspective of each lens is cropped by this smaller
sensor size, “increasing” the focal length’s effective field of view by 1.3X to 2X,
depending on the dSLR you’re using. (The focal length isn’t really multiplied,
however.) This factor is good news for those who want to reach out with a longer
telephoto lens, but bad news for those who find their 20mm super-wide-angle
lens has become an ordinary 26mm to 40mm moderately wide or normal lens.
This drawback is easier to live with if you have the funds to buy the special,
often expensive, ultra-wide lenses made especially for dSLRs.

How Digital SLRs Work
188
Dirt and dust
Each time you swap lenses on your dSLR, dust and dirt have the chance to
get inside and eventually settle on the sensor. While this dirt is often invisi-
ble in your final photos, you’ll see it in large, plain, light-colored areas of
your image (such as the sky) in photos taken with smaller f-stops (which
provide extra depth of field that brings the dust into sharp focus). Get used
to the idea of locking your shutter open and cleaning the sensor with a blast
of air, a brush, or a swab moistened with a cleaning fluid. The process induces
panic the first time you need to do it, but it’s really easy and will be some-
thing you need to live with.
No movies
Many digital snapshooting cameras can take movies with sound at TV-quality
640 x 480 pixels at 30 frames per second (fps). Although most of these cam-
eras will never replace a true camcorder, it’s handy to have this capability for
spur-of-the-moment movie clips. Alas, the fastest professional dSLR is capable
of snapping shots at no more than about 8 fps and would be mechanically
incapable of shooting 30 fps movies even at a drastically reduced resolution. If
you want movies and dSLR stills, you’re going to have to carry two cameras.
Weight and size
Digital SLR cameras can’t be slipped into a pocket unless you’re a kangaroo,
and they weigh a lot more than most of their non-SLR counterparts (although
electronic-viewfinder and superzoom cameras can be huge, too). Some dSLRs
are smaller than others, but none are truly petite. If you want to have a camera
with you at all times (and you should!), you’ll need to either get used to lug-
ging around a dSLR or buy a second, ultracompact snapshooting camera as a
constant companion.
How Digital SLRs Work
I show you in general how digital cameras work in Book II, Chapter 1. But, as
you might expect, there are some differences in the way digital SLRs capture
pictures. Knowing a little of the inside dope on these cameras can help you
understand how best to use their features.
Like their non-SLR counterparts, digital SLRs rely on sensors composed of an
array of pixels. But because the sensors are larger in a dSLR, the pixels are
larger, too, so most 8-megapixel dSLRs produce sharper and more noise-free
results than 8-megapixel non-dSLRs. Some dSLRs even outperform other
dSLRs with greater resolution because of the quality of the sensors, lenses,

or electronic circuitry. So, with dSLRs as with other types of digital cameras,
the raw number of megapixels is only a guideline, even though more pixels is
quite often better.
It’s important to remember that you might not actually need all that extra
resolution, especially when you consider that every million pixels you stuff
into a digital SLR adds up to a more expensive camera that might not actu-
ally give you better results. Those extra pixels fill up your memory cards:
My first dSLR could fit 150 highest-resolution photos on a 1GB Compact Flash
card; my newest requires a 4GB card for 190 photos.
In the same vein, I had to upgrade my hard drive to store those larger images
and switch from CD to DVD for archiving. Those bigger photo files take longer
to transfer from my card reader to my computer, and I needed more RAM
and a faster processor to edit them in my image editor. The demands of mul-
tiple megapixels probably won’t dissuade you from buying that advanced
camera you’ve been lusting after, but you should keep the equipment
requirements of your upgrade in mind.
You’ll find that the components of a dSLR are very similar to what you find in
the generic digital camera I describe in Book II, Chapter 1. To recap, digital
SLRs include the following parts (shown in Figure 1-3):
✦Lens: This optical component captures light and focuses it on your sensor.
Usually, a lens found on a digital camera is of the zoom variety, which can
change focal lengths at your command to provide more or less magnifica-
tion of the image. However, with a dSLR, the lens may also be a fixed focal
length or prime lens (see Book III, Chapter 3 for more information). And, of
course, digital SLR lenses are removable and interchangeable.
✦Aperture: This opening inside the lens can be adjusted to allow more or
less light to reach the viewfinder and sensor. Non-SLR cameras may offer
only a very limited number of apertures (or f-stops), sometimes only one
in addition to the maximum aperture. Lenses for dSLRs usually include 
a full range, from the largest (often f/2.8 or larger) to the smallest (fre-
quently f/22 or smaller.)
✦Viewing system: Non-SLR cameras may have an optical window to sup-
plement the back-panel LCD that provides  an image of what the sensor
sees. As I mention earlier in this chapter, dSLRs have no such LCD pre-
view but instead use a mirror that bounces the light received from the
lens to other mirrors or to a prism for inspection through what is called
an eye-level viewfinder. This more elaborate system requires some mech-
anism for flipping the mirror out of the way when the picture is taken,
plus a ground-glass or plastic focusing screen that the reflected image is
formed on.

How Digital SLRs Work
190
✦Shutter: Non-SLR cameras usually control the length of the exposure
with an electronic shutter, which briefly sensitizes the sensor and then
turns it off. Digital SLRs, too, use an electronic shutter for the very
briefest shutter speeds, usually those no longer than 1/180 to 1/500 of 
a second — the slowest “electronic” shutter speed varies from dSLR to
dSLR. But these cameras also use a mechanical shutter located just in
front of the sensor (at the focal plane) that exposes the sensor for a
period of time by opening a curtain that travels over the surface of the
sensor, followed by a second curtain that makes the same trip to cover
the sensor back up. This focal plane shutter handles exposures from
30 seconds or longer down to 1/180 to 1/500 of a second (again, depending
on the camera).
✦Sensor: All digital cameras use a sensor, as described in Book II, Chapter 1.
Digital SLR sensors are larger, more sensitive to light, and produce less
noise at a given sensitivity setting.
✦Storage: A digital SLR has very fast internal memory, called a buffer,
which accepts each image (actually, a series of images, enabling your
dSLR to take one picture after another). Like other types of digital cam-
eras, the dSLR also has a removable memory card, usually a Compact
Flash, SD, or xD Picture Card, that stores the images as they are written
from the buffer.

The size and speed of your digital camera’s buffer and the writing speed of
the memory card determine how many pictures you can take in a row. Digital
cameras generally let you take between 5 and 30 shots consecutively and in
continuous bursts of about 2.5 to 8 frames per second. When your buffer
fills, the camera stops taking pictures. However, as the buffer fills, the dSLR
will simultaneously write some of the pictures to your memory card, freeing
up space for more pictures. So, a faster memory card (they are measured in
relative speed, such as 40X, 80X, 133X) allows you to take more pictures con-
secutively, making your camera’s built-in buffer that much more effective.
Managing dSLR Quirks
Earlier in this chapter, I describe the differences between a dSLR and a non-
SLR camera. Whether you call them quirks, idiosyncrasies, or foibles, most
of these differences, like the faster operation and lack of shutter lag, are
advantages that you can benefit from. Others, such as lack of an LCD pre-
view, are things you must simply get used to. But other dSLR quirks com-
mand a bit of your attention. The three most demanding idiosyncrasies are
detailed in the following sections.
Noise about noise
If you date back to the film era, you might recall that film came in various
speeds or sensitivities, represented by ISO ratings. (ISO is the name chosen
by the International Organization for Standardization, but it isn’t an acronym.)
You probably purchased an ISO 200 film for everyday use, perhaps a “slower”
ISO 100 product when you wanted a less grainy picture or because you
believed these films provided better quality. If you planned to shoot under
low light levels or needed fast shutter speeds, you might have purchased an
ISO 400 film.
Digital camera sensitivity is measured in ISO-equivalent settings, too, but, in
truth, each digital sensor has only one actual ISO sensitivity — usually the
lowest setting available for that camera. This minimum ISO setting varies
from ISO 50 to about ISO 200, depending on the camera. All other ISO set-
tings are created by amplifying the signal captured by the sensor, so photons
that were almost too dim to register are electronically beefed up to become
full-fledged pixels.
Unfortunately, at the same time, non-photons are mistaken for true pixels
and assigned pixel-hood even though they don’t deserve it. These bogus
pixels are what photographers call noise, and unless you want a grainy look
to your photos, noise is usually a bad thing. Noise appears in your pictures
as multi-colored flecks that look like grainy, irregular dots.

Managing dSLR Quirks
192
Other factors cause noise, too. If an exposure is very long, some spurious
pixels can be produced, often because the sensor heats up after being sensi-
tized for a long period (about a second or more). Some kinds of electrical
interference can also produce noise in your images.
Non-SLR cameras are the worst in the noise department, which is why most
snapshooting cameras top out at ISO 400, although a few cameras from
Fujifilm, Sony, and others now go all the way up to ISO 1600 (with mixed
results). Your dSLR has a distinct advantage. It has larger pixels, which are
more sensitive to light because they have more area to capture photons.
So, virtually all digital SLRs can be used at ISO 800 with little noise, and
many go up to ISO 3200. The very best performers tend to be the full-frame
dSLRs, such as the Canon EOS 5D, which has the largest pixels of all.
If you’re new to dSLRs, you may be unfamiliar with the possibilities of high ISO
shooting and, in particular, the relative image quality your own camera pro-
duces at various ISO settings. You’ll want to take the time to capture a few
shots at each available setting to find out what your dSLR can and can’t do.
You’ll also want to figure out how to use your camera’s noise reduction (NR)
features to reduce problems like those shown in Figure 1-4. Depending on
the model you own, NR may be applied automatically to high ISO settings
but be optional for longer exposures. Or your camera may have separate
user-defined settings for each type of noise. 
Excessive noise reduction can reduce the amount of detail in your image, so
you should find out exactly how to use your camera’s NR features. You’ll also
want to find out how to apply noise reduction after the picture was taken by
using software like Adobe Camera Raw, Noise Ninja, or the filter built into
Photoshop itself.
The real dirt on sensors
It might take awhile, but eventually you’ll get some dust on your dSLR
sensor and will need to clean it. Don’t panic! The process isn’t difficult or
dangerous, but you can take some steps to minimize the number of times
you’ll have to clean your sensor:
✦Minimize dust entry. If you point your camera downward when 
changing lenses, dust particles are less likely to settle into the mirror
compartment.
✦Don’t provide dust with a safe haven. Make sure the mounts of your
lenses and the rear lens elements are clean and dust-free when you
attach a lens to your camera.

The Digital SLR
Advantage

193
Figure 1-4: Without noise reduction, a long exposure at a high ISO (left) can be contaminated 
by the multicolored specks we call noise (right.)
✦Think clean. Try to change lenses in relatively clean environments.
Avoid dusty rooms or gusty outdoor locations.
✦Minimize the time your camera is lenseless. Have your new lens ready
to mount, with the rear cap off but placed loosely on the back of the
lens. Then, remove the lens already on your camera, set it down, and
immediately take the rear lens cap off the new lens (set it on the back of
the old lens if you can do it quickly). Then pick up the lens to be mounted
and fasten it as quickly as you can. It’s okay to leave the old lens “naked”
for a few seconds if you’re careful — you can always clean dust that set-
tles on it later. The goal is to get the old lens off and the new one attached
as quickly as possible.
Do a Google search for “sensor cleaning” to find extensive discussions on the
various ways of cleaning digital SLR sensors. You can use specially designed
bulb blowers to waft the dust off, certain types of soft brushes to remove
more firmly attached particles, and moist swabs to get the really stubborn
artifacts off. Don’t use general-purpose products intended for cleaning lenses

or your vehicle’s dashboard. Your Google quest will provide all the informa-
tion you need to do the job right. (I also include a long discussion of the
process in Digital SLR Cameras & Photography For Dummies.)
Going in crop factor circles
As I note earlier in this chapter, many digital SLR cameras use a sensor that
is smaller than the 35mm film frame. Even so, most vendors (Olympus is a
notable exception) rely heavily on lenses that were originally designed for
these full-frame film cameras. Although many digital-only lenses are being
introduced, there is still a momentum of thinking of optics in terms of the
24mm x 36mm format.
That means that if you cut your teeth on 35mm cameras, the apparent focal
lengths of your dSLR camera’s lenses are likely to seem “wrong” to you. The
smaller sensors cause the image to be cropped, so a 50mm “normal” lens
becomes a mild telephoto. A 105mm “portrait” lens that you used to take
head-and-shoulder shots with a film camera might not be such a good choice
for portraits anymore. (For one thing, you’ll have to take a few steps back-
ward to keep your subject within the frame.)
And, of course, your wide-angle lenses might not be so wide when cropped
by your sensor. This effect is sometimes called, inaccurately, a multiplication
factor or lens multiplier because the easiest way of representing the effect on
the camera’s field of view is by multiplying the focal length of the lens by the
factor. A 100mm lens “becomes” a 150mm lens with a camera that has a 1.5X
crop factor.
Of course, in truth, no multiplication is involved. That 100mm lens is still a
100mm lens and has the same depth-of-field. Your 180mm f/2.8 optic isn’t
magically transformed into an amazing 360mm f/2.8 super-telephoto. You
could get the same effect and look by shooting a picture on a full frame
camera and then cropping it down. That’s why the correct terminology for
this effect is crop factor. Common crop factors with today’s dSLRs are 1.3X,
1.5X, 1.6X, and 2X, as shown in Figure 1-5.
As a dSLR user, you need to become accustomed to thinking about this
factor as it really is — as a crop rather than multiplication factor. That will
help you better understand what is going on in your camera, although it
won’t eliminate all the confusion that results from trying to equate your
70mm to 200mm (actual focal length) lens with what it “really” is in dSLR
terms. The good news is that you’ll eventually get used to the crop factor
and begin thinking of 30mm as a “normal lens” focal range and a 50mm lens
as a “portrait” lens before you know it.

igital SLR cameras have many more controls, buttons, dials, and
options than their non-SLR counterparts. If you bought a dSLR because
you wanted to take control of your photography and gain access to cus-
tomization features that let you produce photos with the exact color rendi-
tion, sharpness, and focus you want, the additional layers of settings are 
a great thing. No other type of digital camera gives you access to so
many different shooting parameters that you can use to opti-
mize image quality or to manipulate your photos in cre-
ative ways.
Of course, if you bought your dSLR because you
wanted a big, impressive-looking camera to over-
whelm your friends with your photography
prowess, you have some studying ahead of you. If
they laugh when you sit down at the piano, they’ll
really be amused if you don’t know how to tickle
the keys and buttons of your shiny new dSLR!
One great thing about dSLRs is that you probably
won’t have to wade through menus to adjust many
settings. These cameras frequently have dedicated (or
multifunction) buttons for given types of settings, so all you
need to do is press the button and twist a dial or thumb a
cursor control. That’s much faster!
In this chapter, I explain some of the key controls you use with your dSLR,
and I revisit some of the exposure and focus topics covered in Book II,
Chapter 2, with an expanded emphasis on the more advanced things you
can do with a dSLR.

Exposure Controls
198
Exposure Controls
Point-and-shoot cameras don’t give you much input into adjusting exposure.
You point, you shoot. If you’re feeling daring, you look at the results on your
LCD and, if dissatisfied, rinse, lather, and repeat (or the photographic equiv-
alent). You have a dozen or two Scene modes that can adjust exposure and
some other settings based on the kind of picture you’re taking (for example,
Beach, Night Scene, or Portrait). You probably also have exposure value (EV)
settings that can increase or decrease the exposure a bit, and, if you own a
higher-end model, you might have aperture priority, shutter priority, and
manual exposure modes (which are all introduced in Book II, Chapter 1).
Now it’s time, as they say, for the rest of the story. As you’d expect, digital
SLRs have the same roster of exposure controls found in even the most
advanced non-SLR digital cameras (although a few dSLRs eschew the only
semi-useful Scene modes or trim their roster drastically). But dSLRs give you
a lot more to work with, too, because, while getting a good exposure is rela-
tively easy, getting the best exposure can be tricky. For dSLR owners who are
serious about photography, good is rarely good enough.
No digital camera (or film camera, for that matter) can capture every tone
available in a scene. Some detail in dark areas is lost because not enough
photons are captured by the sensor, and details in light areas vanish when
pixels in a sensor are flooded with more light than they can handle. The
range from the darkest detailed picture elements to the brightest is called
the dynamic range, and the goal of proper exposure is to make sure that the
most important tones in an image fall into that range.
Metering modes
All digital cameras have built-in number-crunching routines that let the
camera read the lightness and darkness values from a range of locations (or
matrix) in the scene and calculate the best compromise in terms of expo-
sure. The most advanced cameras, including dSLRs, let you choose how the
information is gathered and interpreted. So, your camera will offer a choice
of metering modes:
✦Matrix metering: This is usually the default mode. The camera collects
information from multiple locations in the scene, which can range from 
a dozen or so to more than 1,000 locations, as shown in Figure 2-1. The
camera’s programming can use this information to make some good
guesses about what kind of picture you’re shooting and set exposure
accordingly. For example, if the matrix system determines that the 
upper half of your image is light and the bottom half is dark, it may
decide that you’re shooting a landscape and will optimize exposure so
there will be detail in the foreground, allowing the sky to be a little too
light, if necessary.

199
Figure 2-1: Exposure info may be gathered from a few locations, or, as in this figure, from 
more than 1,000 invisible points arranged in a matrix.
✦Center-weighted metering: In this mode, the camera puts the most
emphasis on the information in the center of the scene, but takes into
account the illumination in the rest of the frame. This mode is a good
choice if you know your main subject will be in the middle of the frame,
but the other areas of the picture have some importance, too.
✦Spot metering: In spot mode, the camera derives its exposure setting
exclusively from an area in the center of the frame. This setting is a good
choice at, say, a concert, where you want to expose for the spot-lit per-
former and don’t want the inky dark surroundings to affect the settings.
Correcting exposure
Digital SLRs have an adjustment system called EV (exposure value) compen-
sation. (Other kinds of digital cameras often have EV settings, too, but they
are sometimes buried down in the menu system.) With dSLRs, this adjust-
ment is easy to apply: You simply press the EV button on your camera (usu-
ally it’s on the top panel) and use a command dial or left/right cursor key to
add more exposure (+EV) or reduce exposure (–EV) using 1/2 or 1/3-value
increments. (+0.5 EV would give 150 percent of the metered exposure, +1.0
EV would provide 200 percent, and so forth.)

Exposure Controls
200
You can determine whether to add or subtract EV by reviewing an image
you’ve just taken on the LCD or by reviewing a picture’s histogram, which
can be displayed on the LCD along with the image itself (you usually must
activate this option in a menu setting).
A histogram is a bar chart with 256 vertical bars spaced very closely together,
usually forming a curve that looks like a mountain, with a high peak in the
middle, trailing off to foothills at the left and right. All you really need to
know to use a histogram is that the left side of the chart represents the dark-
est tones in your image, the right side represents the lightest tones, and the
middle hump represents the tones in between.
Your goal is to produce a histogram in which the entire “mountain” is solidly
in the center of the chart, with none of the dark tones lost at the left side or
light tones at the right. If you look at a histogram of your most recent shot
carefully, you can learn to add a little exposure (+EV) when the dark tones
are cut off at the left side, or subtract a little (–EV) when the light tones are
cut off on the right side. (See Figure 2-2.)
Other exposure adjustments
You have several other options for changing your camera’s exposure setting:
✦Scene modes: Scene modes are the modes offered on many digital SLRs
that are similar to the scene options found in other digital cameras.
They set up your camera to use specific exposure options (for example,
long exposures for Night Scene or Night Portrait mode), set shutter
speed/aperture preferences for action in Sports mode, as well as adjust
parameters like color richness and sharpness.
✦Exposure Lock: The exposure settings are fixed when you press a spe-
cial exposure lock button or simply press the shutter release down
halfway. Such a lock gives you the freedom to set exposure and then
reframe the photo any way you like without worrying that the settings
will change. Using a separate button has an advantage because you
don’t have to keep your finger on the release button.
✦Bracketing: Bracketed pictures are a series of photos taken at a particu-
lar setting and then taken at a “plus” and “minus” setting. The plus/
minus can be more or less exposure or other factors, such as color satu-
ration, color balance, and flash exposure. Your camera might allow you
to bracket more than one of these settings and in the order you choose.
✦Shifting equivalent exposures: Most dSLRs allow you to choose equiva-
lent exposures without changing the actual amount of light that reaches
the sensor. For example, if the meter chooses 1/500 of a second at f/11,
you might be able to flip to 1/1000 of a second at f/8 (which is the same
effective exposure with a faster shutter speed for stopping action) or
1/250 of a second at f/16 (which is also equivalent, but would provide
more depth of field).

Shooting modes
Metering modes, which I describe earlier in this chapter, are the options 
for collecting exposure information and calculating an exposure. Shooting
modes tell your camera how to apply that information. I introduce the vari-
ous shooting modes in Book II, Chapter 2. Here’s a longer discussion of 
these modes, which are, after all, the exposure options most used by dSLR
owners:
✦Auto: Full auto mode handles all the settings for you, with (often) no
options for adjustment. This is the mode you use when you hand your
camera to a passerby and ask to have your picture taken. No fuss, no
muss, no options.
✦Programmed: Your dSLR uses its built-in smarts to analyze your scene
and come up with a recommended exposure. However, you can override
the camera’s selections with EV settings, equivalent exposure shifts, or
other tweaks.
✦Shutter priority: You choose the shutter speed, and the camera locks 
it in, which makes this a good choice for sports shots like the one 
shown in Figure 2-3. The autoexposure system keeps the shutter speed
you’ve chosen and varies only the aperture to achieve correct exposure.
You also see the selected aperture in the viewfinder so that you can
decide when, say, the f-stop is getting a little too large for comfort and
you want to accept a slower shutter speed to gain a smaller aperture.
Should light conditions change enough that your selected shutter 
speed won’t produce a correct exposure with the available f-stops,
you’re alerted with a LO or HI indicator in the viewfinder or, perhaps, 
a flashing LED.
✦Aperture priority: This mode lets you choose the f-stop, letting the
camera select the shutter speed needed for correct exposure. Perhaps
you want a small aperture to maximize depth of field or a large f-stop 
to minimize it. If you notice that the shutter speed is too slow or high,
you can adjust the f-stop you’ve dialed in to one that’s larger or smaller.
✦Manual exposure: Use manual exposure when you want to set both the
shutter speed and aperture yourself. Don’t worry! You’re not on your
own and forced to guesstimate exposure. You can still use your dSLR’s
metering system to determine the “correct” exposure and then set it
yourself — or set some other exposure entirely for a special effect.
Manual exposure is also a good choice if you’re using a non-automatic
flash unit or an older lens that doesn’t allow automatic exposure with
your camera.

Figure 2-3: Shutter priority lets you lock in a high shutter speed to freeze action.
Focus Controls
Correct focus is important because, although you can often at least partially
correct for bad exposure after a shot is taken, there isn’t a lot you can do
when your picture is blurred beyond recognition. Point-and-shooters actu-
ally have less of a problem with correct focus (in one way) than dSLR users
do because the short focal length lenses on cheaper cameras render almost
everything in sharp focus. Of course, that makes using selective focus (cre-
atively placing parts of an image out of focus to emphasize other portions)
more difficult, but you win some and lose some.
Digital SLRs give you back selective focus, while making it more critical to
focus correctly. Fortunately, you have two ways to focus — manual focus 
and autofocus. Manual focus is accomplished by twisting a focus ring on the
lens until the image looks sharp in your viewfinder. (Some cameras provide 
a viewfinder signal when you have focused correctly manually.) Automatic
focus achieves the same results but with the camera deciding when the
image is sharply focused. In both cases, the apparent contrast between your
subject and its (relatively) blurry surroundings is used to determine that
focus point.

Focus Controls
204
Manual focus can be difficult when you’re shooting moving objects (think
sports) or are in a hurry for any reason. Our brains have a poor memory for
sharpness, so it takes awhile for us to decide that the current setting is, in fact,
sharper than the image we saw just a fraction of a second ago. The camera’s
autofocus mechanism has no problem comparing relative sharpness and can
zero in on the right focus point very quickly — assuming the camera actually
knows what object you want to be in sharp focus in the first place.
So, manual focus can be your best choice when you want to focus on a partic-
ular object that might be difficult for the autofocus system to lock in on
because, say, it’s surrounded by similar-looking objects or confusing back-
grounds, or you want to isolate a particular subject, like the one in Figure 2-4.
Figure 2-4: Manual focus is a good choice when you want to focus on a particular object
precisely.
Automatic focus can work for you the rest of the time, particularly when 
you can use your dSLR’s ability to choose which of several different focus
zones to use. Most dSLRs have five to nine (or more) focus sensors grouped
around the viewfinder screen. You can tell the camera how to use those
zones or manually select a zone yourself. It’s also possible to tell the camera
when to lock in focus by using one of two common focus modes:

Book III
Chapter 2

SLR Controls

205
✦Continuous autofocus: When you press the shutter release halfway, the
camera sets the focus but continues to look for movement within the
frame. If the camera detects motion, the lens refocuses on the new posi-
tion. Use this option for action photography or other subjects that are
likely to be in motion.
✦Single autofocus: Press the shutter release halfway, and focus is set. It
remains at that setting until you take the photo or release the button.
This mode is best suited for subject matter that isn’t likely to move after
it has been brought into sharp focus, and for reframing a subject slightly
without having the camera change the focus.
Other Controls
Your digital SLR has other controls that may be less-used with other kinds of
digital cameras or that are more important to dSLR owners who want opti-
mal results. These controls include:
✦White balance fine-tuning: Digital SLRs let you fine-tune white balance
(color balance) much more precisely. Instead of simply choosing a white
balance from among a half-dozen preset values, you can often set the
white balance based on an existing photograph, choose a specific color
temperature, tweak white balance slightly toward blue or red, and meas-
ure actual white balance from a neutral surface such as a white wall or
gray card.
✦ISO settings: Digital SLRs usually let you set sensitivity in much finer
increments and to much more sensitive levels (say ISO 1600 or ISO 3200)
than other types of digital cameras.
✦Image compression: Digital SLRs almost always allow you to choose
from several different levels of “squeezing” for JPEG image files, so you
can select from large files with optimum quality and smaller files that
may lose a little quality during the squishing process.
✦Camera functions: You’ll find that digital SLRs are customizable in the
way the controls operate, and you might even be able to adjust what cer-
tain buttons do. You can tailor how long your LCD remains on after pic-
ture display and how many seconds of display your self-timer provides.
You can also assign certain functions to particular buttons or even dic-
tate how large the spot focus circle in the center of the viewfinder is.
While some non-SLR cameras may also offer some of these customiza-
tion controls, few have the extensive range found in dSLR cameras.

A
ll digital cameras have lenses, of course. Digital SLR owners just have
more of them to choose from. The ability to change lenses is one of the
top advantages of the digital single-lens reflex camera, especially for those
who want to go longer, wider, deeper, or closer or want to shoot in less light.
If the lens currently mounted on your camera doesn’t do what you want,
just remove it and replace it with one that does (assuming you have the
funds to afford your dream optics).
You can find a basic discussion of lenses as they apply to all digi-
tal cameras in Book II, Chapter 1. This chapter concentrates
on the special things you can do with the interchange-
able lenses available for dSLRs.
Optical Allusions
You’ll find references to a disease called “lens
lust” all over the Internet. It’s that strange malady
that strikes dSLR owners when they discover just
how much more they could do if they just had this
or that particular lens.
Unfortunately, no single lens can do every job, although
a few come close. Several vendors offer an 18mm to 200mm
zoom lens (one of them, shown in Figure 3-1, with camera-
shake-nullifying vibration reduction built in) that covers most of the
focal lengths you need for everyday shooting. But even that lens won’t give
you ultra-wide-angle shots or superzoom perspectives, and it won’t operate
well at light levels that call for a large maximum aperture (say, f/2 or f/1.4).
So choosing the right lens is important when you want the best lens for a par-
ticular job. Here are some of the things that the “right” lens can do for you:

Optical Allusions
208

(left) and a less expensive 18–70mm lens furnished with several 
digital SLRs as basic equipment.
✦Shoot in low light. The basic zooms furnished with most digital SLRs have
maximum apertures of f/3.5 to f/4.5, which is much too “slow” to be useful
in low light levels. You can choose other zooms with f/2.8 maximum aper-
tures (although they tend to be expensive) or select a fixed focal length
lens with an f/1.4 to f/2.0. Some of these, such as the 50mm f/1.8 lenses
offered for most cameras, can be very cheap — $100 or less. But if you’re
able to spend a little more, you can buy 28mm, 30mm, 35mm, 50mm, or
85mm f/1.4 lenses that can shoot under very dark conditions. They’ll be
optimized to produce pretty good results wide open, too.
✦Shoot sharper. You can often get better results with a special lens that
was designed to produce sharper images rather than to do everything
passably well. That 50mm f/1.8 lens you pick up for less than $100 just
might be the sharpest lens you own. Or, you might buy a close-up lens
that’s optimized for macro photography and produces especially sharp
images at distances of a few inches or so.
✦Shoot wider. Wide-angle lenses let you take in a broader field of view,
which can be useful when there isn’t room to move farther away from
your subject. The lens that came with your camera probably has a field
of view no wider than that of a 28mm lens on a full-frame film SLR. You
can get a wider look from lenses designed to provide that extra-broad
perspective with a dSLR.
✦Shoot farther. Telephoto lenses let you bring distant objects that much
closer to your camera, as you can see in Figure 3-2. The lens that came
with your camera probably provides only a moderate telephoto effect,
perhaps around 70mm, which, with a 1.5 crop factor, is the equivalent of

Book III
Chapter 3
Working with
Lenses

a 105mm short telephoto on a full-frame 35mm film camera. Longer
lenses are easy to find, are fairly affordable, and are fun to use when you
want to reach out and almost touch something.
Figure 3-2: A wide-angle lens provides a broader view (top), while a telephoto lens 
takes you up close to your subject (bottom). 

Primes or Zooms
210
✦Shoot closer. An interchangeable lens you buy may be able to focus on
subjects a lot closer to the lens, giving you valuable close-up or macro
capabilities. Macro photography is literally a whole new world, encom-
passing subjects that you couldn’t capture before (such as small animals
or insects), as well as new ultra-close looks at familiar objects.
Primes or Zooms
Digital SLRs can use one of two basic kinds of lenses: prime lenses and zooms.
Prime lenses are fixed focal length lenses, the kind that were the mainstay of
photographers 20 or 30 years ago, before zooms (variable focal length lenses)
became as sophisticated as they are today. Because prime lenses were the
best, sharpest, and fastest optics available, it was even common for photogra-
phers to carry around two or three camera bodies, each with a different lens,
to avoid having to swap lenses.
Today, zoom lenses are sharper, faster, and more practical for all-around use,
but they still lag a bit behind their prime lens cousins. Your own lens kit will
probably end up containing a few of each type, each suitable for a different
kind of photography.
Pros for primes
Primes have their advantages. For example, if you shoot architecture, you
might want a fast wide-angle lens to let you shoot interiors without a tripod
or capture images from unusual angles with less lens distortion, as shown in
Figure 3-3. Sports photographers might want a similar wide-angle lens, for
indoor sports like basketball, mated with a fast telephoto prime lens for
night football or baseball under the lights. If you plan on shooting portraits
destined for display on the wall, you’ll want a sharp, short telephoto lens.
Prime lenses with close-focusing capabilities are great for macro work. 
Wide-angle prime lenses produce results that are sharp enough to enlarge 
to 20 x 30 inches for display as home décor.
The main drawbacks of using prime lenses is that you must buy a bunch of
different lenses to cover a range of focal lengths — plus you must be willing
to swap lenses whenever you need to shoot something that doesn’t suit the
lens currently mounted on the camera. Digital SLR owners can be leery of
changing lenses often, especially when working in dusty environments,
because of the danger of getting dust on the sensor.
Prose for zooms
There’s a lot to like about zoom lenses, too. They are convenient and flexi-
ble, allowing you to shoot several different magnifications without moving,
so you can frame your photo carefully and precisely right in the camera.

Book III
Chapter 3

Lenses
Primes or Zooms
211
That’s important when you don’t want to waste valuable pixels by cropping
later in an image editor.
Zooms come in several types. There are wide-angle zooms with focal lengths
like 10–20mm or 12–24mm. Depending on the crop factor of your camera,
these offer the equivalent of 15–30mm to 18–36mm lenses on a full-frame film
or digital camera. Because of the distorted looks that these super-wides can
sometimes provide, they are often relegated to special situations that truly
require an ultra-wide perspective.
Figure 3-3: Wide-angle prime lenses let you capture photos 
from unusual angles.

Special Features
212
Mid-range zooms are more general-purpose. These have ranges that start at
17 to 18mm and extend out to 55 to 70mm at the telephoto end. They’re usu-
ally much less expensive than other types of zooms and may be furnished
with your camera at an incremental cost of only $100 or so above the cost of
the camera body alone. Expect the maximum aperture to shift as you zoom
out; such a zoom may offer an f/3.5 opening at the wide-angle end, but only
f/4.5 in the telephoto range.
Short telephoto to telephoto zooms sacrifice the wide-angle end of the range
to give you a telephoto reach that may extend to 200mm or 300mm. Several
popular lenses go from 28mm to 200 or 300mm. The affordable models suffer
from the same limited maximum aperture as the mid-range zooms.
Telephoto zoom lenses cover only a telephoto range and tend to extend to
much longer focal lengths. One of my favorite lenses is a 170 to 500mm zoom
(although the same vendor also offers a very good 50 to 500mm version that
is highly prized but much more expensive). Other popular telephoto zooms
have ranges like 200–400mm. As with all very long lenses, you’d be crazy to
use one of these without a tripod or other sturdy support.
Macro zooms are a specialized kind of zoom lens, usually in the medium 
telephoto range (from about 100mm to 200mm), that can focus especially
close. You’ll find these lenses useful outdoors for shooting small animals and
insects that must be photographed from a few feet away but that require
extra-close focusing. As your critter flits or hops around, you can follow him
with your macro zoom while still remaining far enough away to keep him
from becoming skittish. The same lens will work with non-moving objects
like flowers, too.
Special Features
Some lenses have special features that let them do things that other types of
lenses cannot do. Here’s a summary of some of those capabilities that are
common (or uncommon) among add-on lenses:
✦Image stabilization: Referred to variously as image stabilization (by Canon
and some other vendors . . . and me), vibration reduction (by Nikon and
allied companies), anti-shake, optical image stabilization, and other names,
this feature operates by shifting lens elements around to nullify the
shakiness that can result when the camera or photographer wobbles
during exposure. Image stabilization can give you the equivalent of two
to three shutter-speed increments more steadiness, so you can shoot at
1/30 of a second instead of 1/250 of a second, or, with a long telephoto,
1/250 of a second instead of 1/2000 of a second. Image stabilization does
not counteract a moving subject and may actually slow down your
camera a little when shooting sports. You’ll still need a fast shutter
speed for that kind of work.

213
✦Perspective control: These highly specialized and expensive lenses shift
the lens elements from side to side and up and down to improve the per-
spective when photographing buildings or other subjects that converge in
the distance, reducing that “falling backward” look, as shown in Figure 3-4.
Figure 3-4: Perspective control lenses compensate for distortion from tilting the camera up 
to take in the top of a building.

Special Features
214
✦Close focus: I’ve already described the close focusing capabilities of
macro lenses. These lenses also offer improved sharpness and may
include extra-small apertures (such as f/32 or f/45) to give you extra
depth-of-field.
✦Focus control: Some very specialized lenses lend themselves to portrait
work by letting you adjust how the out-of-focus background appears in
photographs in which single subjects are centered in the frame, such as
portraits. The effects you get with focus control lenses are unlike those
available with any other type of lens.

andom snapshooting can sometimes yield lucky shots —
happy accidents that look good and prompt you 
to say, “Actually, I meant to do that” (even if it wasn’t
the case). Some Pulitzer Prize–winning photos have
resulted from a photographer instinctively squeez-
ing off a shot at what turned out to be a decisive
moment in some fast-breaking news event.
However, lacking a Pulitzer-winner’s intuition,
most photographers end up with a larger percent-
age of pleasing photos when they stop to think
about and plan their pictures before putting the
viewfinder up to their eyes.
In this chapter, I tell you about the essentials of photo
composition that set you on the road to taking great pic-
tures. I introduce all the basic elements of good composi-
tion, such as selecting what to include in and what to leave out
of a well-designed photograph. You find out some basic rules, such as
the Rule of Thirds, and most importantly, when you should ignore these
rules in order to get a dramatic effect.

Photo Composition: The Big Picture
218
Photo Composition: The Big Picture
One difference between good photojournalists and superior photojournalists
is the ability to take a newsworthy picture quickly when circumstances don’t
allow much time for preparation or thought. If you examine the work of these
professionals, you find that even their impromptu “grab” shots are well-
composed. With scarcely an instant’s notice, they can line up and shoot a
picture that commands your attention.
The very best photos are usually not accidents; they are carefully planned
and composed. That is, such pictures display good composition, which is 
the careful selection and arrangement of the photo’s subject matter within 
a frame. I’m not suggesting you set up your camera on a tripod and wait
hours — à la Ansel Adams — in anticipation of the universe settling into
exactly the right arrangement. Instead, simply understanding how good 
composition works and keeping that in mind when you plan your photos can
make a world of difference. The following list gives you an overview of how
to plan and execute good photo composition:
✦Visualizing a concept for your picture: It’s important to know what you
want your picture to say and who your audience is.
✦Choosing your subject matter: This isn’t as easy as it appears to be. A pic-
ture might be filled with interesting things to look at, but you must select
which one should be the subject of the picture.
✦Deciding on a center of interest: One point in the picture should natu-
rally draw the eye as a starting place for the viewer’s exploration of the
rest of the image. With a center of interest, the photo becomes focused
and not simply a collection of objects.
✦Picking the picture orientation: Some subjects look best when shown 
in a tall, vertically oriented frame. Some look best in a wide, horizontal
format. A few need a square composition. To make the most of your
camera’s resolution, choose an orientation when you take the photo
rather than cropping it later in an image editor.
✦Establishing the distance and point of view: These elements affect your
photo’s composition and are sometimes difficult to control. For example,
when you’re attending that World Series game, you can’t easily substi-
tute your upper-deck seats for a choice position next to the dugout
(although it’s worth a try).
✦Planning for action: If your subjects are moving, you need to anticipate
where they will be and how they will be arranged when you take the 
picture.
✦Working with the background: Objects and textures in the background
can work for you or against you. The area behind your main subject is
an important part of the composition.

219
✦Arranging all within the frame: How you accomplish arranging within
the frame depends on the situation. In some situations, such as at sports
events, you can’t dictate how the subjects are arranged. For example, no
matter how much you want an action shot of Ichiro Suzuki, the Seattle
Mariners’ star isn’t likely to relocate to center field to accommodate
your photo.
✦Directing the eye within the frame: Use lines and curves to provide 
a guided tour of your image, directing the viewer from one portion to
another to finally focus on the main center of interest. Balance the 
composition to keep the eye from wandering to “lopsided” parts of the
image.
Although these guidelines for composition can help you, remember that they
are only guidelines. Your instincts and creative sense will tell you when it’s a
good time to break those rules, grind them up into tiny pieces, and stomp
them under your feet in your quest for an unusual, eye-catching picture. If you
examine Picasso’s earliest art, you’ll see that he knew how to paint in the
classical style. His legacy is based on knowing when not to paint according
to the time-honored rules.
Visualizing a Concept for Your Picture
Take some time to visualize your photo before you begin the actual picture-
taking process. You don’t need to spend hours dwelling over your photo, 
but you need to have at least a general plan in mind before you shoot. The
following sections ask — and then answer — the questions that lead you
through the process of visualizing a concept for a picture.
What do you want your image to say?
Will your photo be a portrait, a sports action shot, or a scenic masterpiece?
The kind of picture you want to take can affect the composition. For exam-
ple, portraits of teenagers frequently include props (from skateboards to
pigskins) that reflect their lifestyles. For a sports picture, you might want to
get a high angle or one from a particular location to include the field of play
or other elements that say, “Action!”
A scenic photo can be composed in different ways, depending on what you
want the image to say. For example, a photo taken in a national park can pic-
ture the grandeur of nature with a dramatic skyline with purple mountains’
majesty and amber waves of grain. On the other hand, you might be tempted
to make a statement about the environmental impact of humans by focusing
on trash left behind by careless visitors or perhaps desiccated amber moun-
tain majesties and chemically tainted waves of purple grain.

Visualizing a Concept for Your Picture
220
Some of the best photographs use composition to take a stand or say some-
thing beyond the photo itself. Figure 1-1 is an example of a photo that makes
a subtle statement, juxtaposing the idyllic academic setting of Kent State
University in Ohio today with a stark memorial that shows where the body
of a slain student fell. In one sense, it’s a less graphic version of those chalk
outlines you see on police shows, but it’s just as effective as a reminder of a
place where a human died.
Figure 1-1: A memorial to a slain student stands out against the peaceful, tree-lined 
campus in the background.
Where will the image be used?
How the photo will be used can affect composition. If you plan to print the
picture in a publication or enlarge it for display in a frame, you want a tight
composition to maximize sharpness. If you want to use the shot on a Web
page, you might want to step back to take in a little extra and crop later with
your image editor because the resolution lost from cropping pixels isn’t as
critical for Web graphics.

Tools and
Techniques of
Composition
Selecting a Subject and a Center of Interest
221
Whom are you creating the image for?
You compose a photo for your family differently from a photo that your col-
leagues or strangers will view. Your family might like a picture better if the
composition revolves around that cute new baby. Create a photo that says,
“I’ve been to Paris,” and you’ll want to include the Eiffel Tower somewhere 
in the picture so your family and friends will know where you’ve been.
Colleagues might want to see a product highlighted or the CEO shown in a
decisive pose. Subject matter that’s extraneous for one audience could be
important for another.
Selecting a Subject and a Center of Interest
Photographs shouldn’t send the person looking at them on a hunting expedi-
tion. As interesting as your subject is to you, you don’t want viewers puzzling
over what’s the most important part of the image or perhaps conducting a
vote by secret ballot to see who has successfully guessed your intent. Every
picture should have a single, strong center of interest. You want to narrow
down your subject matter: Rather than include everything of interest in a
photo, choose one main subject. Then find secondary objects in the picture
that are also interesting (giving the photo depth and richness) but that are 
still clearly subordinate to the main subject.
Narrowing down your subject matter
Narrowing your subject matter means eliminating everything from your
photo that doesn’t belong there and concentrating on fewer objects that
can form an interesting composition.
Find something in the photograph that the viewer’s eye should focus on,
thus forming a center of interest. Your center of interest is usually a person,
a group, or the object you’re seeking to highlight. You don’t want eyes roam-
ing around your photo searching for something to look at. Some aspect
should jump out and grab your viewers’ attention. If other portions of the
photo compete for attention, look for ways to eliminate or minimize them.
For example, you can crop more tightly, move to one side or change your
angle, ask the extraneous person to leave (your brother-in-law is a good guy;
he’ll understand), or physically move something to omit it from your compo-
sition. Figure 1-2 shows photos of the same goose taken from the same dis-
tance, but with a clear center of interest in the second shot.
One good technique when shooting groups is to plan several photographs,
each using a different part of the subject matter in view. That way, each person
or object can take a turn at being the center of interest, and you won’t be look-
ing for ways to reduce the competition among them.

Selecting a Subject and a Center of Interest
222
Figure 1-2: To avoid spoiling a shot with secondary geese in the background (left), wait 
until they move on (right) for a better composition.
Choosing one main subject
You can use several compositional techniques to ensure that the main sub-
ject you’ve selected is, in fact, the center of interest. Here’s a quick checklist
to follow:
✦Make sure that your center of interest is the most prominent object in
the picture. You might think of Aunt Mary as a worthy photo subject,
but if she’s standing next to a ’60s-era minibus with a psychedelic paint
job, she might not even be noticed. Large, distinctive, highly unusual, or
controversial objects are likely to take on a life of their own and seize
the focus of attention in your photograph.
✦See that the center of interest is either the brightest object in the photo
or at least is not overpowered by a brighter object. Gaudy colors or
bright shapes in the background distract viewers from your main subject.
Some elements — such as spotlights at a rock concert or a reflection of
the sun on water — become part of the environment and aren’t necessar-
ily distracting. Other parts of a photo — such as a bright sail on a boat or
a white automobile located behind your subject — can interfere with your
carefully planned composition. Eliminate such objects, move them behind
something, or otherwise minimize their impact.

Chapter 1

Techniques of
Composition
Selecting a Subject and a Center of Interest
223
✦Make sure that your composition has only one center of interest.
Other things in a photo can be interesting, but they must clearly be 
subsidiary to the main center of interest. A child seated on the floor
playing with a puppy would be interesting. However, other puppies in
the photo should be watching or vying for the child’s interest, not off
somewhere else in the photo engaged in some distracting activity.
Figure 1-3 shows a photo of some flowers that is colorful, but there’s no
real center of interest anywhere in the photo, although the clump of
blossoms at right do attract the eye in its frantic search for something
to focus on.
✦Avoid always placing the center of interest in the exact center of the
photograph. There are many occasions when it’s okay to center your
subject, such as for close-ups or portraits. But most of the time, you
want to move the important subject to either side and a little toward
the top or bottom of the frame. Don’t take “center” literally in all
cases. Refer to Figure 1-2, shown previously, for an example of a center
of interest moved to one side but still somewhat centrally located.
I explain how to locate your center in interesting spots later in this 
chapter.
Figure 1-3: This is a bad photo because it has no true center of interest.

Choosing an Orientation
224
Using secondary subjects
Having more than one center of interest is confusing. If you really have several
things of importance in a single picture, consider taking several separate
photos of each and using them to tell a story. Or, group them together to
form a single, new center of interest.
However, you can easily include (and should, in many cases) secondary
points of interest that give the photograph depth and richness. A portrait of
a child should concentrate on the child’s face, but a favorite toy can speak
volumes about what this youngster likes to do. A rock singer on stage can
command your attention, but a view showing the adoring fans in the front
row tells the viewer how popular the performer is. (Conversely, having a
scant few bored spectators as a secondary subject can make another state-
ment, turning the picture into a bit of visual irony.)
Successful secondary subjects are clearly subordinate to your main center
of interest. You can indicate what’s secondary in your image through loca-
tion, brightness, or even degree of sharpness. (Hint: A bit of image editing
can help you after the fact.)
Choosing an Orientation
The orientation of a photo — whether it’s a wide or tall picture — affects how
you look at the image. When you see a landscape-oriented photo, you tend
to think of panoramas and horizontal sprawl. A vertically oriented photo, on
the other hand, provides expectations of height. Most subjects fit into one of
these orientations; very few photos are actually composed within a perfectly
square frame. Square photos are often static and uninteresting and are usu-
ally put to work only with subject matter that suits them, such as circular
objects or images that have important horizontal and vertical components.
Digital cameras, like most of their conventional, film-camera brethren, are
built with a horizontal layout because that configuration is best suited for
holding in two hands held side by side. Indeed, the default orientation for
digital cameras is so much easier to use that some digital SLRs have either a
built in or optional vertical grip that makes it easier to hold the camera and
trip the shutter when the camera is rotated 90 degrees.
Because of this bias, many photographers unconsciously slip into the trap of
viewing every potential photo in a horizontal mode. They turn the camera
only when confronted by subject matter that simply can’t be photographed
in any other way, such as the Eiffel Tower, a rocket headed skyward, or any
NBA all-star.

Here are some tips that will help you decide when it’s appropriate to use a
vertical composition — and when you should think horizontal instead.
✦If you’re taking pictures for a slide show or for a computer presenta-
tion, stick with horizontal pictures. Slide show images are seen sequen-
tially and should all have the same basic frame that is often sized to fill
up the horizontal screen as much as possible. Inserting a vertical picture
might mean that the top and bottom of your photograph is cut off or
appears odd on-screen.
You can still have a vertically composed picture in your slide show; just
mask off the right and left sides in your image editor to produce a verti-
cal image within the fixed-size horizontal frame. The key is to make your
vertical image no taller than the short dimension (height) of a horizontal
picture in the same show.
✦If your subject has dominant horizontal lines, use a horizontally com-
posed image. Landscapes and seascapes with a prominent horizon,
photos of sprawling buildings or bridges (like the one shown in Figure 1-4),
many sports photos focusing on more than one team member, and the
majority of four-legged animal pictures look their best in horizontal mode.
Figure 1-4: Some images look best in a horizontal orientation.
✦If your subject has strong vertical lines, use a vertical composition.
The Eiffel Tower, trees, tall buildings, pictures of individuals (whether

Choosing an Orientation
226
full-length or portrait photos), and similar compositions all call for a 
vertical orientation, as shown in Figure 1-5, which shows a massive
blown glass sculpture.
Figure 1-5: Vertical pictures are also appropriate for showing 
height or vertical movement.
✦Use a square composition if vertical and horizontal objects in your
picture are equally important and you don’t want to emphasize one
over the other. A building that is wide but that has a tall tower at one
end might look good in a square composition. The important vertical
element at one end would keep the image from being too static. Circular
images lend themselves to square compositions because the round form
fits comfortably inside a square “frame,” as shown in Figure 1-6.

Arranging Your Subjects
227
Figure 1-6: Some compositions look best when presented 
within a square.
Arranging Your Subjects
A basic skill in composing great images is finding interesting arrangements
within the frame for your subject matter. You need to position your subjects,
make sure they’re facing an appropriate way, and ensure that they are well-
placed in relation to the horizon and other elements of your image. Your first
consideration when arranging your subject is to choose the subject’s dis-
tance from the camera.
Choosing subject distance
Choosing your distance from the subject to provide the desired point of view
is one of the first things to do, but it’s not something you do once and then
forget about. While you take pictures, constantly examine your distance from
the subject and move closer or farther away if adjusting your position will
improve the composition. Here’s how to choose a subject distance:
✦To convey a feeling of space and depth, use a wide-angle lens, or, if
your back is not already up against a wall, move back. Standing back
from your subject does several things. The foreground area becomes

Arranging Your Subjects
228
more prominent, adding to the feeling of space. You also take in more of
the sky and other surrounding area, giving additional depth.
✦Make sure that your subjects don’t appear too small when you’re
moving back; they should still be large enough to be interesting.
Moving too far back is the most common mistake amateur photogra-
phers make, as shown in Figure 1-7. If you’re showing wide-open spaces
in your picture, be certain that it’s because you want to.
✦For photos that emphasize a person, group of people, or a particular
object, move in as close as you can. A close-up viewpoint adds intimacy
and shows details and textures of a subject that can’t be seen at greater
distances, as shown in Figure 1-8. A short telephoto setting is often the
best route to getting closer; with a normal or wide-angle lens, you can
get some apparent distortion of objects that are very close. With kids or
animals, you should not only get close, but also get down to their level
and shoot eye-to-eye.

Figure 1-8: Some kinds of backgrounds can be found in nature, 
but avoid the cluttered background in this shot.
✦Move so you fill the frame completely with interesting things. Whether
you’re shooting close up to your subject or at a distance, your composi-
tion should not include anything that isn’t needed to make the picture.
Full frames mean less enlargement and sharper pictures, too!
Optimizing backgrounds
Unless you’re taking a picture in the dead of night or on a featureless sand
dune or snow field, you’ll have some sort of background to contend with.
A background can be a plus or a minus depending on how you use it in your
composition. Here are some tips for making the most of your background:
✦Check your background to make sure that it’s not gaudy, brightly col-
ored, or busy. The background should not be more interesting than the
subject, nor should it be a distraction.
✦For portraits, a plain background (such as a seamless backdrop) can
be effective. A plain, featureless background can work for portraits as
long is it isn’t totally bland. Notice how professional photographers who
pose subjects against a seamless background still use lights to create an
interesting gradient or series of shadows in the background.
✦Outdoors, trees, grass, cloud-studded skies, plain walls, and other tex-
tured surfaces can make good backgrounds. Such backgrounds are
interesting without overpowering your subject (refer to Figure 1-8).

The Rule of Thirds
230
✦Watch for strong lines or shapes in the background that don’t lead the
eye to your subject. Straight or curved lines are good for compositions
but not if they distract the viewer from your subject. Also watch out for
things in the background that seem to grow out of your subjects or the
borders of the image. (These are called mergers, discussed later in this
chapter.)
✦Consider using depth of field (the amount of the image that’s in sharp
focus) to make your background blurry. Figure 1-8 uses this technique
to make the foliage background less distracting.
Because of how their lenses are designed, consumer digital cameras often
show everything in sharp focus. Workarounds include using longer lens zoom
settings and wider lens openings. You find out exactly what these are and
more in Book IV, Chapter 2.
The Rule of Thirds
The position of your subject matter within a picture is one of the most
important decisions you make. Whether you can move the subject or objects
around, change your position, or wait until everything moves to the right spot,
you should constantly be aware of how your subject matter is arranged.
Photographers often consciously or unconsciously follow a guideline called
the Rule of Thirds. It’s simply a way of dividing your picture horizontally and
vertically into thirds (see Figure 1-9). The best place to position important
subject matter is often at one of the points located one-third of the way from
the top or bottom and sides of the frame.
Placing important objects at 
imaginary junction points
Follow these steps to compose your pictures effectively using the Rule of
Thirds:
1. Divide the frame into thirds horizontally and vertically.
Above all, you want to avoid having your subject matter centered. By
imagining the frame in thirds, you automatically begin thinking of those
ideal, off-center positions.
2. Try to have important objects, particularly your center of interest,
at one of the four intersections of the imaginary lines that divide the
picture (refer to Figure 1-9).
3. Avoid having objects at the edge of a picture unless the part that isn’t
shown isn’t important.

The Rule of Thirds
231
Figure 1-9: To divide your image into thirds, picture the imaginary lines shown on this image.
If you’re taking a picture of a group of people, cropping out part of the build-
ing they’re standing next to or trimming off half a tree that’s not an important
part of the composition is okay. But don’t cut off heads!
When to break the Rule of Thirds
Sometimes, you want to break the Rule of Thirds. There are almost as many
exceptions to the rule as there are good reasons to apply it, which is why the
rule should be considered only a guideline. Think of the Rule of Thirds as a
lane marker on a highway. Sometimes you want to stay within the markers;
other times, like when you see an obstruction in the road, you want to wander
outside the lines. (If you happen to move from the United States to the
United Kingdom, you’ll find that it’s wise to swap sides and use the lane
markers on the opposite side of the road.)
You might want to ignore this handy rule when
✦Your main subject matter is too large to fit comfortably at one of the
imaginary intersection points. You might find that positioning an object

Incorporating Direction and Movement
232
at the “correct” location crops it at the top, bottom, or side. Move it a bit
to another point in your composition if you need to see the whole thing.
✦Centering the image would help illustrate a concept. Perhaps you want
to show your subject surrounded on all sides by adversity or by a
threatening environment. Placing the subject at one of the intersection
points implies motion or direction, as if the subject were about to flee
the picture entirely. However, putting the center of interest in the very
center of the picture gives the subject nowhere to hide.
✦You want to show symmetry. Centering a symmetrically oriented sub-
ject that’s located in a symmetrically oriented background can produce
a harmonious, geometric pattern that is pleasing, even if it is a bit static.
If the subject itself makes you think of motion, a square image can even
boast a bit of “movement,” as shown in Figure 1-10.
Figure 1-10: Sometimes a square picture can have an 
interesting geometrical arrangement.

universe outside the frame. Here’s how to orient people and other objects in
a picture:
✦If your subjects are people, animals, statues, or anything that you
think of as having a front end and back end, make sure they are either
facing the camera or facing into the frame rather than out of it.
If a person seems to be looking out of a picture, rather than somewhere
within it, viewers will spend more time wondering what the person is
looking at than examining the actual person. The human doesn’t actually
have to be looking at any object in particular as long as they are looking
somewhere within the picture.
✦If objects in the frame are moving or pointed in a particular direction,
make sure they are heading into the frame rather than out of it.
A stationary automobile, a windmill, a palm-tree bent over by a strong
wind, anything with a sense of direction to it should be facing into the
frame for the same reason that a person should be looking into it, as
shown in Figure 1-11.
Figure 1-11: Here the subject is headed into the frame, even if the ball is on its way out.

Using Straight Lines and Curves
234
✦Add extra space in front of any fast-moving object (such as a race car)
so that the object has somewhere to go while remaining in the frame.
If an object is moving, having a little more space in the frame in front of
it is best so that the viewer doesn’t get the impression that it’s on its
way out of view. In Figure 1-11, for example, you wouldn’t want to crop
the image any more tightly on the left because you’d need to leave room
for the speeding ball.
Using Straight Lines and Curves
After you have the basics out of the way, progressing to the next level and
creating even better compositions is easy. All you need to know is when to
apply or break some simple rules. Just remember that one of the key ele-
ments of good composition is a bit of surprise. Viewers like to see subjects
arranged in interesting ways rather than lined up in a row.
Lines within your image can help your compositions by directing the eye
toward the center of interest. The lines don’t have to be explicit; subtle
shapes can work just as well. Try these techniques:
✦Look for straight lines in your image and try to use them to lead the
eye to the main subject area.
Some lines are obvious, such as fences or a seashore leading off into
the distance. These kinds of lines are good when you want a dramatic
composition, like the one in Figure 1-12, which includes multiple sets of
horizontal and vertical lines.
✦Find diagonal lines to direct the attention to the center of interest.
Diagonal lines are better than straight lines, which are static and not
particularly interesting.
✦Use repetitive lines to create an interesting pattern.
Repetitive lines could be multiple lines within a single object, such as the
grout lines in a brick wall. Repetitive lines could also be several different
parallel or converging objects, such as a road’s edges, the centerline of the
road, and the fence that runs along the road. Strong repetitive lines can
become a pleasing composition in themselves, like the ones in Figure 1-12.
✦Curved lines, which are more graceful than straight lines, can lead
the viewer gently from one portion of the composition to another.
Curving roads are a good example of arcs and bends that can contribute
to a composition. Other graceful curves include body parts of living
things, such as the necks of flamingos, as shown in Figure 1-13.

235
Figure 1-12: Straight lines can lead the eye to the main subject area.
✦Look for shapes within your composition to add interest.
Three objects arranged in a triangle make a picture inherently more
interesting than if the objects form a square shape. Your eye naturally
follows the lines of the triangle toward each of the three points, or
apexes, whereas squares or rectangles don’t point anywhere. Instead of
posing groups of people in rows and columns, stack them in interesting
arrangements that make shapes the viewer’s eye can explore. Figure 1-13
uses two flamingos to create an interesting set of repeating curved shapes
that almost form a heart.

Balancing an Image
236
Figure 1-13: Curved lines form graceful, more harmonious pointers for the eyes.
Balancing an Image
If you place every element of interest in a photograph on one side or
another, leaving little or nothing to look at on the opposite side, the picture
is unbalanced, like a seesaw with a child at one end and no one on the other.
The best pictures have an inherent balance that makes them look graceful.
To balance your image, arrange objects so that anything large on one side is
balanced by something of importance on the other side. This is not the same
as having multiple centers of interest. A group of people arrayed on one side
need only be balanced out by having a tree or building on the other. Or a
chess piece Queen can be balanced by other pieces on the opposite side of
the image, as shown in Figure 1-14.
You can balance objects in two ways:
✦Symmetrical balance: Have the objects on either side of the frame be of
roughly similar size or weight.
✦Asymmetrical balance: Have the objects on opposing sides be of differ-
ent size or weight.

Framing an Image
237
Figure 1-14: Other elements of the photo can balance the composition.
Framing an Image
Photos are frequently put in frames for a good reason: A border around a 
picture defines the picture’s shape and concentrates attention on the image
within the frame. You can use framing to provide an attractive border around
your own pictures by using these tips:
✦In the foreground, look for obvious framing shapes in which you can
place your composition.
You won’t easily miss the most readily apparent frames: doorways, win-
dows, arches, and space between buildings. These have the advantage 
of being a natural part of the scene, like the cliffs in Figure 1-15, and not
something you contrived in order to create a frame. In this illustration, the
cliffs at the left side of the image partially frame the ocean inlet at right.
✦Make your own frames by changing position until foreground objects
create a border around your image.
Find a curving tree branch and back up until the scenic view you want to
capture is wrapped in its leafy embrace. Climb inside something and use
an opening as a frame.
✦Place your frame in the foreground.
Shapes in the background that delineate your image don’t make an effec-
tive frame. You want something that appears to be in front of your subject
matter, just like a real frame would be.

✦Use a frame to create a feeling of depth.
A flat-looking image can jump to 3-D life when it’s placed in a frame.
Usually, you want to have the frame and your main subject in focus,
but you can sometimes use an out-of-focus frame to good effect.

✦Use a telephoto lens setting to compress your frame and your subject;
use a wide-angle lens setting to add distance between the frame and
your main subject.
With a telephoto lens, however, you have to be especially careful to keep
the frame in focus.
What’s That Tree Doing Growing Out of My Head?
Mergers are the unintentional combining of portions of an image. With our
stereoscopic vision, our eyes and brain distinctly separate objects that are
farther apart. Other visual clues let us keep objects separate, such as the 
relative size of the objects compared with our knowledge of their actual size. 
For example, we know that a tiny human is located in the distance whereas
another human in the same field of view who appears to be four times as
large is simply closer. However, viewed through the one-dimensional per-
spective of a camera lens, it’s easy for objects that we know to be distinct to
merge into one.
We’ve all seen photographs of hapless photographic subjects posed with
what looks like a telephone pole growing out of their heads. Sometimes, the
merger is with a border of the image or a simple joining of two objects, 
as in Figure 1-16, in which the penguin(s) at right appear to share a body.
This mistake is easier to make than you might think — and easier to avoid
than you realize. Follow these steps:
1. When composing an image, look behind the subject at the objects in
the background. Then, examine the borders of the image to look for
things “attached” to the edges.
By concentrating, you can see how the background and foreground will
appear when merged in your final photograph.
Sometimes it helps to close one eye while viewing the scene.
2. If an unwanted merger seems likely, move the subject to either side or
change your position slightly to eliminate the juxtaposition.
Like all the other rules discussed in this chapter, you can ignore the anti-
merger guideline (even if you aren’t a captain of industry looking to build a
giant conglomerate). Keep in mind that you can creatively use mergers to
make photographs that are humorous. You just might want that forest ranger
to appear to have a tree growing out of his or her head.

O
ne area that has really benefited from the digital single lens reflex
(dSLR) revolution has been close-up, or macro, photography. Although
digital cameras of any sort make close-up pictures fairly easy, you always
have the pesky problem of trying to figure out whether you framed
your picture properly — and whether it’s in sharp focus. Tiny
LCD (liquid crystal display) screens on the back of a
camera should do the job — theoretically — but they’re
often difficult to view, especially under bright light.
Fortunately, a growing number of digital cameras
have back-panel LCDs that measure 2.5 inches or
more, so even if you don’t have a digital SLR, you
can easily take good close-up photos.
With a digital SLR, though, you’re always looking
through the same lens used to take the picture
(unless you choose to view the LCD on the back of
the camera after the picture is taken). Digital SLRs
are designed for bright, easy viewing and focusing of
your image. Unless the light is very dim indeed, you can
usually see almost exactly what you’re going to get as well
as whether your camera’s autofocus mechanism (or your own
trusty fingers) have zeroed in on the exact point of focus you want. Digital
SLRs can turn a fun activity into an uproariously good time.
However, you don’t need a dSLR or camera with an electronic viewfinder
(EVF) to enjoy close-up photography. Macro photography can be one of the
most satisfying forms of digital photography. Any intermediate digital

camera has all the features that you need to take great close-ups that will
astound your family, friends, and colleagues. And although a beautiful scenic
photo or an attractive portrait will elicit praise and appreciation, a well-
crafted close-up photo is guaranteed to generate oohs and aahs and “How
did you ever take that picture?” comments. Close-up photography takes us
into fascinating new worlds without the time or expense of an exotic trip.
For example, if you collect coins or stamps, miniature teddy bears, porcelain
figurines, model trains, or nearly anything smaller than a breadbox (or bread-
boxes themselves), you’ll love the ability to document your collection. Have
a garden full of prize roses? Display them even in the dead of winter through
digital photos. Have a thing for insects? Grab a picture of the little beasts in
their natural habitat. Some of the best applications of close-up photography
involve crafts and hobbies.
You don’t have to be a forensic expert specializing in crime scene investiga-
tions to find interesting photos in the macro world. Just about any house-
hold object, if photographed from an inch or two away, is transformed into
an abstract scene worthy of the most artsy photographic expression.
If you haven’t tried close-up photography, I hope this chapter encourages
you to do so. I show you here how to set up a close-up “studio” and take
macro photos the painless way.
Defining Macro Photography
The first thing to do as you begin your exploration of close-up photography
is to get some jargon out of the way. There’s nothing wrong with calling up-
close-and-personal pictures close-ups, but within the photography realm, 
you commonly find some other terms in frequent use (and misuse). Here are
some of them:
✦Close-up photography: This term has been co-opted by the movie indus-
try (as in “All right, Mr. DeMille, I’m ready for my close-up,” from the 
film classic, Sunset Boulevard). A close-up is generally considered to be 
a tight shot of a single person (say, only the face and shoulders) or of
another object of similar size. It’s okay to refer to close-up photography
for what you do with your digital camera, as I’ve done in the chapter
title. That’s a term that most people, even photographic neophytes,
understand.
✦Microphotography: Microphotography results in microphotographs —
that is, microfilm images. You wouldn’t apply this term to pictures
taken through a microscope, although it is sometimes (incorrectly)
used that way.

Book IV
Chapter 2
Close-Up
Photography
Defining Macro Photography
243
✦Photomicrography: This is the correct term for taking pictures through
a microscope. Although photomicrography is chiefly within the purview
of scientists and researchers, it can also be a fun activity for digital pho-
tographers who have the special equipment needed to hook a digital
camera up to a microscope. Everything from microscopic animals to
human hairs can make fascinating photographs, but you generally need
a higher-end digital camera and some specialized gear to capture the
images. Photomicrography is beyond the scope of this book.
✦Macro photography: This is the brand of close-up that is the focus of
this chapter. Generally, macro photography is considered any picture
taken from about 12 inches or less from the subject, down to half an inch
or even closer. Macro is derived from the Greek word makro, meaning
“long,” but it has come to mean “large” and the exact opposite of micro.
However, that’s not exactly the case in photography. A macro photo-
graph is not a huge picture (the opposite of a microphotograph), but
rather a normal-sized photo of a tiny object that has been made to
appear large, as shown in Figure 2-1. You might not even be able to rec-
ognize common objects when enlarged in a macro photograph.
Figure 2-1: Small objects becoming large are the result of 
macro photographic techniques.

Why Digital Macro Photography Is Cool
244
Why Digital Macro Photography Is Cool
Digital cameras and macro photography were made for each other. In many
ways, digital cameras can be far superior to an ordinary film camera when it
comes to taking close-up pictures. Consider these advantages:
✦Close-focusing lenses: Digital camera lenses are ideal for focusing up
close. Without getting too technical, macro photos are made with any
camera by moving the lens farther and farther away from the film (or
sensor, in the case of a digital camera). Film cameras require moving the
lens quite a ways out to get a decent macro effect. For example, a 50mm
lens on a 35mm single lens reflex camera (or a digital SLR with a full-size
sensor) must be moved 4 inches out from the film or sensor to get a 
life-size (1:1) image. In contrast, an 8mm lens on a digital camera with a
small sensor, roughly the equivalent of the 50mm lens on an SLR, needs to
move only a total of about 5⁄8 of an inch to provide the same magnification.
Clearly, close focusing is much easier to incorporate into a digital camera.
In the macro photography arena, you’ll see close-focusing capabilities
described in terms of magnification rather than the distance from the
subject. As a beginning macro photographer, you might be more inter-
ested in how close you can get: 6 inches, 3 inches, or whatever. However,
realize that the size of the final image at any given distance varies depend-
ing on the zoom setting of your lens. That is, an image taken from 6 inches
away at the wide-angle setting might be one-fourth the size of one taken
from the same distance at the longest zoom setting. Comparing the
amount of magnification is more useful. For example, a 1:1 image is
exactly the same size in your camera whether taken from 1 inch away
with the wide-angle setting or 6 inches away with the zoom setting.
(Although the size is the same, the way the image looks is quite differ-
ent, and I discuss that later in this chapter.)
✦Easy framing of your image: Virtually every digital camera features an
LCD screen, like the one shown in Figure 2-2, that shows almost exactly
what you’ll get in your finished photograph. (The LCD might trim a bit 
of the edges from the image, but getting more than you expected is far
superior to getting less.) Inexpensive point-and-shoot film cameras, if
they have macro capabilities at all, don’t show you exactly what your
image will look like. Cameras with an electronic viewfinder (EVF) are
also easy to use for framing close-ups.
✦Immediate results: Close-up photography can be tricky, and the last
thing you want to do is wait for your film to come back from the photo-
finisher to find out whether your pictures came out. With a digital camera,
you can review your results on the LCD immediately, delete bad shots,
and keep taking pictures until you get exactly what you want.

Picking a Place to Shoot
Where you shoot your macro photos can be as significant as what you’re
shooting. You might want to take your photographs in the tightly controlled
environment of your kitchen, using a tabletop as your platform for your
model trains or other objects. Maybe you want to venture out into the field
to stalk the creatures of nature.
Sometimes you have a choice of where you shoot, and sometimes you don’t.
For example, if you want to photograph sea life at the beach, you pretty
much have to take your pictures there. Comparatively, you can photograph 
a tree frog on a tree or pop him in a mayonnaise jar along with a leaf and
stick to re-create, as the late, great, comedian Mitch Hedberg said, his natu-
ral environment.

Setting Up Your Macro Studio
You don’t need a real studio for macro photography, of course. That’s one of
the cool parts of taking close-ups. Any nook or cranny that you can spare in
your home or work environment can be designated as a studio area. All you
need to do is keep the area reasonably neat and free of clutter so that you
can set up and take macro photos on a few minutes’ notice. You can also
keep a semipermanent close-up studio, like I do, for stuff that my wife sells
on eBay. I have a seamless backdrop up in a little-used corner so that an item
that’s destined for sale can be set up and photographed anytime. A macro
studio, such as the one shown in Figure 2-3, requires so little space that you
won’t hesitate to dedicate a small portion of your living space in exchange
for the convenience of having a special area you can use anytime.
Of course, you’re free to create little macro studios on an ad hoc basis, using
your kitchen table, hearth, or any convenient location as you need.
Many of the close-up photos in this book, such as Figure 2-1, were taken on
impulse right here at the desk where I work. I just grab a piece of white
paper from my inkjet printer, lean it against any convenient support, and
drop the object I want to photograph on my miniature, seamless backdrop.

I often use the built-in flash of my digital camera with one or two other
pieces of printer paper strategically located to reflect the light onto my sub-
ject. Less than a minute after I started, I plug my camera into the USB cable
that rests by my keyboard and watch my photos appear on the screen.
Figure 2-3: Any small corner can become a macro studio.
Of course, you can get better results than I get with my quickie photos if you
collect the right equipment and gear for your ministudio. This next section
explains exactly what you need.
Background check
In many cases, you want close-up backgrounds that are plain and unobtru-
sive because they allow your subject matter to stand out without any dis-
tracting extraneous material. That generally means a light background for
darker objects and a dark background for light objects. You don’t need to
stick with stark white or inky black backgrounds unless your plan is to drop
out the background in Photoshop or another image editor so that you can
combine the subject with some other photograph. A light pastel background
often works well for dark objects, and a medium-dark shade looks good with
very light objects.
The amount of light that falls on the background helps determine its light-
ness or darkness. A soft gray background can appear to be almost white or
fairly dark depending on the amount of illumination that reaches it. Don’t be
afraid to experiment.

Setting Up Your Macro Studio
248
So-called seamless backdrops are very popular. They provide a continuous
(seamless) surface on which the subject can rest while blending smoothly
into a vertical background. Depending on how you light the seamless back-
drop, it can appear to be a single shade or can provide varying amounts of
separation between the foreground and background, as shown in Figure 2-4.
Figure 2-4: Seamless backgrounds make an attractive setting for close-up photos.
Here are the main types of backgrounds that you’ll probably use for your
macro photography:
✦A few yards of cloth: I really like plain, solid-colored cloth as a backdrop
because it’s rugged and versatile. If it gets dirty, you can usually just
throw it in the wash. I buy pieces about 45–54 inches wide and 8 or 9
feet long in several different colors, including pure black and pure white
as well as soft pastels and bright colors. The longer lengths let me use
the cloth as a portrait background if I need to.
Artificial velour is extremely useful. One side has a soft surface that
really soaks up light. A black velour cloth can make a perfectly black
background almost guaranteed not to show shadows. The other side of
velour has a shinier texture that you can use for some types of photos.
Leave the cloth smooth. Avoid fabrics with a pronounced reflective
sheen, such as satin/sateen and vinyl. The simplest fabrics won’t cost
you more than a few dollars a yard.

✦A roll of seamless paper: Rolls of true photographic seamless paper can
be expensive (around $40 for a 9-x-36-foot roll) and hard to find — you
need to seek out a camera store that sells to professional photogra-
phers. If you can’t find such a store locally, online sources sell paper in
53-inch-wide by 12-yard rolls for about $20, although shipping can add 
a considerable amount to the cost. If seamless paper is what you want,
however, you can take a hacksaw and cut the roll in half to make the size
a little more manageable for ministudio work. Because seamless paper
eventually gets torn and dirty, it’s nice to be able to unroll a little more
so that you always have a fresh background.
Check out craft and packaging stores for large rolls of sturdy wrapping
paper as an alternate source for seamless backgrounds. Avoid the paper
with mistletoe and bunnies and stick to plain colors. However, don’t be
afraid to experiment. A smooth section of Kraft paper (like that found on
rolls of brown shipping paper) might make a handsome backdrop for
some subjects.
✦Posterboard: I’ve used a lot of posterboard as seamless backgrounds 
for close-up photos of smaller objects. Hint: Use duct tape to curve it
into place. At a few cents a sheet, you can afford many different colors.
However, watch for posterboard that has a slightly shiny surface. If 
you use it with soft and diffuse lighting, however, that shouldn’t be a
problem.
Visible means of support
You have to provide support for your background material, your lighting
equipment (if you use some), and your camera. Fortunately, the same sup-
ports that work for close-ups serve admirably for other types of photogra-
phy. (See Book IV, Chapter 3 for a discussion of gear for people pictures.)
If you plan to take a lot of studio-type photos, buying some good-quality
equipment of this type can be a shrewd move. I’m still using the same tripod
and light stands that I purchased while in college. A few hundred dollars for
that stuff seemed like a lot of money at the time, but I haven’t had to spend a
penny since then even though I’ve gone from large professional cameras to
teensy digital cameras in the interim.
You can buy tripods, light stands, and other equipment relatively inexpen-
sively. However, I can tell you from personal experience that a $100 tripod is
a lot more than twice as sturdy and twice as useful as a $50 model. If you’re
going to spend the money replacing a flimsy tripod or two anyway, start out
with a good one.
Here are some of the supports you can find:

✦Background supports: You’ll find that cloth backgrounds are so light-
weight that you can support them with almost anything. Duct tape can
suspend a piece of cloth from any piece of furniture that happens to be
around. I tend to use 7-foot light stands, which are aluminum supports
that telescope down to a compact size and have tripod legs at the bottom
to keep them upright. Set up a pair of light stands, suspend a wooden
dowel between them as a horizontal support for your cloth, and you’re
all set.
Light stands can also support some rolls of paper if you substitute a
wood closet pole or metal pipe for the wooden dowel. You can also build
a simple background stand out of lumber. Or, if you do a lot of shooting
in a basement area (as I do), use metal supports fastened directly to the
ceiling joists, as shown in Figure 2-5.
Figure 2-5: Seamless paper can be supported in a variety of ways.
✦Lighting supports: Light stands are good but might be a little too large
to position effectively for close-up photography. In many cases, you can
skip light stands or special lights altogether and use household desk
lamps that rest right on your background setup.
✦Camera supports: A tripod is essential for macro photography. You need
to be able to fix your camera in one position and lock it down while you
take your photos. That’s particularly true if you use your digital camera’s

LCD screen to compose or focus your image. It doesn’t matter whether
you’re relying on your camera’s automatic focus or focusing manually: A
tripod can give you the fixed position that you need. A tripod also allows
you to photograph several subjects from the same distance and angle,
thus adding an important measure of consistency.
You can find more information on choosing a good tripod in Book II, Chapter 5.
Lighting equipment
Unless your subject is a candle or a glow-in-the-dark Halloween skeleton, you
need some sort of lighting to illuminate the scene. Your choices include the
existing light in the room, electronic flash, and incandescent illumination,
such as desk lamps or photoflood lights. The following sections explain what
you need to know about each option.
Existing light
Photographers used to refer to existing light by the term available light until
someone pointed out that a 400-pound Klieg light is technically available
if you happen to have one left over from the last motion picture you shot.
Today, we call it existing light on the presumption that lighting doesn’t exist 
if it isn’t already available on-site. Here are some tips for using existing light:
✦Use with modulation: You can modulate (modify) existing light, of course,
if you have reflectors or other gadgets about. If existing light is too
harsh, you can soften it by using a piece of white cardboard as a reflec-
tor. Foam board also works and is stiffer and easier to position than
cardboard.
Avoid colors other than white unless you really, really want a color cast
in your photo.
✦Foiled again: A piece of aluminum foil can make a brighter, more con-
trasty reflector. Crinkle it up so that the light it reflects is more diffuse.
Otherwise, foil behaves a lot like a mirror, which is something you don’t
want. Mylar space blankets also make a lightweight, portable metallic
reflector.
✦For all in tents: Pros often use miniature white tents when photograph-
ing a shiny object. You can make a simple one out of a translucent milk
jug. Place your subject inside the tent, apply plenty of light from the out-
side of the tent, and then shoot through a hole in the top or side. You’ll
end up with beautiful soft lighting and no reflections of the surrounding
room on the shiny subject matter.
Make sure that the camera lens itself doesn’t reflect on the object!

Setting Up Your Macro Studio
252
✦Block that light: Sometimes you want to subtract light rather than add it
to your subject. Put black cloth or cardboard outside the subject area to
absorb light and darken shadows for a dramatic effect.
When using incandescent lights, make sure that your camera’s white balance
control has been set for interior illumination. Many digital cameras can be
set to automatically recognize and adjust the white balance for various light-
ing conditions. Fluorescent lighting often requires a different setting, and
some cameras will have adjustments for both warm and cool fluorescent
bulbs. You can find out more about correcting colors in Book V, Chapter 1.
Electronic flash
Electronic flash is often useful for quickie shots like those I take right at my
desk, but flash is often not the best choice for close-ups. Here are some rea-
sons why not:
✦Too much light: Flash is often too powerful for close-up pictures taken
inches away from the camera. Flash is intended for shooting from sev-
eral feet or more.
✦Can’t project the outcome: The effect of the lighting isn’t easy to visual-
ize with electronic flash because the subject is illuminated for only a
fraction of a second. After you take your photo and review it on the LCD
screen, you might find that the light is too harsh, is placed incorrectly,
or illuminates the wrong part of your image.
✦Don’t need it for stop-action: One of the major advantages of electronic
flash, stopping the action of moving subjects, doesn’t really apply to
close-up pictures, which are usually taken of stationary subjects at a
fixed distance.
You can use four kinds of electronic flash when taking close-up photos. 
You can find a more thorough discussion of these flash options in Book IV,
Chapter 3 (where I discuss photographing people). However, here’s a quick
summary of your choices.
✦Your camera’s built-in flash: This is usually your worst choice for illumi-
nating your subject. For one thing, the flash is likely to be aimed quite a
distance past your area of interest — or, in many cases, blocked by parts
of the camera or lens. When I use my camera’s built-in flash for close-
ups, I always include several pieces of white reflective material outside
the field of view to bounce the light back onto the subject. Your flash is
likely to be too harsh, thus washing out the details of your subject.
Light placed at an angle, rather than straight on, can often produce
better close-up illumination.

✦External flash: You can find a con-
nector on many digital cameras 
for linking to an external flash 
unit, which you can buy for $50 
to $400 or more (for the dedicated
units built specifically for the 
more advanced amateur cameras).
Sometimes these are located on
top of the camera in the form of 
a shoe (a hot shoe) that can be
used to mount the flash and pro-
vide an electrical connection at 
the same time. Or, your camera
might have a special connector —
a PC/X connector, as shown in
Figure 2-6.
PC doesn’t stand for personal computer, but rather Prontor-Compur,
which is the German mechanical shutter–building company that
invented the connection.
Optional flash units range from more powerful versions of your camera’s
built-in flash to expensive studio flash units. Check out Book IV, Chap-
ter 3, for tips on how to use external flash units of this type.
✦Slave flash: These are a kind of external electronic flash that includes 
a photocell that triggers the unit automatically when another flash unit
is fired. Slaves let you use several flashes at once, if you can match the
slave’s operation to your camera’s flash functions. (Some cameras use 
a pre-flash that can trigger some slaves prematurely.)
✦Ring lights: These are circular flash units that can be fitted around the
circumference of your camera’s lens. They provide even lighting that 
is designed especially for close-ups. Usually, only professionals who 
do a great deal of macro photography can justify the price of a ring 
light.
Incandescent lights
Incandescent lights — including gooseneck desk lamps (which I use), high-
intensity lamps, or photographic floodlights — are great for lighting close-ups.
Their advantages include
✦Easy preview: You can see exactly what your lighting effect will be.
✦Flexibility: Your options are wide-open. Use one, two, three, or as many
lamps as you need. Arrange them as you like. Create backlit effects or
soft lighting. Use a high-intensity lamp when you want a very contrasty
Figure 2-6: Your camera may have a
connection for plugging in an external 
flash unit.

254
quality to your illumination. Turn to a soft-white desk lamp when you
need diffused light.
✦Inexpensive: I buy desk lamps for less than $10 and use them in various
combinations to get well-lit close-ups. What other photographic equip-
ment can you buy that cheap?
Their disadvantages include
✦Heat: Don’t let your high-intensity lamps burn your subject. And forget
about using them to photograph ice cream sundaes.
✦Power: You need lots of power and thick cords if you’re using multiple
incandescent lights.
✦Color of their light: You need to make sure that your camera’s white 
balance is set correctly for the reddish hue of incandescent lights.
✦Burnout: Have some extra bulbs available in case one of your lamps
burns out during a shooting session.
Other equipment
You might find some other equipment handy when shooting macro photos.
For example, slide-copying attachments are available for some digital 
cameras. These attachments let you make high-resolution digital grabs
of 35mm color slides without the need for an expensive slide scanner.
(For more information on scanning slides, see Book VII, Chapter 2.) Even if
your digital camera focuses closely, special close-up lenses let you get even
closer. 
Here’s a rundown of some of the most popular add-ons for close-up 
photography:
✦Slide copiers: Slide copiers are great for converting your existing col-
lection of color transparencies to digital form. All you need is a close-
focusing digital camera and a copier attachment, which mainly consists
of a holder for the slide and a diffusing panel that sits behind the slide to
soften the light you use to illuminate it. You might be able to get good
quality with such a device, and the quality is certainly better than what
you get with most flatbed scanners jury-rigged to scan slides.
✦Single-lens reflex add-ons: If you happen to own a digital camera with
removable lenses (with basic SLR digital cameras finally dipping below
the $1,000 price point, that’s not altogether unlikely), you can use simi-
lar accessories offered for film-oriented SLRs, such as bellows, extension
tubes, and reversing rings.

Book IV
Chapter 2
Close-Up

255
• A bellows, such as the one
shown in Figure 2-7, moves your
camera’s lens farther from the
sensor, enlarging the image over
a continuous range. The down-
side is that the farther the bel-
lows is extended, the less light
reaches the sensor, producing
long exposures. Bellows attach-
ments are also expensive.
• Extension tubes do much the
same as a bellows but over
fixed distances.
• Reversing rings let you mount
your camera’s lens on a bel-
lows so that the front of the
lens faces the sensor. With
removable lenses that weren’t
designed for macro photogra-
phy, reversing the lens can pro-
duce sharper results and
increase the magnification.
✦Close-up lenses: Even if your digital camera focuses very close, you
might want to get even closer. That’s where close-up lenses come in.
Although they’re called lenses (because they function as one), close-up
lenses look like clear glass filters with a curved surface. These lenses
fasten to the front of your digital camera’s lens using a screw mount or
other arrangement. Labeled with designations such as #1, #2, and #3
(referring to a measurement of magnification called diopter strength), you
can use only one or use them in combination to produce varying amounts
of magnification. For example, you can combine a #1 and a #3 for a plus-4
magnification. The amount of magnification that a particular close-up
lens or combination provides depends on the zoom setting of the lens
and its normal close-focusing ability.
For example, if you have a lens that focuses as close as one meter, a +1
close-up lens enables you to focus down to half a meter, a +2 diopter to
one-third of meter, and a +3 diopter to one-fourth of a meter (a little less
than ten inches for the non–metrically inclined). As you can see, these
close-up lenses can bring macro capability to optics that aren’t able to
focus very close (one meter is the pits, close-up-wise) and can bring
super macro capability to lenses that already can focus very close to
your subject.
Serious macro photographers purchase a set of several close-up lenses
and use them in combination to get the magnification they want.
Figure 2-7: This bellows is expensive but
versatile if you have a digital SLR camera.

Shooting Tips for Macro Photography
The first part of this chapter helps outfit you for macro photography. Most
of the equipment and gear discussed can be used for location shooting or in
your home or office studio, although outdoor close-ups can make some of
the tools, such as cardboard reflectors, tricky to use.
This next section provides you with tips for shooting good close-up photo-
graphs, using common techniques the pros take advantage of all the time,
plus a few things I learned the hard way myself.
Positioning your subject and background
You’ve chosen your subject to photograph, whether it’s a pewter soldier
from your collection or a terrified tree frog. You’ve selected a background to
isolate and/or flatter your subject. What’s next?
Set up your subject on its background so that it won’t move. Although that
can be tricky with the tree frog, it’s less of a challenge with an inanimate
object, such as the pewter soldier. I often use bits of modeling clay that can
be hidden underneath an object to hold it at the correct angle. I also use
pieces of wood, bent paper clips, and inexpensive clamps. One of the advan-
tages of digital photography is that you can easily remove any supporting
device in an image editor.
In the studio, positioning your subject might be all you have to do. On loca-
tion, you’ll likely have to remove unsightly leaves, ugly rocks, maybe some
bugs that are wandering through your frame. Clean up any dirt, dying stems,
or other objects that you don’t want to photograph.
Setting up your camera
In the studio, it’s fairly easy to set up your camera on a tripod or other sup-
port and not have to worry about it shifting. On location, you might need to
make sure that the ground underneath your tripod is firm and solid. Put a
rock under one or more legs, if necessary. If you’re shooting on a slope, you
might want to lengthen one or more legs of the tripod and shorten others.
Set the tripod a little shorter than the height you actually want to use. You
can use the center pole to raise or lower the camera a bit. Don’t make the
common mistake of setting the tripod too low because if you really crank up
the center column, the tripod will become top-heavy and unstable. It some-
times helps to tie a weight onto the center pole to give the tripod a bit of
ground-hugging heft. I use mesh bags, like what oranges or onions are sold
in, as a receptacle for rocks. Mesh bags tend to be strong but lightweight,

which makes them ideal for this particular task. (Plus, if you happen to
encounter an orange grove during your shooting session, you’re all set to
bring home some dessert.)
You can reverse the center pole of many tripods so that it extends down
between the legs of the tripod, thus letting you shoot at an angle down on
your subject. Often that’s the only way to get the viewpoint you want with-
out having the tripod’s legs interfere.
Lights, please
Use your lighting equipment or the existing light to illuminate your subject.
In the studio, position two or more lights so that they light up the subject
evenly. In the studio or on location, work with reflectors to fill in dark shad-
ows, darken spots that are too bright, and even out your illumination.
The light that falls on the background can be just as important as the light
that you use to illuminate your subject. The background light can separate
your subject from the surroundings and provide a more attractive photo. 
See Book IV, Chapter 3, for more information on lighting backgrounds.
Remember that the more light you are able to use, the smaller the lens open-
ing needs to be and better the depth of field (how much of your image is in
focus) you’ll achieve. If you want a really sharp picture with lots in focus,
pump up the light as much as possible — although if you’re using electronic
flash, not having enough light is rarely a problem. I explain more about depth
of field later in this chapter.
The quality of the light is as important as the quantity. If you’re using elec-
tronic flash, you want to avoid the harsh illumination that flash typically 
provides. I often drape a handkerchief over my camera’s flash. This reduces
the flash illumination to a more reasonable level while softening the light.
If the electronic flash is still too strong, move back a step or two and zoom 
in closer. Bear in mind, though, that not all digital camera lenses can focus
closely at all zoom settings. Because of the perverse square law (er, I mean
inverse square law), a light that is 12 inches from a subject generates only
one-quarter as much illumination as it does from 6 inches.
Ready . . . aim . . .
You’re all set to frame your photo and press the shutter release. But first, a
few words from our sponsor. Keep these final advisories in mind as you take
your best shot when shooting up close:

Shooting Tips for Macro Photography
258
✦Watch proportions. For any particular magnification, the closer 
you get, the more emphasis is placed on objects very close to the lens.
Photograph a figure of a clown’s head from 2 inches away, and his nose
will be very large in proportion to the rest of his face, as shown at left in
Figure 2-8. Move back a few inches and zoom in to produce the same
size image, and the proportions are much more realistic, as shown at
right in Figure 2-8.
✦Don’t forget focus and depth-of-field considerations. When shooting up
close, only a small portion of your image might be in focus. Make sure
that’s the most important part of your subject! If your camera lets you
lock in a focus setting by pressing the shutter release button part way,
make sure you’ve focused on the right area before locking. Depth of field
is a range, extending one-third in front of the plane of sharpest focus and
two-thirds behind it, as you can see in Figure 2-9. In this figure, very little
in front of the cat is in focus, but the cat’s face itself is fairly sharp. The
background, of course, is too far away to be in focus at all, which is how
the picture was conceived.
Figure 2-8: The clown’s nose (left) appears proportionately larger than when photographed
from a distance (right).

Figure 2-9: Depth of field extends one-third in front of and two-thirds behind the 
plane of sharpest focus (the cat’s face).
✦Crop and center. Crop (trim) extraneous material and center your sub-
ject in the frame (most of the time). Good composition, as I describe in
Book IV, Chapter 1, usually calls for an off-center subject, but that rule
might not apply when shooting close-ups. It might be best to feature
your main point of interest right in the center of the frame.
✦Use your camera’s close-up features effectively. That includes double-
checking to make sure the camera is in macro mode and keeping close
tabs on the in-focus indicator (usually an LED) that might appear in your
viewfinder.
✦Aim and frame. Make sure that you’ve framed the subject correctly,
without accidentally chopping anything off. You often have to use the
camera’s LCD screen to examine your composition because the built-in
optical viewfinder doesn’t show the image 100 percent accurately. (Read
Book II, Chapter 1, for a basic discussion of viewfinder parallax error.)
You don’t want to chop off the top or sides of your image by mistake. 
Of course, if you’re using a digital SLR, you won’t need to worry about
this at all.

Shooting Tips for Macro Photography
260
If your digital camera has a connector for linking the camera to a monitor or
TV, you can often use that capability to frame your indoor close-up photos.
Fire!
When you press the shutter release button, a lot of things happen. One quite
likely (and none-too-happy) event is that you press the shutter release
button too hard, jar the camera during exposure, and produce a blurry pic-
ture. Another possibility is that you see something wrong with your compo-
sition in the last ohnosecond. (An ohnosecond is that interval between the
time when you press the shutter release and the instant when you realize
that you’ve made some sort of serious error. An ohnosecond also occurs
when you’re slamming your locked car door closed and notice your keys in
the ignition.) It’s not too late!
Avoiding blur
First, avoid human-caused blur by using your camera’s self-timer to trip the
shutter after a few seconds rather than using your big fat finger. In self-timer
mode, you set up your composition, make sure everything is okay, press the
shutter button, and then step back and take a few deep breaths until the
camera actually takes the photo (blur-free).
Depth of field and digital cameras
Throughout this book, I mention the copious
amounts of depth of field that digital cameras
offer. This is a good place to mention it again.
Because of the relatively short focal length of
their lenses, digital cameras help ensure that
just about anything you shoot at normal dis-
tances is sharp. Even at close-focus distances,
you have to work a little to throw even part of
your image out of focus.
If you want to reduce depth-of-field a little, say
to blur a background for creative purposes, you
can do several things:
 Try using the telephoto zoom position of
your camera. One of my favorite digital
cameras works fine in macro mode at its
200mm (equivalent) zoom setting, which has
an actual focal length of about 50mm, and
can cut down the depth-of-field a bit. 
 Use your camera’s aperture priority mode
(if it has one) and set the camera for the
largest lens opening available. 
 If you want to throw the background out of
focus, try focusing a teensy bit in front of
your main subject, which will probably
remain acceptably sharp as the back-
ground grows blurrier. Or, focus behind the
main subject (but only a little) if you need to
throw the foreground out of focus.

Book IV
Chapter 2
Close-Up
Photography
Shooting Tips for Macro Photography
261
An alternative is to use an electronic or mechanical remote shutter-release
control to trip your camera’s shutter without touching it. A remote release
can be a cable that attaches to your camera or an infrared remote control
like the one that operates your television, VCR, and virtually everything else
in your household. Unlike a self-timer, a remote release lets you take the
photo at the exact instant you want — say, when the tree frog has a cute
expression on his face.
Some cameras and lenses have anti-shake features that can help you avoid
blur, too.
Making sure the camera is done
For heavens sake, don’t do anything after you press the shutter button until
you’re 100-percent positive that the camera has finished taking the picture. 
If your camera has an optional shutter release sound, turn it on so that you
know when the picture is being taken. Learn to differentiate between the
sound the camera makes when the shutter opens and the sound made when
it closes again.
If your camera has a flashing LED that indicates that a photo is being saved
to your digital film, look for it to begin flashing as an indication that the
photo has been taken. The automatic exposure mechanism of your camera
just might need to use a long exposure (several seconds or more) to take the
picture, and you certainly don’t want any sudden movements or grabs at the
camera to ruin your shot. Wait a few seconds after you hear the camera’s
shutter click before doing anything until you’re sure that your camera isn’t
making a lengthy exposure or time exposure. That click might have been the
shutter opening (or the digital camera’s simulation of a shutter sound), and
the camera might still be capturing the picture.
Reviewing your shot
After the photo has been taken, do take the time to review your picture on
the LCD for defects. Look for these common problems:
✦Poor focus: Correct and reshoot.
✦Bad exposure: Make adjustments by using your camera’s available expo-
sure compensation modes. (Check your camera manual.)
✦Bad reflections you didn’t notice before: Move your lights or move
your camera until the reflections go away.
✦Missing tree frog that has departed the scene: You know, they do make
quite realistic-looking plastic tree frogs these days.

Digital SLRs and Close-Up Photography
262
Digital SLRs and Close-Up Photography
As I mention at the beginning of this chapter, digital SLRs are the almost per-
fect choice for close-up photography because of the increased accuracy you
can get with framing and focusing, as well as the greater control that most
dSLRs provide over your picture-taking. Here are a few things to consider
when using a digital SLR for macro photography. Some of these also apply to
cameras with electronic viewfinders.
✦Don’t forget to use depth of field preview. The digital SLR typically
shows you a bright, clear image with the lens wide open and then closes
down the aperture at the moment of exposure. As you know, the depth
of field at that smaller aperture is likely to be much greater than what
you saw with the lens wide open, so if selective focus is important to
you, you’ll want to use your camera’s depth of field preview button to
glimpse the true focus just before you shoot. An object that appears soft
and out of focus through the viewfinder can be objectionably sharp in
the final image, as you can see in Figure 2-10.
✦Investigate add-on focus aids. An SLR image is usually viewed as pro-
jected onto a focusing screen underneath the pentaprism/pentamirror.
High-end digital SLRs can offer removable focusing screens that can be
easier to focus in dim light or in close-up mode. If you have a dSLR with
that capability, investigate the focus aids available to you.
✦Not all digital SLRs show the full frame. When I began my photographic
career, the Nikon film camera was highly prized because it was said to
display a full 100 percent of the film image through the SLR viewfinder.
Other cameras might not. Today, many digital camera viewfinders trim
off some of the image, providing only 92–98 percent of the full image.
You actually get more than what you saw through the viewfinder, but if
absolute framing is important to you, be aware that what you see is only
most of what you get.
✦Avail yourself of the mirror lock-up feature, if provided. Close-up pic-
tures can be especially sensitive to vibration, such as that caused by
a pivoting mirror. (The mirror reflects the lens view upward to the
viewfinder, then flips up out of the way during exposure to let the light
pass unimpeded to the sensor. This quick up/down flip inevitably pro-
vides a tiny amount of vibration, no matter how carefully the camera
was designed.) If you’re shooting very close or if your exposure is long,
see whether your digital SLR has a mirror lock-up feature, which will let
you flip the mirror up prior to the exposure. Then, when vibration has
been damped, take your picture with the self-timer or remote release.
✦Check out bellows, extension tubes, reversing rings, and special macro
lenses. These specialized devices can let you get closer, take sharper pic-
tures, and improve your results, especially if you have a digital SLR with a
full-frame sensor.

A
lthough the first successful photograph, a scene taken from a Paris
rooftop by Nicéphore Niépce in 1827, was a scenic photo unpopulated
by humans (largely because the exposure took eight full hours!), the most
memorable pictures since then have included people. Indeed, the
desire to photograph family, friends, and colleagues is why
many people own a camera.
When you think of the daguerreotype, Civil War–era
portraits probably come to mind. When you imagine
a prize-winning photograph, images such as
Dorothea Lange’s Migrant Mother leap into your
thoughts more quickly than, say, Ansel Adams’s
“portraits” of the U.S. National Parks. And when
you photographed an architectural treasure such
as the Eiffel Tower, didn’t you include a family
member in the picture?
We’re fascinated by photographs of people, so we take
lots of them. However, people are the most difficult of all
subjects to photograph because of the complexity of human
ego, awareness, and opinion. When was the last time the Eiffel
Tower complained that your picture made it look fat? Has anyone ever told
you that your photo of the Grand Canyon “didn’t really look like the Grand
Canyon”? Has anyone worried that the presidents on Mount Rushmore
would blink during an exposure?

Capturing Satisfying Portraits
266
Satisfying people photography is within the capabilities of every digital
camera owner. You don’t need an expensive camera to take portraits
(although digital SLRs can have some advantages when it comes to using
certain accessories, such as multiple light sources.) Your basic 5- or 6-
megapixel camera will do just fine. Available light or your camera’s built-in
flash might work for some kinds of portraits, but I show you the advantages
of using off-camera flash in this chapter. The best part about taking digital
pictures of people is that you can review the photos instantly, with your sub-
jects, and retake them if the results are less than satisfactory.
This chapter is an introduction to the many facets of people photography.
You find out how to take great portraits, capture vivid candid photos, and
manage unruly group pictures. If you can handle those, all other forms of
digital photography are a snap.
Capturing Satisfying Portraits
The two basic categories of people photography are portraits and candids.
Portraits are posed photos taken in a controlled environment; candids are
unplanned pictures taken of people in the act of being themselves. In gen-
eral, portraits show people as they’d like to be seen, and candids portray
them as they really are.
Each category can produce images ranging from the mundane to the sublime.
To make the step up from mundane isn’t hard. In fact, the average novice 
can achieve significant improvement through better composition and light-
ing alone.
You don’t need a lot of training to shoot candid photos after you master the
features of your digital camera and the rules of composition. You just go out
and take pictures. Portraits, on the other hand, demand some special skills 
if you want the images to look like portraits. The good news is that these
capabilities are within the range of the average photographer; you just need
someone to fill you in on the tools and techniques that work. That’s what
this chapter is for.
But first, a few ground rules. Take care of these simple aspects and you can’t
go wrong:
✦Make it possible for your subjects to look their best. Suggest that they
wear suitable clothes and also invite them to have a change of outfits so
they can have pictures with different looks. Encourage them to use a
friend or family member to help them prepare. Provide access to a good-
sized mirror so that they can check their appearance. A portrait subject
who feels confident about his or her appearance will photograph well!

✦Get to know your subject’s personality. Be careful about trying to make
a somber, serious individual look cheerful and gay; the picture can look
forced and fake. It’s easier to get a happy type to look serious. Unless it’s
an executive portrait (where serious is good), go for the smile. Use what
you know about the subject to create a portrait that reflects his or her
personality.
✦Provide comfortable surroundings to help people stay relaxed. A clean,
organized shooting area puts your subjects at ease, as can some soft
mood music. If your subject doesn’t feel like he or she is standing in
front of a firing squad, your photos turn out much better.
Successful portraiture begins with getting your subjects into the right frame
of mind. Relaxed, confident people pose better than nervous, tense ones, so
make every effort to start things off right if you want to get a portrait like the
one shown in Figure 3-1.
Figure 3-1: A relaxed portrait is the best kind.

Shooting in the Studio or on Location

Shooting in the Studio or on Location
Because portrait sittings are generally carefully arranged, these kinds of
shoots offer the photographer the advantage of being able to exercise a
great deal of control over creation of the image, both in location and lighting.
You can choose to shoot in a studio (which can be any indoor room, includ-
ing your living room or garage) or on location (which can range from your
backyard to a park or other site).
You don’t need to have a real studio to shoot studio portraits. You might
have a place that serves double-duty as a studio as well as some other func-
tion. For example, I took some of my favorite portraits in an attic studio that
was little more than a large space hung with multiple rolls of seamless back-
drop paper, a few painted backgrounds, and lots of room to arrange lights.
When I moved to a newer home without an attic, my studio moved, too, to a
16-x-20-foot basement area with 10-foot ceilings directly under my home
office. The background paper was easy to hang from the ceiling joists.
For one book I wrote that called for
lots of head-and-shoulders portraits, I
pinned a long length of fabric to cover
the drapery in front of my patio door,
set up a couple of lights, and was able
to snap a quick portrait on a moment’s
notice without the need to run down to
the basement where the roomier, full
home studio was set up. 
You can even take portraits in your
own living room, which was the case
for the mother-daughter picture shown
in Figure 3-2. I’ve left the couch in the
photo (at left) but probably would
have cropped or retouched it out when
making a print.
And even if you don’t have room to set
aside for a home studio, you probably
have an area that can be temporarily
reconfigured to serve as a photo-
graphic environment. For example,
back the car out of the garage and hang a backdrop — and you have an
instant studio.
Figure 3-2: Your own living room can be
the scene for your portrait photography.

Shooting in the Studio or on Location
269
When I refer to a studio, I mean any indoor location that can be used to take
posed photographs. I don’t mean to imply that you have to build a home
studio to use any of the techniques described here.
Deciding whether to shoot in your studio or on location must be based on
the kind of photos you want to take. Shooting in a studio offers the utmost 
in control for a photographer, particularly when you’re working in a studio
you’ve set up and become comfortable in. Your studio can become a warm,
comfortable cocoon that lets your creativity and talent grow.
Of course, sometimes, we all have to leave our comfortable surroundings
and brave the outside world. Location photography may pull us out of our
comfort zone, but it also gives us something hard to find in the studio —
scenery.
Think of location shooting as your outdoor studio. Most of the techniques
described later in this chapter apply to location photography, although you
might have to use reflectors instead of external flash units, and you have less
control over your backgrounds. The chief differences between location and
studio shooting are as follows:
✦Portability: If you plan to shoot on location regularly, you need to
assemble a versatile kit of equipment that you can set up and break
down quickly. Find yourself a duffle bag or two you can pack your 
location equipment into quickly so that you can be ready to go at a
moment’s notice.
✦Flexibility: Because no two location shoots are identical, try for a
portable location kit that provides the greatest flexibility for lighting
both your subject and, if need be, elements of the location appearing in
the shot.
✦Creativity: Put together a portable studio system that lets you create dif-
ferent shots and moods. Consider props that are portable and versatile.
Make sure that your kit includes a good set of posing blocks (structures,
often of wood or plastic, that can be sat upon or stood on) so that you
can adjust the height of various posers. You won’t always find a rock or
fence post exactly where you need it out in the field!
Location shoots give you the chance to provide your subjects with some-
thing different from the typical portrait sitting. Every area has a special site
of some sort that can serve as a backdrop for memorable images, such as a
gorgeous hotel lobby, public park, forest, or lake. One photographer I know
lives on some wooded acreage complete with meadows, stands of trees, and
a pond. You can bet that he uses these environmental settings as often as
possible for his people pictures.

Setting Up an Informal Portrait Studio
Many photographers who pursue their art as a hobby or sideline prefer a
simple, informal home studio that can be set up easily and broken down
when the shoot’s done. Such a studio fills their needs without taking over
part of their house.
Others want to have the option of taking their show on the road. A simple
portrait studio can also be a transportable portrait studio. Even if you’re
working on a tight budget, you can come up with a lighting system that
improves your photography.
Depending on your needs, a pair of accessory flash units helps give you the
balanced lighting that you need if you want to capture that natural-lighting
look. If your budget permits a better system, you can build up to a more
powerful semiprofessional system. You’ll find that an investment in slightly
better equipment can be worth it. Portrait lights that I purchased for use
with film cameras a few decades ago work just fine with my latest digital
cameras, and their initial cost averages out to just a few dollars a year.
Choosing backgrounds
Sometimes you want to pose people in their natural environments, even for
formal portraits. A family can be posed in their living room seated on a couch.
An attorney can be pictured in front of a wall of law books. (This is almost a
tradition. Don’t forget to include a flag!) If you apply the same rules of posing
and lighting to such a portrait as for more traditional studio portraits, the
results will be quite good.
However, most formal portraits call for a real portrait background. For an
indoor studio, you’ll want something more attractive than just a bare wall 
for a background; fortunately a wide variety of choices is available for every
budget.
✦Go disposable with paper. The simplest choice is a roll of seamless
background paper, like that used in the photo shown in Figure 3-3. 
These rolls are available in a wide variety of colors and are easy to use.
Usually, you just suspend a roll on some kind of hanging support and
then unroll as much as you need for a shoot. (Hint: Bring enough down
to cover a couple of feet of floor and have your subject stand on it.) 
When a section of the backdrop paper becomes dirty or wrinkled, you
just roll down some clean paper, cut off the damaged part, and throw it
away. You can keep a selection of three to five different rolls and switch
them as needed.

271
Figure 3-3: Seamless paper can be the simplest choice.
✦Upgrade to fabric. Other background choices include painted linen
backdrops that provide a more interesting texture and color gradient.
Because these backgrounds are more expensive and weigh more than
the seamless paper, they might not be a great choice for a portable setup
or for the home enthusiast (who might need to use the studio for normal
family things when not doing photography).
✦Use more than one backdrop: A higher-end system for those making
their living doing portraits offers a multiple-background setup that can
be used for either a permanent studio or a traveling one. Such a rig has
multiple rollers with different backdrops on it. The portrait photogra-
pher creates one set of portraits with one background and then another
set with a second or even third background. Often, the backgrounds and
poses complement each other — say, an athletic field for a sports-type
portrait, with props such as a football in the child’s arm. This way, you
can create a combination of both formal and informal images.

Setting Up an Informal Portrait Studio
272
Nothing is more distracting than using a cluttered wall as a background.
Even a simple roll of seamless paper as a backdrop can do a lot to make your
portraits look more professional.
Selecting supports for lights, camera, and subjects
Good portraits really require lighting beyond the flash built into your digital
camera. In most cases, you need two or more external lights. And because
lights, cameras, and subjects all need to be moved from time to time, how
you support them is important. Supports need to be light enough to move
around easily, collapse small enough to be portable, and yet be sturdy and
solid enough to safely hold your gear.
You need different supports for lights, backgrounds, camera, and people. As
usual, the choices span all budgets and setups. Try to build a system that
will allow for future upgrades or studio expansions.
When planning your support system, aim for versatility and portability. Here
are some things to consider:
✦Lighting supports: Your lighting supports should be strong enough to
support an external lighting unit, up to and including a relatively heavy
flash with soft box or umbrella reflectors (more on these later, in the
upcoming section, “Lighting gadgets”). You want the supports to be
capable of raising the lights high enough to be effective. Look for light
stands capable of extending 6 to 7 feet high.
✦Camera support: A good, solid tripod that’s sturdy enough to support
your camera represents the starting point. If your setup is likely to call
for a lot of back-and-forth movement as you shift from individual to
group portraits, you might want to consider a camera dolly device — 
a kind of wagon — that lets you roll your camera/tripod rig back and
forth as needed.
✦Subject support: Posing your subjects is easier if you can have them 
sitting rather than standing (which is why portrait sessions are usually
known as sittings). The tool of choice for this sort of thing is the pneu-
matic posing stool. These stools are much easier to operate than
corkscrew-type chairs, which have to be spun to raise or lower them 
to the right height for portraiture. With a pneumatic stool, you simply
press a lever to control an air-driven piston that raises or lowers the
chair. At less than $100 each, they are reasonably affordable. A posing
table is also a useful option, particularly if you need to do a shot of 
a baby in his or her carrier. You don’t need to spring for these devices,
however: Stools and tables around the home can serve the same 
purpose.

If you do want to go with photo gear, you can find lots of different options at
most camera stores or advertised in many camera magazines. A good basic
setup includes at least one posing chair (preferably two), three light stands
(two capable of reaching 6 to 7 feet high and a third, shorter one), a mobile
tripod, a posing table, and posing blocks. Posing blocks are nesting wooden
blocks made in varying heights that are big enough for people to stand on.
Using these blocks helps you make people taller as needed to get the proper
posing relationships.
Figure 3-4 shows a bird’s-eye view of a full-blown portrait setup, including a
tripod-mounted digital camera, seamless backdrop paper, a light to provide
the main illumination, another light to fill in the shadows, and optional lights
to brighten the hair and background. In the center of it all is our victim,
seated on a folding chair (although a stool is often a much better choice).
Figure 3-4: Lighting, camera, and subject supports are all important parts of a studio setup.

Basic lighting equipment
Lighting your subject properly is one of the most challenging aspects of 
portrait photography. At your disposal are many different approaches to
lighting and also many different types of lighting resources.
A beginning photographer can definitely create a basic, inexpensive lighting
system capable of delivering high-quality results. Putting together a lighting
kit depends on your budget, what kinds of portraiture you hope to do, and
how big a percentage of your photography this kind of shooting is. Obviously,
the photographer who needs to shoot only the occasional portrait can get
by with a less-sophisticated setup than someone who wishes to focus mainly
on portraiture. Lighting choices fall into several different categories, as the
following sections make clear.
Existing light
Existing light is the light that’s already there in your environment — that is,
before you add flash or other extra light sources. It’s also called available
light — or, by wags, available darkness — but all three terms are misnomers.
After all, all light that you can use exists (unless you’re into quantum mechan-
ics, in which case, it only potentially exists until it’s observed). Available
light is equally murky: If you have an electronic flash or a flashlight in work-
ing order, both of those are technically available. However, I’ll apply those
terms to the light that’s already on a site, and not the kind of illumination
you’d use to photograph Shrödinger’s cat.
To make the most of existing light, consider these points:
✦Reflectors: Reflectors enable you to bounce light into areas of the scene
that need it. Any material that can bounce light into areas of heavy
shadow can help make existing light work in your favor. Whether your
reflector is an assistant holding a piece of foam board or a reflective disk
held in place by clamp and stand, this kind of illumination can be an
inexpensive and portable way of making your lighting better. Although
some pretty fancy (read expensive) reflectors are on the market, spend-
ing a lot isn’t necessary. A simple piece of white foam board does the job
beautifully. 
Use your main light source (daytime outdoors, that will be the sun) to
light a three-quarter section of your subject and then position the reflec-
tor to bounce sunlight onto the remaining quarter. This will lighten the
shadows and give a greater sense of dimension to your photo. If you
want a little less softness in the shadows, use a metallic reflector. You
can even press a metal serving tray into use, like the one shown in
Figure 3-5, if you can convince a friendly observer to hold it up for you.

Chapter 3

275
Figure 3-5: A metal serving tray can function as a reflector 
in a pinch.
✦Room lights: Sometimes your goal is the most natural possible setting
and feel to an image. If this means working without accessory lights,
managing the room’s lights properly can be a big help. If you can posi-
tion a lamp to throw a little more light to a shadow area, you can clean
up a heavy shadow. Or depending on the mood you’re aiming for, you
can bring your lights all to one side and have your subject emerging
from the shadows.
Working with available darkness is one of photography’s greatest challenges.
However, if you can use it successfully, you can produce exceptionally natural-
looking images. Look for ways to control the impact of the building’s lights;
remember, you don’t have to accept what’s there. Shift a lamp closer or far-
ther from your subject. Unscrew some light bulbs while leaving others on
or mask lighting fixtures with cardboard or gaffer’s tape (a special kind of
tape that won’t leave a residue when pulled off the lights when you’re done).
The difference is worth it. 
Figure 3-6 shows an outdoor snapshot taken in bright sunlight (at left). In the
version at right, the subject has been moved so that the sun isn’t glaring in
her face, and a reflector provides soft illumination and better skin tones.

276

Electronic flash
Accessory flash units are your first tool in the battle to correct undesirable
lighting conditions. These small, portable light sources provide you with a lot
of options and can be used to produce some amazing results. Photographers
using a multiple flash setup can produce lighting results similar to those found
in the studio. You can put together a small, three-flash lighting kit that can fit
in a small suitcase or carrying case. If you’re planning to put together such a
flash kit, here are some things to consider:
✦Supports (again): You definitely need some sort of system for holding
your flash units in position. Lightweight minitripods that can be set on
tabletops or other elevated surfaces and positioned as needed work
well. The marketplace has also produced a wide variety of clamps with
standard 3⁄8-inch tripod threads that can also hold a flash and be used to
position it high enough to work effectively. Some tripods also come with
feet or stands they can be mounted on so that they can be set erect on a
flat surface.
✦Light modifiers: After you position your flash units, make the quality of
your light as pleasing as possible. When used head-on, direct flash is
harsh, showing every flaw and imperfection. Experienced photogra-
phers solve this problem in a number of different ways. One solution is

Book IV
Chapter 3
Photographing
People
Setting Up an Informal Portrait Studio
277
bounce flash. Here, the flash units are pointed toward the ceiling, and 
the light is reflected back down to the subject, thus spreading and soft-
ening the light and making it more pleasing. Other tools for improving
the quality of light are devices that attach to the flash head and reflect
light (such as white cards) or ones that cover the flash head and soften
the light as it comes through the device (such as the Sto-Fen Omni Bounce
[www.stofen.com, about $20] or a small soft box, which is basically
nothing more than a piece of white cloth or other material stretched
over a frame).
✦Power: Keeping your flashes firing during a long shoot can be a daunting
task if you’re relying solely on AA batteries. Devices such as Quantum
rechargeable batteries (www.qtm.com, prices vary widely depending on
your model) can provide enough juice for your flash units to keep pace
even with your most frenetic shoots. Many of these units can provide
power to a pair of flashes simultaneously.
Two or three good flash units with some form of supporting gear and the
appropriate light modifiers can give you a very effective portable lighting
setup. Such a kit can give significantly better results than just a single flash
unit and is versatile enough to be useful in a variety of situations.
Photographic slaves — electronic units that trigger multiple flashes not con-
nected physically to the camera — are needed to fire the flashes with either
a photoelectric trigger or wireless radio transmitter.
Incandescent lights
Incandescent lighting is the same lighting most of us use to light our homes.
Enterprising manufacturers have created inexpensive photo lighting kits that
use regular light bulbs instead of more expensive tungsten-halogen lighting
setups.
Professional studio lighting
If you’re serious about portraiture, you might want to consider professional
studio lighting, which isn’t really all that expensive for the photo hobbyist
who spends a thousand dollars or so on a camera alone. Many digital cam-
eras are capable of firing expensive and high-quality studio lighting kits.
These kits, which use very powerful flash heads, provide a predictable,
steady light source.
There are several differences between these flash heads and the more
common accessory flash units that I discuss earlier. For a start, their power
output is measured in watt seconds (ws) versus the guide numbers (gn) that
on-camera flashes are usually measured in.

Setting Up an Informal Portrait Studio
278
Another difference is that these units draw too much power to get by on
either batteries or portable power packs. Instead, an electric outlet feeds
them either directly or via a separate power supply (which can usually feed
two or more lights at a time).
Using such a high-power system has several advantages:
✦More output: The nearly unlimited power supply means that you can get
greater light output. This enables the photographer to shoot at smaller
apertures (larger-numbered f-stops). The resulting greater depth-of-field
provided by smaller apertures means that you can shoot larger groups
of people and have them all in focus. Plus, you get sharper overall
images.
✦No recycle lags: You don’t have to wait for your lights to recycle. You can
blaze away taking shot after shot.
✦Flash previewing: You can take advantage of modeling lights, which are
incandescent lamps built into the studio flash that show exactly how the
light from the flash will look. Many of the higher-quality studio lights
have built-in modeling lights that stay on the whole time you’re working.
These lights aren’t as powerful as the main flash heads, but they do
show you where shadows will fall on your subject.
Use modeling lights to check for hot spots (bright specular reflections)
on eyeglasses.
✦More control: You have more control over lighting. You can set one light
for full power and another for a lower percentage of power output — the
full-power light acts as a main light while the second, less powerful light
simply fills in the shadows.
Studio lighting kits can range in price from a few hundred dollars for a set 
of lights, stands, and reflectors to thousands for a high-end lighting system
complete with all the necessary accessories. The good news is that you
don’t need the top-of-the-line system to produce top-of-the-line results.
Lighting gadgets
A huge assortment of lighting gadgets are on the market, all promising to be
easy to use and to produce a higher quality of light. For the most part, these
claims are reasonably true. Here’s a quick summary of what’s available, rang-
ing from useful and just about free all the way up to high-tech and pricey.
Inexpensive (or free!) gadgets
No such thing as a free lunch? Guess again! Check out these great ideas that
won’t blow your budget:

Book IV
Chapter 3

People

279
✦The White Card Trick: This is
the all-time classic. Set your
flash to bounce mode (point it 
at the ceiling) and take a 3-x-5-
inch index card or other card
and attach it to the flash with a
rubber band. Have the card
extend 3 or more inches beyond
the flash head. When you fire the
flash, some of the light bounces
off the ceiling while more light
kicks off the white card to
throw some light into your 
subject’s face. 
Figure 3-7 shows an electronic
flash that includes a built-in
“white card” and also a wide
angle diffusing lens to spread the
light even more. 
✦The Spoon Trick: If your supply
of index cards has been depleted,
you can always give The Spoon
Trick a try. Similar to the preced-
ing method, use a cheap, white plastic spoon in much the same way as
you would use an index card. Some photographers maintain that the cur-
vature of a spoon throws the light out in a curve to provide a more pleas-
ing effect. I’ve used both methods, and they both work pretty well. It’s
also pretty easy to carry some rubber bands, plastic spoons, and index
cards in your camera bag or find the stuff at most shooting locations.
✦The Aluminum Trick: A third version for those with just a hint of mechan-
ical ability is to take a piece of aircraft aluminum (white or copper col-
ored) and cut it in a roughly squarish or 3 x 5 shape. Use hook-and-loop
tape on the square and the back of your flash head. Store the card by
attaching it upside-down when not in use and then just pull it off, flip it,
and reattach for use. Although white is pretty standard, using a copper-
colored piece can warm the color of your light a little, which can be flat-
tering for portraits.
✦The Alcohol Bottle Trick: Just so it doesn’t look like all I know is differ-
ent versions of the White Card Trick, here’s one that’s a little different.
Get one of those white frosted plastic bottles of rubbing alcohol (one
whose waist is about the same diameter as your flash head). Remove the
alcohol (this is important), and then cut the bottom of the bottle about 
2 inches down the waist. Then snug the waist (the end with the bottom)
Figure 3-7: The White Card Trick provides fill
lighting.

Setting Up an Informal Portrait Studio
280
over the flash head. You can now shoot with the flash head angled almost
vertically with a much softer light. (The Alcohol Bottle Trick creates an
inexpensive alternative to a product known as the Sto-Fen Omni-Bounce,
described in the next group.)
✦The Clear 35mm Film Canister Trick: If you have only a small, fixed
flash — fixed as in it won’t pivot or tilt, not fixed as in repaired (but this
won’t work if the flash is broken either) — here’s another way to soften
and spread the light from it. Take a clear 35mm film canister (see
whether one of your less technologically advanced friends has one you
can get from them or try a camera store) and tape it over the flash head.
Variations of this trick involve placing a sheet of facial tissue inside the
film canister to diffuse (soften) the light a bit or using colored tissue
papers to change the color of the light the flash produces. This isn’t as
big a deal these days, when you can produce all sorts of similar effects
in an image-editing program. Still, if you’re not real comfortable trying
effects in the computer, this method lets you experiment while taking
the shot.
✦Flash brackets: Many department stores carry cheap, L-shaped flash
brackets. Your camera mounts onto the flash bracket, while your flash
fits into a flash mount at the top of the L. To use a setup like this, you
have to have some way of triggering your flash when it is not attached to
the camera. There are several ways to do this. If your camera has a PC/X
connection (and I don’t mean the way to connect it to your computer or
politically correct; I’m talking about a small circular electrical linkage, as
shown in the previous chapter), you connect your flash via a PC cable. A
second method is to use a photoelectric slave to trigger your accessory
flash unit. To do this, you use your camera’s built-in flash unit, perhaps
blocking most of its light output with gaffer’s tape or masking tape.
As you can see, you have many inexpensive ways of improving the quality of
your artificial light. Even the simple White Card Trick combined with bounced
flash gives you much better results than bombing away with direct flash. Keep
this method in mind even when your available light is enough for a good expo-
sure because the light kicked forward from the white card is a great way to fill
in shadows from ball caps and other similarly billed haberdashery items.
Moderately priced gadgets
For just a few pennies (well, maybe dollars) more, you can add the following
items to your lighting toolbox: 
✦Omni-Bounce: Sto-Fen (www.stofen.com) makes several inexpensive
light modifier devices. Best known is the Omni-Bounce, which is a
frosted plastic attachment that fits over the flash head and softens 
the light considerably. The device is used by setting the flash head to 

Book IV
Chapter 3

People

281
a 45-degree angle — unless your subject is more than 15 feet away, and
then you set the flash to fire straight-on. It costs about $20. The com-
pany also makes colored versions of the Omni-Bounce, which cost a few
dollars more.
✦Two-Way: Also made by Sto-Fen, the Two-Way bounce is a sturdier
approach to the White Card Trick and works in a similar manner. It also
costs about $20.
✦Barn doors: LumiQuest’s barn doors attachment fits several of its
bounce flash attachments. Barn doors are flat panels, like those shown
in Figure 3-8, that can be swung open and closed to more finely tune light
output.
✦LumiQuest attachments: LumiQuest (www.lumiquest.com) makes a
whole range of flash attachments offering a bunch of different capabili-
ties. These range from simple bounce hoods that kick the flash’s output
forward and spread it out to ones that perform very specialized functions.
Variations of the basic bouncer include attachments to allow some light
to bounce off the ceiling while the rest is kicked forward. Another ver-
sion sends the light through a frosted panel to soften it even more, and a
third variation permits insertion of colored panels to change the color of
the light that the flash produces while bouncing it.
Figure 3-8: Snoots (at left) and barn doors (at right) let you direct your lighting with more
precision.

Setting Up an Informal Portrait Studio
282
✦Soft boxes: A soft box is an attachment that mounts on the head of the
flash and extends out about 6 to 8 inches, with a frosted white panel at
the end. This attachment lets the light from the flash spread out a little
bit inside the soft box, softening it as it passes through the frosted end.
(Pro portrait studios often sport a similar but much larger version on
their studio flashes.) Lumiquest, as well as several other companies,
also make soft box attachments for portable flash units.
✦Snoots: LumiQuest also makes a snoot. (No, the company is not snooty,
it makes a snoot.) A snoot is a tube-like device (see Figure 3-8) that focuses
the flash’s light to a very small area. Photographers often use a snoot to
create a highlight on someone’s hair.
✦Flash brackets: Moderately priced flash brackets tend to be sturdier
than their inexpensive counterparts. Plus, they usually tend to lift the
flash higher up above the camera. Otherwise, things work pretty much
the same way.
A decent light modifier can be a pleasure to work with, can significantly
improve your photos, and needn’t cost you an arm and a leg. You’ll find that
many can be had for less than $50. A wide variety of choices are available,
depending on your needs. For photographers who work mainly out of a
camera bag, a small, collapsible light modifier is a better choice than one of
the bigger, more cumbersome units. Those who work from a home studio are
better off with one of the bigger soft boxes that give a nice-quality light.
Higher-priced gadgets
I’m not talking thousands of dollars here, but costs for the following items
can still add up a bit. (Note: Quality rises with the price.)
✦Soft boxes: Some companies make a fancier soft box attachment that
mounts on the flash head via spring-loaded clips. These devices are
bigger and feature a deeper well for the light to spread out in before 
hitting the frosted panel. They also tend to be sturdier than the less
expensive versions.
✦Umbrella units: Another option is to mount your flash on a combination
flash stand with photographic umbrella, like the one shown in Figure 3-9.
This kind of rig lets you set up a multiple-flash lighting system that pro-
duces very pleasing lighting without the expense of buying portrait
studio flash heads. Usually, these devices need to be triggered via some
form of slave. The price is about $100.
You can also get by with real umbrellas as long as they’re plain white
with no pattern. Fold-up umbrellas are inexpensive and easy to carry. 
I pay less than $5 for mine, not including clamps to fix them to light
stands or other supports. If one gets dirty, just throw it away and use a

new one. The chief disadvantage is that these translucent rain-stoppers
let as much light through as they reflect. In fact, you might have better
luck using them to illuminate your subject by the light that leaks through
the umbrella rather than bounces off.
Figure 3-9: Umbrellas make good reflectors.
✦Flash brackets: Examples in this category tend to be very sturdy and
can extend the flash as much as one foot or more higher than the camera.
Some offer expanded capabilities, such as the ability to accept a flash
umbrella, making for a heavy but versatile rig. Many of the more expen-
sive units, such as several made by Stroboframe, offer the ability to
rotate the camera and/or flash for vertical orientation. Go to the follow-
ing Web site for more information about Stroboframe products:
www.tiffen.com/products.html?tablename=stroboframe
If you’re serious about using your digital camera for portrait photography,
the equipment mentioned here adds a lot of bang for your buck. The umbrella
rigs tend to be better for studio setups, whereas the soft boxes and heavy-
duty flash brackets stay manageable for photographers who do most of their
work on the road.

Lighting Basics
284
Choosing power sources
Keeping your portrait flash units supplied with power is a key to effective
flash photography. You have several ways of getting juice to your flash heads,
and they vary in both price and effectiveness. Don’t skimp here if you expect
to rely on your flashes. The wrong choice will cost you images and make you
miserable. Choose from these power sources:
✦AA batteries: These are the standard power source for your average
accessory flash unit. The advantages are that they’re inexpensive and
can be found almost anywhere. You can choose from alkaline, lithium,
and standard types. Alkaline and lithium are better choices because they
recycle faster than the standard type. Rechargeable versions are avail-
able in several different versions, including nickel-cadmium (NiCads),
alkalines, and nickel metal-hydride (NiMH). The big disadvantage to all
of these is that they drain fairly quickly, leaving you to frantically change
batteries while hoping you don’t miss a shot.
✦Portable battery packs: Several different manufacturers make high-
capacity portable battery packs that can provide power for a wide 
variety of flash units. The best-known manufacturer is Quantum, which
makes several different styles along with adapters for most current flash
units. Although these rigs are much more expensive than AAs (figure
between $150 and $200 for a new battery pack and flash module), they
can power tons of flash cycles before running out of juice. They also
keep your flash firing longer during motor drive bursts (although not
indefinitely).
A good, portable power pack can provide enough juice to power a couple of
flash units through a wedding, prom, or public affairs event. Having one
available can really make your life easier.
Lighting Basics
The idea behind using artificial light is to provide enough illumination to
adequately light your subject in a pleasing manner. The simplest, most basic
method is to use a single flash — preferably with some form of light modifi-
cation or bouncing — with the flash unit raised higher than the camera.
There are several ways to maximize the effectiveness of a one-light photo-
graphic system. First and foremost is to get the flash higher than the camera.
The closer the flash is to the lens, the greater the likelihood of red-eye (that
nasty red glare that appears in the eyes when light bounces off the subject’s
retina), so extending your flash unit’s height helps your photography quite a
bit. Ways to do this include

Book IV
Chapter 3

People
Lighting Basics
285
✦The ol’ Statue of Liberty play: Use an off-camera shoe cord (an intelli-
gent cord that communicates between the camera and dedicated flash
unit to retain the camera’s ability to meter light through the lens) or a 
PC cord to lift the flash high above the camera. Then either point the
light directly at your subject or bounce it off the ceiling.
✦L-brackets: Use an L-bracket — or something based on an L-bracket
design, such as a Stroboframe grip — to raise the flash up above the
camera.
✦Use a flash stand with an umbrella reflector: This requires either a long
PC cord or a wireless transmitter to trigger the flash unit.
One advantage of getting the flash higher than the camera is that it re-creates
the single high light source that you’re used to seeing naturally — the sun. A
second advantage is that by getting the flash higher than the camera and at 
a higher angle, you reduce the likelihood of red-eye. That’s because red-eye
is caused by a flash reflecting straight back off the retina of the eye into the
camera lens. When the light strikes the back of the eye at a higher angle, it’s
reflected downward and away from the lens.
Using multiple light sources
A more advanced but still basic lighting system calls for multiple lights
arranged in one of several possible ways. Although a multiple-light system
doesn’t re-create the natural light of the sun, you can create a very pleasing
and effective lighting package.
Advantages of a multiple-light system include
✦Precise control over how much illumination you provide for a scene:
Even if your lights are more powerful than you want, you can add screens
to reduce output or shift your lights farther back.
✦More control over the mood of the image: You can control the location
and intensity of shadows and highlights, which can affect the overall
mood of the image, whether it’s stark and full of contrast or soft and
moody.
✦An adaptable lighting kit: You can adapt your lighting kit to a wide vari-
ety of shoots and to any number of subjects. Some lighting kits are even
versatile enough to be brought on location.
Multiple lighting setups can mean the difference between an adequate por-
trait photo and a good one. Although a multilight setup doesn’t guarantee
better quality, getting the hang of such an arrangement will do a lot to
improve your portrait photography.

Lighting Basics
286
Arranging a multiple-light setup
After you decide you want to use a multiple-light setup, you need to know
where to put it. Setting up a multiple-light system isn’t very hard; it’s just a
question of positioning your lights to illuminate your subject attractively.
With a multiple-light setup, each light has a different role to play. Under-
standing the basic arrangement helps you get started down the road to good
portrait photography.
Main light
Surprise, surprise. This is your primary light source. The main light provides
most of the illumination for your subject. An effective two-light studio system
can even be set up with a big main light firing straight on your subject through
a big soft box (not the kind that mounts on an accessory flash, but a big
studio model about 18 inches tall and 36 inches wide) with a second back
light to separate your subject from the background (more on back lights in
minute).
This principle also works with a smaller shoe-mount flash and soft box, 
but the quality of the light won’t compare with that of the studio system.
Generally, the difference is noticeable when you’re trying to shoot larger
groups or doing a lot of sittings. For an occasional small group and a limited
number of exposures, the small portable system does the job pretty well.
The following list fills you in on some ways to maximize the effectiveness of
your main light:
✦Get it up high. Your main light should be higher than your subject. You
don’t have to be ridiculous here; keeping the light about a foot or so
higher than your tallest subject will do the trick.
✦Make an effort to improve the quality of your light. You can do this
either via a soft box or by using an umbrella system.
✦Provide enough power to shoot at a small aperture, thus giving you
greater depth of field. Because shooting through a soft box or off an
umbrella costs you some light, you need a lot of power to shoot a big
group at f/11 or f/16.
✦Recycle quickly. How quickly your main light recycles (recharges so
that it can be ready to fire again) is very important. You want your lights
to keep pace with your workflow, not the other way around. During a sit-
ting, it’s important to develop a rhythm with your clients while posing
and photographing them. A break in that rhythm, particularly one caused
by your lights not being ready, can make your life difficult.

Lighting Basics
287
You want your main light to provide a soft, even illumination with enough
power to keep your subject in focus from front to back. Most often, the main
light is set up a couple of feet to the right or left of your subject’s center line
and angled toward that center. Figure 3-10 shows a portrait subject illumi-
nated by a main light off to the right of the subject.
Fill light
The fill light is the light that fills in the shadow areas created by the main light,
as you can see in Figure 3-10. For the most versatile system, plan on using the
same model flash for your fill light as you do for your main light. This gives
you the option of setting the same power ratios — the settings on your flash
that reduce or increase the amount of light emitted — for each light. Such a
lighting system with two comparable lights about 6 feet apart angled toward
the center point of your sitting enables you to build up your group size with-
out having to reconfigure your lighting — which is a huge advantage if you’re
doing a large number of portraits during the course of a day.
Just because you can bomb both flash heads away at their highest power
settings and create an even light doesn’t mean that you have to. You can
always dial down the power setting on your second flash head and create a
more interesting lighting effect for your subject. Experiment with 2:1 and 3:1
power ratios to see which you prefer.
If you have a fill light that doesn’t let you reduce or increase the power, try
moving the flash back a bit or perhaps placing a diffuser (such as a handker-
chief) over the flash. Thanks to your digital camera’s review feature, you can
quickly see whether you’ve reduced the amount of light enough.
Here are some tips for setting up your fill light:
✦Your fill light should be roughly the same height as your main light,
although slightly lower is okay.
✦The fill light should also receive some kind of modification, via an
umbrella, a soft box, or a diffusion screen (a thin screen-like material that
diffuses or softens the light).
The fill light helps balance your portrait lighting and creates a sense of depth
to your image. Used properly, it can also create a moody or romantic image
through the carefully controlled play of shadows. 
Hair light
A hair light is a small, carefully controlled light that puts a highlight on the
subject’s hair. This type of lighting can also be referred to as a kind of rim
lighting (described later in this chapter.)

Lighting Basics
288
Figure 3-10: A fill light brightens the shadows.
Most often, hair light is controlled via either a snoot or through a barn doors
attachment on a flash head. (See the earlier section, “Moderately priced
gadgets,” for more on snoots and barn doors.) The light itself doesn’t need
to be particularly powerful because it’s responsible for lighting only a small
area. Most often, a hair light is positioned closely to the subject (just out of
the camera’s view) via a boom (raised arm attached to a lighting stand) that
allows it to reach into the portrait area from up high.
To use a hair light, position it so that the light is directed almost straight
back into the camera, raking across the top of the subject’s head, as shown
in Figure 3-11. The hair light is emphasized in this example for clarity, but
would be more subtle in your final portrait.

Figure 3-11: A hair light emphasizes the edge of the head.
Background light
A background light, as its name suggests, lights up the background and cre-
ates some separation between the subject and background by making the
background lighter than the main subject.
This light is generally mounted on a small lighting stand and is pointed
upward at the background; a small screen is usually mounted on the light to
help spread the light over the backdrop. Be careful to position it so that the
lighting stand stays hidden behind your subject.

Lighting Basics
290
When using the background light, keep the following tips in mind:
✦Set the background light about 2 feet from the backdrop and about 2 to
3 feet off the ground.
✦Try to keep your background light on a separate power circuit than your
main and fill lights. Because the main, fill, and background lights are usu-
ally the most powerful lights in your setup, having them on the same
power supply or circuit will probably stress your power source more
than it can handle.
✦Angle the background light upward about 45 degrees so that the light
spreads upward and outward from below your subject(s).
✦Mount a diffusion screen (which can be as simple as a handkerchief or
any other diffusing material) on the light head to soften it as it spreads
up the backdrop. Using the screen helps prevent the light from creating
a hot spot (those annoying bright areas that can crop up in a background
if the light isn’t spread evenly).
Adding a background light to your portrait setup makes for a cleaner, more
pleasing portrait — like the one shown in Figure 3-12 — because it helps 
separate your subjects from the background. Although hardly the most
important light in your setup, your subjects can get lost in a dark back-
ground without a background light.
Additional light sources
Using the four lights discussed in the preceding sections will take care of the
majority of lighting situations, but they’re certainly not the only tools to
create interesting lighting. For some neat alternatives, try one (or more) of
the following:
✦Reflectors: Rather than using a fill light, a photographer sometimes
bounces light from an angled main light into a reflector positioned near
the model but still outside the picture area. This can be a good solution
if you don’t own a second electronic flash.
✦Window lighting: Another charming source of light can be the nearest
window. Window-lit portraits require a bright, sunny day with sunlight
pouring through the window. Position your subject on a chair near the
window. Make sure that your digital camera takes its exposure reading
from the portion of his or her cheek that’s illuminated by the sunlight.
If done properly, your subject appears to emerge from the shadows
bathed in a golden glow. A variation of this lighting technique is to use
a reflector to kick some light back into the shadow area so that some
detail is returned to the side that doesn’t receive sunlight.

Chapter 3

People
Lighting Basics
291
Figure 3-12: A background light separates the subject(s) from 
the background (natch!).
✦Sun and fill: A typical example of this form of lighting is the swimsuit
model at the beach. The model is positioned so the early morning sunlight
acts as the main light, and a reflector is positioned to direct some light
into the shadow areas. This is a very nice style of lighting; unfortunately,
it requires you to get up early!
The latter two methods can produce some beautiful lighting but are hard to
use for groups or a large number of sittings. It can be hard to schedule a sit-
ting for this kind of lighting technique, too.

Basic Lighting Techniques for Shooting Multiple Sittings Quickly

Basic Lighting Techniques for Shooting 
Multiple Sittings Quickly
If you understand the basic lighting equipment and how it’s used (which I
describe in the previous sections), you’re ready to discover common tech-
niques that you can apply with main, fill, background, and hair lights. In this
section and the next, I describe several different lighting techniques, each
with its own advantages and disadvantages. Although you can set up a basic
lighting style that produces an even, acceptable light that works for a variety
of situations, doing so doesn’t necessarily bring out the best in your subject.
Still, you might find yourself in a situation that calls for you to photograph 
a large number of setups as efficiently as possible. Such jobs — weddings,
church directories, and proms, to name a few — come up quite often and
call for photographers to shoot lots of different setups (which photogra-
phers call sittings) quickly.
Keep the following basic lighting setups in mind for those times when you
have to shoot a lot of sittings as efficiently as possible:
✦Set up your main light straight down the center and use a big soft box to
spread and soften the quality of the light. Set up a second light as a
background light, and you’re good to go. Depending on the size of your
soft box, the power of your main flash head, the size of your backdrop,
and your posing resources, you can easily light a 15- or 16-person group.
There’s not a lot of flexibility to this setup, though.
✦Use a three-light arrangement with a pair of identical flash heads firing
into umbrella reflectors as your main and fill lights. Set both flash heads
for the same power output so that you don’t have to worry about rear-
ranging your subjects according to shadows. Set your lights up about
6 feet apart, with each pointed toward the center posing spot, and
about 4 or 5 feet up from your subject.
These basic lighting setups will get you started. You can take a nice, 
professional-looking portrait with either of these lighting arrangements, but
your portraits won’t look much different from those of the photo studio
at your local department store.
Advanced Lighting Techniques 
for More Outstanding Portraits
Which lighting technique you choose depends on your subjects’ features.
One style of lighting can flatter a person’s face while showing another’s
poorly. Each technique can be created with a basic three-light lighting kit.

As you increase your photographic capabilities, effectively using more-
advanced lighting techniques can help you stand apart from the MegaMart
down the block.
Short lighting
Two forms of advanced lighting techniques rely on turning your subject’s
head so that his or her face isn’t staring directly into the camera. One of
these is short lighting, where the main light source comes from the side of the
face directed away from the camera, as shown in Figure 3-13. (The other is
broad lighting, which I discuss in the following section.) Sometimes referred
to as narrow lighting, short lighting is a valuable lighting style because it
tends to narrow overly broad faces.
Figure 3-13: Short lighting narrows broad faces.

Advanced Lighting Techniques for More Outstanding Portraits
294
To set up a short lighting arrangement, do the following:
1. Turn your subject’s face so that it’s angled somewhat to the right or
left of the camera (not too much, though; this isn’t supposed to be a
profile shot).
When you do this, the side of the face you can see more of is the broad
side of the face; the side you see less of is the short or narrow side of 
the face.
2. Set up your main light to illuminate the short side of the subject’s 
face and then add a fill light or reflector to fill in some light on the
broad side of the face.
3. Add a fill light to separate your subject from the background for 
a good three-light setup and add a hair light for a four-light 
configuration.
Short lighting is a particularly nice form of lighting for the female face
because it accentuates the eyes, cheeks, nose, and mouth in an attractive
way. This style of lighting can also be used to make a broad male face look
thinner.
Broad lighting
Broad lighting, as shown in Figure 3-14, is pretty much the reverse of short
lighting. It widens narrow or thin faces by emphasizing the side of the face
turned toward the camera. Here, the subject’s face receives the main light 
on its broad side, with a fill or reflector used to lighten or eliminate the shad-
ows on the short side.
This is a useful lighting technique for thin faces, but use it carefully with
women, who may not appreciate having their faces widened — even if you
think the look would be more flattering.
To set up a broad lighting arrangement, do the following:
1. Turn your model’s face so that the main light illuminates the broader
side of the face.
2. Use your reflector to bounce some light into the shadow areas of your
subject’s face.
Be careful with this lighting technique because it can make a normal face
seem very full.

Figure 3-14: Broad lighting widens narrow or thin faces.
Butterfly lighting
An even more glamorous style of lighting that works well for posing women
is butterfly lighting, as shown in Figure 3-15. This type of lighting creates a
subtle butterfly of light with the bridge of the nose as the axis for the “wings”
of light that spread over the eyes and cheeks.
To set up for this type of lighting, configure your lights as follows:

Advanced Lighting Techniques for More Outstanding Portraits
296
1. Position your main light straight onto your subject, high above his or
her eyes, with the light pointed directly on the nose.
This is what enables the light to spread out in the butterfly pattern.
2. Use a background light to separate your subject from the backdrop.
This style of lighting doesn’t work as well for men because it tends to throw
too much light on the ears. Butterfly lighting should always be considered
for a female subject, although that doesn’t mean you always need to choose
this style. If you use it with a girl or woman who has short hair, the same
problem with the ears can occur.

Backlighting
Backlighting, also known as rim lighting, can create an almost magical glow
or halo-like effect for your subject. An example of backlighting is shown in
Figure 3-16.
Figure 3-16: Backlighting is dramatic.
This lighting style calls for your main light to be placed behind the subject
while a fill light prevents the face from falling into shadow. The result is a rim
of light highlighting your subject’s form.

Preparing to Take Your First Portraits
298
Here are some ways of using this lighting style:
✦Full backlighting: In this technique, the main light is positioned directly
behind the subject, about even with the subject’s head. Check your 
composition carefully to make sure that the light is hidden from the
camera’s view.
✦Side rim lighting: Here you’re trying for just a hint of backlighting to
add some glow to one side of the head. This is similar to hair lighting.
In this case, though, use a small light rather than your main light. Set up
a small light with a snoot (a conical light modifier discussed earlier in this
chapter; refer to Figure 3-8) on a boom pointed at the side of the head,
away from the camera. If you don’t have a boom arm, try using a light
stand as close to your model as possible while keeping it out of the shot.
Practice this technique and get the hang of it. Rim lighting and backlighting
are valuable lighting techniques for certain types of portraiture, such as a
bride’s portrait. Just be careful not to overdo it.
Preparing to Take Your First Portraits
Studio portraiture is about making your subjects look as they would like to
appear — not necessarily as they really are. When you’re setting up your
poses, reflect upon how to make people look their best.
A good portrait photographer inspires confidence not only in himself but
also in the client. The better you can make a person who’s posing for you
feel about how they look, the better her pose — and the better her feeling
about the whole portrait experience. This works in your favor because your
subject will likely be interested in buying your photographs. This section
provides the basic information you need to get started.
Working on a tight schedule
People pose for portraits for different reasons and in different situations. If
you’re working on a tight schedule with a lot of sittings in a relatively brief
period of time (say a wedding or church directory shoot), you don’t have a
lot of time to get to know your subjects or establish a rapport, especially for
a family. Instead, consider a routine that works something like this:
1. Pose the family.
Have Mom seated and Dad as one of the side elements in the diamond
pose. (See the sidebar, “The diamond pose,” elsewhere in this chapter.)
Then build the rest of the pose with the other family member(s).
2. Shoot the family portrait.

Book IV
Chapter 3
Photographing
People

3. Pull the kids from the family pose.
4. Keep Mom and Dad in place and photograph their portrait.
5. Pull Mom and Dad from the sitting and set the kids up into a new dia-
mond pose (depending on how many kids you need to photograph).
Usually, it’s best to pose a group of male children in a line from tallest 
to shortest. If there’s a sister or two, seat the eldest boy and pose the
eldest girl as the next diamond element with her hands on his shoulder.
6. Ask the parents for any special poses they would like.
Don’t be afraid to take special requests; they’re usually very likely to be
appreciated.
When you’re doing large numbers of portraits (after word gets out about
how good you are, you’re bound to be the hit of the next family reunion!),
strive for the most efficient posing setup and flow possible. People who are
sitting around in their finery waiting to be photographed can get pretty
grumpy, particularly if there’s more than one group waiting. A typical pose,
using the diamond configuration, is shown in Figure 3-17.
Figure 3-17: You end up with an attractive pose like this one when using the diamond
arrangement.

With most families, Mom is usually the decision maker when it comes to
family portraits. Make sure you keep her happy. Have brushes, combs, and
lint brushes on hand so that everyone can make sure they look their best.
Try to be flexible enough for a special request because sometimes these can
be very profitable. I was once part of a team shooting portraits for a church
directory when a husband mentioned that he and his new wife never had a
wedding portrait done. We suggested that they come back after our shoot-
ing schedule was done in their best suit and wedding gown, and we’d do a
series of portraits for them. The couple loved the idea, and we spent an hour
creating different poses and portraits and ended up with a huge order! Most
importantly, we accomplished this without inconveniencing other members
of the church and gained a reputation for enthusiasm and service amongst
that particular church’s members.
When you have more time
If you’re working under a more generous time schedule and aiming for a
higher-end product, take the time to make your subjects comfortable and
see what they’re looking for in a portrait sitting.
Although you might still be looking at the basic family portrait package
(family, couple, children), it’s also very possible that each family member
might need individual portraits as well. This could be the time to bring out
more specialized types of lighting, such as the broad lighting and short 
lighting discussed earlier in this chapter.
Be sure to offer your clients some extra poses for each family member, par-
ticularly for those kids who go for a variety of sports in a big way. Have
props such as soccer balls, baseball gear, footballs and helmets, and other
such items on hand.
Here are some of the kinds of groups to expect:
✦Husbands and wives: Offer husbands and wives the basic couples pose,
but also suggest a second pose that illustrates their love and commit-
ment to each other (standing close, gazing into each other’s eyes).
Depending on their age and demeanor, a more whimsical pose, like the
one shown in Figure 3-18, might also be in order. If you want a whimsical
pose, having the husband get down on one knee to re-create his mar-
riage proposal while the wife “thinks” about it can be cute.
✦Kids: A brother and sister can be posed in a diagonal with the boy seated
and the girl angled behind him with her hands folded on his shoulder.
This is a basic couples pose, but the relationship issue isn’t important.
If you have two posing stools, you can seat both diagonally one behind
the other. A pose that works with two boys is to have them sit back to
back with their heads turned toward the camera.

✦Mothers and daughters: Seat Mom and have her daughters arranged 
in the appropriate number of elements for a diamond pose. Another
option — if you have the posing boxes to do so — is to seat Mom on a
posing stool and have a daughter or two seated at her knee. A third
daughter (the eldest) would be diagonally behind Mom with her hands
on Mom’s shoulder. If I had them, I’d load the scene with flowers.
✦Fathers and sons: A simple pose would be to seat Dad and build a dia-
mond around him. A more adventurous pose would be to have Dad stand-
ing slightly sideways with his off-camera hand in his pocket looking at
his son(s) posed about a foot away (one diagonally behind the other)
while one tosses a ball in the air (the sons watch the ball; Dad watches
the sons). A simpler variation would be to have the sons remove their
suit jackets (if this is a dressy portrait) and sling them over their shoul-
ders (off-camera side) while Dad regards them with arms folded across
his chest (still properly attired).
✦Infants: For a fancy pose, look for an old-fashioned baby buggy or other
such prop. A lot of choices are available, including simulated giant sea-
shells for the baby to sit in or bearskin rugs to lie on. Generally, how you
pose an infant depends on his or her age and physical abilities, such as
whether or not the infant can sit up unsupported. Babies younger than
six weeks old usually can’t focus their eyes on any specific point, so they
present a special challenge. Usually, it’s best to leave them in their car-
rier and go for a reasonably tight shot.
The diamond pose
Diamonds are a photographer’s best friend.
Professional portrait photographers use a dia-
mond formation as their basic foundation for a
group photo. Establish your anchor person (usu-
ally the mother in a family portrait) and seat him
or her. Place the father (or second individual)
behind the anchor and halfway to the side.
Elevate the seated person so the top of his/her
head is level with the nose of the standing
person. Have the standing person place his or
her hands one on top of the other, slightly
angled on the seated person’s shoulder. (This is
the basic pose for a couple, by the way.) Then
do the same with the third person to balance
the trio. (This gives you a basic pose for three
people.) Place the fourth person directly behind
the first person and positioned so that the heads
of Subjects 2 and 3 come up to the nose of the
fourth person. (Have sturdy wooden boxes or
blocks of varying sizes for people to stand on.)
Have Subjects 2–4 lean slightly forward from
the waist so that their faces are as close as
possible to being on the same plane as the first
person. Avoid gaps between bodies, and make
sure that people are close to each other. This
basic posing system is expandable to fit 20
people or more.

As a general rule, pose multiple people closer together than they would nor-
mally stand if left to personal space comfort levels. Your goal is to maximize
the use of space by filling the frame as effectively as possible with people,
not backdrop or props. This doesn’t mean that you’re doing nothing but
headshots, though. If you’re doing a wedding or prom shoot, people will be
in their finest clothes, and showing that clothing is appropriate. Certainly,
the bride in her wedding gown deserves at least one photo that shows her
entire dress, including the train.
Shooting the Portrait
Now that the previous section has made you more comfortable shooting 
portraits, you’re ready to begin. Your first family enters your studio ready 
to have a portrait taken. After you exchange pleasantries, be sure to point
them in the direction of the mirrors and check their appearance for any last-
second adjustments.
Seating your subjects
When everyone’s ready, begin arranging the sitting. Start by seating the
mother and build your diamond around her. Make sure each person is
sitting or standing up straight. (Place your hand on the front of a shoulder
and two fingers at the base of the spine and apply gentle pressure to
straighten them up.)
Have your subjects focus their eyes slightly to one side of the lens. Have
them bring their chins up slightly so they’re looking slightly up and away
from the camera.
While seating your subjects, remember the following:
✦Make sure that your subjects are sitting up straight. Slouching just
doesn’t look flattering to anyone.
✦Check to make sure clothing is as wrinkle-free as possible. Tug suit
jackets to straighten out wrinkles if need be.
✦Use your modeling lights (if you have them) to make sure you mini-
mize the glare from eyeglasses as much as possible. No one wants to
look like Little Orphan Annie with no eyes.
✦Provide a mirror, as shown in Figure 3-19, so your subjects can check
themselves over just before you take the picture. Knowing they look
good helps people relax.

Figure 3-19: Putting every hair in place.
Use this time to get your subjects in position and into the right mood for the
portrait. Remember to stay positive and encouraging. Be sure to tell them
they look good. Crack a few jokes while positioning people to keep them
relaxed, too.
Posing your subjects
In order to properly pose your subjects, keep in mind that you are dealing
with two separate tasks: positioning them in such a way to make them look
their best and creating a pose that’s not too unbearable to maintain for sev-
eral minutes.

Book IV
Chapter 3

People
Shooting the Portrait
305
Start out by posing the lowest seated person, as follows:
1. Pose the bottom person in the diamond so that he or she is comfort-
ably seated on a posing stool; elevate the person’s legs so they are at a
right angle to his or her body.
2. Place a small posing box for the subject to place his feet on for best
comfort while he is holding the pose.
3. Angle the subject so that he is at about a 45-degree angle to the
camera lens.
Make sure this subject is comfortable in the basic pose because he has to
hold the pose longer than anyone else. I usually put the mother in this posi-
tion for these reasons:
✦She looks natural as the base of the diamond. 
✦She’s usually trying to set a good example for the rest of her family.
✦If she’s already in the pose, she can’t meddle with your work with the
rest of her family. (Don’t underestimate this reason, whatever you do.)
With your first person in place, it’s time to move on to Subject 2:
1. Set the second person on a posing stool angled behind the first person.
Normally, this would be the father, but there are no hard and fast rules
here. Position him so that his head is properly oriented in relation to the
mother within the diamond pose.
2. Have your subject place his on-camera hand (the hand facing the
camera) on his hip.
Be forewarned: Couples are always trying to put their arms around each
other’s waists. Don’t let them; it’s touching, but it doesn’t photograph
well. If dealing with spouses or a couple in a relationship, let them put
their off-camera hand on their partner’s hip out of sight of the camera.
3. Have the second subject lean slightly into the first person so that you
don’t have any gaps between their bodies.
Make sure both are still sitting up straight. If a gap exists, you can turn the
stools slightly to bring the shoulders a little more square to the camera
and close the gap. You can also slide the chairs a little closer together.
Keep in mind that the pose you’re setting up with the husband and wife (or
whatever significant pair you’re posing) also makes an excellent pose for
when you do the couple’s portrait. Don’t let them get up when the family/
group shot is done, or you’ll just have to re-create this pose all over again.

Shooting the Portrait
306
After you have Mom and Dad posed, add the kids. Start with Kid 1:
1. Place the smallest child on the bottom person’s other side, using a
posing box to raise her up to an appropriate height.
2. Turn the third subject toward the bottom person (roughly at the same
angle as the second subject).
3. Move the third subject so that he or she is about halfway behind the
bottom sitter.
The second and third subjects should be close together, but it isn’t
mandatory that their shoulders touch. Just avoid a gap between those
two posers and the bottom subject.
You’ve set the base for a diamond pose and created a good three-person sit-
ting. Remember to keep the relationship between the three heads consistent
so that a line drawn across Subject 2 and Subject 3’s faces travels over their
eyes. Their mouths should be even with the first poser’s eyes.
Now add Subject 4:
1. Place your fourth person behind Subjects 2 and 3 and raise him or her
up (if necessary) by using a posing box.
Subject 4 fills any gap between Subjects 2 and 3, which is why it wasn’t
that important to squeeze them in tight.
2. Square Subject 4’s shoulders toward the camera.
3. Adjust the height of Subject 4 so that his or her mouth is on a line with
the eyes of Subjects 2 and 3. Have Subject 4 lean slightly into the others.
That last little part about leaning is important. Ideally, you want all the faces
in the same plane for the best possible focus. Even when shooting at f/11 or
f/16, it’s still better to have all faces on a line for best appearance. After you
get everyone lined up properly, check your modeling lights to make sure that
no one is casting shadows somewhere they shouldn’t be.
If you need to pose more than four individuals, take the following guidelines
to heart:
✦Use the topmost person in your original diamond as the base person
for another diamond group.
This lets you add three more people the same way you added Subjects 2
through 4.
✦If you have more than seven sitters, start building diamonds outward
by using the left- or right-most person in the lower diamond as the
side anchor of a new diamond.

Book IV
Chapter 3

307
✦As you build your additional diamonds, take care to make sure that
everyone’s faces line up properly in the same focal plane.
✦Make sure that everyone is on steady ground.
As more and more people stand on posing blocks, your group’s inherent sta-
bility suffers. You don’t want to see them collapse into your backdrop and
lights.
Working with a large group is a difficult challenge because the number of
variables increases to almost unmanageable numbers. Take a moment before
setting up the pose to do a little planning.
Visualize the group pose before you start assembling it to avoid wasted time
and effort after you get started. Take a moment to explain to the whole group
that you’re going to take a lot of shots of the group pose to maximize your
chances of getting an exposure with as many good expressions as possible.
Arranging your lighting
Create a triangle with your base posing stool as its apex. Set up your main
light and fill light about 6 feet apart and 6 feet from the posing stool.
Position your background light about 2 feet behind the posing stool and then
position the background approximately 1 to 2 feet from the background light.
If you’re using a hair light, position the light angled about 45 degrees behind
the subject’s head pointed toward the camera. Take a moment to check 
your viewfinder to make sure that no part of the hair light protrudes into 
the photograph. (Read about positioning a hair light in the earlier section,
“Hair light.”)
Taking the picture
After setting up the lights and arranging your subjects, start thinking about
taking the picture.
I recommend triggering the camera via a remote so that you can maintain
eye contact with your subjects. Many digital cameras (both professional and
point-and-shoot types) offer some method of triggering the shutter without
tripping the shutter button. If yours doesn’t, you can still fire the camera via
the shutter button while looking over the camera at your subjects.
Before tripping the shutter, go through this very quick checklist:
1. Is everyone standing up straight?
2. Are their heads properly arranged so that their faces are directed toward
the camera?

Advantages of Digital Cameras
308
3. Is everyone looking either directly toward the camera lens or in the
direction you’ve designated? (Some poses may look better if you have
your subjects looking slightly past the lens.)
4. Is everyone smiling?
Be ready to work fast. Holding a pose is a tiring chore. People lose their
patience if you take too long to trip the shutter, so be ready to run through
the checklist quickly.
Don’t be afraid to stop and correct someone who’s relaxed his or her pose. It
doesn’t do you any good to trip the shutter if someone doesn’t look good.
I usually hold the remote behind my back when tripping the shutter during a
portrait session in order to keep people from realizing I’m about to take the
picture. This is important for two reasons:
✦I don’t want to give people a reason to shift their eyes in the direction of
my hand when I’m taking the shot.
✦Many people anticipate the flash firing and blink their eyes when the
lights fire.
Remember to keep watching your subjects as you trip the shutter. You can
usually catch any blinkers and know that you need to take another shot.
Advantages of Digital Cameras
Digital cameras offer you many advantages in portrait photography. Most
important of all is the chance for the photographer to review the pose before
the subjects leave. Because you can spot problems before your victims
skedaddle, you have a chance to correct them while everyone’s still there.
Another huge advantage of the digital camera is that it gives you a chance
to make sales while your customers are still excited from their sitting and
still in high spirits after all that positive feedback you’ve been giving them.
(You have been giving them positive feedback, haven’t you?)
Film photographers have to factor the cost of film, processing, and making
proofs into their costs of doing business, thus driving up their margins. As a
digital photographer, you can afford to take all the shots you want without
damaging your bottom line (provided you have enough media to get you
through a long shooting session, of course).
Learn to use your digital camera’s review feature to its best effect. Here’s a
list of some of the things you should analyze as you play back your shot:

Book IV
Chapter 3

Advantages of Digital Cameras
309
✦Make sure that the photo is properly focused. Although you can’t be
dead sure while reading your camera’s LCD screen, you can at least elim-
inate really poor shots. If you have a digital camera that can be hooked
up to a television to play back images, by all means do so! This will help
you get a better look at your images. You can also show the images to
your clients while at the same time taking their orders. (If they’re not 
satisfied, you can also offer to reshoot the sitting while they’re still
dressed for it.)
✦Check for any obvious errors. Such errors could be gaps between
people, bad expressions, or wrinkled clothes. Straighten out the cloth-
ing, as shown in Figure 3-20. Also make sure the subject’s hair looks good
and that the image is properly exposed.
Figure 3-20: Make sure the subject’s clothing isn’t in disarray.
✦Check for any lighting errors. These include lights that shine where you
don’t want them to, bad shadows, and so forth.

Advantages of Digital Cameras
310
✦If your subjects are wearing glasses, check for any hot spots that might
be too difficult to clean up in an image editing program. Repositioning
someone’s glasses is easier than heavy computer retouching, so make
your job easier when you can.
✦Check for any blinkers. This can be pretty tough with small LCD
screens; a TV monitor makes this easier.
I once worked for a portrait firm (before the digital revolution hit its stride)
that spent quite a bit of money developing a portrait system that simultane-
ously exposed a piece of film plus captured a low-resolution digital image.
The photographer would hand the salesperson a floppy disk with the
images, who would then show the images to clients while giving the sales
pitch. Such a system made portrait sales much more effective because
people were seeing the results of their sitting while they were still excited
and upbeat about the process — and thus more likely to buy prints.
Most of today’s digital cameras offer a similar capability via an RCA or video-
out jack that allows you to hook up a TV monitor, as shown in Figure 3-21.
You (and your subjects) can view images on a larger screen.

you take them.

F
or some readers of this book, becoming a published photographer
might be a lifelong goal. Many avid photographers hone their skills,
trying to reach professional levels in a quest for a published credit line.
However, the average digital camera buff more often ends up
shooting for publication for more practical reasons. Perhaps
your parent-teacher association drafted you to publicize
school events. Or maybe your small company doesn’t
have a full-time photographer, so you — with your
digital camera wizardry — seem perfect to snap 
a portrait of the founder for the organization’s
newsletter. Perhaps you’re a recognized expert in
your hobby, customizing vintage Atari game con-
soles perhaps, and would like to have a few photo-
graphs published in one of the technical magazines
devoted to ’80s-era games.
Digital photography lends itself to all these situations
because you can take a picture on a moment’s notice,
review your results on your camera’s LCD, take another pic-
ture if you need to, and then produce a digital file or print that’s
ready for publication in a few minutes. Most professional photographers
shooting for newspapers, magazines, catalogs, and other publications now
use digital cameras — and you can, too.
In all these cases, your digital pictures are going to end up in print, and you
need to know some things in order to shine when shooting for publication.
This chapter explains the differences between taking pictures for print and

for Web sites, desktop presentations, or a personal photo album. You can
also find some tips on how to get published and advice on preparing your
work for publication.
Finding Outlets for Print Publication
Whether you want to get published simply to satisfy yourself or you need to
have your photos published to satisfy the expectations of your friends, boss,
or colleagues, you can find lots of outlets for your digital work. Here are a
few of the most common:
✦Local newspapers: Although larger newspapers rarely publish photos
from readers, smaller local papers usually welcome submissions of
photos on behalf of your school, club, or even business. Or, you can
make a habit of showing up at public meetings or fast-breaking news
events. Supply enough good shots in a variety of situations, and the
paper might take you on as a part-time stringer (a freelancer with an
ongoing affiliation with a publication). Because digital pictures can be
snapped and transmitted to a newspaper over phone lines just minutes
after an event takes place, electronic photos are especially apt.
✦Trade magazines: These are the unseen publications that nobody knows
about, except for the millions of people within a particular industry.
You might never have heard of Repro Report magazine unless you’re a
member of the International Reprographics Association. I had never
heard of it, either, when I started taking pictures for the magazine (way
back when it was still called Plan and Print.) However, that publication
(and many like it) are constantly looking for photos taken at member
businesses, conventions, and other venues. These trade publications are
good outlets for digital photography, and I’ve managed to have my own
photographs published in hundreds of them. You can do it, too.
✦Company publications: Companies of any size can never have enough
photographers. If your organization is small, management might be
delighted to find a photographer who’s outfitted with fast and flexible
digital gear and who’s also ready, willing, and able to snap photos for
company newsletters, annual reports, and other official publications.
Even larger organizations with a full-time photography staff might be
receptive to photos that you take at events that their pros are unable
to cover.
✦Special interest publications: Every hobby or special interest, from 
collecting Seat Occupied signs from defunct airlines to protecting your
right to arm bears, probably has a publication of some sort. If you share
that interest, you can easily get your digital photos published.

✦External PR and advertising: Most organizations can use photos for
public relations or advertising purposes. If you’re good, your work can
accompany news releases or be incorporated into less formal advertising
layouts. Digital cameras are good for these applications because you can
create a photo in a few minutes, ready for review and approval by the
high mucky-mucks in an organization.
✦Self-publication: The fastest route to getting your digital photos printed
is to publish them yourself. Whether your interests stem from a favorite
hobby or from the most arcane conspiracy theories, if you have a com-
puter, you can create a newsletter, fanzine, or other publication and
spice it up with your own photos. 
The best part about self-publication is that you have absolute control
over which images are used, how they are sized and cropped, and who
gets to see them. And who knows? If your work is good, you might get
paying subscribers to cover part of your costs. In my case, I knew that
no publisher would possibly want to print my illustrated guidebook to
repairing vintage video games, so I took the photos, laid out the manual,
and published it myself, as you can see in Figure 4-1. I’ve sold thousands
of copies on eBay of something that I put together just for fun.
Figure 4-1: Publish your own fan magazine or other publication and put your 
photos to work.

✦Product photographs: Your company probably needs photos of its prod-
ucts for use in advertising, PR, and so forth. You can take them with
your digital camera.
Shooting for publication isn’t as hard as many people think provided you
remember that you don’t start out shooting for slick, nationally distributed
magazines any more than aspiring ball players begin by playing shortstop
for the New York Yankees. If National Grocer is your target, rather than
National Geographic, you have a shot.
Breaking into Newspaper Photography
Your local paper is probably willing to consider your digital photos of a local
event, particularly if it’s a small paper. Larger newspapers prefer to use their
own photographers — not because they don’t think your photos are good
enough but because of journalistic ethics reasons. Big papers frequently face
charges of journalistic bias and must be able to vouch that a given photo-
graph hasn’t been manipulated in ways that would make it misleading.
Photographs supplied by businesses can’t be used unless they are clearly
labeled as a photograph originating with that organization. However, bear in
mind that even big cities have small, special-interest papers that can be a
market for your pictures.
Newspaper photography is fun and challenging. This type of shooting isn’t
especially rewarding financially, but it does provide valuable experience
because you learn to adapt your photographic ability to the environment.
No other type of photography offers the shooter as little control over the
shooting conditions as photojournalism. For some of us, that’s the best
thing about it.
Submitting photos to your local newspaper
The key to getting published in your local paper is understanding what it
does and doesn’t need from you. Newspapers have small photo staffs and
can’t be everywhere at once. They’ll send a photographer (shooter in the
lingo of photo editors) to a major event or fire or accident, but if several
events happen at the same time, shooters probably will have to cover one
or two events and let the others slide. For example, I regularly cover
events at my kids’ school and submit them to the newspaper. Our paper
even prints the articles that accompany the photos, as you can see in
Figure 4-2.
Here are some of the kinds of photos that smaller newspapers would love to
receive:

Book IV
Chapter 4
Shooting for
Publication
Breaking into Newspaper Photography
315
✦Events: Your club or fraternity is having its annual barbecue or banquet 
or get-together of whatever form. It’s not a big enough deal for the local
paper to send someone to cover. If you can produce some usable images
along with enough information to caption them properly, you can proba-
bly get at least one of them published. Newspapers are willing to run
photos like these because people like to see their pictures in the paper —
and that helps sell newspapers.
✦Sports: The paper’s shooters cover the big events, such as football, 
basketball, baseball, and so on. Your opportunity comes with the sports
that don’t quite get their due. For example, shoot track and field events
(not necessarily the big weekend meets with 50 schools and a thousand
athletes, but the local dual meet). Sports like tennis, field hockey, and
lacrosse seldom get as much coverage as the big three (football, basket-
ball, and baseball). Study your local paper to see what sports it seems to
favor and then try submitting shots for the sports it doesn’t seem to cover.
Good action photos are particularly important. If you can regularly capture
peak action well, your photos will be used. See Book IV, Chapter 5, for
more information on how to take good sports photos with a digital camera.
Figure 4-2: Local newspapers are welcome territory for freelancers.

316
✦Spot news: Spot news includes things such as traffic accidents, fires, and
robberies. It can be tough to succeed at selling this kind of photo unless
it’s your main focus. If so, a police/fire scanner is a must. Remember,
though, that it doesn’t do you any good if you’re covering the same news
as the paper’s staffer. Small-town papers tend to need this kind of mate-
rial most and are sure to send out their own staffers at the first hint of a
big story, but you might have a shot at publication if you’re in the right
place at the right time to take a photo of something that no one else
managed to grab. (Some spot news opportunities don’t last very long,
which is why they’re called spot news.) And because your digital camera
film doesn’t need processing, your photos are timely.
Although dramatic photos of spot news events can produce eye-catching
portfolio shots, don’t forget that human emotion creates the most memo-
rable images. This is perhaps the most difficult part of photojournalism —
intruding upon the tragedy of others and recording it for the world to 
see. Pros don’t really have a choice in this matter — it’s part of the job.
Freelancers, however, can choose either side of the deal.
You might run across groups claiming that, as part of their membership
fee, you’ll receive a press pass that will get you across police lines or
into events. Be very skeptical of such claims. Usually, an organization,
such as the state police (in some states at least) or event organizers,
issues a press pass. There is no universal press pass that gets you into
any event. In fact, even working news photographers with state-issued
press passes won’t get into many events (pro sports and rock concerts
for instance) unless they’re specifically cleared for that event by the
event organizer as well.
✦Hard news: These are major news events, such as a speech by the mayor,
a visit by the governor, certain press conferences, demonstrations, and
political rallies. They’re frequently open to the general public, although
official photographers might be given a special area to shoot from.
✦News feature photography: Feature photos and news feature photos are
different. A news feature image accompanies a legitimate story with a
feature edge — say an article on family TV-watching habits or a story on
an upcoming play that will be performed this weekend (as shown in
Figure 4-3).
✦Feature photography: This part of the paper deals with the lighter side of
life. You might shoot a feature package on Elvis impersonators or pictures
of a local restaurant for a review. This is the one section of the paper
where you’ll frequently see created images, or what are sometimes called
photo illustrations.
You can often tie some local happening in to a historical event to give
your feature photo an interesting angle. For example, on May 4 of every
year, I always find a ready market for photos of the 1970 shootings of four
students on the Kent State University campus.

Figure 4-3: Local theater groups can be a subject of good news feature photographs.
You don’t have to limit yourself to just one community newspaper. More
often than not, neighboring newspapers have circulation areas that overlap.
If you know your neighboring communities well, you can also market your
talents to their newspapers.
Working as a professional newspaper photographer
Whether you submit photographs to newspapers as a representative of
your organization, as a freelancer for pay, or as an official stringer for the
newspaper, you want to conduct your business professionally. There are
lots of points to consider. For example, do you want to be a freelancer or a
stringer?
Being a stringer versus freelancing
Nonstaffers come in two types of affiliations: being a stringer and being a
freelancer. The difference is in just how attached you and the newspaper are
to each other.

Breaking into Newspaper Photography
318
Here’s what being a stringer involves:
✦Regular assignments: Stringers receive assignments from the paper
they’re affiliated with, frequently with a guarantee of pay, even if a shot
isn’t used.
✦Pseudostaffer: Still considered an independent contractor, stringers
are generally issued a newspaper press pass, like the one shown in
Figure 4-4, or the paper gets a state credential for them (if it’s in a state
that issues them).
Figure 4-4: If your work is good, a small-town newspaper might 
issue you a press pass.
✦Free supplies: Stringers frequently receive supplies, such as film (in the
old days), notebooks, pens, and pencils. You might be able to get your
newspaper to chip in for some extra digital film, which could be handy
if you’re rushed to get a shot published and need to simply hand over
your memory card.
✦Loyalty: Both the stringer and the newspaper are expected to show some
level of loyalty to each other, although it might not be a lot. Generally, a
paper has a specific number of stringers and a rotation policy to have
some fair manner of distributing assignments. By the same token, a
stringer doesn’t shoot for the paper’s competition. (Usually the expecta-
tion is that you won’t shoot for a newspaper that is sold in your paper’s
distribution area.)
Additionally, stringers are generally considered independent contractors for
tax purposes. This is occasionally a point of contention between newspapers
and state employment officials who scrutinize such arrangements carefully

Book IV
Chapter 4

to see whether such relationships should be considered employer/employee
instead of contractor/client. You should be aware of tax responsibilities in
this situation, too.
Working as a freelancer also has some advantages and disadvantages:
✦Freedom: Freelancers have no affiliation to any particular newspaper,
so they receive no support from any paper. However, they are free to
work for any newspaper and to sell pictures to the highest bidder if
they stumble on a potential Pulitzer Prize winner.
✦More freedom: Because freelancers are unaffiliated, they either don’t get
assignments or are at the very bottom of the list of those who do. That
simply means that freelancers have to develop their own opportunities,
which can help sharpen their news sense.
Freelancers don’t have to worry about employee/employer relationships
because they’re total free agents as independent contractors, but the same
tax responsibilities apply. As a stringer or a freelancer, you can likely deduct
the cost of your equipment and expenses involved in doing business. You
might also have to make quarterly tax payments if this is your primary
source of income. (I’m not an accountant, however, so I can’t give you tax
advice; I urge you to consult a professional for the details.)
Newspaper Web sites have created a new concern for freelance photogra-
phers. Many papers now require freelancers to sign over more rights or 
all rights to any images used in the paper as a result of some recent court
decisions. These rulings have said that freelancers still retain the other
rights to their images even if a photo appeared in the paper. Because many
newspapers were making their entire issue available online, the decisions
Avoiding the Grip ’n’ Grin cliché
Grip ’n’ Grin — it’s the standard shot of any event.
You know, one person is giving an award, and
one person is receiving it. They stand there grip-
ping the award, each looking right at the camera
and grinning. Photo editors hate these pictures.
They all look alike, and the only people who are
interested in looking at them are the ones receiv-
ing the award and maybe the ones giving it. Take
the shot, give the awardee a print, and then get
a shot that has a chance of being used.
Rather than take a Grip ’n’ Grin shot, provide a
sense of what the event is about. If it’s a barbe-
cue, get behind the grills and take a shot of
somebody getting a hot dog through a haze of
smoke with a big smile on his or her face (hope-
fully wearing a cap or T-shirt with the name of the
organization on it). You can mention the award
presented at the event in the cutline (caption),
but there’s really no need to show it. More infor-
mation on preparing images for publication
appears later in this chapter.

meant that the papers were violating the freelancer’s copyrights. Most of 
the time, the loss of the additional copyright doesn’t receive any additional
compensation. Only you can decide whether giving up all rights to a particu-
lar image is worth the chance to get your work published.
Special considerations for news photography
Here are some things to think about when photo–
graphing news events:
 Be aware of emotions. Tempers can run
high at both spot and hard news events.
Sometimes, law enforcement personnel
can overreact when things go wrong.
Cameras can be broken, film can get con-
fiscated, and photographers can be threat-
ened. More and more often these days,
police (although to be fair, still not that
often) try to stop press photographers from
working, First Amendment considerations
be damned. In such situations, newspaper
photographers tend to have their newspa-
per’s resources behind them, whereas a
freelancer probably doesn’t. It’s best to
accept that you’re not on a level playing
field in such circumstances. There are sto-
ries of photographers who’ve played sleight
of hand with their film and turned over 
an unexposed roll of film when someone
demanded their images. I’ve been ready to
do so myself once or twice, but it’s a judg-
ment call for each photographer to decide
what risk he or she is willing to take. In
small towns, you can avoid problems by
getting the police and firefighters on your
side. Give them prints and work hard at get-
ting favorable photos in the newspaper.
 Be different. Your best bet as a freelancer is
to deliver something different from what
everyone else is doing. One of the best news
shots I’ve ever seen came from a presiden-
tial campaign several decades ago. The
photo is of a president answering questions
with a mountain of photographers pressed
together shooting away. One enterprising
shooter had enough of a sense of the
moment to take a few steps back and record
the insanity of the situation. In the process,
he got a timeless photo that far exceeded
the images his counterparts created.
 Look for unusual angles. Shoot from up
high and down low. Try and get the shot
with several different focal lengths, too.
 Be careful not to get locked in on the main
event. Sometimes, the best shot comes
because you look beyond the setting and
uncover human nature at work. Young chil-
dren can offer interesting opportunities
because they don’t hide their reactions or
feelings as much as adults do. A sleeping
child at a political event or wedding can
show humor and make a comment about
how sometimes adults take themselves too
seriously.
 Look at the participants who aren’t center
stage. Is there a clandestine conversation
going on? Do they look bored? Are they
looking in the opposite direction of every-
one else?
News photography strives for impact. Eye con-
tact and emotions are key ingredients. Don’t be
afraid to compose your shot tightly. The image
should have a single focal point, not multiple
ones. Whether you’re shooting for a newspaper
or the World Wide Web, space is valuable, and
images should be tightly cropped and easily
understood.

Getting your foot in the door
How do you become a stringer or freelancer? I recommend making initial 
contact by mail. A simple introductory letter identifying yourself as a photo-
grapher interested in working as a stringer or freelancer, plus some samples of
your work, should be enough. Don’t overdo it on the number of samples you
send. Two or three shots that demonstrate your ability are enough.
Then, follow up. In your letter, say you’re going to call in a day or two to 
discuss how you might be able to help the paper. All you’re aiming for at this
point is a chance to meet the editor, show him or her your portfolio, and sell
the idea of your contributing. The smaller the newspaper, the better your
chances (although the smaller the pay, too).
Be thorough in your examination of the potential marketplace. Many areas
have more than one newspaper and thus more than one opportunity for
freelancing.
Magazines and Magazine-Like Markets
Breaking into magazine, book, or stock photography presents a different set
of challenges and opportunities. Magazines offer the most opportunities. 
Making the leap to published photographer is within the reach of many tal-
ented amateurs. It’s just a question of understanding what markets are out
there, how to make contact, and what the markets need.
Exploring magazine photography
You can find many different types of magazines that aim toward a variety of
audiences. These magazines include
✦Trade journals: Although perhaps not glamorous, these specialized 
publications are good potential sources of sales for enterprising digital
photographers. A trade journal is a magazine that covers a specific
industry or profession. These magazines are seldom found on news-
stands but are instead distributed mainly via subscriptions. Although
they might not pay very well (if at all), they tend to be the easiest maga-
zine market for novices to break into. 
If there’s a trade journal for your particular profession or trade, you prob-
ably have a good place to start because you already have knowledge and
experience in the industry. Your chances of acceptance improve even
more if you can package a story with your photos. This is also a good
market for event photos within your industry, particularly if you can pro-
duce interesting images. You can also cover local stores and companies
in your area with the idea of doing a feature about their operations for
the trade publication.

✦Special interest magazines: These are mass-market publications geared
toward a specific interest — think magazines like Tennis, Popular 
Photo-graphy, Cat Fancy, and so on. This market is harder to break into
than the trade journal market because these magazines tend to pay
better than trade journals and also because more writers and photog-
raphers want to be published in them. Read the guidelines, study the
magazine thoroughly, and query the editor before submitting anything.
In many cases, these magazines are more receptive to photo-only
queries. Regional travel magazines can be a good bet. If you get a good
photo of an unusual or out-of-the-way travel destination, like the one
shown in Figure 4-5, you could have a sure sale.
Figure 4-5: Photos of hard-to-get-to locations are easy to sell.
✦Major mass-market magazines: Time, People, Cosmopolitan . . . these are
the heavy hitters of the magazine world. They’re also incredibly difficult
publications for beginners to sell to. Many times, these magazines won’t
even consider unsolicited submissions and probably won’t take your
query letter seriously, either, unless you have some kind of established
track record as a professional photographer. An amateur photographer
generally needs a remarkably newsworthy image to have a chance to sell
to one of these magazines.

Getting into book publishing and stock photography
Other markets include
✦Books, textbooks, and photo books: The good news is that this market
can be a reasonably easy one to break into. The bad news is that book
editors are notoriously cheap, grumpy, and hard to deal with. (Just kid-
ding! They’re actually kind, supportive, and generous; plus they edit
books such as this one.) Unfortunately, the book publishing industry is
extremely competitive, and the sad truth is that many books don’t turn
a profit. (Please buy an extra copy of this one! It will make a great gift.)
So although there is a need for good photography, there’s seldom a lot
of money in it. Find a publisher whose line of books appeals to you and
query about its photographic needs and policies or check the appropri-
ate market guide book. A coffee table or photo book is a tough sell even
for established pros and requires the highest quality photographic
images to support the higher resolution these books demand.
✦Stock photography: The concept sounds great: Sell the same image over
and over and make lots of money. No, it’s not a telemarketing scam or
multilevel marketing scheme; it’s the world of stock photography. You
deal with stock photo agencies, which keep carefully categorized images
in a database that they can access to provide virtually any sort of pic-
ture (including yours) at the request of a client. To break into this busi-
ness, you’ll need lots and lots of photos (thousands) to make taking you
on worth the agency’s time. Figure 4-6 shows an example of a generic
photo that might be useful as a stock picture.
✦Web stock agencies: A number of growing stock agencies (often called
microstock organizations) have sprung up on the Internet thanks to its
worldwide reach, easy accessibility, and relatively low cost compared
with the prime real estate used to house the big agencies. The advantage
to them is that they can provide a starting point for photographers
whose portfolios are too small to interest the big agencies. Of course, if
your stock of images is that small, the odds are against your having much
success. Still, most offer the photographer 20 percent or more of the rev-
enue received, which can be as little as $1.00 per download, so it’s an
opportunity for you to get a lot of images online without having to have a
Web site or server of your own.
Shooting stock pictures is one area in which having a spouse and kids might
actually pay off. Photos of family interaction, pensive teens, and children at
play are all marketable stock images. How about a boy and his dog? A girl
and her cat? Study advertisements and brochures. Although teams of profes-
sional artists, designers, and photographers sometimes create images specif-
ically for an ad or brochure, more often than not, they’ve been put together
from stock images. Advertisers sell products by showing normal everyday
people whose lives are enriched by their products. Theoretically, your family
qualifies as normal. (Heaven knows I wish mine did!)

Figure 4-6: For stock photography, you don’t want just one flag picture; you need dozens for
clients to choose from.
Gathering publishable photographs
Never forget this omnipresent law of the photograph seller-to-be: In focus
and properly exposed. It’s amazing how often these basics aren’t met when
people submit photos to their local newspaper. I know from personal experi-
ence: At one newspaper I worked for, I was the one who had to weed through
all those pictures trying to find something we could actually use.
So start by sending your best work. Publishable photographs are different
from fine art. Their purpose is to communicate as simply and effectively as
possible. Because you can do that, here’s how to take the next step toward
seeing your work in print:
✦Be organized. Have a filing system that enables you to identify and
locate a particular image.

Book IV
Chapter 4
Shooting for
Publication
Magazines and Magazine-Like Markets
325
✦Be ready to do some research. Your local library is sure to carry refer-
ences, such as the publication you’re interested in selling to as well as
Photographer’s Market. Consider investing in your own copy because
Photographer’s Market provides information on a wide range of possible
markets.
✦Consider ordering your own business cards and stationery in order to
look professional. If your budget allows, consider a promotional piece,
such as a four-color postcard or print showing some samples of your
best work.
Making contact with a publication
The magazine industry does not respond well to unsolicited photographs
and manuscripts. Although you have a better chance of getting published
with a trade journal than with most other types of publications, you improve
your chances by sending the publication’s editor a carefully worded missive
indicating what he or she can expect.
Sometimes, a publication accepts unsolicited photos or manuscripts. You can
usually find this information noted in the magazine’s masthead, located inside
the first few pages of the magazine and listing the publisher, staff, and contact
information. If a publication does accept unsolicited submissions, be selective.
Don’t bombard an editor with a submission per week or more. (Editors can get
restraining orders, too.) Instead, send your best. Either include an SASE (self-
addressed, stamped envelope) with enough postage for the editor to return
the photos to you or attach a note saying they don’t have to come back. (Back
in the days of typewritten manuscripts and hand-printed photos, this whole
issue used to be a much bigger deal than it is now.)
Introduce yourself in a query letter. Talk about your experience in the indus-
try, plus your experience as a writer and photographer if it might help. Let
the editors know what your photo or story idea is and how you plan on
approaching it. Also indicate that you’re familiar with the publication’s
guidelines for writers.
Writer’s and photographer’s guidelines are frequently available on the Web
or by mail and are sometimes even noted in the publication itself. Books
such as the Writer’s Market and Photographer’s Market appear yearly, provid-
ing useful information about many publications. Generally, this information
tells you how publications want materials submitted. (Do they accept digital
photos? Should you submit prints with them? How should prints be pack-
aged? Do the publications even accept work from freelancers?) Publications
such as trade journals are more forgiving if you violate their writer’s guides
than other magazines are, but it’s still best not to do so. (Remember, you’re
trying to convince them that you’re a professional.)

Magazines and Magazine-Like Markets
326
Whatever individual guidelines a publication has, you’d be wise to keep the
following in mind:
✦Be enthusiastic! You can’t expect editors to get fired up about your idea
if it sounds like you find it dull. Tell them why you think their readers
will want to read your story.
✦Submit on spec. If the editor is interested in your work, mention that
you’d be willing to submit it on speculation (spec), which means that you
prepare the work at your own risk, with no guarantee that the publication
will use it. This kind of thing lets the editor know that he can encourage
your submission without having to worry about what will happen if
you’re rejected. (Editors have nightmares about beginning contributors
threatening lawsuits because they expected to be published even though
all the editor did was agree to look at a submission.)
✦Send in your tear sheets. If you have samples of published work (usually
referred to as tear sheets), go ahead and submit the best one or two (three
at the most) pieces you’ve done, like those shown in Figure 4-7. Quality is
tremendously more important than quantity here. If you don’t have some-
thing good to submit, don’t submit anything at all unless the editors or
guidelines ask for it. Frequently, editors take on mediocre writing with
good photography simply because they can improve poor writing but
might have trouble finding good photography.

Trade journals are the best place to start if you’re interested in expanding
beyond newspaper work. They tend to be receptive to freelancers and pro-
vide the opportunity to contribute both photos and text. If writing isn’t your
thing, see whether you can team up with a newspaper staffer or stringer
who’s also looking to expand his or her reach.
Editors hate submissions and query letters that make it obvious the people
contacting them haven’t even looked at their magazine. Most publications
offer copies at a reasonable rate for would-be contributors, or your local
library may have back issues available. Get to know the magazine before you
propose a story idea. Studying back issues tells you whether you’ve been
beaten to the punch by another contributor, or you might find out that a
publication is the wrong market for your submission.
Submitting your photos
Quite a few publications remain cautious about digital submissions for final
publication (perhaps accepting CD submissions for portfolio samples) and
might not even be willing to consider them. If the fact that your images are
digital is the only thing preventing them from acceptance, consider convert-
ing them to analog artwork. A few publications accept prints, but these are in
the minority. Generally, the hands-on favorite for submission even now is
transparencies, or slides. The good news is that you have a couple of ways to
get 35mm slides made from digital files:
✦Online photo labs frequently offer this service. One such lab is www.
slides.com, which charges about $2.50 per slide.
✦Get a 5 x 7 or 8 x 10 print made from your digital file and load your film
camera up with a good quality slide film. Then, either set up a copy stand
(camera is placed perfectly parallel to print with two lights placed at 
45 degree angles to the print) or your tripod and photograph the print.
As time goes by, more and more publications are accepting digital images.
Odds are high that your local newspaper will. It’s a nice feeling to discuss an
image with an editor, e-mail him or her the image, and find out that it has
been accepted, all in a single afternoon (particularly when you’re selling a
shot for the second or third or fourth time).
Getting model releases
A model release is written permission to use a person’s likeness. These docu-
ments, available from any photo store, are popular with publishers because
they help protect the publisher from nuisance lawsuits. The need for model
releases depends upon how the images are to be used. Newspaper photo-
graphers, for instance, seldom bother. Editorial use is generally recognized
by the courts to support the public good and provides some protections to
such publications expected to meet that need. Usually newspapers, news
magazines, and books are considered to meet the editorial-use standard,
although most book publishers desire model releases anyway. Advertising

328
photography, on the other hand, receives no such help. If your photo is
going to help sell a product, have a model release for every recognizable
individual in the shot.
Even as a newspaper photographer, I still try to be careful when it comes to
photographing children. Usually, I look for the adult caretakers first, intro-
duce myself to them, explain my purpose in taking pictures of the kids, and
give them one of my business cards before asking their permission to shoot.
Perhaps this was more than I needed to do, but parents rarely object after
they know who I am and why I am taking pictures of their kids. Skip this
approach, and you might end up explaining yourself to a state trooper
instead. Also, a parent or guardian must sign model releases for minors if
you want those releases to count.
A model release doesn’t give you carte blanche to play with a person’s image,
which is something that’s very easy to do with a digital photograph. Taking
someone’s image under innocuous circumstances and then placing it into
what could be considered an embarrassing photo composite could leave you
open to a lawsuit. When in doubt, be careful and consult with a lawyer or
discuss the potential use with your subject (making sure your model release
reflects the potential use and the subject’s awareness of it). Model releases
are particularly important for stock photography, where the image could end
up being used for just about anything.
In some cases, public figures receive less privacy protection than private 
citizens when it comes to editorial photography. (Think of how the paparazzi
chase celebrities. If you followed your private citizen neighbor around that
way, no doubt your future cellmate would probably be amused to learn 
how you ended up in jail.) No such leeway exists to advertising-related uses,
particularly because celebrities can argue that their likeness does have a
monetary value and that your image is lowering its value.
Shooting Groups for Publication
This section details the special needs of each of the most common types of
group photography for publication, such as groups and PR photos. In each
section, you can find suggestions for taking great photos in a variety of 
situations. You’ll find that these photos fit in with many different types of
publications, from newspapers to trade magazines to company in-house
newsletters to popular magazines. The tips in this section can be applied
to many different types of print destinations.
Understanding group photography basics
Photographing groups can be an interesting challenge, one that calls for
greater skill as the number of people in the shot grows. As you add more and
more people to the frame, it becomes more difficult to catch a moment when

Book IV

everyone has a pleasant expression. As the numbers increase, faces get
smaller, making it increasingly difficult just to make sure everyone is visible
in the shot.
Group shots are popular — and for the photographer who can do a good job,
rewarding. As souvenirs of large events, they’re a well-accepted and compar-
atively easy way to commemorate a gathering. People have also become so
trained to expect a group shot that trying to get through an event without
taking one is almost a sacrilege. Thankfully, good group photos aren’t impossi-
ble; they just need some planning and the right tools. They’re perfect for trade
publications looking to publicize member groups, or for your local newspaper.
Pose your group to conform to your camera’s image area. For virtually all
digital cameras, this means a horizontal rectangle that conforms to a roughly
2:3 aspect ratio.
Posing a group depends upon how many people you’re working with. Book IV,
Chapter 3 covers this topic in more detail, but the following sections dish out
some helpful information.
Photographing groups of two to two dozen
Although 20 people might not seem like a small group, the techniques that
you use to photograph collections of two dozen people or fewer are similar.
Diamonds are a photographer’s best friend. Professional portrait photo-
graphers use a diamond formation as their basic foundation for a group
photo. You can find more about the diamond formation for groups in Book IV,
Chapter 3.
The way it works is to establish your anchor person (usually the mother in a
family portrait) and seat that person. Place the father (or second individual)
behind the anchor person and halfway to the side. Elevate the anchor person
so that the top of his or her head is level with the nose of the standing person.
Have the standing person place his or her hands, one on top of the other and
slightly angled, on the anchor person’s shoulder. (This is the basic pose for a
couple, too.) Now, on the opposite side of the anchor person, pose the third
person the same way you posed the second person to balance the trio. (This
gives you a basic pose for three people.)
Now place the fourth person directly behind the anchor person and posi-
tioned so that the heads of subjects two and three come up to the nose of
the fourth person. (Have sturdy wooden boxes or blocks of varying sizes for
people to stand on.) Have subjects two through four lean slightly forward
from the waist so that their faces are as close to being on the same plane as
the first person as possible. You do this so that everyone is on the same
plane of focus. Make sure that people are close to each other so there aren’t
any gaps between bodies. Now you have a basic posing system that’s
expandable to fit 20 or more people.

Shooting Groups for Publication
330
If you can’t use a diamond-shaped pose, switch to a row arrangement, with
a mix of sitting, kneeling, and standing subjects. Generally, four people or
fewer make your first row. If you have five people, you can shift to a two-
person front row and three-person back row.
Composing effective group shots
The general rule is that people don’t buy portraits because their knees look
good. Compose the shot from roughly above the waist to a little bit above
the tallest person’s head. Of course, this rule has a couple of exceptions.
Wedding portraits should include all the finery, and so should formal events
in which people are wearing gowns and tuxedos. When in doubt, take two
shots — one long and one tight — and let your subjects pick the ones they
prefer. Most professional portrait photographers offer at least two different
poses to pick from. Here are some tips for arranging groups:
Lighting groups
See Book II, Chapter 5, and Book IV, Chapter 3,
for more information on lighting. Here are some
general tips that you can use when lighting
group photos that you hope will be publishable:
 The pro way: To light this setup, use a pair
of studio lights firing into umbrellas or soft
boxes about 6 feet apart and angled toward
the center of the group. A third light is posi-
tioned behind the group and pointed at the
backdrop to provide some separation from
the backdrop. Set your light’s power output
to maximize your depth of field. Safety tip: If
you’re doing multiple sittings, use masking
tape or gaffer’s tape to tape your cables
down so that people don’t trip over them.
 The serious amateur way: A less profes-
sional setup that can still deliver good results
is to use multiple slaved portable flashes
(see Book II, Chapter 5 for an explanation of
photographic slaves) without the backdrop.
This approach has three problems: The
flashes don’t recycle as quickly as the studio
lighting setup, the flashes don’t put out as
much light (meaning you have to go with
shallower depth of field), and the lack of a
backdrop means the photo’s background will
probably detract from the overall image
quality. Few publications will use a photo
that has a distracting background.
 The not-so-serious amateur way: One flash,
straight ahead. It’s not elegant, the light’s
kind of harsh, and you run the risk of red-
eye, especially with kids. Getting your flash
up higher helps prevent red-eye and gives
you a nicer light, but even one flash can do
you some good because it helps clean up
shadows on your subjects’ faces.
 The “Oh My God, What Were You Thinking?”
way: The camera’s built-in flash. You’ve got
to be kidding. Most built-in flash units have a
range of about 8 feet. It might do some good
with a small group, but it’s useless with a big
one. Publications will reject large group
photos poorly lit with a puny flash unit.

✦5 to 7 people: Start with your basic four-person diamond pose (see the
preceding section) and then start building a second diamond on top of
the fourth person of the first diamond. Use that person as the anchor
person for the second diamond.
✦8 to 20 or more people: As you add more and more people, keep joining
new diamonds with existing diamonds until this system starts becoming
unwieldy. Generally, this happens somewhere between 10 and 20 people
although experienced portrait pros can manage bigger groups. As the num-
bers grow, pay careful attention to whether your lights and backdrop are
up to the challenge. (As your diamond stack grows taller, the height of the
backdrop might not reach as high as the top of the uppermost diamond.)
✦More than 20: At whatever point you feel uncomfortable with fitting a
larger number of people into diamonds, switch to rows. Once again,
remember the dimensions of your viewfinder. Keep the number of rows
and columns proportioned so that you fill the frame effectively. With the
rows and columns approach, divide each row in half and angle the
halves into each other so that you can bring people closer together.
Have your tallest rank kneel, position your shortest rank behind them,
and then work your way back (tweaking if the tallest and shortest are so
extreme that this alignment doesn’t work). As you position each row,
make sure that you can see each person’s face from your camera posi-
tion. When you use this technique for a large group, your first and most
important goal is to make sure nobody’s face is blocked.
Managing the group
People tend to get impatient in such situations, especially if they’re among the
first to get posed. Staying enthusiastic and cheerful buys you time and patience
from your subjects. Here are some ideas that have proven to work in the past:
✦Don’t worry, Mon. Explain to your subjects not to worry about posing
until everyone is in place. Keep them relaxed as long as you can because
posing is tiring and stressful for most people.
✦Please, stay put. I usually stress to people that I’m going to take more
than one photo and ask them not to flee like startled deer the first time
my flash goes off. (Every time they laugh at one of your jokes, you’ve
gained a couple of more minutes of patience from them.)
✦Avoid flashers. If your digital camera uses a preflash or red-eye reduc-
tion of any sort, either turn it off (if possible) or alert your subjects to
ignore the preflash. Otherwise, they’ll release their poses just as the
main flash fires. When you’re ready to shoot, tell everyone to look
directly into the camera lens. Look carefully through your viewfinder
and quickly check each person to make sure you can see everyone’s
face. If you can’t, stop and correct poses. If you can, start shooting.

PR Photography

Keep your sense of humor no matter how challenging the group shot gets. If
you can keep everyone smiling and relaxed, you’ll get a good shot sooner or
later.
Try to have people say something that will make them smile. Vacation! is
usually successful, as is Hawaii. Stock options used to work well with busi-
ness types, but with the current market conditions, you might get tears
these days. (Remember, you’re going for smiles, not hysterical laughter
here.) Having people say, “Cheese” is a no-no. Every portrait photographer
has a bag of phrases to get his or her subjects to smile.
Back in my days shooting portraits, I had different phrases for families, 
parents, boys, and girls. Vacation and Hawaii work for just about anyone.
Yes, dear and honeymoon work nicely with couples, as does 10 more kids!
(Some moms get a look of terror when they hear this one, though.) Young chil-
dren generally smile for Cowabunga, Dude (even if it is getting kind of dated),
but any cartoon hero catchphrase will probably work. For teenage boys,
a sequence beginning with girls for shot one, lotsa girls for shot two, and
lotsa girls in skimpy bikinis for shot three is just about guaranteed to work.
These days, a similar male-oriented sequence for teenage girls also works.
PR Photography
Public relations (PR) photography frequently looks like photojournalism, but
note an important difference: Newspaper photography tries very hard to be
balanced, objective, and unbiased, but PR photography doesn’t.
The goal in this kind of shooting is to present your client in the best possible
light. This kind of photography calls for a good sense of diplomacy and the
ability to work as a member of the team with the company’s public relations
personnel. Generally, the PR department has some specific ideas of what
message it would like the image to convey.
PR photography can take many forms, ranging from creating executive por-
traits for senior company personnel to special event photography to taking
photos for the company newsletter or a sales brochure. PR doesn’t apply only
to businesses, either. Your social organization or church might need some
useful PR. Perhaps a new church has been opened, and the parish could use
an attractive photo, like the one shown in Figure 4-8, for publicity or for the
bulletin. Anything newsworthy is ripe for PR photography. The next sections
cover the particular varieties of PR photography in greater detail.
Executive portraits
If you have a staff position with a company or operate your own photogra-
phy business, you may be called upon to shoot pictures of the top brass of a

company or organization. Executive portraits can vary and include basic
head-and-shoulders portraits, commanding-executive-in-charge-at-the-helm/
desk photos, and leader-with-his-or-her-troops pictures. You can find more
on shooting portraits in Book IV, Chapter 3, but for now, check out the basic
kinds of executive portraits you might be asked to shoot.
✦Head-and-shoulders shot: This is a basic portrait. Use a portable studio
lighting setup and take a variety of shots and poses, including smiling,
visionary, and serious. Don’t be surprised if an executive has some very
clear ideas about how he or she wants to look. You and the PR staffer
should look the execs over carefully to make sure they look their best.
If they don’t, offer them a mirror and a comb (if their hair is out of place)
or a lint brush if their clothes need it. Also use an appropriate backdrop.
The PR types in your organization might be able to suggest the best
backdrop for a particular executive.

shot to publicize the opening of a new building in your area.

✦The desk shot: This portrait shows the captain of industry hard at 
work at his or her desk. Skip the backdrop, but check the background
thoroughly through your viewfinder. Some honors and photographs are
fine, but if it’s too cluttered, consider changing camera angles a little to
clean things up. Because you’re shooting the exec at his or her desk,
indications that it’s a working space are important. A neatly arranged
pen set and a single document on the gleaming mahogany desk is plenty.
Whatever you do, don’t show a messy, cluttered desk.
✦The confab: This shot’s a bit trickier. The idea is to show the exec as 
an in-charge leader. Usually, it’s done with the standing exec giving
instructions to a pair of underlings. The exec is turned toward the
camera (slightly angled) with the underlings posed mostly away from
the camera. Underlings should be carefully selected (this is the PR
department’s job) because it’s an opportunity for the company to
show it’s an equal opportunity employer, or minority employer, or 
whatever.
✦Setting: The setting is usually in the nicer section of the company 
headquarters, but it could also be in a location shoot that showcases
something about the firm. The location could be anywhere business-
appropriate, such as a shipyard, an oil field, a factory assembly line, or
a restaurant.
✦One of the gang: This shot is for the charismatic executive whose rapport
with the troops is legendary. Forget the suits, mahogany desk, and rich 
carpeting. Instead, he or she is
dressed casually. In fact, it should
be hard to tell the executive from
the employees, except for the fact
that everyone in the photo is hang-
ing on his or her words.
✦Really one of the gang: From 
time to time, you’ll need to take
a head-and-shoulders shot of
someone who really is one of
the gang: a non-executive, non-
manager, ordinary star-of-the-
warehouse type. Maybe she had
a great bowling score on behalf
of the company team. Or he had
perfect attendance for 10 years.
In such cases, a formal portrait
would be inappropriate. You need
to be prepared to grab a simple,
flattering, head-and-shoulders
shot, like the one shown in
Figure 4-9.

non-executives for the company newsletter,
too.

Being able to produce a wide range of executive photos is a good skill for a
PR photographer because there’s always a place for these images, whether it
be the company newsletter or the latest annual report.
Company events
Shooting company events usually revolves around documenting activity 
for outside company publications and also for distribution among employ-
ees. Usually, this means that the photographer is expected to take a lot of
pictures — and the biggest challenge is being thorough enough.
Here are the main types of company events you’ll be called on to capture:
✦Company dinners: A company holds a dinner for a lot of reasons. Plan
on getting photos of the speakers, award recipients (if any), company
executives, and as many attendees as possible. Special-event dinners
(fund drive events, seasonal parties, recognition of company accom-
plishments) should also include photos that show why the event is being
held. For tips on how not to shoot presentations, see the “Avoiding the
Grip ’n’ Grin cliché” sidebar, earlier in this chapter.
✦Company outings: Sometimes, an organization holds a retreat or confer-
ence. These gatherings feature a variety of events — some meant for fun
and others for training. Plan on lots of shots of individuals participating
in these events. Start by making sure you get the bigwigs. While you’re
looking for good photographs, make sure that your shots are positive
and also present the employees in a good light.
✦Company-sponsored sporting events: The information in Book IV,
Chapter 5 applies here, with the added reminder that you’re still shooting
a corporate event first and an athletics meet second. Document elements
that show the company relationship to the sports event (banner, logo,
or whatever) and get good souvenir photos for the amateur athletes
(particularly if they are company employees). Posed shots and cama-
raderie photos are good, too.
✦Family events: Sometimes a company holds an open house for employee
families to come see what their family members do and where they
work. Get plenty of shots of employees demonstrating their jobs for
their families.
✦Community relations events: Many companies work hard to be good 
corporate neighbors. Employees are encouraged to volunteer as mentors
or to give time to public service efforts, such as Habitat for Humanity. 
If you’re asked to shoot a community relations event, plan on getting
newspaper-type photos for use in the company newspaper or newsletter
(and remember, positive images here). You should also take pictures for
the company to hand out to its workers as well. (Companies motivate and
reward employees for doing things like this. T-shirts, coffee mugs, and
souvenir photos are the top three incentives.)

Arranging a PR event worth photographing
If you’re shooting for your own company and your company is a small one,
you might find yourself dubbed the in-house PR “expert” and be asked to help
put together events covered by other photographers. You really need to
understand the needs of other photographers, too! Putting together a photo-
worthy event calls for an understanding of the needs of the photographers
you’re inviting and for optimizing your own chances to get good photos along-
side them. Press photographers are paid to create strong, exciting visuals.
Here are some things you can do to make an event more likely to be a success:
✦Pick a location that provides a strong backdrop for the speaker or 
ceremony.
✦Include elements that reinforce the purpose of the event. For example,
at a groundbreaking or building dedication, try to get some construction
equipment in place to frame the podium or platform. Hang banners from
the buckets of front-end loaders that identify your company and project.
✦Give the other photographers handouts that will make it easier to
identify each person participating in the event. This should include a
photo of each person, with his or her name and title securely attached
to the picture. (It can be a printed sheet with bio. It doesn’t have to be
an actual print.)
✦If holding an outdoor event, be prepared for bad weather by having
an awning available on-site. Try to set up things so that photographers
can still get a good backdrop for their photos.
On the day of the event, check on all the small details that can come back to
haunt you, such as confirming the presence of equipment, banners, handouts,
and so on. Next, check the weather forecast. Have some people available to
help answer questions from the photographers or provide extra handouts.
Refreshments for the press and guests are a good idea, but you don’t need to
go to extremes. Actually, you should probably worry more about having the
appropriate refreshments for the company bigwigs than for the media.
Other photo-worthy events
Sometimes, your company welcomes members of the community inside its
doors. This can be a welcome opportunity for creating images that you can
place in your local papers.
✦School tours: Does your company do something that might make a good
tour for the local school? If so, bringing a group of school kids in will
provide tons of photo ops (opportunities). Some typical images include
an employee demonstrating a piece of equipment to the kids or one of

Book IV
Chapter 4
Shooting for
Publication
PR Photography
337
the kids learning to use a piece of gear (keeping safety in mind at all
times). Be sure to have your company’s name or logo on equipment so
that it shows up in the photo.
✦Mentors: Does your company have a mentors program? If so, the interac-
tion between your employees and their protégés can also make a good
image. In this case, you’re shooting at the school instead of your facility,
so you won’t have as many ops to get your company’s name in the shot,
but at least make sure it’s in the caption.
Producing placeable PR photos
Successfully placing images taken specifically for PR purposes for your local
media is both an art and a science. Remember that you’re trying to meet
your needs (placing your company’s photos) as well as the newspaper’s
(strong images).
Newspapers know what you’re trying to do — namely, get your company
some free publicity and credibility. They also know that they have an adver-
tising department that exists to help pay the bills. They’re not giving away
free space, but if you supply a good image, it has a chance at being used.
Also, understand your markets. Many local newspapers are willing to con-
sider photo submissions, but each paper has its own criteria for acceptance.
Newspapers use PR photos for a variety of reasons, including these:
✦The images are of high quality and show members of the community
doing something newsworthy (building homes for Habitat for Humanity,
running a dunk tank to raise money for charity, and so on).
✦The images fill a need that the newspaper couldn’t fill on its own because
it was understaffed or it was a weekend and too many events were going
on to cover them all.
✦The newspaper is willing to “sacrifice” a couple of pages to run photos
from groups and organizations that want publicity. It’s easy to tell
whether your newspaper does this; look for the section near the back
that has a couple of solid pages of Grip ’n’ Grins (those trite photos of
two people shaking hands and grinning at the camera).
Many newspapers also run a Neighborhood or Region section. (There are
lots of names for this part of the paper.) Such a section is geared toward the
local community. In fact, when a newspaper hits a certain size, it will proba-
bly print a different section for local communities as a special insert, which
gives you even more opportunities to place photos. Even if your company
isn’t located in a community that the paper has a section for, some employ-
ees who work for your company probably live there.

Printing your PR photos
After you create your publishable PR images, give yourself the best chance
that you can to get them used. Read Book VII, Chapter 1 to find out about
printing digital images in detail, but here are some general observations.
As a bureau chief for one publication I worked for, I was frequently amazed
at the number of low-resolution inkjet prints that I received from PR and
marketing people. To make matters worse, they were frequently printed on
cheap typing paper. Needless to say, they weren’t used. (I’m not referring to
proof images accompanying a digital file here either; those are okay.)
Instead, you should use one of the newer, high-resolution ink-jet printers
(1400 dpi or higher) capable of producing photos that are as good as those
you get from conventional film and photofinishers. If you don’t have such a
printer, your local drugstore or department store might have a stand-alone
kiosk or an in-house digital mini-lab that can produce high-quality photos
from your digital files.
Writing cutlines
Cutlines, or captions if you prefer, are vital to getting your photos used.
Newspapers know nothing infuriates a reader more than seeing his or her
name misspelled or being misidentified in a newspaper photo. As a result,
most papers set very strict policies for their own staff on this kind of thing
(usually three strikes and you’re out of a job).
Good cutlines provide the basic information and get it right. Here’s the kind
of information to include:
✦Identify subjects. Make sure that each name is identified with the proper
person. Usually, it’s done from left to right (or l to r).
Make sure that you have the correct spelling for the names of everyone
appearing in the picture and triple check to make sure that no typos
sneak through.
✦Summarize the event. Describe what they’re doing and why it’s impor-
tant. Make sure to also identify your company or client.
✦Identify yourself. Provide your photo credit (Photo by). Include contact
information in case the publication needs more information about the
people in the picture or the event.
Cutlines need to be accurate, concise, and informative. Plus, the cutline is your
chance to mention your organization’s name in the publication. Although short
cutlines will do the job in most cases, longer versions can serve as a mini news
release. Here’s a (slightly modified) example of a longer cutline, from a photo
actually published in my local paper:

When faced with a barnyard full of animals who didn’t want to help, 
“Do It Yourself” was the solution for the Little Red Hen in a production of
the children’s play, performed by the kindergarten class at Immaculate
Conception School in Newtown. The young thespians who demonstrated
the importance of cooperation included, from left, Johnny Smith, Janie
Doe, William Roe, and Samantha Brown. For more information on the
kindergarten or preschool classes, call the school office at (331) 555-1212.
Preparing the cutline for submission
After you write your cutline, affix it to the print — and do it in such a way
that the print and cutline won’t be separated by accident, as shown in
Figure 4-10. The standard method is as follows:
1. Set your margins for the cutline so they’re narrower than the print’s
horizontal dimension and give your cutline a top margin of about one
and a half inches.
2. Print out the caption and trim the sides and bottom to about a quarter-
inch from the text while leaving the top margin alone.
Figure 4-10: Photo and cutline should be carefully fastened together.

3. Turn the print face-down and position the face-down cutline on top of
it. Line the cutline up so that the top line of text is slightly below the
bottom of the print and use a small piece of tape to affix the cutline to
the back of the print.
4. Turn the print and cutline back face-up and fold the cutline sheet up
and over so that it covers the photograph.
Now your picture and cutline, as shown in Figure 4-10, will fit neatly into
an envelope, and with the cutline sheet offering some protection for the
face of your print.
5. Before sticking your print in the envelope, though, sandwich it
between two pieces of corrugated cardboard and rubber band the
sandwich together to keep it from being damaged in transit.
Professional packaging and presentation will help you put your best foot for-
ward and will improve your chances of getting your photos accepted.
Submitting the photo
After you assemble a nice professional package, prepare a cover letter telling
the editor why you’re sending these photos.
✦Be brief. You need only a few paragraphs to explain what the event was
about, when it was held, and where.
✦Include contact info. Make sure that the appropriate contact informa-
tion is also provided in your letter.
✦Send to the photo editor. Check the newspaper’s masthead and address
the envelope to the photo editor (if the paper is big enough to have one),
to the Neighborhood section editor if the paper has a Neighborhood sec-
tion, or just to the editor if it’s a really small paper.
✦Keep a log. Identify the image (something like 20070821.03 for “2007,
August 21.third photo release of the month”), the newspaper(s) you’ve
sent the photo to, and the date you mailed it. Make sure your cutline
includes this release number. Also identify whether the photo is for
immediate release or for use on a particular date.
Following up
A few days after mailing your photo submission, call the newspaper and ask
to speak with the appropriate editor. Tell whomever answers the phone that
you’re calling to follow up on a photo submission. When you’re connected,

Book IV
Chapter 4
Shooting for
Publication

341
identify yourself and say you’re checking to see whether the editor needed
any additional information.
Also be sure to check the appropriate papers to see whether they’ve already
run your image. If so, buy a couple of copies for tear sheets for your files. Note
the log number on your file copy so that you can match it with the appropriate
photo. Get in the habit of comparing your successful and unsuccessful images
so that you can see what kinds of images your local paper favors.
Product Photography
Product photography is certainly a specialized type of photography, but
one that offers good opportunities for the enterprising photographer.
Product photography is all about making your clients’ products look as good
as possible, such as in Figure 4-11. You can do this in several ways, and you
can find more information on photographing objects close-up in Book IV,
Chapter 2.
Although you could think of this type of photography as the exclusive domain
of the big-name advertising photographers, agencies, and art departments,
the reality is far different. Opportunities for this type of work are very open to
talented freelance photographers.
Figure 4-11: Close-ups are the meat and potatoes of product photography.

342
Product shot opportunities
Lots of manufacturers sell their product lines through catalogs. There is a
constant need for fresh images because some these catalogs come out as 
frequently as once a month. Success in this type of photography calls for
several skills:
✦Speed: Be prepared to work quickly and efficiently. Set up a standard
lighting package that provides clean, even lighting. Generally, this means
setting up a tabletop station with a pair of lights that rake across the
product at 45-degree angles and that are positioned at a right angle to
the camera.
✦Simplicity: Your tabletop setup should be as simple as possible. Plan on
using seamless paper that you can advance on a roller. Then, when one
section gets dirty, you can just advance it to another stretch of clean
paper. Your close-up photography skills should be well-honed, too,
because many product shots are close-ups of components, like those
shown in Figure 4-11. See Book IV, Chapter 2, to read more about snap-
ping close-up photos.
✦Flexibility: Your digital camera and tripod rig should be versatile
enough for you to be able to change their position quickly and easily.
Some tripod manufacturers offer dollies (small platforms with rollers)
that the tripod can be mounted on so that you can reposition it easily.
✦Record keeping: Be sure to have a workable record-keeping and -indexing
system set up so that you can keep track of what you’ve shot and when;
clients frequently need this info.
Product demo shots
Product demo photos are designed to show either what the product can do or
how it is correctly used. The idea is to create an image that shows a typical
user successfully using the product for its designed purpose. Some examples
include
✦An attractive person reclining on a pool float, looking relaxed and
happy. (Selling the pool float.) Shoot this scene from a variety of angles,
including getting up on a ladder to shoot down on her. Use an image 
editing program to tweak the pool water’s color to be a nice rich blue. 
Be careful in your choice of lenses here, though: Longer focal lengths 
are more flattering. You probably need flash here to clean up any shad-
ows, too.
✦Cyclists standing with their bikes happily discussing their planned ride.
(Selling the bicycle.) Use a long telephoto for this image. The cyclists and
their bikes should be in focus, but the background shouldn’t be. Use late-
afternoon light to give a rich glow to the scene.

✦A woman stroking her pet cat while it laps up a saucer of milk — and
not just any milk, but a specially formulated milk just for cats. (Product
box can also be in the photo or composited in later.) Use your portable
studio lighting setup here and a short telephoto or modest wide-angle
lens, depending on how much space you have to set up your photo.
✦A business person working on a portable computer. (Selling the com-
puter.) If the shot’s outside, use fill flash and a medium telephoto. If it’s
inside, use your portable studio lighting kit and a medium telephoto lens.
Set your aperture depending on your background. 
For the outside shot, generally a wide-open lens that throws the back-
ground out of focus works fine. Inside, if you have a particularly good
background (say, a nice study), take advantage of it and stop down to
increase your depth of field.
✦The product posed as it is set up for use. Figure 4-12 shows a shot
arranged to show how a product is used. All the extraneous information
has been excised, making the final photo abundantly clear.
Figure 4-12: This photo shows exactly how the product is hooked up.
The idea is to sell viewers on the idea that buying this particular product will
enrich their lives in some way.
Of course, sometimes you don’t want to show the product being used. 
When this happens, the photographer must invoke a mood the product 
manufacturer finds desirable. For instance, I’d never show a sample of kitty
litter being used the way the manufacturer designed. Instead, I’d create an
image of a cat bathing itself in the foreground with a dinner party in the
background. The text for the ad could then read, Brand X Kitty Litter —
you’ll never know it’s being used.

How the pros do it
When Philadelphia Mayor John Street wanted
to announce his plans for an anti-blight initia-
tive, his staff put together a carefully crafted
day for the press. The day began with a morning
briefing with coffee and pastries. More impor-
tantly, the media was given a full briefing
manual describing the mayor’s plan. During the
briefing, Mayor Street and his team introduced
his plan and the people whom he hoped would
make it succeed. Although those of us who
were working press photographers grabbed
some photos at this point, we all knew these
images weren’t going to get much play.
After the briefing was over, we headed out to
waiting city trolleys for a tour of the areas that
the mayor hoped to turn around. At this point, we
were informed that we’d be getting a three-hour
tour of the city, which caused the press corps to
begin singing the theme song from the old TV
show, Gilligan’s Island. (You know, “A three-hour
tooour!”) We were also given box lunches.
During the next few hours, we were presented
with a number of carefully planned photo ops.
Face it — a city like Philadelphia has a large
number of abandoned buildings (several thou-
sand according to the briefing we were given),
and yet every time we stopped, it would be in
front of a single derelict structure instead of a
row of vacant houses.
When it came time for the mayor to climb into a
front-end loader to knock down a derelict struc-
ture, there was just one small section of a build-
ing left for him. Every other building in that
development had already been demolished.
The reason for these photo ops was obvious.
The mayor’s staff wanted to make sure the
images in the media created the impression that
the problem was manageable. The mayor facing
a city block of vacant, ruined buildings would
have looked too much like an underdog taking
on an insurmountable challenge.

D
igital cameras offer at least one advantage and one disadvantage
when used for sports and action photography. The big advantage lies
in the ability to shoot an almost unlimited number of pictures in your
quest to capture the peak moment of action but without burn-
ing up dozens of rolls of film. In times past, professional
photographers had an edge in this department because
they could justify using tons of film at a single event.
Today, mistakes and bad shots can be erased from
reusable digital film, so your errant photos aren’t
necessarily captured for eternity.
The chief disadvantage to digital cameras is that
the models that are not digital single lens reflexes
(dSLRs) don’t respond as quickly as you like when
the shutter release button is pressed. Even a pause
of half a second is too long when the decisive
moment in a contest is framed within your viewfinder
or LCD for only an instant. If you are using a dSLR,
you’re in good shape: Most of these cameras will snap off a
picture as quickly as you can press the shutter release. If you
don’t have a digital SLR, you can work around this potential problem by
using some techniques I show you later in this chapter.
Choosing Your Weapons for Sports Photography
Sports photography calls for a range of tools that can help put you in the
best possible position to get the shots you need. This doesn’t mean that you

Choosing Your Weapons for Sports Photography
346
need to break the bank to get good images, though. Many of the current crop
of digital cameras — from digital single lens reflex cameras (dSLRs) to point-
and-shoot versions — offer powerful capabilities of their own.
I cover the basics of choosing a camera, lenses, and accessories in more
depth in Book I, Chapter 2. However, sports photography does have several
particular needs. Here are some of the things that you should consider when
assembling your sports photography arsenal. I explain these key needs in
more detail later in this chapter, but this summary will get you in the proper
equipment frame of mind:
✦Go long with telephotos. To get the best sports photos, you want to get
as close to the action as possible. That’s enough of a challenge for pros
equipped with press passes and access to areas set aside for their use.
Imagine how tough it is for someone who has to get shots from the stands.
If you can’t get close, your digital camera’s telephoto zoom setting or
add-on telephoto attachment is your best friend. For sports photos, a
camera with a 3:1 or 4:1 zoom lens is almost essential. You can find pro-
sumer digital cameras that take you even closer with 10:1 to 12:1 zoom
ratios. These long lenses provide the equivalent of a telephoto lens in
the 200mm to 400mm range on a traditional full-frame (film or digital)
camera. Of course, if you’re using a dSLR, you can swap the lens you
have on your camera right now for one that is longer, up to preposterous
focal lengths. (There are lenses with 1000mm and longer focal lengths.)
✦Go wide. Wide-angle capability also comes in handy for sports photo-
graphy. Certain sports, such as skateboarding and roller blading, photo-
graph quite well from a low position using an extreme wide-angle view. A
wide-angle capability is also great for getting an overall view of a sports
venue or crowd, as you can see in Figure 5-1.
✦Light up your sports life. If you want to shoot sports at night, an acces-
sory flash unit can greatly improve the quality of your photography
because that brief flash of light can freeze action. External flash units
can even be a big advantage during the day if you’re photographing out-
door sports such as baseball because the flash lights up those inky
shadows under the caps many athletes wear to shield their eyes.
Of course, you have to be close enough for the flash to be useful.
✦Take along lots of digital film. Sports photography can fill your digital
storage media faster than most other photographic enterprises. At an
exciting game or match, you might find yourself shooting more photos in
two hours than you took during your entire vacation. Yet, other than
timeouts or halftime, you have very little time to review your photos and
erase the duds to free up storage space. The solution is to take a lot of
digital film with you and use it freely.

views of the crowd.
Digital Camera Features and Action Photography
You can find information on specific digital camera types and their features in
Book I, Chapter 2. The following sections review how some of those features
can best be applied to action photography.
Viewfinder
Most non-SLR digital cameras have an optical viewfinder and a color LCD
panel or, perhaps, an LCD alone. Others have an electronic viewfinder (EVF)
and a color LCD panel on the back of the camera. And, of course, dSLRs have
optical viewfinders that see the same lens used to take the picture. You need
to determine when to use each of them when taking sports photos. Some
general rules to keep in mind are
✦Non-dSLR owners should use the optical viewfinder to follow action
prior to squeezing off a shot. You can view the subjects continually
through the viewfinder under just about any lighting conditions. Although
optical viewfinders can be difficult to use under very low light levels
(when you need to use a flash instead of existing light to take the picture,
anyway), optical viewfinders are still a better choice than the LCD panel
for following fast-moving events.

Digital Camera Features and Action Photography
348
✦Try keeping your other eye open while looking through the optical
viewfinder. This trick gives you some peripheral vision that will alert
you when the action is about to enter the frame.
✦If your camera has an EVF, you might find it convenient for viewing
fast action prior to snapping the shutter. Note, though, that some EVFs
produce a smeared image when you move the camera to follow action
and may blank out a split second before the photo is taken, so you’ll be
shooting blind.
✦Digital SLRs are even better for sports photography. They provide a
bright, clear view (like an optical viewfinder), but you can see through
the taking lens except for a tiny fraction of a second when the picture is
actually being taken. You’ll be “blind” for a much shorter period than
with an EVF; you might barely notice the interval.
✦The LCD screen is invaluable for reviewing your images immediately
after creating them. Most cameras can be set to display an image on 
the LCD for a few seconds while it’s being saved to your digital film. Take
the opportunity to review the image. Even if it’s great, you might learn
something that will enable you to do better on the next shot!
Using your camera’s LCD review feature
Here are some things to look for when review-
ing your action shots:
 Composition: One of the most valuable
things that your LCD screen can do for you
is confirm that your composition is what you
want it to be. With sports photography,
you’re dealing with athletes moving quickly
and sometimes (seemingly) at random.
Being sure they’re where you want them to
be in the frame is a good thing.
 Sharpness: LCD screens aren’t necessarily
an accurate way to judge image sharpness.
However, some cameras offer the ability to
magnify a portion of your image, which can
help you see whether your camera’s auto-
focus or your manual focusing is close. If not,
you can switch autofocus modes (some
cameras let you choose which area of the
frame to focus on, or whether the camera
locks the focus when you press lightly on the
shutter release) or switch to manual focus.
 Exposure: Your camera’s LCD screen can
help you determine whether your exposure
is on target. Some cameras let you call up
a histogram, which is a kind of scale that
shows the distribution of brightness values
throughout the image. The histogram can
help you judge your exposure. If your expo-
sure isn’t spot on, you can make changes
immediately so that subsequent action
shots are better.
Shooting outside in bright sun makes it hard to
use your LCD screen effectively. The Hoodman
company (www.hoodmanusa.com) makes a
variety of hoods that offer some shade for the
LCD screen and make it easier to read in the sun.

Electronic flash
An electronic flash unit can be a big help to your action photography
whether it’s day or night. You can use flash for good photos in a number of
ways. Here are a few:
✦Let there be light. An accessory flash unit can provide enough light for
you to shoot by when it gets too dark for even your highest ISO (film
speed) setting to be usable. (For more on ISO ratings, see the upcoming
section, “Setting your ISO speed.”)
✦Freeze your frame. Accessory flash units produce an incredibly brief
burst of light (somewhere on the order of up to 1/10,000 of a second).
Also, because the flash unit, if it has enough power, provides the main
source of light, it has the ability to stop action. You should be careful,
however: When using flash at a slow shutter speed setting, the ambient
light (the available light other than the flash itself) can register a ghost
image trailing the image captured by the flash. This can sometimes be a
cool effect — but only if it’s intentional.
✦Cleaning up the shadows. Even when you have more than enough light
for good sports photography, many times even the brightest conditions
can’t change the fact that athletes wear ball caps or that tree limbs cast
shadows. An accessory flash unit can help get rid of those shadows if
you are close enough.
Tripods
Sports photography usually calls for such high shutter speeds to stop action
that no photographer would use a tripod to prevent blurry photos from
camera shake, unless working with a high-end digital camera with a huge
telephoto lens (which isn’t something the average digital photographer
needs to worry about). Instead, sports photographers use a tripod to simply
help support the camera. Here are some considerations specific to sports
photography that you should consider. (Read Book II, Chapter 5 for more
detail on tripods.)
✦Great support: A good sturdy tripod can be invaluable for holding and
steadying your camera, particularly at telephoto lens settings. Some
sports, such as football, call for too much movement on the photo-
grapher’s part for tripods to be useful. (You’ll constantly be running up
and down the sidelines.) When photographing track and field, baseball,
and softball, however, you benefit greatly from having a tripod to support
your camera.
✦A second camera rig: When shooting baseball and softball games, I fre-
quently prefocus a second, tripod-mounted camera on a key spot, such
as first base, second base, or home plate. A tripod enables you to switch
back and forth between two cameras easily and quickly.

✦Panning: This technique involves following the action as it moves across
your image frame. Panning is discussed in greater detail in the “Panning”
section a bit later, but a tripod with a panning head can greatly improve
your efforts at this technique because it allows free horizontal movement
while keeping the camera steady vertically. Figure 5-2 shows some action
stopped by panning in the direction the base runner was moving.
Figure 5-2: Pan the camera in the direction of movement to stop action at slow shutter speeds.
✦Monopods: For sports that call for photographers to be active, a mono-
pod frequently works better than a tripod because it’s easier to pick up
and carry around. A good monopod is fairly thick and heavy, both to be
strong enough to support the weight of a big telephoto lens and also so
that you can brace against it. A lot of inexpensive units promise all sorts
of capabilities; make sure you hold out for a good solid monopod and
not one of the flimsy ones.
✦Shoulder stocks: These devices are modeled after rifle stocks and work
on the principle that by bracing the lens into your shoulder, you can
hold it steady.
Lenses and attachments
Because sports photography requires you to cover large swatches of field
and fast-moving athletes, long lenses or attachments to extend the reach of
your point-and-shoot camera’s built-in zooms will really help improve your
results. Your choice of lens or zoom settings is in part dependent on what
sports you plan on shooting.

Digital Camera Features and Action Photography

Because the effective focal length of a digital camera lens depends on the
size of the sensor, when I give focal lengths in this chapter, I use the tradi-
tional “equivalent” figure; that is, the magnification you’d get if using the lens
on a 35mm film camera or a full-frame digital camera.
✦Wide-angle settings: Wide-angle settings will be a big part of your sports
photography if you’re shooting up close. For example, wide-angle lenses
are currently in vogue for skateboarding photography. These lenses can
give your sports shots a very different look, if you can get close enough
to your subject to fill the frame.
✦Short telephoto settings: Telephoto settings equivalent to a 35mm
camera’s 85mm–135mm lengths (which is how digital camera manufac-
turers measure their optics’ magnifications) have a lot of uses in sports
photography. These are great for indoor sports, such as basketball and
volleyball, and can also be handy for nighttime sports under the lights.
If your digital camera has a maximum aperture of f/2.8 or larger, you can
take photos in lower light levels. Make sure that your camera doesn’t
use a smaller lens opening, which would defeat your ability to take
indoor shots.
✦Medium telephoto settings: These are usually in the 180mm–200mm
range. This is a very versatile setting that can come in handy when
shooting almost any type of sport.
✦Long telephoto settings: Some digital cameras have long telephoto set-
tings that are the equivalent of 300mm–400mm on a 35mm film camera.
These are the lenses of choice for both football and baseball photography
because they allow great reach and the ability to keep shooting even when
outdoors under lights. Be careful that your long lens doesn’t reduce your
shutter speed beyond the ability to capture the action.
✦Super telephotos: You probably won’t have access to super telephotos
unless your digital camera is a dSLR with interchangeable lenses. I’m talk-
ing about the really big guns here — the 500mm and 600mm telephotos.
These lenses are almost too big for many kinds of sports photography
and are almost the exclusive reserve of nature and bird photographers.
They can be useful when you just can’t get very close to the action and
have a pretty small subject. (Gymnastics events and skiing come to mind.)
✦Add-on lenses for point-and-shoot digital cameras: Many point-and-shoot
digital cameras can accept lens converters that attach to the front of 
the camera’s built-in zoom lens. These converters can screw into the lens
filter mount, clip onto the lens barrel, or attach via an ingenious adapter
barrel and are frequently available in both wide-angle and telephoto 
flavors. I recommend going with the manufacturer’s version, which is
specifically designed for your camera, but if your camera’s manufacturer
doesn’t offer the accessory lens you need, look at third-party options.

Latency and Shutter Lag
352
Be very careful if someone tries to sell you an add-on lens for a video camera.
Video cameras get by with much lower resolution than digital still cameras.
A lens designed for a video camera probably won’t produce very good results
on a digital still camera.
Latency and Shutter Lag
Before you move on to tips for taking great digital sports photos, you proba-
bly should spend a few minutes considering the deep, dark secret that digi-
tal camera manufacturers don’t want you to think about: When you press
that shutter release button, many cameras have a noticeable time lag before
the picture is actually taken. Although this lag is but a minor inconvenience
if you’re taking a photo of the Eiffel Tower, that delay can be fatal (to the
shot, not to you) when photographing sports. Fortunately, there are some
things you can do about the phenomena known as latency and shutter lag.
Once upon a time, you pushed the shutter release button and the camera
took the picture. As cameras have gotten more and more sophisticated,
more and more things have to happen before an image is created.
Dealing with latency of your camera
Latency is the time required to write the image you’ve just taken to your stor-
age media. When you take a picture with a film camera, the shutter releases,
and the image is immediately registered on the film at the speed of light, so
to speak. When you take a picture with a digital camera, the image has to be
captured and then recorded onto your memory card. The image capture and
storage process can take a second or two — or even longer. How long the
process takes and whether your camera will continue taking additional
photos while writing to the card are important questions.
Digital cameras use buffers (built-in memory) to temporarily let you keep
shooting while the buffer contents write to removable memory. If you keep
shooting, eventually the buffer fills, and you have to stop until it has made
enough room for you to resume shooting. Other cameras might not be able to
use their buffers quickly enough for their highest resolution files but will let
you keep shooting if you choose a lower-resolution setting. It’s a tough choice,
but sometimes the ability to keep shooting overrides the desire for the highest
possible resolution. Things that affect latency (that you can control) are
✦Media: Some forms of media accept data faster than others. CompactFlash
cards tend to write information faster than microdrives (tiny hard disk
drives). Some CompactFlash cards write data faster than others. Look for
ones rated for faster write times (frequently marked 8X, 50X, 80X, or 133X).
Several photo-oriented Web sites have conducted their own tests of
CompactFlash cards. Check out www.robgalbraith.com for the most
highly-respected card test results.

Book IV
Chapter 5
Sports and Action
Photography
Latency and Shutter Lag
353
✦Resolution: The more data the camera has to write to the card, the
greater the latency period. Non-compressed formats like RAW and TIFF
can take the longest to write. If you know that you can get by with a
lower-resolution setting, you can speed up things considerably by going
with the lower resolution. This can be a tough decision because after
you give up quality, you can’t get it back. On the other hand, missing a
shot because you’re waiting for your last few images to write to your
memory card is one of the more frustrating experiences that a photo-
grapher can endure. Film photographers miss shots while changing rolls
of film, but digital photographers miss them because of latency. It’s not a
perfect world, but it is a great reason to get a second camera.
Understanding your equipment and its capabilities and limitations is impor-
tant for the digital photographer interested in making winning sports photo-
graphs. If sports photography is your overriding concern, several cameras on
the market are geared toward the sports shooter. Both Canon and Nikon’s top-
of-the-line digital SLRs are highly capable photographic tools well designed for
this kind of work (but they’re not cheap!). For those of us on a tighter budget,
Olympus makes a lower-resolution digital camera capable of 15 fps (frames per
second) bursts (for a max of 10 frames). It may be worth considering.
Coping with shutter lag
Latency isn’t the only thing that can slow down your picture taking. Many
things happen when you press the shutter, including activating light-sensing
features and bringing autofocus up to speed. If you have a microdrive hard
disk storage device, the time needed for its drive platters to start spinning is
a factor as well. The result is shutter lag, which is the delay between the
moment when you squeeze the shutter and when the camera actually fires.
In practice, most of the delay is caused by the autofocus system. Thus, you
have to anticipate the decisive moment and trigger the shutter early enough
to cause the image to be created at the best possible moment.
Timing your shot properly
Here are some ways to time your shot so that you can take a great picture
even when shutter lag delays capture of that decisive moment:
✦Anticipate the action. Many sports and non-sports action activities have
a particular rhythm. If you can become sensitive to that rhythm, you can
anticipate that peak moment of action and learn how far in advance to
trigger the shutter. If you’re shooting a baseball or softball game, you
can position yourself down the third base line and wait for a play at first.
It takes a certain amount of time for a throw to make it across the field to
the first baseman, so you can trip the shutter in time for the ball to reach
the mitt. When shooting a basketball game, you can usually tell when
someone is about to drive to the basket. Anticipation can work for you in

Latency and Shutter Lag

non-sports action photography, too. You can wait until just before the
real action starts, as shown in Figure 5-3, which was taken just as the
flume ride started down the incline.
Figure 5-3: Pressing the shutter button just before the flume ride started down 
helped freeze the action.
✦Go with the flow. Follow the action with your camera and gently
squeeze the shutter as you keep your eye on the ball (or athlete). In
sports like basketball or soccer, you can track the person bringing the
ball down the field.
✦Pick your spot. Many sports direct action to a particular location. For
instance, long jumpers are headed toward the landing pit, so you can
know within a couple of feet where the athlete will land. Be prepared to
trigger the shutter as the athletes launch themselves and stay with them

until landing. Some sports have goals, some bases, and some baskets;
sooner or later, every sport has a spot that you just know will see action.
✦Use manual focus. Some digital cameras allow more control over their
capabilities than others. If your camera lets you deactivate autofocus,
for instance, you can prefocus on the expected action spot and reduce
your camera’s shutter lag time. A similar technique works for cameras
that let you lock focus. Lock focus on the spot you’re keying on just
before the play starts, and you give yourself a head start on the action.
✦Lock in your focus. If your digital camera requires you to press the shut-
ter halfway to activate autofocus and autoexposure (and with cameras
using mini-hard disks, to start your microdrive spinning), you can do
this in advance and have everything operating at just the right time. The
problem with this technique is that it can drain your camera’s batteries
in a hurry, so plan on having lots of extra juice if you want to do this.
✦Choose your autofocus mode. Most digital cameras, dSLR and non-dSLR
alike, have two autofocus modes: AF-S (autofocus single) and AF-C 
(autofocus continuous.) AF-S locks in focus when you press the shutter
release halfway and keeps focus at that point until you release the button
or take the picture. AF-C also sets focus when you press the shutter
release part way, but then continues to refocus if your subject moves 
or you reframe the shot. Usually, AF-C is best for sports (if you’re using
autofocus at all), but it does run down your battery more quickly and can
be fooled if something moves between you and your primary subject,
even momentarily.
✦Use autofocus selectively. Does your digital camera let you pick a differ-
ent button to activate autofocus instead of the shutter button? If it does,
you can combine this feature with the previous technique to decrease
battery drain. (Autofocus uses lots of power.) Keep the shutter pressed
halfway while awaiting the next event. Then, as soon as you need to,
press the second button to activate autofocus. (This takes a little prac-
tice, but it does work.) It also works well for the prefocusing suggestion
made a couple of paragraphs earlier. Some cameras have a continuous
or single autofocus setting. Switching to the single setting can save
power because your camera doesn’t constantly refocus each time you
move the camera a little.
Choosing Your Sport and Your Spot
This section deals with tips for taking great digital action photos in a variety
of sports situations. That’s the great part about sports photography: There
are so many different sports. Just when you think you’ve explored every-
thing that can be done for soccer, soccer season is over, and it’s time to grab
some basketball shots!

Elementary, middle, and high school sports are great training grounds for
people who want to become good sports photographers, for several reasons:
✦Speed: Because the players aren’t as fast and as skilled as those at the
college level (and up), the excitement generally unfolds at slower
speeds, making life easier for the novice sports photographer who’s
trying to follow the action.
✦Access: School athletic events are much more accessible than college or
the pros. Return the favor by offering the coach or the boosters a copy
of your shots for their awards dinner.
Don’t be afraid to experiment, either. There are always elements of an event
that provide dramatic imagery, even if it’s not the typical sports action shot.
Think about close-ups of equipment, low-angle shots of the playing field, and
portraits or studies of spent, exhausted athletes at the end of the game.
Look for shots that show the emotion and intensity that the athletes bring to
the sport.
Knowing where to position yourself can be a real challenge for novice sports
photographers. It’s also vital to give yourself the best possible opportunities
to get great shots. Your goal is to be in position to capture peak action in the
right direction (getting that great catch with the athlete’s back to you doesn’t
do you much good). Generally, this means you want to be far enough in front
of the action to be effective, yet close enough to fill the frame.
Determining the right spot is largely dependent on the sport you’re shooting.
Your choice of available zoom settings can also play a role.
Football
If you’re photographing high school or peewee football, you can often get right
down on the sidelines to take photos like the one shown in Figure 5-4. At the
lowest levels of the sport, you can pretty much get whatever access you want.
Even at the high school level, you can probably get on the sidelines if you
explain that you’re trying to build a sports portfolio. For most college and pro-
fessional games, you need some form of accreditation from the team itself.
Still, sometimes even a small, local newspaper can secure such access for its
photographers, so working for such a publication could get you in. 
Here are some tips for photographing football:
✦Keep your distance. Photographers generally stand about 8–15 yards up
field from the line of scrimmage. Don’t get much closer than this, or the
line officials block your view. This puts you in place for a shot of a run-
ning play or quarterback sack in the backfield while still giving you a
chance to turn and lock on to a receiver in case of a pass play to your
side of the field.

Book IV
Chapter 5
Sports and Action

357
✦Use a second camera. A second digital camera set to its wide-angle set-
ting can also be a good idea. This camera can be quickly grabbed and
brought up to shooting position if a play comes right at you. (Be careful
to avoid being run over.)
✦Keep other spots in mind. As teams approach the goal line, you can
move to the area behind the end zone and shoot straight at the quarter-
back or running back attempting to leap over the defensive line. Because
the team’s players sit near the midfield, you can’t shoot around this
area. Also, plan on getting some shots of the coach yelling from the side-
lines and players on the bench. Cheerleaders are good for a couple of
shots. If it’s a particularly cold day, some shots of the fans bundled up in
the stands are worth taking.
✦Be patient. Football demands patience and determination on the part of
the sports photographer simply because so much of the sport takes
place too far away from where you’re standing for you to be able to
shoot it effectively. Just stay with the game and be prepared for the
action when it finally does head toward you.
Football is one sport for which the more you know about the game 
and the particular teams that are playing, the more effective you can be.
Understanding that one team favors short, quick passes while another favors
a more conservative ground game helps you predict where the next bit of
action will take place.

Baseball and softball
For these sports, there are several likely places for a photographer to work
from. One of my favorites is directly behind the backstop, shooting through
the links to get a shot of the pitcher just as he or she releases the ball (ideally
framed between the batter and umpire). I also like shooting from just behind
the dugout, which is where I took the picture shown in Figure 5-5. 
Figure 5-5: Shooting from behind or next to the dugout can give you a great perspective at
baseball or softball games.
Here are some other tips for shooting ballgames:
✦Get behind the plate. Many times, I start behind the plate to make sure
I get a usable image as quickly as possible before moving on down either
the first or third baselines. Usually, I head down until I’m about 5 or 10 feet
below the base. From this spot, I can get good shots of the batter, a side
view of the pitcher, and a good angle for plays at second base.
✦Move down the baseline. After that, I continue on down the line until
I’m as much as 15 or 30 feet past the base. This position gives me a shot
at the runner racing to first or third.
✦Watch that runner on first. If there’s a runner on first, sometimes I pre-
focus my tripod-mounted camera on second base in case there’s a close
play there. Here’s where knowledge of the sport and the teams involved
can give you a big advantage. The stolen base is one of the more exciting
plays in baseball or softball. If you’re ready before the play begins, you
have a much better chance of getting a good shot of the action.
Much like football, baseball’s lowest levels of skill are wide open to any 
photographer who cares to shoot them. College and the pros are much

harder to gain access to — although once again, a newspaper job might give
you a chance. Softball tends to be easier to gain access to. Sometimes, a 
one-sided game is easier to shoot than a close one. There tends to be lots of
scoring, including plenty of people stealing home.
Basketball
Hanging out behind the backboard is a great place for getting good shots. I
probably spend 80 percent of the game here. Rebounds, scoring, fights over
the ball — it all happens under the boards. Here are some other good loca-
tions for shooting hoops:
✦Take to the bleachers. I take some shots from up in the bleachers with a
telephoto prefocused on the rim. This is a good location for getting the
rebounder pulling the ball off the rim and a good look at the player’s face.
Try to find a spot a little higher than the rim. This generally calls for a
longer zoom lens setting, about 100mm–135mm for a digital camera.
✦Head for the sidelines. I also shoot along the sideline with a longer zoom
setting to get a shot of a ball handler bringing the ball up court. From this
position, I can also look for a shot of the coach yelling instructions to the
players and pivot to grab some crowd intensity shots. Sometimes you
can catch a tense moment as the ball is thrown back into play, as shown
in Figure 5-6.
Figure 5-6: Sometimes the tension of putting the ball into play can 
make a good photo.

✦Don’t forget half-time. Half-time is the time to look for shots of the
coach and players talking strategy. A wide-angle gets you in close when
possible (easy for high school ball and younger, but you probably won’t
be able to get that close for college and the pros).
Basketball is a great sport for a novice photographer who’s looking to build
a sports portfolio. It’s possible to get good photos without having to break
the bank on a camera with an ultralong telephoto lens zoom setting.
Soccer
Soccer is a little like football in terms of the field and sidelines action, but
this sport has lots of unique aspects, as well. Here are some tips:
✦Get behind the net. Behind the net and to one side of it are good loca-
tions to catch scoring attacks, but you spend long periods of time
counting blades of grass when the action moves to the other side of
the field.
✦Take to the sidelines. Positioning yourself on the sidelines puts you in
place for good ball-handling shots. If you move down the sidelines closer
to the net, you’ll be in position to get the goalie in action.
✦Reach out and grab someone. If you have a digital camera with a long
zoom lens, you can try to reach from one end of the field to the other to
get the goalie straight-on. Or, you can even grab a shot from way up in
the stands, as in Figure 5-7.
✦Going for the wide look. For variety’s sake, try a shorter focal length
while lying on the ground. This will give you a second shot, but not a
main photo.
Soccer can be a difficult sport for the point-and-shoot digital camera simply
because of the size of the field. The best place to work from is the spot
behind the net and to one side. An occasional shot through the net works,
too, but becomes a cliché if this is the only image you ever capture.
Other sports
Other sports all have their own special challenges and opportunities. Here’s
a brief rundown on some other popular action opportunities:
✦Hockey: Stand behind the goalie or on the sidelines just above the goal.
Players tend to make a lot of contact behind the net trying to control the
puck, so there’s some good action there. Another place where big hits
happen is the area between the blue lines — the neutral zone. If your
lens is long enough, get some shots of the face-offs. Don’t forget about
reaction shots either. Hockey is tough simply because your movement
can be so restricted.

Figure 5-7: This action photo was taken from the stands with the longest zoom 
setting I had available.
✦Tennis: You can stand behind the court shooting the player on the far
side of the net straight-on. Don’t worry about the fence; if you’re using a
telephoto setting, you can shoot through the links. On the sidelines, I
favor shooting when the player is running from side to side after a ball,
but only when the player is moving toward me. Either a monopod or
tripod will work for tennis.
✦Golf: Shoot from the side when the player is teeing up (but not during
their swing) or straight-on if the course conditions permit. You can also
shoot straight-on from a safe distance when a player is putting.
✦Track: So many events, so little time. Whenever possible, I try to shoot
track events from as close to straight-on as possible, generally as run-
ners are coming around the turn or at the start of a race when the line of
runners is beginning its break. 

Choosing Your Sport and Your Spot
362
✦Field events: So many events, so many different ways to shoot them.
Unlike track, which tends to use the same quarter-mile track surface for
its events, the field competition presents more challenges. Fortunately,
shot put, javelin, and discus can all use the same basic philosophy:
Namely, get in front of the athlete with a little offset to the side (and far
enough away to be out of range) so that you can shoot straight-on as the
athlete releases whatever it is he or she is throwing. Setting yourself up
behind the landing area is a good strategy for both the long jump and
pole vault, while positioning yourself to the side and slightly behind the
bar works well for high jumping. (The hard part is racing from side to
side because jumpers will come from both the left and right.)
✦Gymnastics: Any position that lets you shoot the athletes coming
directly toward you is a good location. If circumstances allow you 
to get close to the action, wide-angle lenses can give your images a 
different look.
✦Adventure water sports: I’m talking white-water rafting, kayaking, and
canoeing here. Generally, you have a choice of two good locations. The
first is downstream, just below a rapid, so that you can get the boaters
in action. The second is from a bridge, looking down on the river, which
gives you a nice alternate shot. Don’t be afraid to get in tight and com-
pose from the top of the boater’s head down to his or her paddle in the
water. It’s not necessary to show the entire boat.
✦Rock, alpine, and speed climbing: If possible, either get on top of the
rock and shoot down on the climbers, or get on a ledge that’s level with
a point the climbers will reach during their ascent. If you’re on the
ground when they begin the climb, a wide-angle shot from the side and
below gives a usable image, and you can play with silhouettes if you
want to try something different. Also from ground level, you can try a
telephoto shot of the climber against the wall. For a speed climbing com-
petition, a longer telephoto setting gets you in tight and compresses the
competitors more closely together. I prefer to shoot speed climbing from
the side because it emphasizes the extreme body contortions the
climbers go through.
✦Extreme sports: Both straight-on and profile shots provide good images
for many of these sports. For skateboarding, inline skating, and BMX
bike events, shorter focal lengths work well, depending on how close to
the event you can get. Wakeboarding calls for very long lenses, a mono-
pod, and a position on the riverbank that gives a good view of as many
jump points as possible.
✦Motor sports: These sports are among the fastest growing events from a
fan standpoint. Auto racing is one of the toughest photographic chal-
lenges, even for modern professional camera equipment. Those cars are
fast! Try to catch them on the curve when they’re moving a little bit
slower. This can also give you a three-quarter view of the car. Or, pick a
spot where you can get the cars coming at you. This type of action is

Book IV
Chapter 5

Photography
Choosing Your Sport and Your Spot
363
easier to capture. Fast moving racing cars can also present a good
opportunity for creative blur shots (more on this topic later). Use a
modest shutter speed (say 1/125 of a second) to keep the starter sharp
as he waves the flag to begin the race. If you do it right, the starter stays
sharp while the cars and flags are blurred. Other good opportunities
include shots at the starting line or in the pits. For motor-cross events,
where the motorcyclists are catching big air, you want to be some dis-
tance away from their take-off point. Side shots of the athlete and bike as
they come even with your position are also good.
✦Horse racing/dressage: For horse racing, station yourself where the
track curves so that you can shoot the animals coming straight toward
you; then get three-quarter and profile shots as they round the curve.
For the specialized horse maneuvers called dressage, study a book on
the desired movements and looks each animal should present. Be ready
to shoot them head on and in profile and three-quarter pose.
✦Swimming: Shots from head-on and from the side are pretty much your
only choices here. Start by shooting head-on and time your shot to catch
the swimmer rising up from the water. You might need an accessory
flash unit and a butane-powered hair dryer for battling lens fogging.
Don’t underestimate just how difficult it is to keep your equipment in
working condition because of all the moisture and humidity in the air.
Keep extra packets of desiccant (a powdered moisture-grabbing agent) in
your camera bag and a microfiber cloth within easy reach. Try to get to
the swim meet site at least a half hour early so that your equipment has
a chance to come up to room temperature and humidity. Package your
camera and lenses in sealable plastic bags during this warm-up period
so that condensation forms on the bag, not the lenses.
Increasing dynamic range
High-contrast situations, such as ski slopes,
present a special challenge for digital cameras.
Because sports photography frequently revolves
around frame-filling action with just one or two
athletes, the easiest way to deal with high-
contrast lighting is to use flash to balance the
light between your subject and the background.
 Metering: Take a meter reading off a mid-
tone (something equivalent to medium gray,
such as the palm of your hand) and find 
the correct exposure for the overall scene.
Then set your flash to output enough light
so that your subjects’ illumination matches
the background. (This tip probably applies
only to those with higher-end cameras and
very powerful flash units.)
 Filtration: Special low-contrast filters have
appeared on the market in the past few
years. Although sticking another piece of
glass in front of your high-quality lens risks
degrading image quality, a well-made filter
can be worth the investment. Photographs
made with low-contrast filters generally
require a little extra tweaking in an image
editing program (nothing extreme), but the
results can be well worth it.

Winter sports: A special case
The 2006 Winter Olympics renewed interest in shooting sports like skiing
and snowboarding. These sports present a special challenge for the digital
photographer because of the amount of contrast inherent in snowy condi-
tions. Such lighting conditions often fool your camera’s exposure system.
If your digital camera lets you shoot in RAW mode (a relatively unprocessed
mode that captures the image information before the camera’s settings are
applied — check your camera’s instruction manual to see how), use that
option. It gives you the maximum amount of information when you’re editing
the image later. You’ll be glad you did.
Generally, a good image occurs when the skier or snowboarder turns about
15 or 20 feet from your position. (Try to avoid the snow spray.) Another
good shot is when the athlete becomes airborne. Be careful that you aren’t
so busy looking through the viewfinder that you lose track of the skier or
boarder coming right at you. (Don’t laugh; it happens.)
Accessibility
Most events are accessible at all but the high-
est levels of play. Even high school and junior
college sports cut serious amateurs some slack
if they want to get closer to the action (on the
sidelines or behind the baseline).
When you get to the point at which the athletes
are making their living playing the sport — or for
the highest levels of NCAA play — that starts to
change. Even minor league ball has restrictions
on what you can do and what kind equipment you
can use. Pro-level events are even more restric-
tive. Plus, most professional organizations grant
access based on your agreement to use your
images only for editorial purposes. High-profile
sports organizations like Major League Baseball,
the National Football League, and the National
Basketball Association guard the marketing
potential of their sport and athletes very closely.
At least one type of competition, extreme (or
action) sports, provides unparalleled access for
the average enthusiast. Many times, while
shooting events at the X-Games, I’ve been on
one side of a fence chatting with spectators a
foot or two away on the other side, and we’re
all close enough to the action to get the exact
same shot.
Extreme sports tend to be very photogenic, too.
Plus, the athletes tend to be fan-oriented, which
can lead to good fan-athlete interaction shots.
Because the financial rewards for many of these
sports come more from endorsements than from
prize money, the athletes actually try to cultivate
their fans — a lesson that some professional
sports seem to have forgotten. Extreme sports
fans tend to be almost as flamboyant and color-
ful as the athletes, too. Look for mohawks, spiked
hair, body piercings, and tattoos. Most fans don’t
mind if you want to get a shot of their particular
fashion statement; they’re usually pretty proud of
it. Just ask whether it’s okay first.

I usually rely on medium to longer zoom lenses plus an accessory flash.
Because these sports are done on snow-covered mountains, I try to travel
light and with my equipment balanced in waist pouches or equipment belts
rather than a camera bag. A camera backpack works well, too, but makes it
harder to get at your equipment in a hurry. Having a flash available is very
important because, otherwise, you have to choose between overexposed
snow and an underexposed subject.
Exploring Action Photo Techniques
As a would-be sports photographer, one of the most important things you
can do is become knowledgeable about the sports you want to shoot. The
most successful sports photographers are the ones who can anticipate the
next play or event and put themselves in position to trip the shutter in time
to record the moment.
Many times, you have decisions to make long before the action starts. Is this
a situation in which you’ll use the zoom on the camera and try to react to
what happens? Or are you picking a spot, prefocusing, and waiting for action
to reach that location? Both are valid methods, and most photographers
alternate between them as the game goes on.
Whenever possible, sports shooters try to analyze the situation to see
whether they can understand what will happen next. Third and long yardage
or first and 10 in football are good examples. In the former, a pass is likely; in
the latter, a running play. You can follow the receiver on your side of the field
if you think a pass play is likely or key in on the quarterback to get a shot of
the pass or the pass rush. For the running play, you can key in on the back-
field and be ready to catch the hand-off and ensuing running play.
Setting your ISO speed
Being able to change the film speed or ISO (International Standards Organiza-
tion) rating of your camera on the fly is one of the great benefits of owning a
digital camera. Be sure to check your camera’s instructions to see how to
change the ISO setting.
When conditions permit, I always try to work at 100 or 200 ISO to get the high-
est quality images. Most digital cameras are optimized to provide their best
quality at those settings. If I’m shooting outdoors under most daylight condi-
tions, an ISO setting at 100 to 200 usually allows me an action-stopping shutter
speed of 1/2000 of a second or higher, which is good for the majority of sports.
(For more on choosing shutter speeds, see Book I, Chapter 2.) If I have to move
indoors or if the sun is getting lower in the sky, I ratchet the speed up to 400
ISO and use a flash unit if circumstances permit. In uneven lighting situations,
being able to change ISOs whenever you want is a great help.

Exploring Action Photo Techniques
366
Although my digital camera allows ISO settings as high as 800 and 1600, I try
to avoid these settings unless it’s the only way to keep shooting. Images shot
at these ISO settings tend to need a little more tweaking in an image editor
than lower ISO shots and also offer less margin for error when it comes to
exposure. Cameras vary, and so do photographic tastes. Test your camera
out before taking your first action shots so that you can determine whether
your ISO choices produce results that meet your standards.
High ISO settings let you use faster shutter speeds, which means sharper
images, but higher ISO settings also produce noisier images: Noise is the 
digital film version of conventional film’s grain. Still, a sharp, noisy image is
preferable to a noise-free, fuzzy one.
Freezing action with fast shutter 
speeds or an accessory flash 
Today’s athletes are well trained, well conditioned, and well prepared. As a
result, they’re faster than ever. To freeze their movements, you need to use
either a fast shutter speed or an accessory flash unit. Another consideration
is the relationship between the direction in which your subject is moving
and your camera’s orientation. Here are some tips to keep in mind:
✦Fast shutter speed: If your subject is moving toward you or away from
you, you can get by with a slower shutter speed than if your subject is
moving across your field of view. It’s hard to say generally what a good
minimum shutter speed is because the shutter speed needed to stop
action varies from sport to sport, but faster is always better. Figure 5-8
shows a speedboat and water skier headed away from the camera. The
action was stopped at a relatively slow 1/125 of a second.
Figure 5-8: Action headed toward or away from the camera can be stopped at a relatively 
slow shutter speed.

Chapter 5

✦Accessory flash: As light levels drop, an accessory flash’s quick burst of
light can freeze action that a slow shutter speed might not. Whether you
can use flash tends to depend on the particular sport you’re shooting.
I’ve never had any problems shooting football or basketball with a flash
unit. Athletes such as tennis players tend to be more sensitive to flash
photography, so I plan accordingly. When in doubt, check with the event
organizer to see whether they have a specific policy or watch what other
photographers are doing. Many times, if you’re setting your flash for fill
lighting rather than as your main light source, the burst of light is brief
enough and low enough in intensity that the light won’t be a problem.
Keep in mind that you have to be within the effective range of your
flash’s output capability for it to do any good.
Short-duration shutter speeds can often be the key to stopping action. The brief
time that the shutter is open registers only an instant of motion. Longer shutter
speeds give your subject time to move farther or make more movements while
the image is being recorded, which results in blurred photographs.
Generally, your choice is to use the fastest shutter speed possible. For many
digital cameras, this frequently means 1/1000 of a second. This speed is fast
enough to stop any human motion and will freeze many other elements of
most sports. Digital SLRs usually have shutter speeds up to 1/4000 or 1/8000
of a second or faster.
Stopping action with slow shutter speeds
You can often stop action by using a slower shutter speed, too. Indeed, the
effects might be more realistic than the frozen-statue look that you get when
Controlling shutter speed
How do you get your camera to use a short
shutter speed to stop action? You might have to
check your camera’s instruction manual to find
the exact controls, but here are the options you
should look for:
 Shutter priority mode: In shutter priority
mode, you can choose the exact shutter
speed you want to use (such as 1/500 or
1/1000 of a second), and the camera’s auto-
matic exposure control will choose the 
f-stop lens setting appropriate for that shut-
ter speed. Keep in mind that depending on
the lighting conditions, you might not be able
to use the very shortest shutter speeds at all.
In dim light, for example, your camera might
not be able to take a photo at any shutter
speed shorter than 1/250 or 1/125 of a second
because there simply isn’t enough light.
 Manual shutter speed/exposure settings:
On some cameras, you can set both shutter
speed and f-stop manually. If you can do
that, it’s up to you to interpret your camera’s
light meter to provide the correct combina-
tion of shutter speed and f-stop for a proper
exposure.

sports participants are stopped dead in their tracks. Here are some tips for
stopping action at slower shutter speeds:
✦Look for momentary pauses. Many times, a sport has a moment of peak
action where the action hesitates before movement returns. Think of a
jumper on the ascent. At the top of the leap is a moment of stasis —
hanging in space before dropping back down, as shown in the bicycle
shot in Figure 5-9. If you’re forced to shoot at too low of a shutter speed,
try to time your shot for that moment. Another example is a tennis
player, just after tossing the ball to serve. If the server uses a high toss,
he or she has to wait for the ball to drop before hitting it. The tennis
player up at the net is another example. Although the racket and ball
might be moving very quickly, the athlete’s body usually isn’t traveling
very far or fast.

Chapter 5

✦Try to shoot the action moving directly toward the camera. Athletes
and machines moving toward the camera require a slower shutter speed
and faster autofocus to freeze motion than those moving laterally across
the camera’s field of view.
✦Concentrate. The most dramatic image can be the concentration of the
athlete the moment before he or she begins play. Think of the pitcher
looking to the catcher for a sign, or a tennis player just before serving
the ball. Another example is the linebacker poised for the snap of the
ball before rushing the quarterback. There’s also the free-throw shooter
pausing a moment before shooting.
✦Find action in nonaction moments. Another shot to look for is one that
shows the price the athlete pays for his or her sport. This can be foot-
ball players on the bench with steam rising off their heads or a spent 
distance runner leaning on a teammate at the end of a race. A shot of a
distraught athlete being consoled by a fellow athlete is a classic sports
photograph. Also watch for the emotions of the fans or cheerleaders.
Panning
Panning (moving the camera horizontally in the same direction of motion as
your subject) is a valuable technique that should be part of every serious
sports photographer’s repertoire. This procedure gives you the best of both
worlds: freezing the important part of the scene while blurring the back-
ground to show the furious motion of the moment.
The idea behind the technique is to use a slower shutter speed while follow-
ing an athlete or an object laterally with the camera. The result is a subject
that’s in relatively sharp focus while the background is blurred.
Here’s how to put panning to use:
1. Select a moderately slow shutter speed to give yourself a long enough
stretch of time for the lateral movement of the camera to register —
but not so long as to create overall blurriness from camera shake.
Don’t you just love precise directions like this? But seriously, if I could
give you exact numbers, your camera would already be programmed to
do it for you. There’s no exact recommendation; you have to experiment
to see what works best for you. The speed will vary from sport to sport
as well. Start out by trying something in the 1/45–1/60 of a second range
for running humans. Work your way to around 1/350 of a second for
motor sports and see how this works for you.
2. Begin following your subject with the camera before tripping the shutter.
You want a smooth lateral motion here, so beginning the move first and
then shooting helps you do that. Your panning movement is steadier if 
you limit your movement to your waist and hips while keeping your feet
planted and your knees together. This will also help reduce camera shake. 

Exploring Action Photo Techniques
370
Also make sure to keep your elbows braced against your body to help
turn yourself into a human monopod. Most people find that using an
actual monopod generally doesn’t work very well, but for a few, it works.
If circumstances permit, a tripod with a tripod panning head (one that
allows the tilt and yaw controls to be locked while the panning direction
swings free) can make for a smoother pan. Certainly, a photographer
who’s just starting to experiment with the panning technique might find
that a tripod makes things easier.
3. Trip the shutter as gently as possible.
You’re trying to avoid a downward snap in your movement. The old
cliché is to squeeze the shutter — not press it.
4. Continue your lateral panning movement for a second or so after the
shutter has closed.
This is a case where proper follow-through is just as important for the
photographer as it is for the athlete.
5. Repeat this process at least a half dozen times or more.
It seldom works perfectly the first time. (It’s okay; you’re not paying for
film here.) Good panning is something you have to work at. Don’t give
up on the technique if your first few attempts (or more) don’t pan out.
(Sorry, just couldn’t resist the pun!)
This technique gives you dramatic images that accurately convey the sense
of motion the sport involves. Sometimes, the photograph of the athlete
flying through the air or running down the baseline with the background
blurred (see Figure 5-10) does a better job of conveying the speed of the
event than a moment of frozen action.
Capturing action approaching the camera
Action approaching the camera is also more dramatic because the camera
can maintain eye contact with the athlete or create a sense of power from
the approaching machine coming right at the viewer.
Because these images produce such drama, work on capturing them well.
Mastering this aspect of sports shooting will do much to improve your
sports photography. Help your camera’s autofocus system work its best 
by prefocusing on a spot a few feet ahead of where you hope to take the pic-
ture. Lock on to the approaching athlete and give your camera a chance to
acquire the athlete and bring its autofocus up to speed. If you’re working
with a digital SLR with a zoom lens, you can give yourself more time and dis-
tance for the shot by acquiring your subject at the extreme telephoto end of
its range and continuing to shoot while racking the zoom through its full
range to its widest setting.

Figure 5-10: Panning freezes action at a slower shutter speed.
Circumstances don’t always permit you to get this shot. Still, photography is
about putting yourself in a position to give yourself the best possible chance
to catch the action. If you couple that with shooting a large number of
images, you can increase the likelihood of success.
Using blur creatively
In some circumstances, you just don’t have enough light or a fast enough
lens to set the shutter speed as high as you would like. Stopping action can
be a good photographic technique when you’re covering sports, but it’s 
certainly not the only one. When circumstances don’t allow you to freeze
motion or when you want to create something that looks different from what
everyone else is doing, deliberately trying to blur your image can create
something special. Blur works for non-sports action, too. Figure 5-11 shows a
picture in which the blurring creates a photo that says “action!” more clearly
than any frozen-in-time photo.

Exploring Action Photo Techniques
372
Figure 5-11: Blurring adds to the excitement of this photo.
To create a successful photograph, the key elements of the image — not 
necessarily every single part of it — need to be in focus. Your subject’s eyes
and face need to be in focus. If his or her body, hands, or feet are blurred,
that shows just how fast they’re actually moving. Some sports, such as
tennis, are easy. There’s a pretty forgiving difference between the shutter
speed you need to freeze the athlete’s body and the speed necessary to

Book IV
Chapter 5
Sports and Action
Photography
Taking the Picture

freeze the moving tennis racket or ball. The same goes for hockey because
the player’s stick and the puck blur quite easily at shutter speeds that com-
fortably freeze the player.
When successful, this kind of image can actually be more dramatic than
freezing action. Here’s how to try this technique:
1. Figure out what shutter speed is slow enough to blur the faster moving
parts of the body while being fast enough to freeze the face.
This varies from sport to sport, so be prepared to experiment.
2. Time your shot to coincide with a moment of peak action, such as the
athlete at the top of his or her leap.
Many sports call for the athlete’s head to stay still while the rest of the
body explodes in action. (Think of a golf swing where the player’s head
stays down through the entire stroke.) Other sports require the head
to travel through a range of movement as they stroke through the ball.
(You know, keep your eye on the ball.) For these sports, the head eventu-
ally stops as the athlete follows through to complete the stroke. The end
of this follow-through determines where the athlete’s body movement is
frozen, although the ball or puck and stick or racket might still be moving.
After you get the hang of using blur creatively, you’ve added a powerful tool
to your photographic arsenal. The essence of many sports is the athlete’s
ability to move as fast as possible. Blurred hands, feet, limbs, and wheels
convey the speed of modern athletes and machines in a way that frozen fig-
ures can’t. Try to experiment with creative uses of blur each time you’re on a
shoot. Just manage it the way most of photographers do: We start out work-
ing for an image that we know gets the job done. After we get our “money”
shot, we can start looking for something a little more creative. This is the
time to try the panning or creative blur photos.
Taking the Picture
After you choose your shutter speed, take a strategic position, and know
what kinds of opportunities might be coming your way (literally!), take the
picture. Watch the action closely, frame the image in your viewfinder, and
snap away.
Capturing great sports moments
As you shoot, keep some simple concepts in mind. For example, here are
some things to look for in a great sports image:
✦Full extension: The athlete at the top of a leap or in full stride represents
one example of the decisive moment in sports photography.

Taking the Picture
374
✦The coiled spring: The moment before release when muscles are tense
and the body is coiled represents another key moment in sports. This
image shows the athlete just before he or she explodes into action.
Think of the shot put thrower just before release, the shot still pressed
into the chin; or the baseball pitcher, arm reared back ready to reverse
direction and fire the ball at the batter.
✦Emotion: A great sports image doesn’t even need to be a good action
shot. Catch the athlete or fan in a moment of extreme emotion, and
you’ve gotten a memorable image. Watch the fans, watch the coaches,
and watch the athletes watching the other athletes. 
Most sporting events are carnivals of colors, patterns, and personalities.
They provide a wealth of photographic opportunities not limited to just the
playing field. Enthusiastic photographers, curious about the world around
them and with an eye to more than just the game, can produce great sports
photos no matter what camera they’re using.
Setting up for predictable action
Having an understanding of the sport you’re photographing can put you in a
position to take advantage of your ability to predict impending action. Here
are a couple of ways to use that ability.
✦Prefocusing: Sometimes an athlete needs to reach a specific location as
part of a play. If I’m photographing a baseball or softball game and a
runner makes it to third, I swing my tripod-mounted camera to cover
home and prefocus on home plate. I still follow the action with my hand-
held camera, but I also position myself so that I can quickly fire the
second camera for a shot of a runner sliding home. Prefocusing on the
forward end of the basketball rim is another example. You’re now ready
to get a shot of the center leaping for a rebound.
✦Zone focusing: This technique takes advantage of the depth of field that
comes with using a smaller lens opening. (Depth of field is covered in
greater depth in Book IV, Chapter 2. In simple terms, the smaller the lens
opening, the greater the range of sharp focus from one point to another
on a line from the lens.) The idea here is to choose a lens opening that’s
small enough to create a zone of sharp focus. The zone should be deep
enough to give you about a 5-foot range in which everything is in focus. 
Zone focusing works well for a sport like basketball, where you know
you can expect action to take place in a location about 5 to 10 feet from
the basket. Using an external flash unit (which many point-and-shoot
digital cameras can do) should enable you to shoot at f/5.6 or f/8, which
gives you that 5-foot range or greater. In Figure 5-12, the focus was set
ahead of time for the ramp, so when the athlete spun around, the
camera was already set for the picture.

Photographing action sequences
Sometimes, you need to do more than just capture one good shot of sports
action. You need to get the sequence of movements that make up an entire
run or the execution of a particular move or trick.
Pros get these sequences by using cameras that can capture as many as
eight pictures per second (usually expressed in fps — frames per second).
Although one or two non-dSLR digital cameras are capable of high-speed,
motor-driven photography, most are good for only about 2 or 3 fps at best.
Usually, you must work with a digital SLR to get 3 to 5 fps and have one of
the high-end pro models to get as many as 8 fps.

Taking the Picture
376
Even with a limited burst mode capability, a photographer can still create
effective photo sequences. Once again, a little planning and foresight can
help you get the best possible results. If you can predict the path the athlete
is going to take, you can better follow that path with your camera. Another
thing that you can do is back out your composition a little to give you some
margin for error. You don’t want to have a great sequence of shots with your
subject ruining it by drifting in and out of the frame.
Here are some tips for getting good action sequences:
✦Visualize the path that you expect your subject to travel.
✦Prefocus on the point where you expect to start shooting.
✦Set the fastest shutter speed you can to give your motor drive the best
possible chance of advancing at its best speed.
✦Compose your shot to give your subject some room to move within the
frame.
✦Shoot several sequences to make sure you get at least one usable
sequence. Remember that you’re trying to get four or five good shots
in a row, not just one, so it becomes that much harder to be sure that
they’re all in focus and well composed. Take lots of shots.
Don’t expect to get a good sequence on your first attempt. This is another
one of those techniques that you need to practice beforehand. You’re trying
to understand how your camera works in this kind of situation and deter-
mine whether you can tweak your gear to perform better. Some cameras
require you to drop down to a lower resolution in order to shoot fast enough
to get a good sequence of images. Because you’re trying to get multiple
images, the loss of resolution might not be as bad as you think. After all,
you’ll have the group of images to take the place of one shot.
Some digital cameras don’t offer a continuous shooting capability. Others
offer it only at a lower resolution setting than you’re really comfortable
using. Just because you can’t blaze away like the pros doesn’t mean you
can’t tell a multiple-picture story of a sports event.
A good sequence of photographs tells a story. If you’re shooting an event in
which an athlete makes more than one run or attempt (long jumpers get six
tries, for instance), work on getting the sequence you want by shooting a dif-
ferent aspect of each attempt. Be careful how you identify the finished result,
though. There’s nothing wrong with showing how each element of the jump
works through a sequence of images, but representing it as the individual
elements of one jump is the kind of thing that gets photographers in trouble.

aking pictures while traveling can be the most rewarding long-term 
benefit of a trip. Although memories of a particular location fade as the
years go by, the images that you create will still be there to remind you of a
special time in your life. Plus, face it: Photography is fun! Knowing that
you’ve taken a good picture of that special location gives you a particularly
satisfying feeling. Lasting friendships can be made during a trip, and being
able to send your new friends pictures of the time you shared together can
help cement your friendship.
If you’ve traveled with a film camera in the past, you’ll find
that vacationing with a digital camera offers some terrific
advantages over traditional picture-taking tools. Digital
cameras can be smaller and lighter than their film
counterparts, so they take up a lot less space in
your luggage. They have no film that airport secu-
rity X-ray cameras can damage. And as you take
photos, you can check them using your digital
camera’s built-in LCD screen.

pieces of equipment to take — and which to leave behind — can make the
trip less stressful and more productive.
Selecting a camera for your needs
Choosing a camera to use while traveling is an important decision, one that
you might have already made long before your trip. After all, most of us are
unable to buy a camera specifically for a vacation. You’ll want to keep a
camera’s travel photography capabilities in mind whenever you purchase a
digital model. Key decisions revolve around lens versatility (for more options
while taking pictures), file size (more megapixels equal bigger pictures), and
how much control the camera gives you over shooting decisions.
When purchasing a camera, most of your decisions revolve around what
kind of photographer you are and what kind of travel pictures you expect to
take, as the following sections make clear. No matter which category you fall
into, your digital camera should have the basic features that you need to
make a broad range of travel photography easy and carefree.
Professional photographers
Pros like to be ready for anything, even when they’re not on the clock. You
never know when a quick shot taken while on vacation can turn into a sal-
able image. If you’re a professional photographer, look for
✦Compatibility of a digital system with your current film camera’s inter-
changeable lens system, if at all possible. Right now this means Canon,
Nikon, Fuji in Nikon mount, Sigma, Sony (which took over Konica
Minolta), Pentax, and a few other vendors.
✦A choice of camera bodies offering 6–16-megapixel sensors, rapid
sequence shooting ability, and other features, depending on your shoot-
ing needs. Travel photography can sometimes be as fast-paced as sports
shooting and can require high-resolution images for reproduction.
✦A choice of flash units and accessories. A professional system needs to
be flexible enough to accommodate all the gadgets needed for top-of-
the-line travel photography.
Serious amateurs
The best serious amateur photographers are often professionals in every
aspect except monetary reward. They frequently spend a lot on their hobby
and might even be looking at the same systems desired by pros. Their needs
will certainly include

✦A high-resolution (6–10-megapixel) camera with large capacity memory
(with the ability to accept interchangeable memory cards). These fea-
tures enable you to grab travel photos suitable for printing at large sizes,
which you can then display on the wall.
✦Extreme zoom lens capabilities, preferably with a 10X range or the equiva-
lent of 300mm to 400mm on a full-frame camera. This range is ideal for
reaching out and grabbing a small detail from a panoramic scene.
✦Add-on accessory lenses (called teleconverters) to extend a zoom’s capa-
bility even farther.
✦Rapid-shooting capability to allow taking pictures quickly at festivals 
or other fast-moving travel experiences. (The running of the bulls at
Pamplona comes to mind!)
Enthusiastic amateurs
Amateur photo enthusiasts love photography but have other interests —
such as travel! With more limitations on their budgets, they need top-quality
prosumer cameras. These cameras are aimed at consumers but have features
that will please advanced photographers. These include
✦Medium- to high-resolution (6–10-megapixel) camera with decent capac-
ity memory (with the ability to accept interchangeable memory cards).
These cameras enable you to print vacation snapshots in sizes as large
as 5 x 7 to 11 x 14 inches.
✦Versatile zoom lens (between 3X and 10X — up to the equivalent of a
300mm to 400mm lens on a full-frame camera) for taking close-up shots
of distant scenic features or for capturing locals being themselves.
Figure 6-1 shows the “reach” of various typical zoom ratios.
✦Add-on accessory lenses to extend range even farther or to widen the
view to take in monuments, castles, or cathedrals penned in by their 
surroundings.
Vacationers who simply want to take good photos
You know who you are: You want pictures that are sharp and clear, colorful,
and good enough to make a batch of 4-x-6-inch snaps of your best shots. 
You like digital photography and want to capture some travel memories, but
can’t spend a huge amount for your equipment. These photographers need
✦Low- to medium-resolution (5–7-megapixel) cameras (especially pocketable
compact models) with the ability to accept interchangeable memory cards.
✦A versatile zoom lens, at least a 3X zoom, preferably a 5X or longer zoom.

Choosing key features for travel photography
Here are some key features to look for in a camera, no matter what kind of
travel photographer you are. You can find more information on these features
in Book I, Chapter 2.

✦Optical zoom range: A powerful zoom enables you to compose your
image carefully and cover a lot of photographic territory on your travel
treks. With a good zoom, you can also take advantage of lens effects,
such as selective focus.
✦Interchangeable memory cards: Some camera vendors try to get by sup-
plying just a small amount of built-in memory, which may be a skimpy
32MB, and expect you to buy memory cards if you need more. When the
memory is full, you either stop shooting or delete images, neither of
which is a happy option during a once-in-a-lifetime vacation. The ability 
to change cards enables you to just keep shooting. Fortunately, all digital
cameras that do have non-removable, built-in memory also include a slot
for a flash memory card. It’s just something you have to pay for.
✦Sufficient megapixels: The more megapixels, the better. This is true for
several reasons. First, higher resolution (more megapixels) allows for
larger prints of your prized vacation shots. Second, higher resolution
lets you crop down to a smaller view of that monument you just couldn’t
get close enough to and still get a good-quality print.
✦Interchangeable lenses: These days, an increasing number of affordable
digital cameras use interchangeable lenses. These give a photographer a
wide range of choices for high-quality travel photography. Being able to
select from a range of different focal lengths — plus being able to control
depth of field (the range of image sharpness as it appears throughout
the photograph) — gives the photographer tremendous power over the
photographic image. Sometimes manufacturers offer add-on lenses for
non-interchangeable-lens cameras, too.
Think about taking a second camera along, too, particularly if this is more
than just a run-of-the-mill vacation. A small digital camera might not cost
much. If your primary camera fails, your backup camera could be worth its
weight in gold photographically. Shop for or borrow one that uses the same
type of batteries and storage media as your primary camera, if possible.
The extra camera can also entice a spouse or child into sharing your love
of photography. Encourage them to shoot their own photos on the trip.
Selecting lenses for travel
Look at your camera’s built-in capabilities, including the range of magnifica-
tions available from your zoom, as well as the ability to add supplementary
telephoto, wide-angle, or close-up lenses. You can find more about lenses in
Book I, Chapter 2. Travel photographers need three basic capabilities:
✦Wide-angle: Being able to fit more into a picture comes in handy
when you’re shooting scenics and architecture, like the image shown
in Figure 6-2.

Figure 6-2: Wide-angle lenses, like the one used to take this shot, can be useful in tight
quarters.
✦Telephoto: Capturing native wildlife or sports shots without getting dan-
gerously close is an invaluable capability.
✦Macro: These lenses are essential for getting close-ups of native insects,
signs, or documents.
With at least some capabilities in each of these ranges, you can shoot a
broad selection of travel photos without necessarily having to physically
move closer or farther away from your subject.
Considering a tripod
A tripod is a three-legged stand designed to hold your camera steady. You can
find more detailed coverage of tripods in Book I, Chapter 2.
Although a tripod can be a little cumbersome to carry along on a trip, this
camera support can do several things for you. A tripod is great for holding
the camera steady if you are using longer shutter speeds in dim light or
using a telephoto lens. If your camera has a timer feature, you can use a
tripod to get yourself in the picture.
A tripod definitely leads to better pictures, but only if you use it. If you find
the idea of lugging one around too much of a bother during your vacation,
plan on a different tool, such as a monopod, beanbag, or one of the other
options discussed later in this chapter. It’s okay — you’re on vacation!

Investing in an accessory flash
Although most digital cameras have some sort of built-in flash capability,
these are usually only good for a range of about 8 feet or so, which isn’t
always enough. Because available light (more commonly known as available
darkness) is undependable, the traveling photographer should consider car-
rying an accessory flash unit.
Accessory flash units do more than just provide extra light when it’s too
dark to shoot without it. The reasons why an extra flash can be particularly
helpful for travel photography include the following:
✦Using fill flash: If you’re planning to
shoot a companion who is in partial
shade or is wearing a ball cap, an
accessory flash can help you clean
up the shadows. Because the sup-
plemental light isn’t trying to light
the whole scene, filling can be
accomplished by smaller, less 
powerful flash units (such as the
camera’s built-in flash) or even by a
reflective surface. 
A 3-x-3-foot piece of folding Mylar or
a silver-coated auto sunshield held
by a helper to reflect the sunlight
into the area where the sunlight
can’t reach provides a nicely lit
photo, as shown in Figure 6-3.
✦Painting with light: If part of your
trip takes you into a dark place,
such as a thirteenth-century
church that doesn’t have any spot-
lights shining on it, an accessory
flash might help. You can use the
painting with light photo technique,
covered later in this chapter, with
a tripod or firm support.
✦Macro/close-up photography: If you want to take close-up shots of 
typical local jewelry, markers, or insects, you need to provide a lot of
light in order to get enough image sharpness to create a good-looking
image.
Figure 6-3: Keep a compact reflector in 
your travel bag to fill in shadows.

Many higher-end digital cameras offer
some method of triggering an accessory
flash unit, either by a cable connection
or via hot shoe (the connection found
on the top of many digital cameras that
holds the flash and provides electrical
contact with the camera). Figure 6-4
shows the hot shoe found on one
Olympus digital camera model. Many
consumer-priced digital cameras, how-
ever, offer no such provision. If your
camera doesn’t have the means for
adding an additional flash, a slaved
flash specifically designed for digital
cameras might be your answer. (A
slaved flash has a built-in light sensor
that triggers the slaved flash when
your camera’s flash fires.)
Accessory lighting is covered more thoroughly in Book II, Chapter 5.
Selecting a camera bag
Depending on the size of a digital camera and the accessories accompanying
it, a camera bag or pouch could be a necessity. For just the basics — a small
camera, extra batteries and memory cards, and a lens cleaning cloth — a
simple fanny pack will do the job and leave room for hotel keys, money, and
identification. 
If you’re a more serious photographer who’s carrying a larger digital camera
or an interchangeable-lens digital SLR, you need more space. Although a
larger camera bag could be the answer, the active traveler should consider
these factors:
✦Size: Your camera bag should be roomy enough to hold your basic
camera setup and also leave some room for an extra piece of gear or
two, such as filters or extra batteries that you’ll be glad you have when
you’re hundreds or thousands of miles from home.
✦Flexibility: An ideal bag includes multiple compartments that can be
reconfigured (with hook-and-loop tape) so that you can adapt the bag 
to the different configurations of camera outfit that you might need.
You’ll often find that your equipment needs vary from place to place on
vacation. At one destination, you might need easy access to your extra
flash unit. At another, you’ll want to grab your add-on wide-angle lens
quickly.

external flash.

✦Sturdy strap: Much travel is done on the run. A travel-friendly bag has
a main strap that runs around the sides and bottom of bag and that’s
securely stitched, not grommetted into the fabric. (Don’t underestimate
the importance of this one, folks!)
✦Toughness: To stand up to the rigors of travel, a bag should be made of
rip-stop nylon or canvas. If you’re really into leather, though, you don’t
have to rule this material out, either — if the bag is well constructed.
✦Security and convenience: The
bag should offer multiple methods
of closing. Usually a good bag
offers a fast method of closing (fre-
quently with hook-and-loop tape or
clasps) and a more secure method
of closure (zippers or clips) that
takes more effort to open and
close but makes accidental open-
ing less likely. Figure 6-5 shows
such a bag.
✦Protection from the elements: The
bag needs a top flap that closes
over the main compartment in
such a way that if it’s hit by rain,
the water is channeled down the
bag sides. Water shouldn’t be able
to seep through a zipper channel
or closure point. Although the zippered closure on this bag looks secure,
it does little to protect the sensitive digital camera equipment inside
from rain.
At some point, you can cross over the line that divides vacation photogra-
pher from pack mule. Do a dry run with all your gear before leaving. Now 
ask yourself whether you’re comfortable with the idea of lugging that stuff
around with you on your vacation. The only right answer to the question is
the one that satisfies you.
Keeping your camera powered
Modern cameras use batteries like there’s no tomorrow, particularly digital
cameras with their power-draining LCD screens and built-in flashes. That’s
not much of a burden when you’re shooting close to home. But if you’re 
traveling — far from AC power or a ready source for batteries — power is a
prime consideration. If you plan to shoot pictures for more than a couple of
hours, take along spare batteries to use until you get back to civilization.
Figure 6-5: A sturdy bag with multiple
ways of closure offers the most flexibility.

Getting the Right Gear
386
Predicting battery life is a bigger challenge than taking good pictures simply
because the figure varies depending upon your particular camera, how
much you review your shots on the LCD finder, how many pictures you take,
what kind of media you’re using, how often you use your internal flash, what
type of batteries you’re using, and what the temperature is. (Batteries drain
faster in the cold.) If you’re careful with the LCD screen and flash and keep
the camera warm, four AA batteries could last for several hundred to 1,000
or more shots, depending on the camera.
Here’s how to maximize your battery life when on vacation:
✦Short reviews: Most digital cameras let you set how long the LCD stays
on for review after a shot is taken. Choose the briefest setting. You can
always review an individual shot for a longer period if need be.
✦Flash with care: Built-in flash units reduce battery life by half. Use an
accessory flash if possible.
Camera bag alternatives
If a traditional camera bag doesn’t do every-
thing you need, consider some alternatives.
Here are some of the most popular:
 Backpacks: An alternative to the camera
bag is the camera backpack. These range
in size from small — big enough for just the
camera, a couple of lenses, and some
accessories — to massive carry-alls. One
drawback is that you have to take the pack
off and put it down every time you need to
retrieve something.
 Modular belt systems: I use one of these
myself, and it’s great if you don’t plan on sit-
ting down very often. It puts the weight on
your hips and leaves multiple lenses and
accessories within easy reach even when
wearing a backpack. The modularity of the
system means that it can be configured for
almost any sort of shoot.
Several manufacturers make modular belt
systems, including Tamrac (www.tamrac.
com), Lowepro (www.lowepro.com), and
Kinesis (www.kinesisgear.com). These
belts are festooned with loops, and sepa-
rate pouches are mated to the belt with
hook-and-loop tape. The advantage to this
system is that the belt can be configured for
different needs and matched to each day’s
shoot. Pouches are also available to hold
cell phones, water bottles, and other non-
photographic items.
 Chest bags: A chest bag enables you to
carry your camera harnessed to your chest,
where you can get to it quickly and easily.
Most of these style of bags can also be
switched to a belt and positioned to ride on
the hip as well.

✦Battery choices: AA lithium batteries tend to last longer than other bat-
tery types, so if you use these, you can extend the active life of your
shooting session before replacements are necessary. They also handle
cold weather better. You should always carry at least one set of extra AA
batteries (more if you shoot a lot).
If you’re traveling in your home country, chances are you already know how
easy or difficult it is to feed your camera, but even here in the United States,
not every type of battery can be found in the “boonies.” If your camera
requires one of the less common types, your digital camera can become a
paperweight before your trip is half over.
If your camera uses AA or AAA batteries,
rechargeable batteries are the best answer
(with an extra set of backups, or two or three
sets) for each device you bring that needs
them. Choose nickel metal-hydride (NiMH)
rechargeable batteries if you can because they
have more power, are safer for the environ-
ment, and have several technical advantages
over other types. If your camera doesn’t use a
common battery type, bring lots more than you
think you’ll need. Remember, if you have to buy
batteries at a popular tourist destination, you’ll
probably pay a lot more than you normally
would at home. 
If you’re lucky, you’ll have a camera that can
accept a rechargeable battery pack and use reg-
ular AA batteries as well. Some packs, like the
one shown in Figure 6-6, are the same form
factor as a pair of AA cells.
Of course rechargeable batteries need to
be recharged. If you’re going overseas, make
sure that you have the proper adaptors for whichever country you’re visit-
ing. Don’t automatically assume there will be plenty of outlets, either. I
recently went on a Bahamas cruise and found that our stateroom had only
one outlet. Because I’d come prepared with a power strip, we could still plug
in my laptop, battery chargers, fan, and my wife’s hair dryer and curling iron.
Without such foresight . . . well, my wife and I would surely have ended up
fighting over a single outlet.
Figure 6-6: Some rechargeable
packs can be replaced with
conventional AA cells.

Another option, especially for those headed for a week or two in the back-
country, is a solar-powered battery charger from ICP Global Technologies
(www.icpglobal.com/html/pp.htm). This unit can charge four AA batter-
ies in four hours or so, depending on how bright a day it is. (Good luck if
you’re hiking in the Pacific Northwest.) The hard part might be finding a way
to keep the device pointed toward the sun while you’re backpacking through
the forest. You may also want to consider whether carrying the unit’s weight
(1.3 pounds) in extra batteries would be more efficient.
By the way, many of today’s camera makers have resorted to marking the
battery compartment orientation markings through indentations (+ or –) in
the molds used to make the compartments, rather than painting the mark-
ings on with white paint. If your camera is one of those, consider finding a
way to mark it yourself with something more visible, such as nail polish.
Picking up other useful devices
Gizmos. Gadgets. Thingamajigs. Many of these items don’t fall into any par-
ticular category except that they do something useful. Here are some of the
most popular photo widgets:
✦Cleaning kit: A cleaning kit includes these items:
• Microfiber cleaning cloth: These are useful for keeping lenses and
bodies clean.
• Blower brush: Use this first and blow off any dust or small particles.
• Silica packets: These absorb any moisture that gets in your camera
bag. Keep in a plastic freezer bag that can double as a camera rain-
coat in bad weather.
✦Rain poncho: I always keep a cheap plastic rain poncho in my camera
bag, along with a better rain poncho in my car. Add to that a supply of
plastic bags of various sizes and some artist’s tape that’s easy to apply
and remove from the camera.
Make a raincoat for your camera from a plastic freezer bag. Draw the
end of the bag over the camera’s lens barrel and cut a hole large enough
for it to shoot through. Wrap the artist’s tape around the end of the
barrel and bag to hold the bag in place, and you’ve got a low-cost rain
poncho for the camera. Thread the camera strap through the end of the
bag that opens and press as much of the seal together as possible. If it’s
hard to see through the viewfinder, turn the LCD display on and use that
to compose the photo. Figure 6-7 shows you what this camera raincoat
looks like. Put a clear or ultraviolet filter over the front of your lens to
provide even more protection from the moisture.

Figure 6-7: A zip-closure bag and tape can make a raincoat for your camera.
✦Towel: Carry some paper towels so that you can towel off any moisture
that gets inside the freezer bag. Toss a silica packet or two in with the
camera before closing the bag to help keep the inside dry. It’s also a
good idea to have something to dry your hands with so you’re not
touching the camera with wet hands. A good choice for this kind of thing
is a Pack Towel, which is a lightweight towel that dries quickly and is
sold in many department stores’ camping sections.
✦A pencil eraser: Sometimes a thin film of corrosion builds up on the bat-
tery and terminal contacts. The cure for this one is to gently rub both
the battery and terminal contacts with a pencil eraser and reinsert the
batteries, making sure that they’re right-side-up.
✦Polypro gloves: Several outdoor clothing companies make lightweight
gloves out of polypropylene or some brand-name version, such as
Capilene or Thermax. Outdoor enthusiasts prize these synthetic mate-
rials because they wick (transfer) moisture away from the skin to the 
outside of the material, making them seem warmer because the skin
stays dry. Wearing a pair of these in damp conditions will help keep
your hands dry. When you need to touch the camera, pull a glove off,
and you have a dry hand to work with.
✦Artist’s or masking tape: If the conditions are both dusty and windy,
protecting the camera can be vital and difficult. Fine-grit sand or dust
can blow inside the camera’s seals and mess up internal mechanisms.

The same plastic bag technique described in a preceding bullet is good,
but consider taping as much of the bag end shut as possible to get the
best possible seal.
If you’re traveling abroad and want to be sure you won’t be hassled on 
your return, visit a U.S. Customs and Border Protection Office and ask for a
Certificate of Registration (form CF4457). You have to bring your gear to the
customs office where they will confirm your gear and stamp the form. This
will guarantee you won’t be asked to pay a duty on your gear. Find the loca-
tion of the nearest customs office at www.customs.ustreas.gov. Most trav-
elers skip this step and do just fine, but if you have new gear and are going
somewhere known for electronics, filling out the form can be a good idea.
Getting Ready to Go on the Road
You won’t like surprises after you leave home and begin taking pictures. One
key to successful travel photography is making as many preparations as you
can ahead of time so you’ll be organized and confident when you begin cap-
turing memories. Here is a checklist of things to do before you leave:
✦Create a packing list: As you prepare for the trip, put together a packing
list for the photographic gear. Plan a dry run to make sure everything
fits in whatever camera bag or case you’re using.
✦Carry it on: All but the cheapest camera equipment should be included
with carry-on luggage. If you’re taking more than just a basic digital
camera and memory cards, make sure that the camera bag is small enough
to meet carry-on space limits. Record serial numbers for pieces of equip-
ment that have them and have a packing list in a separate bag in case the
camera bag gets lost or stolen. Check with your insurance company to see
whether camera equipment is covered under your policy. If it isn’t, see
whether you can add a rider (a special add-on to your policy) for the trip.
✦Have some in-flight reading: How familiar are you with your camera and
accessories? Maybe it would be a good idea to dig out the instruction
manuals and pack them in your carry-on so that you can reacquaint your-
self with some of the camera’s more esoteric features. The book you’re
reading right now also makes for some good travel reading. I also recom-
mend Digital Travel Photography Field Guide, also from Wiley and yours
truly.
Meeting Your Storage Requirements
Just like going on vacation with a film camera, the digital camera needs a
steady supply of (digital) film. Because of the newness of the technology

Book IV
Chapter 6
Travel Photography
Tried-and-True Travel Photography Techniques
391
(particularly overseas and in Third World countries), photographers need to
ensure that they have enough memory capacity for the trip.
Here are some considerations when bulking up your storage for a trip:
✦Have enough memory. Will you be able to get an entire vacation’s worth
of pictures with your current supply of memory? Remember that you
tend to shoot a lot more while traveling. If you don’t think you’re going
to have enough capacity, consider buying more. Alternatively, you can
carry a laptop computer (if you have one) so that you can transfer
images and free up memory each night. (Test this process before you go
to make sure you have what you need to transfer images.)
✦Try a portable hard drive or CD/DVD burner. In between a pocketful 
of memory cards and a notebook computer are portable hard drives 
and CD/DVD burners. These drives can accept CompactFlash cards 
and other types of removable storage with the proper adaptor (floppy
users are out of luck). For about
$200–$300, far less than a laptop,
you can get a portable hard drive
(like the one shown in Figure 6-8)
with 40–60GB of storage space for
fewer dollars per byte than a
CompactFlash card. The portable
CD/DVD burners, although a bit
larger, can copy your photos to
durable CDs and DVDs, which can
hold gigabytes of information at a
very low cost. If you go this route,
try to acquire the device a couple
of weeks before the trip so you
have time to make sure you can
work it properly.
Even with all the extra memory cards or a portable hard drive, you’re still
carrying less weight than the equivalent in number of shots worth of film.
Tried-and-True Travel Photography Techniques
If you’ve prepared well, you’ll be ready to take great pictures when you reach
your destination. This section tells you a little about some of the most popular
types of travel photography and provides tips on getting the best shots.
In all cases, keep local, regional, and national sensitivities in mind when
choosing your subjects. Some buildings, installations, and people shouldn’t
be photographed because of security, personal, or religious concerns. When
in doubt, ask for permission.

Shooting scenics
Scenic photos are high on the list of pictures people try to bring back from
their travels. After all, you have to prove you went someplace nice, don’t
you? Here are some tips for shooting great scenics:
✦Don’t hurry. The effort to record a site’s beauty all too often results in
quick snapshots hurriedly snatched while with a tour group or during a
sightseeing drive. Some places are spectacular enough that this approach
actually works; most of the time, it’s hit or miss.
✦Not all light is created equal. The best light of the day occurs when the
sun is low in the sky. Early morning and late evening sunlight produce
dramatic shadows and rich, warm colors, when the sun’s light is more
red/orange than any other time during the day. If a site on your trip is
particularly important, plan on being there during the golden hours
(early morning and late evening). Try to do a reconnaissance of the loca-
tion a day or two beforehand so that you can see whether the sun rises
or sets behind what you’re shooting.
When the sun is rising or setting behind the scene, it creates the oppor-
tunity for a dramatic backlight silhouette. This is a difficult exposure 
situation because the camera is pointing directly into the sun. Don’t
underestimate the additional risk for the photographer, who must be
careful not to stare directly into the sun.
✦Create silhouettes. For a good, solid black silhouette of a building, struc-
ture, landscape feature, or person, the camera should be set about two
full f-stops smaller than what the light meter indicates for the main
scene. Your goal here is a bright, orange-red sun (the most dramatic
kind). Depending on your camera, you can either change aperture set-
tings directly, or use the exposure compensation dial to get the exposure
you need. Take several shots at one f-stop increment to make sure
there’s a good exposure, like the one shown in Figure 6-9.
✦Keep it steady. Have your camera mounted on a tripod while doing sce-
nics. The added stability reduces the effects of camera shake and allows
for a slower shutter speed. Reducing the shutter speed enables you to
use a smaller aperture (larger f-stop number), which creates greater
overall depth of field for the sharpest possible picture. 
If a tripod isn’t available, try to find something sturdy to brace the
camera on or against. Walls, car roofs, wooden chairs, and countertops
can all make excellent emergency tripods. Bracing the camera vertically
against a post or column will also help keep it steady enough to help
compensate for too slow a shutter speed for hand holding.

Figure 6-9: A sunset offers the opportunity to create dramatic 
silhouette photos.
✦That cloud looks like a. . . . Take advantage of cloudy skies, which pro-
vide more visual interest than a plain, washed-out blue sky, as you can
see in Figure 6-10. When the clouds are in hiding, compose the image so
that it has minimal empty sky at the top of the frame.
Capturing monuments and architecture
The Arc de Triomphe, the Empire State Building, the Golden Gate Bridge.
Monuments, architecture, and engineering marvels can provide stunning
images and a record of your journey. You can take your photography to a
whole new level by following some simple techniques.

Figure 6-10: Clouds can add a dramatic element to travel photos.
Many of the techniques described earlier for scenics also apply to photo-
graphing these man-made wonders. Some special techniques, however,
apply only to man-made objects.
Taking a shot in the dark
Don’t put your camera away when the sun sets. Buildings, monuments, and
bridges take on an entirely different look at night when they’re all lit up. Here
are some of the things to keep in mind when taking pictures of monuments
after dusk:
✦Support your camera. Once again, use your tripod or some other
camera support. Many cameras suggest using flash at this point; don’t.
Some cameras automatically set the flash under such conditions; over-
ride it if you can. You don’t want to overpower the existing illumination
with flat, bright, electronic flash. Most of the time, flash used in night-
time scenes spoils any existing mood or ambience.
✦Go long. The idea here is to get a long enough exposure to turn the
headlights from cars and trucks into long ribbons of color wrapping
around the base of the structure, while its own lights help give a sense
of its form.

Chapter 6

✦Shoot by the sea, by the sea, by the beautiful sea. Finally, if you’re pho-
tographing in a river or ocean town, a boat can make a fine shooting
platform. Just keep in mind that motor vessels’ powerful engines cause
the decks to vibrate, and a tripod isn’t much help in such circumstances.
When the sun goes down, check out the nearest amusement park. Set your
camera on a tripod or something solid and do a long exposure of the Ferris
wheel or roller coaster or any of the other rides with bright lights and fast
motion.
Painting with light
Sometimes, a building is too big and too dark for normal photographic meas-
ures to do the trick. For these situations, the pros paint with light. This tech-
nique calls for using a long exposure and firing off multiple flash bursts to
illuminate the object in sections. Here’s how to do it:
1. Set your camera on a steady surface.
A tripod is good, but so is a short wall or the ground. Keep your camera
steady because if the camera moves, the illuminated areas move, too,
putting them out of alignment.
2. Adjust the camera for a time exposure.
Check your camera manual to learn how to set your camera for a time
exposure.
3. Decide what areas of your subjects need painting.
Keystoning
Keystoning, also known as perspective distor-
tion, happens when the photographer tries to fit
an entire building in a photo by tilting the
camera up. The problem with this approach is
that when the camera is no longer perfectly
parallel with the building, any straight lines on
the long axis of the image converge until they
meet at the top. The photographer ends up with
a photo of a building with a wide base and a pin-
point top that appears to be falling away.
How to avoid it? Because the problem comes
from the lens and the building not being per-
fectly parallel, the easiest way to correct that
problem is to bring them into line. You might be
able to do this by finding a way to gain some
elevation. Sometimes, a nearby hill can provide
a distant vantage point. Sometimes, another
building with an accessible roof is available.
Unfortunately, all too often, neither solution is
available, and the only option is to point the
camera up and take the picture.

4. Trigger a time exposure (or have helper do it) using your digital
camera’s particular time exposure controls.
Experiment with different times, from ten seconds to a minute or longer.
5. Paint by triggering your external flash multiple times.
Move the flash around to illuminate the subject in sections. As you
move, keep your body between your light source and camera if you
don’t want the light source to appear in the photo.
Photographers use another technique called writing with light, which can be
lots of fun. It’s an especially apt technique for travel photography, because it
can be used to photograph buildings, monuments, and other scenes that
would otherwise be difficult to capture at night. This is another trick that
takes advantage of a long exposure and a solid shooting platform, such as a
tripod, a wall, or the ground. The idea is to take a pencil torch (penlight) and
point it toward the camera lens while the shutter is open. You can either
swirl it around, or try to write a specific message. Here’s how to do it:
1. Plan what you want to do. It’s good to rehearse a couple of times with
someone watching through the viewfinder.
This way, you know if the camera’s positioned properly to get everything.
Besides, you have to write backward — don’t you think that takes some
practice?
2. Set the camera to shutter priority and give it a long time (long enough
for you to do what you want, probably several seconds or more).
3. Write with light by pointing the light at the camera lens from your
subject position.
4. Review the image with the camera’s LCD screen.
5. If necessary, make some adjustments to your shutter speed based on
what you see in the LCD, using a longer or shorter speed as required.
6. If you want to get really fancy, have a friend or spouse fire off a small
flash after you’re done writing but before the shutter closes.
This helps illuminate you while still allowing your writing to show.
Don’t forget that fireworks, like those shown in Figure 6-11, are a kind of
“writing with light.” You can use the same techniques that I just described
except that you let the aerial display create your image for you. Use a tripod
and set your camera for exposures of a second or two. Set the camera for
about ISO 100 and start your exposure just before the fireworks reach the
top of their arc. Try leaving your shutter open for several sets of displays,
covering the lens with your hand between displays to capture several in one

exposure. Take along a penlight so you can adjust your camera’s settings in
the dark! Time exposures of moving lights and traffic (think the Strip in Las
Vegas) are also great ways to paint with light.

Shooting panoramas
One of the most frustrating moments of travel photography comes when you
find yourself literally surrounded by the beauty of nature and have no way 
to capture all that surrounds you in a single photo. A digital camera, tripod,
and the right image-editing software, however, make capturing a 360-degree
panorama possible. Basically, you take a series of shots for your panorama
and then stitch the shots together (line up the images into one image) on
your computer. Although you can stitch images together in any image editor,
specialized stitching applications are easy to use. Follow these steps to
shoot a panoramic shot:
1. Mount your camera on a tripod and set the camera’s appropriate zoom
setting.
You don’t have to set the zoom lens to its widest setting. Zooming in a
little closer means that you’ll capture more detail per photo. If your main

Tried-and-True Travel Photography Techniques
398
subject is distant, zooming in lets you capture more of the important part
of the scene without wasting space on unnecessary foreground details.
The more shots you take, the more you’ll have to stitch together, and
the greater the chance the software might have trouble creating a 
seamless panorama. Generally speaking, three to six images are most
manageable.
2. Level the camera.
The closer you can come to a perfectly level camera, the better job
your software can do with the final image. Buying an inexpensive level
(as small a unit as possible) at the local hardware store is highly recom-
mended. Set the level on top of the camera and adjust the tripod until
the camera is level.
3. When you take the first picture, waste a shot by photographing your
fingers in front of the lens. Don’t worry about focusing or exposure.
This makes it easy to see where you began the sequence. Do the same
when you’ve completed each sequence.
4. Make your first shot of the scene at either the left or right end of the
panoramic swing that you intend to make.
If your camera is capable of manual exposure, take several readings
throughout the scene and try to come up with an average setting for the
entire range.
5. Take subsequent pictures.
Make sure each shot overlaps the previous one by 20–30 percent.
6. If possible, do a second sequence of images, particularly if lighting
was erratic.
7. Stitch them all together back home, using an image editor or stitching
software.
Packages such as PhotoStitch (furnished free with Canon cameras for
Windows and the Macintosh) or Photoshop and Photoshop Elements’
built-in PhotoMerge panorama capabilities (see Figure 6-12) are easy 
to use and a lot of fun. Your digital camera may come with similar 
applications.
Photographers who are really serious about getting good 360-degree panora-
mas can try a special tripod head made by Kaidan (www.kaidan.com). The
Kaidan head enables you to mount the optical center (or nodal point) of the
camera lens directly over the tripod’s pivot point for the most accurate 
positioning possible. These heads range from a little over $140 to several
hundred dollars or more. Unless you’re a perfectionist, though, you can get
satisfactory results without one.

Shooting adventure sports
Adventure sports, such as white-water rafting, rock climbing, scuba diving,
and similar activities, entail different risks and require different precautions
and tools to protect your precious equipment:
✦Dry boxes: Climbers and hikers need to keep their gear dry by using
waterproof camera bags or other equipment. Sports like white-water
rafting and kayaking call for even greater protection. Usually, these
boaters protect their gear in a dry box setup. The best known manufac-
turer of these is Pelican (www.casesbypelican.com), which makes
cases with foam insides that can be cut to fit specific camera gear. If
using one of these, take very good care of the O-rings that provide the
watertight seal for the box. 
Veteran river runners sometimes rely on Army surplus ammo or rocket
boxes, which also provide a watertight container for gear, but without
the form-fitting foam. If you use one of these, make sure that the camera
is properly cushioned from the bumps and jolts that white-water rafting
entails. If you protect your camera from water, you can easily take
photos like the one shown in Figure 6-13.

Figure 6-13: To take a photo like this, you need to protect your gear from water.
✦Carabineers: These are the oval clips that climbers use to secure them-
selves to safety ropes; you can use them to clip the dry box to your off-
road vehicle. If you’re immersed in a water activity, the clips can also
secure your dry box to the raft or inside the kayak. The boaters will run
the rapid, catch an eddy at the end of it, unpack the camera, and start
shooting. Once again, placing a silica packet or two in one of these cases
will help keep dampness from damaging equipment.
✦Underwater digital cameras: Another option for those who want to
shoot a lot in wet conditions is a new underwater digital camera. I’ve
used underwater cameras even when I wasn’t planning to go in the
water. (You never can tell where a hike will end up.) The SeaLife
ReefMaster underwater digital camera comes in a waterproof housing
and works both on land and underwater. The camera, which retails for
under $400, produces only a 3.3-to 5.0 megapixel image but saves you
the trouble of trying to find a housing to fit an existing digital camera.
The camera also has an LCD screen that works underwater and a fast
delete function, both of which make it easier to operate underwater.
Check out the manufacturer’s Web site at www.sealife-cameras.com
for more information.

✦Waterproof casings: More extreme conditions call for better protection.
Waterproof casings that still allow photography are available from sev-
eral companies, including ewa-marine (www.ewa-marine.de). These are
useful for both underwater photography (careful on the depth, though)
and above the water if sailing or boating.
Keep in mind that salt spray is very possibly the worst threat to camera
electronics there is. A camera housing provides good protection against
wind and salt spray.
✦Deep-diving housings: For serious underwater enthusiasts, heavy-duty
Plexiglas camera housings now exist for small digital cameras. These
housings are available for a wide range of digital cameras and can be
found for as little as $200.
Photographing people
There are lots of reasons to photograph people while traveling, and also
some reasons not to. Photographing law enforcement or military personnel
without getting their permission first can be a bad idea.
With the heightened concern about terrorism these days, many security
forces, including our own, have become much more sensitive about people
photographing and videotaping government facilities and employees. While
traveling in Israel and South America, it wasn’t unusual to see armed military
personnel walking the streets. Even a decade ago, it wasn’t a good idea to
grab a snapshot of them, and I wouldn’t even consider it these days unless
I’d gotten their permission first.
When photographing people in other areas of the country or in foreign lands,
remember that effective travel photography needs to create a sense of place.
Any time the photographer can use lifestyle, surroundings, work, or clothing
to show the region or culture involved, he or she has achieved at least one
measure of success. Certain elements can help your photos convey your
location:
✦Clothing: Different cultures have different tastes in clothing and jewelry.
✦Design: Advertisements, homes, and buildings will look different
whether you’re overseas or in the United States.
✦Products: Soda cans, candy bars, and other packaging is different in
other countries, and sometimes even in the United States.
✦The natural world: Plants and wildlife might be noticeably different in
other locations.

Tried-and-True Travel Photography Techniques
402
In addition to creating a sense of place, these tips can help you effectively
photograph people while traveling:
✦Be aware of cultural sensitivities. Some cultures frown upon photo-
graphic images of other human beings (that includes cultures in the
United States, as well). In many Middle Eastern and Third World countries,
women wear clothing designed to hide their appearance. In some of these
countries, photographing them can be a serious taboo (as can a man
speaking to one of them to even ask permission to take their photo).
✦Check out the local customs. Although taboos that have their origins in
religious beliefs can stay constant for millennia, official taboos can shift
frequently. Check with the U.S. consular office for the country that you’re
visiting to learn what’s okay and what isn’t. The Web site http://
travel.state.gov/travel/warnings.html also has information on
individual countries and policies.
✦Ask first. As a newspaper reporter and photographer, my philosophy
was to shoot first and ask questions later. (You can always talk to people
after an event’s over, but you can’t re-create photos.) Photojournalists
working in a newsgathering capacity are afforded some liberties that are
considered out of line for tourists, though. (And that’s in this country;
the rules vary from country to country.) In the case of a traveler photo-
graphing others without their permission, it’s a behavior that many
would at least consider rude.
✦Pretend I’m not here. One of the reasons why pros prefer to shoot first
and then ask is because people appear more natural when they don’t
know that they’re being photographed. A common way of dealing with
this problem is to ask permission and then explain you’d like the picture
to look “natural” and could they please go back to what they were doing
and forget you’re there.
✦Be forgettable. Although your subjects likely start out self-conscious,
after a few minutes, they tend to become involved in their activity and
forget you’re there.
✦Give them feedback. Be aware of human psychology. People who are
posing tend to wait for some feedback at first — namely the click of the
camera that tells them you’re satisfied. If they don’t hear it because
you’re waiting for them to forget you’re there, they tend to become con-
cerned that you’re not happy with what they’re doing. Use your digital
advantage (being able to delete bad shots) and take a photo or two at
the start. Your subject will relax a little and begin to forget you’re there.
Another technique works well if you have a camera with a fairly wide-angle
lens. Set the zoom to the widest possible focal length and hold the at camera
waist level and as perpendicular to the ground as you can. I usually try to do
this one-handed with the camera strap helping me keep the camera under

403
control. Most people relax even more at this point because they don’t expect
you to shoot now. At this point, when I see the shot I want, I trip the shutter.
This technique works better if you’re familiar enough with your camera to
have a good idea of what its wide angle covers from a certain distance.
This “shooting from the hip” can be a tricky proposition ethically. At least
one journalism professor I know feels that it’s a violation of trust between a
photographer and the subject.
As a photographer, I believe it’s important to be sensitive to your subject’s
feelings on the matter. Because I’m shooting digitally, I take the shot and then
explain that I’ve taken a shot and show it to the person I’ve photographed. I
then let him or her decide whether or not the photo should be deleted. Most
people don’t mind at all, but I’ve slept better at night by immediately delet-
ing the shot if the person is unhappy with it. This all gets a lot harder if you
and your subject don’t speak the same language. Sometimes, the combina-
tion of pantomime and the preview capability of the digital camera can be
enough for you to get by.
Capturing people and their environments
After the issue of getting permission from your subjects is out of the way,
consider how to photograph them. Being able to capture people in their 
own environment is where you can really feel the advantages of your digital
camera. It’s lightweight and versatile and can take plenty of photos. Here are
some ways to make the most of its advantages:
✦Shoot as much as it takes. If what you want can be achieved in just one
shot, so much the better. Still, there’s nothing wrong with multiple shots
to achieve the same thing, provided the images build upon one another.
✦Capture the environment. At least one shot should show the individual
within his or her cultural environment. After that image is out of the way,
focus on smaller details. Look for things that would be unusual back in
your own home.
✦Move in close. Medium shots and close-ups provide greater intimacy
than full-body or head-and-shoulder shots. A well-focused, tight compo-
sition of a person’s face (cropped in to just eyes, nose, mouth, and not
much more), packs a lot of intimacy. Whatever you do, don’t make the
mistake shown in Figure 6-14, in which the subject is so far away that
you can barely tell who he is.
✦Hands can speak volumes. Sometimes a person’s hands can reveal his
or her work history. Work roughened, they can speak of years of manual
labor and toil. Or a close-up of hands holding small tools or repairing a
watch, for instance, can show great dexterity.

Tried-and-True Travel Photography Techniques
404
✦Capture the essentials. Who is this person? What shows your subject’s
identity? A new mom cradling her baby, a farmer on his tractor, and a
cyclist on her bike are just a few possibilities.
✦Use lighting. Don’t forget to consider lighting. Unless your subject’s in
direct sunlight, some sort of fill flash is necessary. (The term fill flash
comes from its use not as a main light source, but as an additional light
to fill in areas that are hidden from the main light.)
✦Go for variety. Make sure to take a mix of horizontal and vertical photos.
For people shots, take lots of verticals because the human body breaks
down to a series of elements that are taller than they are wide.
✦Show people working, playing, and relaxing. Even on a mountain
climb, like the one shown in Figure 6-15, quiet moments reveal another
side of your subjects. Social gatherings and religious meetings are also
prime opportunities for good photographs. Look for community festi-
vals, too, where you can get lots of people, costumes, and events going
on. In such freewheeling settings, people are less concerned about being
photographed, and you can probably get away with taking wider shots
without having to check with every individual for their permission.
Performers, in particular, are quite used to being photographed.

Documenting Your Trip
Pull together everything from the earlier sections in this chapter to create
memorable photos of your trip. Documenting a vacation is more than grab-
bing some pretty pictures of your travels; it’s creating a visual narrative that
re-creates the magic of your trip all over again. This section wraps up travel
photography with some final tips for getting great vacation pictures.
Varying your shots
Try for a mix of shots and camera angles. Shoot some close-ups, and shoot
from far away. You can do a lot of things to avoid having all your photos 
look alike:
✦Put the camera on the ground for a worm’s-eye view. Makes that
church look even more imposing.
✦Get a bird’s-eye view. Renting helicopters gets expensive, but there are
other ways of getting up high and shooting down. You were going to
climb that monument anyway, right? Take advantage of the elevation.
Even simpler, climb a staircase and shoot straight down. Take advantage
of cable cars. Take advantage of a hot air balloon ride for some once-in-a-
lifetime scenic photos, like the one shown in Figure 6-16.

Documenting Your Trip
406
Figure 6-16: A bird’s-eye view can provide an unusual vantage point for travel photos.
✦Turn the camera vertically when appropriate. Many scenes lend them-
selves to vertical images, yet most people still grip the camera horizon-
tally. Monuments, people, and buildings are all taller than they are wide.
Turn the camera on its side.
✦Shoot from more than one vantage point. Do like the pros do. Shoot it
high, shoot it low, shoot it horizontally, vertically, get closer, move back,
walk around it. While doing this, remember to consider what’s in the
background.
Composing your shots
How you arrange the elements within your photo has a lot to do with how
much impact they convey. I talk about composition in more detail in Book III,
Chapter 1, but here are some things that can help improve your photo-
graphic composition:
✦Leading lines: Strong linear elements can pull the eye into an image.
Straight lines, diagonal lines, and S-curves all show movement and can
depict strength, direction, or grace. For example, a U.S. flag rippling in
the wind combines an S-curve with the strong lines of the stripes.
✦Framing: Use natural elements, such as window frames or tree branches,
to form a natural border along a corner or around the image. Figure 6-17
is an example of this concept.

Book IV
Chapter 6
Travel Photography

407
✦Rule of Thirds: Divide the frame in thirds horizontally and vertically.
Where the thirds intersect is a good place to position your subject. You
can also use this to show a course of movement. For example, putting an
airplane coming into the frame into the top-right third conveys a sense
of moving downward through the frame.
✦Balance: Ever see a picture of someone sitting on a park bench with one
end of the bench missing? Without the missing support, it seems like the
person is going to drop like a rock off the unbalanced bench. You can
find examples of photos using balance and these other prime rules of
composition in Book III, Chapter 1.

interior photo.

Getting organized
Close focusing (or macro capability) is another one of the digital camera’s
best features. By introducing details of the location you’re visiting, you can
trigger memories of your experience years after the trip has ended.
On that cruise I mention earlier in this chapter (in which the stateroom had
only one electrical outlet), my wife and I were fortunate to stay in an owner’s
suite, one of the nicest cabins on the ship. Each afternoon, we received a
treat of some sort from one of the ship’s staff along with a card announcing
whom it was from. Before enjoying our delicacies, we made sure to photo-
graph the dish and card together, as shown in Figure 6-18, and kept the card
for a scrapbook as well. The photo album from this trip includes many such
details and provides a much fuller and richer representation of our trip.

environment as you travel.

Now take it a step further. Think of your photographic coverage as a series of
still images that tell a story rather than a group of individual pictures that
stand on their own (even though they should).
✦Signs, signs, everywhere there’s signs: Use street and highway signs, or
even the one and only South Pole (shown in Figure 6-19), to show where
you are or where you’re going. Photograph maps and brochures, too.
Don’t just settle for snapshots of these images; try to use lighting and
depth of field to turn them into interesting images in their own right.
✦Cultural and language differences: Signs differ from country to country.
In the United States, signs read End of construction. Years ago, on a trip
through New Zealand, I photographed a sign, shown in Figure 6-20, that
proclaimed, Works End, with a cemetery in the background.
✦More signs: Street and road crew signs are only one type of photo-
graphic target, though. Distinctive shop, restaurant, and tavern signs
also provide reminders of where you’ve been.
✦Newspapers/newsstands: Check the local newsstands. In at least some
countries, newsstands say something about where you’re visiting. For
that matter, a close-up of the day’s headline during your visit can make a
good introductory graphic if you’re giving a presentation.
Figure 6-19: The South Pole is one sign that you’ve traveled far and wide.

410
Figure 6-20: A sure sign that your travel work is never really at an end.
✦Trailheads: On a wilderness trip, most trailheads are well marked.
Photograph the signs. Shoot the trail maps, too. Your packs, supplies,
and other gear should also be documented. Follow the same approach 
if you’re on a white-water, skydiving, or ski trip.
✦White water: For white water, shoot as many rapids as possible. (Only
my fellow paddlers will get that pun.) Photograph the rapids from the
side because that field of view gives a better sense of scale than a head-
on shot. If you can, get a raft or kayak in the photo because that will help
show the rapid’s size.
✦River scenes: Wilderness rafting trips include many other photo oppor-
tunities as well. Photos of swimmers (the white-water euphemism for
someone who’s inadvertently become one with the river) and their
rescue provide dramatic images. The lunch buffet (if on a commercial
trip) provides an opportunity for humor if you get shots of some of the
sandwiches the guides make. (Guides traditionally eat after the paying
guests have gone through the buffet. As a result, some of the sandwich
ingredients get pretty creative. Mine usually included cold cuts, veggies,
chunky peanut butter, and thick slices of onion.)
✦River scenes (part 2): Don’t forget that white-water rivers generally 
offer spectacular scenery, too. Plus, you can take shots of all the 
preliminaries — inflating the rafts, getting gear together, putting on 
wet suits and life jackets.

✦Rock climbing: Scenery, gear, climbers. Oh yeah, don’t forget the rocks.
Seriously, mix close-ups, wide-angle shots, and action images of the
climbers. Take advantage of the bright colors and patterns of the cloth-
ing that rock climbers wear, and the chocks, friends, and nuts (protective
equipment climbers use to anchor into the rock, for all you nonclimbers)
are great subjects for close-up shots. So are chalk-covered fingers. Also,
get lots of angles: Shoot from below, above, and alongside the climbers.
✦Moods: Everything doesn’t have to be bright and sunny in your travel
photos. Don’t be afraid to shoot moody, misty, rainy days, like the one
shown in Figure 6-21, to show yet another side of your journey.
✦Papers, please: Don’t forget close-ups of your travel documents. They’re
also part of the story you’re telling.

You’ll soon discover that good photography is all in the details. Visiting for-
eign cultures provides a wealth of these details that help show how different
or similar we are. Close-ups of jewelry, magazines, and candy and food pack-
aging help emphasize that you’ve gone somewhere different.

Basics of Image

very journey begins with a ﬁrst step, and if
you still haven’t taken the plunge into image
editing, this minibook helps make that step a
gentle immersion rather than a plummet from the
high-dive platform. I show you exactly what you
can and can’t expect to do with image editors
such as Corel Paint Shop Pro, Corel PhotoPaint,
Ulead PhotoImpact, and Adobe Photoshop and
Photoshop Elements. You’ll see the capabilities of
each of these applications and discover the full
range of tools each puts at your disposal.
I close out this minibook with a chapter that 
compares and contrasts the most popular image
editors so you can choose which one (or perhaps
two!) of these image editing programs you really
need to make your digital photos look their best.

ith all the seemingly miraculous things that you can accomplish with
image editing tools, it would be easy to assume that there’s
nothing you can’t do. You’d think that you could take any
image, in any condition, and make it beautiful — but is
that really the case? Not always. Although you cer-
tainly can do a great deal to repair serious tears, rips,
stains, and scratches, as well as the effects of aging
and improper photographic technique, you can’t
solve every problem every time — at least not
easily.
You can’t, for example, take a photo in which
everything is out of focus and make it as crisp and
clear as the photographer probably intended. If,
however, one part of the photo is in focus and the
other parts are a blurry distraction, you can blur them
out even further so that they’re just a pleasant backdrop
to the properly focused portion. Or, you can remove them
altogether, eliminating the unpleasant aspects of the image. You’ll
find that in some extreme cases, your images might require some compro-
mise when editing them, giving up one thing to gain another. Or success
might require a willingness to work with only the parts of the photo that are
salvageable, discarding the rest. This chapter provides a quick introduction
to the kinds of fixes you can expect to make with image editing tools.

Correcting Colors
416
Correcting Colors
As you probably know, digital camera
images are made up of the red, green,
and blue primary colors of light. (You
can find more about this in Book II,
Chapter 1.) These three colors can be
combined to produce the colors you
see on a video monitor, within the limi-
tations of the monitor’s color reproduc-
tion capabilities. When your digital
pictures are printed, these colors are
expressed as combinations of their
complementary colors, which are the
primaries of pigments. The complement
of red is cyan, and it is printed by com-
bining yellow and magenta; the comple-
ment of blue is yellow, and it is printed
by combining magenta and cyan; and
the complement of green is magenta,
and it is printed by combining yellow
and cyan. Everyone has seen a color
wheel, like the one shown in Figure 1-1,
that shows these relationships.
Knowing these relationships can be useful when it comes time to correct
colors. For example, as you’ll find out later in this chapter, you fix a photo that
appears to be too red by removing some red or by “adding” its complement,
cyan. (You’ll see why “adding” is in quotes in the next subsection.) Similarly,
you can remove green or “add” magenta; remove blue or “add” yellow.
We’ve all seen photos with a strange green, yellow, or red tinge, where skin
looks weird, hair colors aren’t anything close to what appears in nature,
leaves are blue, grass is yellow, and basically everything looks alien. The
color problem can happen either when the photo was taken or during devel-
opment. Sometimes photos that looked okay in the beginning change color
over time. Regardless of the cause, you can fix most color problems — with
some exceptions, of course.
Most image editing applications provide tools for adjusting a photo’s color
levels. Depending on the features of your favorite application, you might or
might not be able to add color or change color effectively, and this is per-
haps one of the most important tests for evaluating multiple image editing
applications. If you can’t get rid of a ruddy, sunburned look in a photo or
eliminate the nausea-green tinge in a picture, consider looking to another
application for serious photo editing.

the primary colors of light and their
complements can be represented by a

Can’t Do with Image

You can’t add color that isn’t there
Typically, adjusting image color involves changing existing color levels. If the
photo is a color image, you can adjust the levels of whatever color is in
unwanted abundance so that the tones are more natural. However, color cor-
rection can’t add color that isn’t there in the first place. For example, in an
overpoweringly red image, removing the red cast might not leave enough
green and blue colors to produce a realistic image. One of the things that
you can’t do with an image editor is fix the color of images that are too far
off the deep end in terms of color balance.
Similarly, if the image is in black and white or has faded so much that it’s
hard to tell whether it was ever in color, adding that touch of color to a
photo might not be so easy. You can’t simply increase or decrease one or
more colors if the colors aren’t there in the first place.
You can, however, add layers to your image and color them in by using your
editing software’s fill color and painting tools. In doing so, you create a color
wash on top of a faded or black-and-white photo. Think of it as the clear
plastic overlays in the old anatomy books, in which each successive layer
added some content (the respiratory system, the digestive system, and so
on) until the body was complete. You can add layers of color on top of the
faded image, achieving the look of rich color that’s currently missing.
Do keep in mind, however, that when you add color layers to a very faded or
black-and-white photo, the results often look fake, sort of like how colorized
black-and-white movies look a little funky. To put it bluntly, people’s teeth look
blue instead of white, and natural things (grass, trees, flowers, and so on)
never look quite natural. If you want to brighten a faded color, you can proba-
bly use an editing tool or two to bring back a bright blue dress or some lush
green lawn, provided that there’s enough color to work with in the original.
Fixing color casts
A color cast is a tinge — a shade of red or maybe yellow — that discolors
your image in whole or in part. Casts occur for a variety of reasons, includ-
ing the age of the photo, the quality of your scanner (if you scanned a
printed original), the print from which you scanned the image, or the film
used to take the picture. If a cast appears in an image captured with a digital
camera, you might need to adjust the white balance of your camera to com-
pensate for the different colors offered by various types of illumination. (See
your camera’s instructions to learn how.)
Most digital editing applications offer tools for getting rid of a cast, like 
the greenish tinge in Figure 1-2, usually with a name like Color Balance or
Color Cast.

Correcting Colors
418
Figure 1-2: The greenish tinge makes this lemon resemble a jaundiced lime.
Here’s a general description of the necessary steps for eliminating a color cast:
1. Open the image with the unwanted color cast.
2. Choose your image editor’s Color Balance, Color Cast, or similar 
command.
The dialog box opens with an array of tools, similar to what you see in
Figure 1-3.
3. Choose whether you want to apply the change to the Shadows,
Midtones, or Highlights.
4. Move the Cyan/Red, Magenta/Green, or Yellow/Blue slider away from
the color of the unwanted hue.
For example, if your picture is too blue, move the Yellow/Blue slider
toward Yellow.
5. Click OK to apply the change when you’re satisfied.
Applications such as Paint Shop Pro, Photoshop, and others have a Preview
option. Make sure that you leave the Preview option selected in the dialog
box. Leaving it checked means that you don’t have to apply the changes just

Book V

to see them in your image. If you do apply them and then decide you don’t like
the change, choose Edit➪Undo (or your image editor’s equivalent) to go back.
If your application doesn’t refer directly to a color cast, you can use any tool
that adjusts tone, including dialog boxes and toolbar settings that allow you
to adjust the levels of color in the image, one color at a time. This enables
you to increase the level of blue, red, green, or yellow (or perhaps cyan or
magenta), and you can tweak one or more of them until the photo looks
more natural and normal.
Another tool in Photoshop and Photoshop Elements is the Variation tool,
which gives you several different versions of an image to choose from,
enabling you to add more red, green, or blue. You can adjust color intensity
for any one of these colors in your image and view Before and After versions
of the image. In Photoshop, choose Image➪Adjustments➪Variations. If
you’re using the lower-priced and nearly as powerful Photoshop Elements,
choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Color Variations. Figure 1-4 shows the
Elements Color Variations dialog box as well as our lemon portrayed in a
variety of tones.
What do you do if none of the color correction tools in your image editing
software does the trick? You can try a different application, or you can
appreciate the photo for what it is. If it’s an old photo, the color problems
can add charm. If it’s a new image and there’s no excuse other than film or
technique, just chalk it up to experience. You can also try rescanning a print
on a different scanner or after recalibrating your scanner (follow the manu-
facturer’s instructions). You can find out more about scanners in Book VII,
Chapter 1.

Figure 1-4: Color Variations lets you choose the best color balance from a selection of images. 
Causes of color catastrophe
Where does bad color come from? Generally it comes from a digital camera
that has been adjusted to the wrong white balance setting (say, set to indoor
light when you’re shooting outdoors), environmental color casts (such as
sunsets or bright snowy conditions), or, in the case of film images, age of the
film, bad film, bad development technique, poor print quality, or a bad or
poorly adjusted scanner. These factors apply to most color problems in a
poorly colored photo — unnatural tones, images that are too bright, too
dark, faded, and so on.
Of course, if you have nondigital photography experience, none of this is
news, and you probably know what to do to make sure that the images you
take, develop, and print are not color-challenged. However, if you’re a fledg-
ling photographer or simply enjoy taking photos of family, friends, and 
vacation spots (and have no idea what you’re doing beyond focusing and
shooting), you might not know how to prevent problems in the future. Some
things to consider include

Book V
Chapter 1
What You Can and
Can’t Do with Image
Editing Tools
Adjusting Brightness and Contrast
421
✦Use appropriate film and/or white balance settings. When shooting
with a traditional (not a digital) camera, use film intended for the types
of shots you’ll be taking. Some films are balanced for indoor use; some
are better for outdoor use. Digital cameras, too, need to be balanced for
the light source, so you’ll want to make sure that your camera is set for
Automatic White Balance (AWB) or adjusted manually for the type of
lighting you’ll be shooting under.
✦Check printer settings. If you’re printing a digitally captured image, the
color could go wrong entirely because of the printer’s color settings,
eliminating the need to edit the image. Use your image editor’s calibra-
tion tools to correct for the vagaries of your particular printer. Try print-
ing the image on someone else’s printer to determine the common
denominator.
✦Calibrate your monitor. Use your software or monitor’s instructions to
calibrate your monitor to help insure that what you see is what you can
expect to get.
✦Fix problems by using scanner software. If you’re scanning from a print,
you get whatever sins were committed when that photo was taken,
developed, and printed. Take note of any problems and be ready to
accommodate them by using your scanner software — if color correc-
tion tools are included in its toolbox — or by using your image editing
software. Better to have noticed the problem before you scan, print,
and/or share the image online!
✦Store images properly. Because aging causes many color problems when
the dyes in the three color layers of prints fade at different rates, store
your images in a cool, dark place and make sure that they contact only
acid-free paper. Acids in some papers damage photos, and you can avoid
it by using photo albums and storage boxes that were made in the last
10–20 years. Don’t reuse the old photo albums that came over with your
family on the Mayflower; the paper could contribute to the aging process.
If you have a precious image that you display in a frame, don’t expose it to
direct sunlight. Hang or stand any framed images in a place that gets only
reduced ambient sunlight or low-level incandescent or fluorescent light from
bulbs. Direct, bright sunlight fades images the worst. And because the colors
in photos don’t fade at the same rate, your previously natural-toned image
can turn yellowish, reddish, greenish, or some combination thereof.
Adjusting Brightness and Contrast
Other components that you’ll want to fix with your image editing software
include brightness and contrast. Detail can be lost when an image is overex-
posed, faded, or just too bright. Detail can also be lost when an image is too

Adjusting Brightness and Contrast

dark because of a failed flash or simply a very dark subject. A day that looks
perfect for picture taking to you can result in washed-out faces, shiny fore-
heads, light-eating shadows, and an overall lack of definition. You can elimi-
nate many of these problems by adding and removing light in your image
with the help of the brightness and contrast controls found in just about
any worthy image editing package. Figure 1-5 shows a photo that has been
improved simply by adjusting the brightness and contrast.
Figure 1-5: Sometimes photos need adjustments to brightness and contrast.
With most image editors, you have several choices for fixing these problems:
✦Quick Fix: Many image editors have a quick fix command with a variety
of tools for tweaking just about any aspect of an image. You can adjust
brightness, color, focus, contrast, flash, and backlighting. You can also
rotate the image. 
Like with the Variations feature (which I discuss in the earlier “Fixing
color casts” section), you can also preview a Before and an After version
of your image, as shown in Figure 1-6. Previewing versions enables you
to see whether the adjustments are having the desired effect before
committing them to the image.
✦Auto Contrast: This is an easy one. Many image editors, including Paint
Shop Pro and the Adobe products, have an Auto Contrast or Automatic
Contrast Enhancement command. Choose this command, and voilà!
Your image is adjusted, using existing color and brightness levels to
determine a happy medium.

✦Auto Levels: This automatically adjusts the relationship of the tones

Murky shadows and washed-out highlights
Most of the tools described earlier in this chapter adjust the entire image,
making the whole photo brighter, better, more natural-looking, and so on.
If you want to tinker with specific areas of the
image — an unwanted shadow in the corner, for
example, or a single beacon-like forehead — you
can use your image editing software’s selection
tools before issuing the commands, or you can
use various brush-based tools to apply more or
less light in specific areas.
Huh? Brush-based? That means painting — 
painting more light here, more dark there; using
a big brush here to add a lot of light to a big area;
and using a small brush there to add just a little
dark or light where it’s needed. Most (if not all)
image editing packages offer corrective tools for
adding and removing light and dark. Figure 1-8
shows a toolbox with typical Dodge, Burn, and
Sponge tools that you use to lighten, darken, and
remove (respectively) color saturation from por-
tions of an image. Some image editors use the
regular brush to perform these tasks. For exam-
ple, Paint Shop Pro has Dodge and Burn modes
for its brush, turning the Brush temporarily into
Dodge and Burn tools. Corel PhotoPaint tucks its
Dodge and Burn tools into the Effect tool. All work
in a similar manner.
Go into the light with the Dodge tool
Use a Dodge tool to add light to an image by applying it with a brush that you
customize in terms of the size, shape, and even texture. Most applications
offer a similar tool, if not the ability to completely customize the brush. You
can find more information about the Dodge tool in Book V, Chapter 2 (along
with extra info on the Burn and Sponge tools, too). To use the Dodge tool,
follow these steps:
1. Click the Dodge tool in the toolbox.
Choose the appropriate options on the Options bar that appears above
the workspace, as shown in Figure 1-9.
Figure 1-9: Set the options for the Dodge tool here.

Burn, and Sponge tools.

2. Set the size of your brush so that you don’t apply a large light area to
the image if you don’t want one.
3. Adjust the intensity or opacity of the brush (how much light each
click or stroke of the brush applies).
4. If you really want to control the effect, use the Range option to choose
what is lightened — Shadows, Midtones, or Highlights.
• Shadows: Use this if your image has very dark corners where details
are lost.
• Highlights: Use this if you have a bright spot that needs to be brighter.
• Midtones: Use this default if you want to brighten an area that’s not in
sun or shadow.
5. Begin lightening by either clicking a single spot or by dragging the
mouse over an area.
The more passes you make over one spot, the lighter it becomes.
Need to brighten a single object, such as a face or a flower? Size your brush
to the face or flower in question (so that the brush is the same diameter as the
object) and click the object with the Dodge tool. You can click multiple times,
if needed, to achieve the desired level of lightness.
Keep away from the light with the Burn tool
Opposite the Dodge tool, which adds lightness, the Burn tool adds darkness.
You can revive lost facial features or other details where the sun, too much
flash, or age-induced fading have washed them out, and you can add depth
by simply darkening areas in the image for aesthetic reasons. Using the Burn
tool is much like using the Dodge tool except that wherever you click or
drag, darkness is added, and lightness is taken away.
Living up to its name, the Burn tool can give you a singed, brown tone if you
overuse it. If you click or drag repeatedly in an area with the Burn tool, instead
of a simple darkening effect, the spot will look as though a flame came danger-
ously close to it and the area began to char. Easy does it! Figure 1-10 shows an
image that has been both dodged and burned.
Maintaining consistency
Consistency is a lot like conformity: Too much is not good, and too little can
cause problems. The world would be pretty dull if everyone were the same,
but some degree of conformity and consistency usually makes things run
more smoothly. The same can be said for photos. No interesting photo has
the same levels of light and dark throughout it; only a picture of a white wall
or a black, starless sky has no need for defined depth, implied dimension, or
just plain old variety. 

Adjusting Brightness and Contrast
426
Figure 1-10: The original photo is dodged to lighten some shadow tones and then burned to
darken some light tones.
When you’re adjusting the lights and darks in your image, keep this delicate
balance in mind. You don’t want to make the lights and darks uniform over
the whole image, yet you don’t want to have very dark darks in one spot and
very light lights in another. Artistic images that are meant to convey a mes-
sage, and in which you want people to see that you’ve tinkered with reality,
are another story — there are no limits or boundaries there. But for photos
of people, places, and things that are meant to be realistic and clear, you
want to keep the signs of your tinkering to a minimum, and you want to
achieve the right levels of consistency.
How is that done? By using the right tools the right way. If you’re dodging or
burning an image, use brush sizes that allow gentle effects. Using very small
brushes over a large area is bound to show the strokes or clicks. Using the
tools too much causes some areas to be much lighter or darker than others,
probably giving you unnatural results that look like you went overboard.
Of course, using the tools that apply to the entire image also gives you consis-
tency. Any Auto command makes universal adjustments based on what’s in
the image to start with, and your results will be pretty tame and consistent.
Using tools that allow you to drag sliders or enter new levels and have the set-
tings affect a selected area only or the entire image if nothing is selected also
creates consistency because your mouse skills and brush-based tool settings
are not part of the equation. This gives you less control over the degree of
lightening or darkening but can provide gentler, subtler results.

Reviving lost detail
Perhaps your photo has too much contrast, and the details of the items caught
in the brightest spots are unrecognizable. Or maybe your photo has faded 
with time, and fine details are lost. Are the details lost forever? Probably not,
assuming that you have time, patience, and the right tools to bring them back
to life.
Choosing the revival method
The method used to bring back lost details varies by the situation and the
situation’s cause. For example, if the details were lost to too much bright-
ness, using the Burn tool darkens the light areas and brings out the missing
features, textures, or whatever has been blighted by the light. If the details
are hidden in shadow, the Dodge tool can reveal these details once again.
Adjusting contrast and brightness levels can revive details lost to too much
or too little of those levels, and you can even use color to bring things out.
How do you choose? The best strategy is to figure out what went wrong and
reverse it, using a tool that applies the opposite attribute.
Re-creating lost detail
If you’re skilled and patient and have good eyesight, you might be able to
zoom in extremely close to your image and use painting and drawing tools 
to re-create details that are irretrievably lost. You have to be very careful,
though, and avoid it in faces and natural things (such as flowers and plants)
because pulling it off is nearly impossible. Things usually look drawn and
end up drawing attention to the problem. You can, however, re-create tex-
tures (such as a brick wall or a stubbly patch of cement) and industrial or
man-made items (such as the edge of a car bumper or the handle on an
umbrella). The results can be surprisingly good, even for someone who
might be a bit shaky with the mouse. You can use your image editor’s Paint
Brush and Pencil or similar tools to draw missing items.
Does what’s missing appear elsewhere? If so, steal a copy and replace the
missing detail. I’ve successfully replaced lost content with faces, furniture,
grass, trees, walls, cars, and sleeping dogs. You can, too, by using the tools
that I discuss in the section, “Removing Unwanted Image Content,” later in
this chapter.
Not to be negative (pardon the photographic pun), but sometimes lost detail
is simply lost. If an overzealous flash completely washed out someone’s face,
short of drawing in his or her features by hand, you might not be able to
bring back eyelids, a nose, cheekbones, the contour of lips, and so on. Not
every photo can end up framed and admired or viewed by adoring millions

online. If you’ve used every brightness, lighting, and contrast tool that your
software has to offer, you can try a different or more powerful package, or
you can do your best and hope nobody notices that Aunt Mary doesn’t have
a nose.
Using Blurring and Sharpening Tools
Another way to revive lost details is to apply a filter that sharpens the image by
heightening the difference between adjacent pixels. This increased intensity
of color and brightness makes everything stand out, as shown in Figure 1-11,
where the top portion of the image has been sharpened, and the rest was left
as it was. You can use the Sharpen filters that come with all image editing
applications or use the Sharpen tool found in the toolbox of just about any
image editing program. Using the filter requires selecting the area to be sharp-
ened and then applying the filter, whereas the tool requires the standard
brush-related adjustments (such as the size of the brush and the degree of
sharpening it applies). You can find more information on the Blur and Sharpen
tools in Book V, Chapter 2.
Figure 1-11: Sharpening enhances the contrast between adjacent pixels.

Sharpening here and there
If you want to sharpen the entire image, use a filter to do the sharpening. If
your software doesn’t have filters, check for a Sharpen command or reason-
able facsimile thereof — any command that performs an automatic, all-over
sharpening will do. The other benefit of this process is that it’s a simple one
in most image editors. Corel PhotoPaint, Paint Shop Pro, and Adobe’s image
editors, for example, all have a simple Sharpen command that you can apply
directly, along with more sophisticated versions if you need more control.
If you want to sharpen an area, you can also use the filter or automatic
sharpening command, but you have to make a selection first, directing the
software to the spot you want to sharpen. You can repeat the process to
sharpen two or more noncontiguous areas. Or if your software supports
selections that are not touching, select all the areas that are to be sharpened
and then apply the filter or related command.
When I need to sharpen a little here, a little there, a bit more here, and a
whole lot there, I use the Sharpen tool that some image editors provide for
“painting” sharpness. It works like a painting tool in that you click and/or
drag your mouse over the image to apply the sharpening effect, and you
can repeat your mouse movements in the same spot if you want more of a
sharpening effect in one place than in another. You can dictate the size of
the sharpened area by adjusting your brush size, and you can control the
intensity of the sharpening by adjusting the strength setting.
To use a Sharpen tool, follow these steps:
1. Turn on the Sharpen tool by selecting it from your image editor’s tool-
box or menu.
2. Set your brush size so that you can control how big an area is sharp-
ened with each click or drag of the mouse.
3. Set the strength for your sharpening effect.
A good default value is 50%, but you can raise or lower that level as
needed by dragging the slider or other control.
4. Begin sharpening by clicking or dragging over the area to be 
sharpened.
Clicking sharpens an area the size of your brush tip, and dragging allows
you to sharpen in a freeform area, following an edge or working within a
desired region of the image.

Using Blurring and Sharpening Tools
430
Be careful not to sharpen too much. Too much sharpening results in bizarre-
looking bright pixels that end up hiding details because the individual pixels
stand out too much. Figure 1-12 shows an image in which the sharpening
went a little overboard. Sharpening can also increase your file size.
Figure 1-12: Too much sharpening is not a good thing!
To keep the sharpening results as subtle as possible, avoid using a very
small brush size (10 pixels or fewer) if you’re sharpening an area that’s more
than 20 pixels wide and/or tall. Why? Because you’ll be able to see your brush
strokes as you apply the sharpening. An exception would be the sharpening
of a very small spot, which would obviously call for a very small brush, and
you can select the area first, which helps control your effects by restricting
them to the selected area.
Blurring for effect
Sometimes the best way to draw attention to something is to draw attention
away from something else. The bride doesn’t have to wear the biggest, most
ostentatious dress to stand out against her bridesmaids; she can instead
dress them in colors that blend in with the flowers — and by contrast, she
stands out. The same is true for photos, especially those with a lot of con-
tent that you need to keep but want to keep people from noticing too much.

Figure 1-13 shows a photo of a dandelion against a leafy background. The
outdoorsy setting is important to give the image context, but the dandelion
is the real focus. To make it stand out, the background has been blurred, and
its details are diminished. Other than being able to tell that the background
consists of foliage, there isn’t much about it that you would notice or be
drawn to visually.
Figure 1-13: Blurring everything else makes your main subject 
stand out.
Blurring is the exact opposite of sharpening in that instead of heightening
the contrast between adjoining pixels, the color and brightness differences
are reduced so that pixels are much closer to each other in terms of their
color levels, brightness, and contrast. You can go too far with blurring and
end up with something that isn’t even recognizable; conversely, you can blur
not enough, leaving the content as distracting as ever. The key is to find a
happy medium where objects are still recognizable, but nobody will spend
much time looking at them.
Like sharpening, you have choices as to how to apply blurring. You can use
your image editor’s Blur tool (which works just like the Sharpen tool, except
for its results), or you can use the Blur filters. Many image editors offer spe-
cialized Blur filters that do cool things, such as making an image look like 
it’s whipping past the camera (the Motion Blur) or like it’s spinning in place

Using Blurring and Sharpening Tools
432
(Radial Blur). The plain old Blur filter simply blurs the entire image or a
selection therein — it’s as simple as that. In Figure 1-14, Motion Blur has
been applied to the entire image.
Figure 1-14: Motion Blur adds the appearance of movement to an image.
To apply a blur to everything but the focus of the image, follow these steps:
1. Select the object or area that should not be blurred.
This can be done on an image that’s all on one layer. Or, if your software
supports layers, you can select the object or area and then cut it to its
own layer to keep it separate from the rest of the image during the blur-
ring process.
2. If you’re working all on one layer, invert the selection so that every-
thing but the selection can be blurred.
Most image editors, including Corel PhotoPaint, Paint Shop Pro, and 
the Adobe Photoshop products, let you invert a selection by pressing
Ctrl+Shift+I (or Ô+Shift+I if you’re using a Mac).
With the not-to-be-blurred section protected, you can begin blurring the
rest of the picture.
3. Click your image editor’s Blur tool to activate it and then set the way
the tool should work by choosing the brush size and strength, just as
described for the Sharpen tool.

433
4. Begin dragging the mouse in the area to be blurred. You can go over
some areas more than once, increasing the blurring effect in those spots.
Unlike many other types of retouching, blurring is very subtle and is
hard to overdo.
5. When you’ve finished blurring the area, turn off the selection and
view your results.
If you chose to use the Blur filter, after making the selection and inverting it
so that everything but the selected area can be blurred, you can choose your
image editor’s Blur filter. The blurring effect is uniform throughout the selec-
tion, and you can intensify it only by repeating the command.
Unlike the regular Blur command, the special blur filters found in most image
editors have dialog boxes that allow you to set how much blurring will occur
and exactly what special effect will be achieved.
When blurring your photos, keep the following points in mind:
✦Try combining Blur effects. For example, blur by hand and then apply
one of the special Blur filters, or combine more than one special blur
filter for a completely unique effect. If your software doesn’t offer special
blurs, you might consider one that does, such as Photoshop Elements,
which I used for all the figures in this chapter.
✦If your editing software supports layers, you can do a very cool thing
with the Motion blur (or with a manually created motion effect, created
by horizontal or vertical strokes with the Blur tool). Duplicate the object
that should be in motion and put it on its own layer. Then blur that
duplicate, and place it behind the static version on the original layer.
Voilà! Your object is sitting still after rocketing into position via the
Motion blur.
✦If you’re a Photoshop or Photoshop Elements user, don’t confuse the
Smudge and Blur tools. The Smudge tool literally smears adjoining pixels,
as though you’ve run a greasy paw across a chalk drawing. You can use
the Smudge tool to blend two contiguous areas of color or texture, but
the effect is much more dramatic than blurring.
Removing Artifacts (Tiny Blemishes)
Damage comes in all shapes and sizes — little specks of dust; scratches thin
and wide, short and long; water marks or discoloration from tape; missing
corners. In this section, I explain how to remove artifacts from your photos.
No, I’m not talking about ancient clay pots unearthed by archaeologists.
Artifacts are the little stray marks, blips, and other tiny blemishes that
appear on images when they’re captured and manipulated electronically —
the kinds of blemishes you can see in Figure 1-15. 

Removing Artifacts (Tiny Blemishes)
434
The term artifact is also sometimes applied to the dust and scratches that
accumulate on printed photos and that end up in the digital version of the
photo after it’s scanned. Unlike an ancient clay pot that you’d probably want
to keep, artifacts in your images are usually not desirable, and you’ll want to
get rid of them. Although few photos are as damaged as the example shown
in Figure 1-15, most scanned images will have at least a few dings.
Figure 1-15: Dust and scratches inevitably show up on scanned photos.
Finding an artifact’s source
When dealing with artifacts, it’s useful to note how they got there. If the arti-
facts appeared after you resized an image or a portion thereof (stretching it
with your mouse to increase its width, height, or both), the solution might
be to undo the resizing and then save the file in a format that’s more sup-
portive of the resizing process. If the artifacts were there from the time the
image was scanned, you can try brushing off the original to make sure none
of the spots are from dust that can be removed (as opposed to the nastiest

Book V
Chapter 1

435
kind of dust, which becomes embedded in the photograph itself) and then
rescanning it. In lieu of that, remove the marks with your software’s various
painting and cleaning tools.
So what file formats support the resizing process? JPG is a good choice as a
final destination because it supports more colors than GIF (assuming that
your image is bound for the Web or that you’re trying to keep the file size
small to facilitate sharing online). TIFF is another good choice if your image
file size doesn’t matter and you plan to print the image rather than display it
on the Web.
Sweeping away dust
Dusting off your originals before scanning them is an obvious preventative
measure, but it rarely removes the ground-in dust or the scratches and
scuffs that appear over time, even on relatively new photos. If you store your
pictures in a box or desk drawer and they rub up against each other, damage
is bound to occur. For very old photos, the porous papers used back then
absorb moisture and dirt, so stains and dust attack them much more easily
than newer, coated photographic papers. Obviously, storing your images in a
safe, protective environment (remember to use only acid-free paper!) is best,
but if you haven’t done that, all might not be lost.
You have several choices for removing dust and scratches, and in most
cases, personal preference, skill, and the degree of damage will dictate which
tool you choose. For example, you can use any of the following tools found in
editors such as Photoshop, Photoshop Elements, and others to get rid of
small spots, scratches, and other tiny blemishes:
✦The Brush tool: The Brush tool can be used to paint out the spots.
✦The Pencil tool: For tiny, tiny spots, you may like the precision of the
Pencil tool, which works much the same as the Brush tool except that
the dots or lines drawn are sharp-edged.
✦The Smudge tool: The Smudge tool found in some image editors is a
favorite of mine if I just need to smear a little of the surrounding color
onto the spot, much as I’d do if I had a painting with an unwanted dot of
color on a field of another color. You can find more information on the
Smudge tool in Book IV, Chapter 2.
When you paint, pencil, or smudge out a dot or small scratch, you can’t dupli-
cate any pattern that’s in place. For example, if the spot is on a piece of fabric,
such as a coat or dress, the fabric’s texture will be lost on that tiny spot even
if the color is restored and the spot is no longer visible. For the kind of tiny
spots and marks I’m talking about here, this is rarely a problem. For larger

areas, however, the lack of texture stands out as clearly as the original mark
did, so use the Clone tool (found in both Photoshop and Photoshop Elements,
as well as other editing programs) to copy sections of the pristine textured
area onto the damaged area. I discuss using this type of tool in the section,
“Removing Unwanted Image Content,” later in this chapter.
Painting over the dirt
Because your image contains only little marks on a plain background that
you can easily remove with the Brush or Pencil, you decide that painting or
drawing out the spot is the answer. You’re ready to make the artifacts go
away. With the photo in question opened and on-screen in your favorite 
editing program, follow these steps:
1. Click the tool that you want to use.
• Brush: Use this tool if you’re painting out a small dot or a tiny scratch.
• Pencil: Choose this tool if you need a thin, precise line to get rid of
the artifact in question.
2. Set the size of the brush or pencil, choosing one that’s roughly the
same size as the dot or scratch that you want to eliminate.
If you’re dealing with a scratch, draw or paint a line that’s only a tiny bit
wider than the scratch itself.
3. Use the color-sampling tool — the Eyedropper — to sip up the color
from the surrounding unmarred pixels.
With Photoshop or Photoshop Elements, hold down the Alt/Option key
to convert the Pencil or Brush tools temporarily into an Eyedropper.
This sets the painting/drawing color so that it matches when you brush
or pencil the marks out. Figure 1-16 shows sampling in progress.
4. With the proper color selected, go back to the desired tool (the Brush
or Pencil) and paint or draw out the unwanted artifacts.
You can click to get rid of a small dot or drag to get rid of a scratch.
Smudging or blurring out the paint lines
If you painted out a mark but feel that your retouching is too visible, you can
use Undo (usually Ctrl+Z, or Ô+Z if you’re using a Mac) and start over, or
you can use the Blur or Smudge tools (set to an extremely tiny brush size) to
make the edges of the painted dot or line just a bit fuzzy. This action removes
any visible edge to the color that you apply to the image. Figure 1-17 shows a
painted-out scratch being repaired by blurring the edges of the scratch with
the Blur tool.

To address any concerns about dust and scratches that can’t be repaired, let
me say this: Every image editing application that I know of offers the ability
to select a color from within the image and then use that color for painting
or drawing so that you can brush or pencil out tiny blemishes. The tools
involved are simple to use, and this sort of repair is easily within the grasp 
of beginning users.

Spackling Over More Serious Damage

Spackling Over More Serious Damage
More extreme than scratches and scuffs, missing content is the kind of seri-
ous damage that might make you think a photo is unsalvageable. Not all
image editing packages are capable of fixing dramatic problems, but many
are. If your software has cloning, patching, or similar tools, you could be in
luck. However, if all you have are paint brushes and the ability to copy and
paste selections, you might not be so lucky. Figure 1-18 shows a seriously
damaged photo with a corner missing. Painting, drawing, and pasting are
clearly not going to work in a situation like this! But given the right tools, you
can restore the missing corner by filling it with the remaining image content
and thus creating a nearly seamless repair.
Figure 1-18: When you have an entire corner missing from 
your photo, serious repairs are needed.
Fixing more serious damage requires digital spackle, which works a lot like
the gloppy white spackle that you apply to your walls to fill in holes from
where pictures were hung or where someone gouged the plaster while

Editing Tools
Spackling Over More Serious Damage
439
moving furniture. Photos can also suffer from the same sort of dents and
dings, and you need to fill in the holes and gashes with something, right?
You can use content from within the image (or from another image), or you
can create new content from scratch.
Preparing your digital spackle
Unfortunately, image editors don’t come with a spackle tool, but you can
create your own spackle by using the various tools at your disposal. The
most common tool for this application is the Clone tool or Clone brush,
depending on your image editor. The spackle that you create depends on
what kind of damage you’re repairing. You can fill in small areas with solid
colors, applied with a Brush tool, or you can clone existing content from
nearby and place it over the damage. Your choices are virtually unlimited,
and the success that you see is based only on your mousing skills (for those
tight corners and tiny repairs), patience, and how much time you can devote
to the task.
Replacing content that’s ripped or torn away
Although you might not be able to put the corner back exactly as it was, you
can make it look as if there were never a missing corner. If that sounds like a
contradiction, consider that what was in the corner might be unknown. What
if the corner were missing before you even got the photo? If you don’t know
what used to be in that corner, you can’t put it back. What you can do, how-
ever, is create a new corner from existing content and make it look like it has
always been there. To get started, follow these steps:
1. Think about what you could use to replace what’s missing.
If you know what’s missing, this isn’t difficult, but if the missing or dam-
aged portion doesn’t tell you anything about its original state, you might
have to decide what remaining content can be used to rebuild the corner.
2. Click the Clone tool.
3. Choose a brush size and set the Opacity to 100%.
4. Zoom in to the area you want to work with.
5. Choose the source area for cloning, as shown in Figure 1-19.
Some image editors require right-clicking to select a source area. Others
ask you to hold down the Alt key (if you’re a Windows user) or the Option
key (if you’re on a Mac) as you click the area that you want to clone.
6. Click and/or drag over the damage, watching as the sampled content
covers it.
Figure 1-20 shows cloned content filling in the missing corner.

If you want to be able to apply the same exact cloned spot to the entire dam-
aged area, be sure to select the Aligned option on the Options bar (or the
Cumulative option with some image editors) before you start painting the
cloned content onto the damage. With Aligned marked, the tool clones from
a position relative to where you first started cloning. When unmarked, the
Clone tool always starts cloning from the same point.
Your filling needn’t come from the same image! You can use the Clone tool to
sample content from another image and then apply it to the damaged photo.
Just open up the new image, sample the content (press the Alt or Option key
as you click the content to be cloned), and then switch back to the damaged
photo. With the Clone tool still selected, click and/or drag to place the cloned
content in the image.
Removing Unwanted Image Content
Signs of wear and other types of physical damage aren’t the only things you
might want to get rid of when editing your images. A person, car, garbage
can, building, plant, tree, or just about anything can become objectionable if
you didn’t want it to be in the picture in the first place. Rather than tearing
all your wedding photos in half, consider replacing the unwanted spouse
with more of the background or a large potted plant. Someone forget to move
the car before taking a picture of your house for the real estate brochures?
Get rid of the car, replacing it with curb and grass as though the car had
been in the garage all along.
It might seem like some sort of complicated sleight of hand, but replacing
one piece of content with another is really rather simple. If you’ve already
tried repairing scratches, stains, and tears, you’re more than ready to tackle
the process of removing unwanted people, places, and things. You need soft-
ware that has Clone and/or Patch tools (or reasonable facsimiles), and you
need to understand how the Clipboard works (so you can copy and paste
content in big chunks). Sound like too big a job? Never fear — it becomes
clear in the next few paragraphs!
For example, no matter how much we love them, we sometimes wish family
members would make themselves scarce, if only for a little while. But what
if your ex–family member — someone you thought you’d never have to see
again — is still haunting your family photos? Starting with a group photo,
follow these steps:
1. Identify the unwanted person and use a selection tool — preferably a
freeform or magnetic selection tool — to select him or her.
Book V, Chapter 2 has descriptions of the generic selection tools found
in most image editors.

Removing Unwanted Image Content
442
You don’t have to worry about getting a little of the surrounding image
as long as it doesn’t remove someone else’s arm or the side of a face.
2. Press Delete to get rid of the selected person.
The background layer or any other underlying layer’s content now
shows through the hole.
3. Fill the hole with other content — more of the photo’s background
content if you were all standing in front of one of those lovely painted
backdrops, or use the sky or extend a nearby wall or stand of trees.
Whatever’s behind the rest of the group can be extended to fill in where
the now-missing person once stood. Your choices for filling in are as 
follows:
• Copy content from elsewhere and paste it onto the hole.
• Use the Clone tool to fill in the hole with sampled content from else-
where in the image.
Which method you choose depends on three things:
• How big a hole the deleted person left behind
• Whether you have a lot of alternate content to use as fill
• Whether there are lighting issues
Perhaps everything but the deleted person is in shadow, and you can’t 
seamlessly apply that dark content in his or her place. If lighting is the 
problem — and you have Photoshop — you’ll want to use the Patch tool
(a kind of super-Clone tool that adjusts for texture and lighting) so that the
lighting of the destination is preserved when you patch the hole. If the hole
is huge or there’s no background to use, you might need to copy content and
paste it into the hole, perhaps even going to another image to get the filler.
Figure 1-21 shows a Before and an After of the same image. In the after ver-
sion, the unwanted element (in this case, a goose in the background) has
been replaced by more of the surrounding pond.
What if the unwanted person isn’t against a background or is sitting in front
of someone else and deleting him or her will leave you with half of a person?
Consider bringing someone in from another picture and putting him or her
in place of the person you’re deleting. You can always resize a new person
from a smaller or larger image, and you can use your image editor’s Burn or
Dodge tools to adjust lighting if the substitute person comes from a darker
or lighter image. Use the Blur or Smudge tools to make the stand-in blend in
so that none of the edges are obvious.

Throughout this chapter, most of what I discuss is repairing and improving
individual photos by fixing spots, scratches, and tears, replacing missing
content, and moving stuff around to make things better. This isn’t the end of
even a low-end image editing application’s capabilities, however. You can do
a lot with multiple images, combining them into a single image and using spe-
cial effects for a really creative result.
When combining images, there really aren’t any rules. You can combine
black-and-white photos with color images, professional portraits or photo-
graphic artwork with amateur or family photos, pictures of people with pic-
tures of places — anything that makes sense to you. You can create a collage,
assembling parts of various photos into a composite image like the one
shown in Figure 1-22, or you can mix content from two or more photos and
retouch the combined result to make it look like the combined content had
been together from the start.

Combining Pictures
444
Figure 1-22: You can combine several photos into one.
Is there anything along these lines that image editing software can’t do?
With the midrange to top-level packages, the limitations are fairly . . . limited.
You might run into limitations in terms of special effects and retouching
capabilities, which can hamper the success of the creative side of your com-
binations, but those are software-specific limitations, such as not being able
to adjust the opacity (see-through quality) of content within a photo, or not
being able to place different parts of a composite image on separate layers.
Pasting content from other images
Whether you’re using a Windows-based PC or a Mac, you have the ability to
cut, copy, and paste content from one file to another or to share and duplicate
content within the same file. These capabilities make it easy to take content
from one photo and add it to another, either by removing content from its
original location or by making a copy that appears in both photos.
To copy content from one photo and paste it into another, follow these
steps, which work in virtually any image editing package:

Book V
Chapter 1
What You Can and
Can’t Do with Image
Editing Tools
Combining Pictures
445
1. Open both the source image (the one where the content you want cur-
rently resides) and the target image (the one that will receive the
copied content).
2. In the source image, use a selection tool to select the content that you
want to copy.
You can use either a freeform or geometric-shaped selection tool. Your
choice depends on the shape of the object that you want to copy.
3. Choose Edit➪Copy.
This places a duplicate of the selection in your computer’s memory,
where it will wait for you to paste it.
4. Go to the target image and choose Edit➪Paste.
In Figure 1-23, a moon that was cut
from an image is now pasted into a
different photo.
5. When the pasted content appears
in the target image, activate the
Move tool and then drag the con-
tent into the desired position
within the photo.
Note that if you’re using software that
allows you to put different parts of an
image on separate layers, the pasted
content is probably on its own layer —
a layer created automatically through
the pasting process. You can leave the
content on this separate layer or use
your software’s layer-handling com-
mands to merge the paste layer with
the rest of the photo (sometimes called
flattening). Of course, you’d do this
only after your pasted content was
placed in the desired spot and you’re
sure you don’t want to move it again.
You can activate the Copy and Paste
commands with your keyboard as well
as through the Edit menu. To copy, press Ctrl+C, and to paste, press Ctrl+V. If
you’re on a Mac, the shortcuts are Ô+C and Ô+V, respectively.
Figure 1-23: This moon has been copied
from one photo and pasted here.

446
Using layers to create overlapping images
Assuming that your software supports layers, your pasted content will be on
separate layers — one new layer per paste. This is good in that it makes it
easy to move things around, repositioning pasted stuff so that it’s in just the
right spot. Separate layers also enable you to hide pasted content if you’re
not sure you really want to use it. Rather than deleting the pasted content
(which you might regret if you change your mind), you can simply hide the
layer that it’s on, and then you won’t see it until and unless you choose to
display that layer again.
Keeping things on separate layers has another benefit. By having different
elements of your image on individual layers, you can overlap the layers
and rearrange the layers to restack the overlapping content. As shown in
Figure 1-24, the same image was copied, overlapped, and stacked in several
layers. Images can be restacked in as many configurations as you can imag-
ine but only because each individual part has its own layer.
Figure 1-24: You can stack layers to overlap content.

Book V
Chapter 1
What You Can and

447
Hiding layers
After something is pasted into your image, the pasted content is on its own
layer. If you no longer want to see that layer’s content, just hide the layer
by clicking the icon next to the layer number. The icon varies from image
editor to image editor. In Paint Shop Pro, the icon is a pair of spectacles; in
Photoshop Elements, it’s an eyeball.
In any case, after the layer is hidden, its content doesn’t display on-screen,
nor will it print. If you want to bring it back, simply click the box where the
icon was, and the icon reappears, as does the layer’s content.
Rearranging layers to change object stacking order
If you want to change the stacking order of two or more overlapping ele-
ments in a photo, simply drag the layers up or down in the Layers palette.
The top-most layers represent the content that’s on the top of any overlap-
ping stack, and the lower layers are underneath. Dragging a layer up moves it
up in the stack, and dragging a layer down puts it beneath the other layers.
Deleting layers
If you just plain don’t want a layer anymore and hiding it isn’t the answer,
delete the layer. To do this, just drag the unwanted layer to the trash can icon,
located at the bottom of the palette in some image editors (Photoshop) or at
the top in others (Photoshop Elements and Paint Shop Pro, for example).
Adjusting opacity for interesting effects
When layers overlap, you can achieve very cool results by making one or
more of the layers less opaque (more see-through) so that underlying layers
can be seen. Reducing the opacity of the elements on top of a background
makes it possible to see that background image and recognize its content.
Or, you can use transparency to de-emphasize some parts of an image and
emphasize others. The elements on top of the background remain visible,
but their slightly see-through nature integrates them more fully with the
image as a whole. Figure 1-25 shows a picture used in an eBay auction: Only
the widget in the center is for sale. The semi-transparent objects at the left
and right are shown to illustrate how the widget works.
For applications that support layers, the opacity controls are found in the
Layers palette, and you adjust the opacity of an entire layer, not just portions
thereof, although some editing applications allow you to select content on a
single layer and reduce or increase its opacity independently. Using the popu-
lar Photoshop Elements program as an example, follow these steps to adjust a
layer’s opacity, making the objects on underlying layers more visible:

Combining Pictures
448
Figure 1-25: You can make some layers semi-transparent.
1. Open the image containing the layer that you want to adjust.
2. Access your image editor’s Layers palette or dialog box.
3. Within the Layers palette, click the layer you want to make more or
less opaque.
4. Choose your image editor’s layer opacity control and use the slider to
adjust the opacity level.
Opacity is set at 100% (not see-through at all) by default.
As you adjust the opacity, the results appear immediately within your
image. You can undo your result if you don’t like it, or simply go back to
the Layers palette and readjust.
An opacity of 0% renders the active layer completely invisible, and you
can use this to your advantage, making a layer disappear and then slowly
increasing its opacity until you achieve the very level of visibility you want.
You can also back down from 100%, but starting at 0% can make it much
easier to find the right setting for a layer that you want to be very, very faint.

T
he main editing tools found in virtually all image editing applications fall
into four categories: painting, selecting, blending, and correction. There
are no hard and fast rules, however, as to when to use these tools, and
you’ll find yourself using painting tools to make corrections,
blending tools to create original painted effects, and any
other variety of mixing and matching of tools and tasks
that your editing jobs require.
This chapter provides an overview of the editing
tools common to most image editing programs. I
use Adobe Photoshop Elements and Corel Paint
Shop Pro as the primary examples, but most of
these tools are available in other image editors,
such as Microsoft Digital Imaging Suite, Adobe
Photoshop, Corel PhotoPaint, and others. Whatever
application you’re using now or will use in the
future, the basic concepts are the same for these four
tool categories and the tasks you perform with them. So
don’t worry about not being able to apply instructions or
examples from one application to another!

Checking Out Your Editing Toolkit
450
This chapter is intended to be an introduction to the tools that
you’ll find in virtually all image editors. I show you how to use
some of these functions in more detail using Photoshop and
Photoshop Elements in Book VI.
Checking Out Your Editing Toolkit
As shown in Figures 2-1 and 2-2, your tools in both Photoshop
Elements and Paint Shop Pro are very similar. You might even
notice that some of the tools’ buttons are nearly identical.
These similarities exist for a very simple and logical reason:
The things people need to do to photographs — reversing the
signs of aging, wear and tear, and photographic errors or apply-
ing aesthetic preferences — are universal. Nobody has thought
of something that the other guy hasn’t added to his software.
Other than some of the very low-end packages with extremely
limited toolsets, a full set of tools for performing these tasks is
found in pretty much the same arrangement, and the tools are
used in pretty much the same way. So, the information you pick
up in this chapter can be applied across the board. You can find
a summary and comparison of the features in a broad selection
of image editors in Book V, Chapter 3.
In both Elements and Paint Shop Pro, you can choose
where toolbars are displayed. They can be docked along
an edge of the main window or pulled loose as free-floating
strips of tools, as in Figure 2-1. Paint Shop Pro lets you
resize the floating toolbar into a rectangle with several
columns, as you can see in Figure 2-2.
If you don’t see your application’s tool kit, you can usu-
ally redisplay it by choosing it from the Window or View
menu. The preferences settings that control features of
the image editor are normally found in the Edit menu,
as shown in Figure 2-3, which shows the Photoshop
Elements Edit menu and Preferences submenu. As you
can see from this list, you can control just about every aspect of the image
editor’s functions as well as some general settings for the application as a
whole.
As you take the time to visually check out your tools, you can identify them
quickly by placing your cursor over a tool to display a ToolTip, which shows
the names and sometimes the purpose of the individual tools. As you mouse
over a tool, its name appears in a small box.

help, which means that if you’re using a particular tool or have a particular
dialog box open and press the F1 key, information pertaining to that tool or
dialog box appears when the Help window opens. The Mac OS also offers a
Help menu, and the same Help articles appear when you search by topic.
Painting Tools
Spotting the painting and drawing tools in any image editing package isn’t
difficult. They look like paint brushes and pencils, and there are often air-
brush and spray-can alternatives as well. When you use a painting tool, you
can customize several options in just about any application. Although some
applications definitely offer more options than others, any program worth
its salt lets you set the following paint brush options:
✦Brush size and type
✦The shape of the brush bristles
✦The strength of the flow of paint coming out of the brush
✦The opacity of the paint applied by the brush

Pencil tools offer many of the same options that you can find for a Paint
Brush tool — size, shape, intensity, and color. The color setting is usually
established in a color selector tool unrelated to the Paint Brush or Pencil,
but the foreground color chosen is the color that the painting or drawing
tool applies. I talk about setting your painting color later in this chapter.
Customizing your Brush and Pencil tools
To customize your Brush or Pencil tool, you can use the options presented
when the tool is activated. As shown in Figures 2-6 and 2-7, the options for
painting and drawing are quite similar in Photoshop Elements and Paint
Shop Pro.
Figure 2-6: Photoshop Elements’ painting options.
Figure 2-7: Paint Shop Pro’s painting options.

454
To apply customizations to a tool, click the tool to activate it and then use 
the available drop-down lists, radio buttons, check boxes, sliders, and menus.
Sometimes, the options appear on a toolbar; other times, they appear in a
palette. It all depends on the software you’re using. 
You can often save your settings for a particular tool as a group of presets. You
can set up collections of options for each tool and have more than one setting
for a tool, which enables you to have different paint brushes for different
tasks.
Choosing a paint color
Most applications offer a single color-selection tool that applies to any of the
tools that apply color to the image. For example, in Paint Shop Pro, the color-
selection tools are in a palette labeled Materials (shown in Figure 2-8), which
has Frame, Rainbow, and Swatch modes you can use to choose a color with an
eyedropper. Whatever color you choose for the foreground color applies to
the Paint Brush, Pencil, and other painting or filling tools. Photoshop Elements
uses palettes like the one shown in Figure 2-9.
Figure 2-8: Paint Shop Pro has its own color chooser palettes.
Selecting foreground and background colors
If you’re using Paint Shop Pro, clicking the Foreground Color or Background
Color panels at the right side of the Materials palette opens a Material
Properties dialog box’s Color tab (as shown in Figure 2-10), which offers 
several ways of choosing a color:

✦Click in the color wheel to select a range of colors and then zero in on
the precise hue you want in the box in the center of the wheel.
✦Choose a color from the swatches underneath the color wheel.
✦Enter an exact color using RGB (red, green, blue) or HSL (hue, saturation,
lightness) values (if you happen to know them).
✦Type Web color values in the HTML box at lower center. If you’re heav-
ily involved in Web page development, you might be familiar with these
esoteric-looking numbers. They are actually a set of three hexadecimal
values (a base-16 numbering system your computer understands, even 
if you don’t) strung together, representing the amounts of red, green,
and blue in a color. For example, in Figure 2-10, the value 74c680 actually
represents Red 74 (116 decimal), Green C6 (198 decimal), and Blue 80
(128 decimal).
Clicking in the Foreground or Background patches at the bottom of the
Photoshop Elements Tool palette (at left in Figure 2-9) produces a Color
Picker dialog box with options similar to those in the Paint Shop Pro
Materials palette. However, in this case, the “color wheel” is a strip located
to the right of the sample color box. 
There are also a set of HSB (equivalent to HSL; the B stands for brightness),
RGB, and HTML entry boxes to the right of the color strip. Elements’ Color
Swatches palette is separate and shown at the right in Figure 2-9.
Figure 2-9: Choose colors from the Color Picker dialog box or the Color Swatches palette in
Photoshop Elements.

Figure 2-10: Paint Shop Pro puts the key color selection tools 
in this chooser palette.
After your color is set, you can use any painting, drawing, or filling tool avail-
able to you, and then that color is applied to the image.
Sampling colors from the image
If a color already appears in your image (or anywhere on the workspace or
your Windows or Mac desktop), you can sample it, which means sipping 
up the color with a sampling tool, such as the Eyedropper tool or variation
found in all image editors. When you sip up a sample of the color, the color
information is stored, and the color that you sampled becomes the new fore-
ground color. Figure 2-11 shows sampling in progress.
Sampling colors makes it easy to find compatible colors and to keep your
colors consistent throughout a single image or in related images that need

the look of a running theme. If, for example, you retouch a photo by adding
brighter colors to clothes, cars, flowers, and other objects, you can sample
those colors afterward, which will allow you to use those same shades in
other places.
Figure 2-11: You can sample existing colors to duplicate any 
particular hue.
To sample a color, click the sampling tool, and your cursor changes to an
eyedropper. Then click the image at the spot where the desired color is cur-
rently in use. The color you clicked then becomes the foreground color.
Remember that you can also click title bars, buttons, backgrounds, or images
on your desktop — anything that’s visible while the sampling tool is active can
be sampled and turned into a paintable color in your editing software.
Applying the paint
After you customize your painting tool by choosing the size, style, opacity,
strength, and color for the brush, pencil, or other painting device, you’re ready
to get painting! The technique for painting doesn’t vary much from application
to application. With your mouse or other pointing device in hand, you’re ready
to go. Just click and drag and watch the paint flow onto the image.

Painting and drawing freeform lines
When you’re painting by hand and applying freeform lines, there are no real
rules. You can set the line to just about any width, shape, style, and color
you desire, which you see as you paint. If you set the line to a particular
level of opacity, you see that, too. The only control that’s not easily estab-
lished is your mouse ability. If your hand is shaky, you’re working too
quickly, or you’re not paying attention, you might not like your results.
Take your time, go slowly, and don’t do the entire job in one stroke. Why? If
you make a mistake at the very end, using Undo from the Edit menu will undo
the entire job. Instead, paint in shorter strokes. You can see from the Undo
History palette found in Paint Shop Pro, Adobe Photoshop and Photoshop
Elements, as well as other image editors (see Figure 2-12) that the Brush tool
has been used several times in succession to form the apparently continuous
line in the image. Every time you release the mouse button, you create an indi-
vidual stroke, even if the pause doesn’t show on the line itself.

equivalent (right.)
Filling a shape with the Brush tool
Remember coloring books? You scrubbed away with your crayons, filling 
in shapes, trying to stay within the lines. Or, if you were like me, you went
outside the lines and created new shapes altogether! In any case, you can
use your editing software’s painting tools to fill in shapes and areas simply
by applying paint the same way you’d apply crayon to a shape on a coloring
book page. Figure 2-13 shows a shape being filled in with the Brush tool, set
to a large size and a soft style so that no obvious scribbles are visible.
If you want a nice, uniform fill for a shape or an area, consider using the Fill
tool that comes with your software. The Fill tool applies a solid color with no

visible brush strokes. On the other hand, if you want a brushed look or want
to vary the intensity by painting over certain spots more than others, you
can use the Brush tool. Don’t use the Pencil tool, though, or the result will
look too sketchy.
Figure 2-13: You can fill a shape with color as easily as with a coloring book.
Painting and drawing straight lines
With all image editing packages, holding down a key (the Shift key in
Photoshop Elements and Paint Shop Pro) while you use the Brush and the
Pencil tools constrains the drawing to a single direction. This trick is helpful
when you need to draw straight lines.
To use this feature, follow these steps:
1. Click the painting or drawing tool you’d like to use (Brush or Pencil)
to activate it.
2. Click the image at the spot where the straight line should start.
3. Press and hold the Shift key.
4. Click where the line should end.

Painting Tools
460
A straight line connecting the beginning and ending points will be
painted/drawn automatically, with the visual characteristics of the
Brush or Pencil settings you established. Figure 2-14 shows a box that
was painted with a textured Brush tool.
Figure 2-14: This border was painted with a textured brush.
Because the Pencil tool provides a sharp-edged, crisp line, it’s a good tool to
use if you need to create a very clean line or lines. It’s also great if you need
to draw very fine lines that measure as small as one pixel.
Using specialty painting tools
Specialty painting tools refer to any painting or drawing tools that aren’t your
basic Brush or Pencil. These tools often work like the basic ones, at least in
terms of how you apply them. Just drag and/or click your mouse and the
paint is applied. The look achieved is where these tools deviate from the
basic painting and drawing tools.
With some image editors, the specialty tools are actually variations on the
basic tools. For example, in the Adobe products, you can turn on the Airbrush
option when you’re setting up the Brush tool to give the lines and strokes an
airbrushed look. In Paint Shop Pro, the airbrush is a separate tool; it has its
own settings for size and intensity of the lines drawn, as shown in Figure 2-15.
When you paint with this tool, your results really look like paint that was
sprayed on.

Figure 2-15: Paint Shop Pro includes a separate Airbrush tool.
Paint Shop Pro also has a Picture Tube tool that, by default, applies color
as if you were squeezing thick paint out of a tube. Its results are shown in
Figure 2-16, where you can see the 3-D look of the lines drawn. Not all appli-
cations have a tool like this, but many do. In Photoshop or Photoshop
Elements, you could apply drop shadow and beveling options to the lines
after drawing them, ending up with a 3-D-looking result.
Figure 2-16: The Picture Tube lines look like you’ve squeezed 
thick paint out of a tube.

462
Another cool thing that the Picture Tube tool
does is allow you to paint predesigned shapes,
such as garden vegetables, blades of grass,
musical notes, flowers, and stars. Figure 2-17
shows an assortment of lines drawn with the
Picture Tube tool, and perhaps you can think
of some ways to use them in your photos.
For example, you could use the Garden Veggies
option to paint a bowl of produce on a tabletop
that was bare or had something unappealing on
it to begin with.
To choose one of these picture options with
Paint Shop Pro, follow these steps:
1. Click the Picture Tube tool to activate it.
2. From the Tool Options palette, click the arrow next to the large pic-
ture box.
An array of alternative pictures is displayed, as shown in Figure 2-18.
3. Click the picture that you want to apply.
Figure 2-18: Choose the image you want to apply in a brush-like way from the list.

4. Go back to your image and click and drag your mouse or other point-
ing device on the image to dispense the picture.
By setting the size of the brush, you can control the size of the pictures you
apply with the Picture Tube tool. If you want tiny veggies or very short grass,
you can use a small brush size to apply them.
If you’re a Photoshop or Elements user and feeling dejected because this
cool tool isn’t available in your application, take heart. You can apply leaves
and grass with the Natural Brushes brush set, and you can download third-
party brush sets off the Internet. You can also search the Internet at www.
google.com for tons of brush sets that you can download for a reasonable
price. Just enter Photoshop Brushes in the search box.
Selection Tools
For many edits, you need to focus the software’s attention on a particular
part of the image, thus controlling where and how the edits take effect. For
example, if you want to increase or decrease the contrast in a certain area of
the image and nowhere else, you want to select that area before invoking the
contrast-adjustment tool so that you don’t end up changing the contrast in
an area that’s fine as-is.
All image editing programs provide selection tools. Some provide more than
others, and some provide more options for using them than others do. A
variety of selection tools and options is one of the marks of a flexible and
powerful application. All good image editors offer the following tools for
selecting content. The names of the following tools might change from appli-
cation to application, but the jobs these tools perform remain the same:
✦Marquee: This type of selection tool allows you to select geometric
shapes — rectangles, ovals, and in some cases, vertical rows or 
horizontal columns that are a single pixel wide.
✦Lasso: This freeform selection tool often comes in three varieties:
• A basic lasso
• A magnetic lasso that adheres to certain colored pixels
• A polygonal lasso that allows you to select areas with multiple
straight-lined sides
✦Magic Wand: This type of selection tool selects by color, based on a
starting pixel or group of pixels. Need to make everything that’s blue
turn green? The Magic Wand is the selector tool for you.

Selection Tools
464
✦Paintbrush or Mask Select: Some applications offer a paintbrush-like
tool that allows you to make a selection by painting. Others allow you to
enter a Mask mode, where your standard Brush tool acts as a selector to
create a mask of what you want to include in the selection, and when
you switch back to the normal mode, your mask has turned to a selec-
tion. Alternatively, you can specify that what you don’t paint turns into a
selection instead.
Making geometric selections
Geometric selections — rectangular and oval-shaped regions — are good if
you’re preparing to make an adjustment or to apply a fill to a large area and
don’t mind if the area doesn’t follow the shapes within your image. As shown
in Figure 2-19, you can select a square area and apply paint to it to create a
frame around the central images in a figure.
Figure 2-19: Paint around the edges of a selection to create a 
natural-looking frame.

Before shape tools were added to most image editing applications, using the
Marquee selection tools was the only way to map out an area and fill it with
color — creating solid-filled squares, rectangles, circles, and ovals. Most
applications come with shape-drawing tools now, enabling you to draw just
about any geometric shape or symbol (hearts, arrows, and so on) and then
fill it with color. This strips the Marquee tool of one of its original jobs, but it
remains an important weapon in your image editing arsenal.
Using the Marquee selection tools
To use the Marquee or geometric selection tools, simply click the tool and
drag from the upper or lower corner of the desired selected area and diago-
nally away from that starting point. The farther away you drag, the bigger
the selection becomes, as shown in Figure 2-20. Here, a rectangular area is
being selected, and the distance and angle from the starting point dictates
the selection’s size and proportions.
Figure 2-20: The size of the selection determines the shape 
of the frame.

Selection Tools
466
Selecting perfect squares and circles
If you want to select a square or circle instead of a rectangle or oval (often
called an ellipse), you can add keystrokes to the process. In most image 
editors, holding down the Shift key while you drag the Marquee or other 
geometric selection tool creates a perfect square — if you’re using the
Rectangular Marquee tool. If you’re using the Elliptical Marquee, holding
down the Shift key creates a perfect circle. Paint Shop Pro offers a set of
selection options, as shown in Figure 2-21, in which the Freehand Selection
tool is chosen. You can use the drop-down list within the Tool palette to
select square or circle rather than rectangle or ellipse. You can also select
rounded-corner rectangles in Photoshop, Elements, and Paint Shop Pro.
Figure 2-21: Paint Shop Pro includes a variety of selection tools.
Changing and resizing selections
If you’ve already selected a geometrically shaped area on your image and
realize you want a different area or a larger or smaller area, you can always
deselect and start over. If the area you’ve selected is fine but you want to
add to or take away from it, however, you needn’t restart from scratch. You
can simply augment or reduce your selection by using keyboard shortcuts
or tool options that are provided while the selection tool is active.
If you’re using Paint Shop Pro or any of the other higher-end applications,
you can use the Shift key to add to a selection or the Ctrl key (Ô on a Mac)
to reduce a selection. Make your selection first. Then hold down the Shift
key or Ctrl/Ô key and create an additional selection. The new selection will

Options

467
be added to or subtracted from the first selection you made. You see a plus
or minus sign, respectively, appear with your selection cursor.
With most image editors, you can choose from four alternative selection
modes on the Options bar. In Figures 2-22 through 2-25, I use the Magic Wand
tool, which selects contiguous pixels based on their color, to add or subtract
from the main selection. (I could have used one of the other selection tools
instead, however.)
Here are the most common selection options:
✦Selection: Figure 2-22 shows a rectangular selection made out of the
overlapping rectangle and circle. The dotted lines represent the limits of
the selection.
Figure 2-22: A standard selection created with the rectangular 
marquee.
✦Subtract from Selection: In Figure 2-23, I held down the Alt key (Option
key on the Mac) and used the Magic Wand to click in the circle area, sub-
tracting the circle from the selection and leaving a corner cut out of the
rectangular selection.
✦Add to Selection: In Figure 2-24, I went back to the original rectangular
selection and held down the Shift key while clicking in the circle with the
Magic Wand. This added the circle’s area to the selection.

✦Intersect with Selection: In Figure 2-25, I used the Intersect option,
which produces a selection that results where two selections overlap —
in this case, creating a quarter-circle.

Book V
Chapter 2

Options
Selection Tools
469
Figure 2-25: This selection results from the area in which separate 
circle and rectangle selections overlap, using the Intersect option.
Want to make a selection that looks like a frame? Use your application’s tool
for reducing a selection to select a rectangle or square within a larger rectan-
gle or square selection. The smaller selection cuts the center out of the first
selection, leaving a frame-like selection that you can fill with a solid color or
pattern. This can also be done with concentric circular or elliptical selections.
You can move your selection without moving the selected content within the
image if you point to the very edge of the selection (the dashed line) and
drag after drawing the selection. This allows you to reposition the selection
before you fill it with paint, delete its contents, or apply a filter or special
effect to the selected area.
Drawing freeform selections
The ability to draw the borders of a freeform selection is what really enables
you to do fine editing in a photo. Without the freeform selection tools in your
application, you can’t select a person’s face, a scratched area, a shadowy
area that needs to be lightened, or any other nongeometric region within an
image. Most applications offer alternatives for the Lasso or Freeform selector
tools — the ability to have the selection follow along like-colored pixels or to
draw a polygon (an irregular, straight-sided shape) with the selection tool.
With these alternatives, there isn’t anything too large, small, or oddly shaped
to be selected.

Selection Tools
470
Using the Lasso or Freehand selection tool
Using the Lasso (in Photoshop and Elements) or the Freehand selection tool
(in Paint Shop Pro) is really easy if you follow these steps:
1. Click to activate the tool.
2. Move your mouse onto the image and find the spot where you’d like
to begin your selection.
3. Click to begin the selection and then drag, drawing the shape selec-
tion you want.
4. Come back to the beginning of the selection. When you’ve met or
passed the starting point, release the mouse button to complete the
selection. If you release the mouse button anywhere else, the program
will draw a straight line from that point to the original starting point,
closing the selection.
Selecting polygonal areas
When you click the Lasso or Freehand selection tools, options become 
available. In Photoshop and Elements, the Options bar displays different
Lasso modes, as shown in Figure 2-26. Similar options are available for the
Freehand tool in Paint Shop Pro through the Tool Options palette.
Figure 2-26: The Lasso tool’s Options bar in Photoshop Elements.
With the Polygonal Lasso (Photoshop Elements) or the Point-to-Point
Freehand tool (Paint Shop Pro), you can make your selection by following
these steps:
1. Click to activate the selection tool.
2. Use the tool’s options to set it to Polygonal or Point-to-Point mode.
3. Click your starting point on the image.
4. Rather than dragging, move the mouse to the next point in your 
polygon — where you want to make a corner and start another side —
and click.
5. Continue clicking and moving, each time drawing a new side for your
selection, until you come back to your starting point.

6. When you’re back to the beginning of the selection, click the starting
point to close the shape.
If you can’t find the exact pixel where your selection began, just double-
click when you get close. The software closes the shape for you, forcing
the endpoint to meet the starting point that you couldn’t see or find
manually.
Your freeform selections needn’t be a single closed shape. You can draw
figure eights or any kind of freeform looped shape, using either the freehand
or polygonal modes. Go crazy!
Using magnetic selection tools
Magnetic selection tools create a selection that “clings” to the outline of an
object as you drag, according to pixel colors that define the object’s edge.
These tools are very handy because they enable you to follow the edge of an
object or objects, restricting your selection to very finite areas of the image.
Nearly every editing package has a tool like this. In Photoshop and Elements,
it’s the Magnetic Lasso; in Paint Shop Pro, you select the Smart Edge option
for the Freehand tool.
To use the magnetic selection tools, follow these steps:
1. Click the Lasso or Freehand tool (or other similarly named tool in
your application) to activate it.
2. From the tool’s options, choose Magnetic (Photoshop or Elements) or
Smart Edge (Paint Shop Pro).
3. Click the spot where you want to begin your selection.
4. Continue making the selection by dragging along the edge of the
object or area you want to select.
The tool adheres to the edges of that object or area, following the like-
colored pixels, as shown in Figure 2-27.
5. If you see an area coming up where the tool might fail because the
pixels aren’t diverse, click again to reroute the selection process, and
then continue dragging.
You can click as often as you like along the way, controlling the direction
that the selection takes.
The same process in Paint Shop Pro uses the Smart Edge tool, from
which a rectangle follows you as you drag. While you click to continue in
a new direction, the previously dragged selection adheres to the shape.

6. Come back to your starting point and click (or double-click if you’re
not sure you’re at the exact starting point) to end and close the 
selection.
Selecting with the Quick Mask mode
Photoshop offers a Quick Mask mode, in which you can use the Brush and
the Pencil tools (as well as the Fill tool) to paint a protective mask over parts
of the image. This makes it as easy as painting to make a selection because
when you return to standard working mode, the mask turns into a selection.
Alternatively, everything not painted can become a selection.
To work in and make a selection with Quick Mask mode, follow these steps:
1. Click the Quick Mask Mode button in the bottom section of the
Photoshop toolbox.

2. Click the Brush or the Pencil tool, adjusting its settings just as you
would if you were painting or drawing color onto an image.
You want to increase or decrease the size of the tool’s tip to accommo-
date the level of detail that you want to achieve in your selection.
3. Begin outlining the area you want to select, and note that a see-through
red mask appears wherever you paint, as shown in Figure 2-28.
Figure 2-28: The selection you’re painting appears as a semi-transparent red mask.
4. After you outline the shape or area, use the Fill tool to fill in the shape
that you want to turn into a selection.
This makes a solid mask that will translate into a selection of the entire
area.
5. When you finish masking the area you want, switch back to Standard
mode.
When you leave Quick Mask mode, your mask turns into a selection. 
You can now work with the selection as you would one that you created
directly with any of the other selection tools or methods.

Selection Tools
474
If you want to select everything but a particular object or area, first mask
that area. Then, when you get back into Standard mode, choose Select➪
Inverse from the main menu.
Selecting with the Paintbrush Selection tool
Photoshop Elements has a Paintbrush Selection tool that you can use to
paint a selection. The tool gives you the flexibility and familiarity of a Paint
Brush tool and also allows you to select snaking paths or to select a freeform
shape by filling in an area with the Brush tool.
Selecting pixels by color with the Magic Wand
The selections that you can make with the Magic Wand (or like-named tool)
often resemble those you’d make with the Lasso or Freehand selection 
tools. They’re freeform shapes and — like selections made with the Add to
Selection option turned on — they can encompass multiple noncontiguous
areas. 
The difference between those selection tools and the Magic Wand, however,
is that the Magic Wand makes selections based on an initial pixel sample. For
example, this enables you to select all the blue areas, all the white areas, or
all the areas that are the same as or quite close to any color or shade within
your image.
Abracadabra! Using the Magic Wand
The Magic Wand selects pixels within your image based on the color of a
pixel you click. It’s a simple process, but one that you can master and use
to your advantage if you know exactly how it works.
To use the Magic Wand tool, follow these simple steps:
1. Click the Magic Wand tool to activate it.
2. Click a pixel that’s the color of the pixels that you want to select in
your image.
Figure 2-29 shows the sampling in progress.
3. If you don’t get all the pixels you wanted, press and hold the Shift key
while you continue to click pixels around in the image, adding to the
Magic Wand selection.
Figure 2-30 shows a selection in progress.

Selection Tools
476
If you get more pixels in the selection than you want, reduce your selection
by switching to Subtract from Selection mode (Photoshop or Elements) or
by holding down the Ctrl key (Ô for Mac) to take away from the existing
selection. When you click an unwanted area within the selection, those
pixels are no longer selected.
If you didn’t get as much of the image as you wanted, tweak the tool’s
options settings, such as Tolerance, to include more pixels. You can tweak
the number of selected pixels by expanding the tolerance, or press the Shift
key and click in the additional area you hoped to select in order to add to
the selection.
Controlling the wand’s magic
Any wand settings that you could possibly tweak are located on the tool’s
Options bar in Photoshop and Elements or in the palette or Tool options
bar of other image editors. The settings work differently, depending on the
application you’re using.
In any case, you will see a Tolerance setting, which is a threshold for the sen-
sitivity of the wand. The higher the number you set for the Tolerance setting,
the more pixels that the software sees as selectable — a risky approach if
you’re working with a black-and-white photo or a color photo without a lot
of color diversity throughout. You can make other application-specific
adjustments that, when used in conjunction with the Tolerance setting, can
assure you of the exact selection you wanted. These adjustments include 
the following:
✦Match Mode (Paint Shop Pro) allows you to choose what pixel attribute
is compared to the surrounding pixels. You can choose from RGB Value,
Hue, Brightness, All Opaque, or Opacity. If you choose RGB Value (the
default), the surrounding pixels are compared in terms of their levels of
red, green, and blue. And, if they’re close enough to the sampled pixel
(based on the Tolerance you set), they are selected.
✦Contiguous (Photoshop/Elements) is a check box that allows you to
choose whether the selection includes pixels that aren’t touching the
sampled pixel or any of the pixels that were selected on the first click
with the wand. If you turn on the option (it’s off by default), you get a
smaller selection, which might be just what you want. If you turn it off,
any pixels meeting your Tolerance setting are selected, no matter where
in the image they’re found.
✦The Use All Layers option (Photoshop/Elements) allows you to select
pixels on (who’d have guessed it) all the layers of the image. If you turn
this on (it’s off by default), you can select all the pixels that meet your

Book V
Chapter 2

Options

477
tolerance requirements, no matter which layer they’re on. If you want to
restrict your edits to a particular layer, however, make sure this option
is off.
You might find it easier to set your Tolerance setting low so that you don’t
get more of a selection than you wanted and then use the Add to Selection
option or the Shift key to augment the selection by clicking again on a new
spot, which resamples the image and compares surrounding pixels against a
different sample pixel. Like most things in life, it’s easier to start small and
add what you need than to grab too much and then have to give some of it
back or start all over again.
Blending Tools
Blending is another word for mixing — combining separate things to make a
new thing. When it comes to photos that you’re retouching or editing for con-
tent, use blending to make new content seem as though it has always been 
in what’s really a new environment. Blending is for retouching — applying
strokes of paint that cover a stain or pasted areas that fill in a hole and then
disappear into the neighboring content.
Any good image editing application offers at least one or two blending tools,
and again using Photoshop, Photoshop Elements, and Paint Shop Pro as
examples, you’ll find no lack of blending tools available, including
✦The Smudge tool (Photoshop/Elements)
✦The Blur tool (Photoshop/Elements and Paint Shop Pro)
✦The Scratch Remover tool (Paint Shop Pro)
You can use other tools to blend one thing into another, but they’re not nec-
essarily tools that are classified as blending tools per se. For example, you
can use the Clone Stamp tool to eliminate the signs of an obvious patch job,
to add consistency to an area with spotty colors or textures, or to heal a
damaged area that stands out like a sore thumb. Sometimes, the Clone
Stamp’s results need a little blending of their own, though, and that’s when
the actual blending tools come into play.
Smudging and smearing your colors
The Smudge tool smears color from one area of the image onto another area,
much like how you blend dry pastels with your fingertip or how children
finger-paint. You can use this tool to blend hard edges, to soften blemishes

Blending Tools
478
(when actually patching them would rob the image of too much texture), and
to smear away small spots or scratches. You can use the tool in black-and-
white or color images.
Using and controlling the Smudge tool
To use the Smudge tool, just click it and start smudging. The default settings
are appropriate for most uses, but you can adjust them. The most effective
setting to adjust is Strength, which controls the degree of smearing that the
Smudge tool achieves. A low strength creates very subtle results, and a high
strength achieves dramatic results. A setting in the middle (50%) gives you
an effective smudge without making a mess.
Other adjustments are available on the Mode drop-down menu, which allows
you to control which aspect of the smudged pixels is affected by the smudg-
ing process. You can choose to Darken or Lighten the pixels or to affect their
hue, saturation, color, or luminosity (brightness). Not sure which one to
choose? Tinker a bit and undo your handiwork by pressing Ctrl+Z (Ô+Z) if
you don’t like the results.
Smearing with the Finger Painting option
The Finger Painting option — available with Photoshop and Photoshop
Elements’ Smudge tool — allows you to smear the current foreground color
into the area you’re smudging. You can use this option to incorporate 
new colors or brighter, more vibrant versions of existing colors by virtual
finger-painting.
Don’t forget the role that the brush size can play in the Smudge tool’s effec-
tiveness. Too big a brush can smear more of the image than you want it to,
whereas too small of a brush can result in obvious, sketchy-looking smudges.
It’s a real Goldilocks situation: You want the one that’s just right, and some-
times only experimentation helps you find the right size.
Blurring the edges
The Blur tool found in most image editors works by eliminating a little — 
or a lot — of the contrast between adjacent pixels, thereby making parts of
your image blurred or out of focus. You control how much of an effect the
tool has by adjusting its settings — Strength and Brush Size being the most
dynamic. You also control where it works by where you place your mouse 
as you scrub over unwanted edges and distinctions. You can use it to draw
attention to part of the photo by blurring nonessential content. Or, in the
blending context, you can use it to make hard lines, the edges of pasted 
content, and other unwanted edges disappear into the surrounding image.

Figure 2-31: The edges around the pasted-in flowers are too harsh.
How do you know when to blur and when to smudge, when to clone and
when to paint? There are no hard and fast rules, although I wish there were.
We all spend time trying one technique and then undoing it in favor of
another. A good guideline to keep in mind, though, is the old adage that Less
is more. A small problem (such as tiny scratches or minor stains or spots)
should require a small solution, and that usually calls for a subtle tool. If you
have a large-scale problem — such as major amounts of unwanted content,
big tears, or missing portions of the photo — a larger-scale solution is proba-
bly required.

Using the Scratch Remover
Paint Shop Pro offers a very cool tool — the Scratch Remover. Unlike
Photoshop’s multistep Healing Brush and Patch tools, this tool works
quickly and easily. (If you want to remove spots in an image in one step
using Elements, try the Spot Healing Brush instead. You can find more on
removing scratches with Adobe’s healing tools in Book VI, Chapter 4.)
1. Click the Scratch Remover (as shown in Figure 2-33) to activate it.
The Tool Options palette appears.
2. Check the options palette for any adjustments you’d like to make to
the size and shape of the Scratch Remover itself.
3. In the image, click and drag over the unwanted scratch.
4. When the Scratch Remover’s shape encompasses the scratch, release
the mouse.
The scratch is gone, a seamless duplication of surrounding content in 
its place.

You can also use the tool to get rid of unwanted small content, such as an
unruly cowlick sticking up on someone’s head, a blemish on a face, a stain
on a tablecloth, or whatever tiny imperfections you’d like to be rid of.
Finding it hard to decide which application is best? Don’t make a decision —
use two or more applications and work with them on a situational basis. I love
Photoshop and Photoshop Elements and would consider either one a required
program for anyone working with photos or just about any other types of
images. However, I love Paint Shop Pro’s Scratch Remover tool, and I use it
instead of Photoshop’s Healing Brush and Patch tools whenever I can. You
might find yourself in the same boat — torn between two applications — but
you needn’t choose, especially if you’re shopping in the under-$100 range!
Correction Tools
The word correction implies the presence of a mistake — something to be
fixed. Photos, both those taken professionally and those captured by total
amateurs, can be rife with color, lighting, and exposure problems. Whether
your image was printed and then scanned or taken with a digital camera, it
can suffer damage from poor storage, low-end equipment, or even inade-
quate previous attempts to clean up the image.
Whatever the source or cause of your photos’ problems, you can find a com-
prehensive set of corrective tools in just about any image editing application. If
you don’t find them, move on and find an application that offers tools such as

Correction Tools
482
✦Color-correction tools that saturate and desaturate colors
✦Brightness and contrast adjustment tools that add and remove light
✦Red-eye removers
✦General retouching tools that make quick, overall color, light, and expo-
sure corrections in a single step
I admit that the number of corrective options can be confusing. However,
like choosing the right blending or selection tool, choosing the right correc-
tion tool is done on a case-by-case basis. Don’t underestimate the value of
some reasoned trial-and-error editing!
Using the Sponge tool to add and remove color
Discussed briefly in Book V, Chapter 1, the Sponge tool, found in both
Photoshop and Photoshop Elements, adds color (in Saturate mode) or
removes color (in Desaturate mode), depending on how you set up the tool.
There’s a Sponge version of Paint Shop Pro’s Retouch tool, too. Figure 2-34
shows how I used the Sponge tool to remove some — but not all — of a
yellow cast in a bird’s feathers.
To use the Sponge tool in Photoshop or Photoshop Elements, follow these
steps:
1. Click the tool to activate it.
Figure 2-34: The Sponge tool removed most of the yellow cast seen at left, producing the
image shown at right.

2. On the tool’s Options bar, choose Saturate or Desaturate mode.
3. Adjust the Flow, which controls how much saturation or desaturation
occurs.
4. Choose the right brush size for the area to be sponged.
A small brush might give you undesirable results when used in a large
area, and a big brush can go too far. Choose a brush that allows you to
fix the problem area with the fewest number of clicks or brush strokes.
5. Apply the Sponge tool to the image, clicking and/or dragging to add or
remove color where desired.
Passing over the same spot more than once intensifies the sponge effect.
You wash out or add more color on each successive pass.
Why would you want to take color away? Perhaps you added too much color
in a previous editing session, and the edit can’t be undone. Or maybe you
simply want a subtler, more faded look to your image. New photos are often
faded for a more vintage look or to prepare for the use of an artistic filter
that makes the photo look like a drawing or painting.
Adjusting lights and darks
Although you can use dialog boxes galore to adjust the light levels in your
photos, the tools on the toolbox/toolbar that allow you to paint light and
shadows where they’re needed are always a real timesaver. It’s also much
easier to control the amount of light or shadow you’re applying and to con-
trol where you’re applying it if you use a brush-based tool to apply it. You
can set the brush to as large or small a size as you want, and you can zoom
in and adjust single pixels or very small groups thereof as needed. You can
also apply light and shadow to very large areas; by going over the same spot
more than once, you can easily intensify the effect.
Dodging to add light
Photoshop and Photoshop Elements offer a Dodge tool, described briefly in
Book V, Chapter 1, that allows you to add more light to any image simply by
clicking and dragging the tool over the area needing more light, as shown in
Figure 2-35. Many other image editing applications have the same tool. In the
case of Paint Shop Pro, for example, the application offers a retouching tool
that has dodging capability.
The term dodge is not specific to any software product; it’s a photographic
term for holding back the light that forms part of an image as a print is
exposed onto photographic paper by an enlarger, lightening part of the
image.

Correction Tools
484
Figure 2-35: The Dodge tool lightens areas, such as the shadows under this scary ride.
To use the Dodge tool, follow these steps:
1. Click the tool to activate it.
2. Check the tool’s Options bar and make any desired adjustments.
Your options are
• Size: The size of the brush that you use to dodge the image. Use a
size that won’t show the individual strokes but that isn’t so large that
it dodges an area larger than you intended.
• Range: Choose which tones the dodge will affect in the image — the
Highlights, Midtones, or Shadows.
• Exposure: This percentage is set to 50% by default and allows you to
control the intensity of the dodge effect. Lower numbers result in a
subtler effect than higher numbers.
3. Click and drag over the area to be dodged.
If you feel that you need to confine the Dodge effect to a very specific
area, you can select that area first, using a freeform selection tool, such
as the Brush selector or the Lasso. That way, you don’t end up with
obvious blocks or circles of lightened image content.
You can go over areas more than once. Each pass heightens the dodge effect,
so don’t go overboard!

Burning to add depth and shadow
Burning is another photographic term, and its definition is the opposite of
dodging. It involves adding extra exposure to part of an image while a print is
exposed by an enlarger. That sounds contradictory, doesn’t it? Adding more
exposure time darkens the image? Note that image-forming light is held 
back — that’s the key. The Burn tool reduces the amount of light, which
deepens shadows and reduces the detail-killing light that can wash out parts
of your image. Figure 2-36 shows an image in dire need of the Burn tool — 
if only to even out the very stark effects of the sun on specific parts of the
road image.
Figure 2-36: The Burn tool darkened the road in this country scene.

486
Using the Burn tool in most image editors is very much like using the Dodge
tool. Even though their effects are opposite, their functioning is nearly 
identical:
1. Click the tool to activate it.
2. Adjust any desired settings on the tool’s Options bar, including Size,
Range, and Exposure.
These options have the same meanings as they do for the Dodge tool
except that increasing exposure here increases the darkening effect.
Your software might have different terms for these settings, but they do
the same things.
3. Click or drag over the area of the image to be darkened, being careful
not to lose more detail by creating shadows that are too dark or too
obvious.
Living up to its name, overuse of the Burn tool can make your image look
singed. If yours is a color photo or a black-and-white photo in RGB mode
(which has more color information beyond simple shades of gray), the Burn
tool can add a brownish tone, making the photo look as though it were
exposed to high heat or flame. Unless you want your photo to look toasted,
take it easy with the Burn tool.

Image Editor for You

 Comparing the capabilities of the popular image editors
 Using different image editors for different tasks
C
hoosing the right image editor is a lot like selecting the best digital
camera for your needs. Like digital cameras, some editors have lots of
bells and whistles that you really don’t need and that can, in fact, get
between you and easy access to the functions you really must use. Other
image editors correspond to point-and-shoot digital cameras, with lots of
automation that helps you avoid making decisions on your own. That’s
great when you’re in a hurry, but not so helpful when you want
to apply your creativity to an image.
In many ways, choosing your image editor corre-
sponds to choosing a photographic lab to perform
the physical and chemical processes required to
generate prints from your exposed film. The lab
technicians at your finisher routinely adjust expo-
sure, color balance, and other details to improve
the quality of your photographic prints. You place
a lot of trust in their skills.
Today, you often end up making those adjustments
yourself in an image editor, even if the final prints are
still made at a digital lab at your retailer or via a walk-up
printing kiosk instead of on your own printer. You want to
have the same trust in your image editor and your capabilities
that you had with a traditional photo lab, especially since you can’t
switch from one editor to another as easily as you can switch photo labs
when you shoot film. When you choose an image editor, you’re making a
long-term commitment — unless you have the resources to buy and use
multiple image editors.

Looking at Popular Image Editors: The Basics
488
In Book V, Chapter 1, I fill you in on the kinds of things that you can and can’t
do with image editing tools. In Book V, Chapter 2, I describe some of the
basic features common to all image editors. In this chapter, I compare the
features of some of the leading image editors and help you decide which is
best for you.
You can download free trial versions of most of these image editors from
their corresponding Web sites. The trial versions are limited in some way —
often the length of time you can use them, and sometimes they also have
limits on their capabilities — but using them can help you choose the right
image editor before you plunk down the big bucks for a full version.
Looking at Popular Image Editors: The Basics
No single image editor is right for every digital photographer. Different image
editing programs offer different feature sets and take different approaches to
manipulating digital images. The trick is to find the program (or programs)
with the features and approach that most closely match your needs and
working style. Image editing programs range in capabilities from extremely
limited to impressively powerful. And you probably won’t be surprised at
the correspondingly wide range in price, from free or low-cost for programs
with limited capabilities to several hundred dollars for high-end programs.
A simple image editor was probably included on the disc that came with
your digital camera. Dozens of others are available on the shelves of local
computer stores or as free downloads from the Internet. Like the one-hour
photo lab, these programs are quick and easy to use for viewing your images
and producing simple prints, but the capabilities are usually quite limited.
Your search for an image editing program will undoubtedly extend beyond
the simple view-and-print utilities and those already included with the
Windows and Mac operating systems. However, wanting more capabilities
than the low-end programs offer doesn’t necessarily mean that you should
go all the way to the other end of the spectrum. An assortment of midrange
programs just might fit your needs very nicely.
The available image editing programs can be grouped into roughly four tiers:
✦Adobe Photoshop stands alone at the top as the de facto standard for
professional image editing. If you’re working with images professionally,
you need to own and use Photoshop. Although you might also find one
of the other editors helpful for specialized tasks, Photoshop is your meal
ticket.

Book V
Chapter 3
Choosing the Right
Image Editor for You
Adobe Photoshop — Alone at the Top
489
✦The second tier is composed of highly capable image editors. Although
they might not match Photoshop’s every feature, they have the power
and versatility to meet the needs of many digital photographers. The
image editors in this tier often include wizards and dialog boxes that
automate common tasks, but the main focus is on direct access to the
image with a variety of manual selection, retouching, and painting tools.
✦The third tier of image editors sacrifices some of the raw power and ver-
satility of the first- and second-tier programs in favor of dramatically
improved ease of use. Most common image editing tasks are automated
or made more accessible through the use of wizards and dialog boxes
that walk you through the steps required to complete the task. The pro-
grams in this group might also have the ability to access your image for
direct manipulation with retouching and painting tools, but the manual
editing features are somewhat limited. The main emphasis is on the pro-
gram’s automated editing tasks.
✦The fourth tier is composed primarily of the simple view-and-print utili-
ties, although some of the programs also have some limited image edit-
ing capabilities. These programs often feature simple and attractive user
interfaces with big graphical buttons for each task. They are very easy
to use but offer only a very limited assortment of simple image editing
options, such as cropping and overall color balance. Generally, these
programs don’t enable you to select and edit a portion of an image with
manual retouching tools.
Because the purpose of this chapter is to give you a brief overview of some
of the popular image editors and to assist you in identifying the program
that might be right for you, I skip the bottom tier. These programs come and
go and don’t usually have the level of support needed for serious image edit-
ing. The focus in this chapter is on the other (top) three levels.
Adobe Photoshop — Alone at the Top
Adobe Photoshop, as shown in Figure 3-1, is the big kahuna of image editing
programs. Available for both Windows and Mac OS, it is the industry stan-
dard by which all the other image editing programs are measured.
Over the years, Photoshop has earned a place in nearly every digital imaging
professional’s toolbox. The latest version only cemented that position. In
fact, for many graphics professionals, Photoshop is the primary tool for
everything from resampling image files and changing the file format to pho-
tographic retouching and image enhancement to creating original illustra-
tions and artwork.

Adobe Photoshop — Alone at the Top

Figure 3-1: An image being edited in Photoshop CS2.
Photoshop is a professional-level tool, but you don’t have to work at a major
advertising agency, photography studio, or printing plant to use it. Even
though buying a copy of Photoshop requires a significant investment of
money and of time spent learning to use it, it’s not beyond the reach of small
businesses, serious digital photography hobbyists, artists, and others who
need access to its powerful tools and advanced features. You’ll need a com-
puter powerful enough to run it, of course. You can find attractive upgrade
offers from time to time that let you purchase a full copy of Photoshop 
for a fraction of its regular list price. When you own Photoshop, additional
upgrades (as Adobe releases new versions) are relatively economical.
What’s good about Photoshop
Photoshop didn’t attain its stature as the leading high-end image editing 
program by accident. It has a well-deserved reputation for delivering a 
complete feature set. In short, this is one powerful program. No matter
what you want to do with an image, odds are that Photoshop contains the
tools to let you do it.

Book V
Chapter 3
Choosing the Right
Image Editor for You
Adobe Photoshop — Alone at the Top
491
Photoshop can read, write, and manipulate all the industry-standard file for-
mats, such as TIFF, JPEG, and, through its Adobe Camera RAW plug-in, the
RAW formats that more advanced digital cameras produce. It also supports
many not-so-standard formats as well. You can resample images to change
the image size, resolution, and color depth. Photoshop excels at providing
images that are optimized for specialized uses, such as commercial printing
and Web graphics. Photoshop also enjoys close ties with several leading
page-layout programs and Web-development programs (especially the other
Adobe products, PageMaker and InDesign).
Photoshop provides a rich set of tools for everything from simple image
manipulation (cropping and color balance adjustments, to name two) to
selecting complex shapes from an image and applying sophisticated filters
and effects to the selected area. Photoshop also includes a full set of painting
tools that you can use to retouch your images or to create original artwork.
As if Photoshop’s built-in features weren’t complete enough, Adobe designed
Photoshop to accept filters and other program extensions provided by third-
party suppliers. As a result, a robust aftermarket has evolved to supply a
wide assortment of plug-ins that make it quick and easy to apply all manner
of textures, edge treatments, special effects, and other image manipulations
to the images that you edit in Photoshop.
What’s not so good about Photoshop
Photoshop is undeniably a powerful program, but you do pay a price for all
that power: Photoshop is expensive. The price of admission for accessing
Photoshop’s power is a significant investment in money and learning time.
At a little over $600, Photoshop is expensive to purchase initially (later
upgrades won’t cost you as much). But the cost of the program doesn’t stop
there. If you’re a serious Photoshop user, you probably want to add one or
more plug-in packages, which each cost as much as a typical mid-level image
editor. And then there are the inevitable upgrade costs when Adobe releases
the next version of Photoshop with all its cool new features. The upgrade
price for a new version of Photoshop is more than the full purchase price of
most other image editors, but the cost is still reasonable when you consider
what you’re getting.
In addition to its monetary cost, Photoshop is also expensive in terms of the
time that you need to invest in order to use it. The demands of learning to
use this program are probably the most significant barrier for the casual
user. Photoshop’s power and versatility make it a complex program, and that
complexity creates a steep learning curve. Getting started working with the
program right out of the box can be challenging. Even after you learn the

Adobe Photoshop — Alone at the Top
492
ropes, performing some simple tasks can sometimes be cumbersome in
Photoshop. The program’s breadth and depth make it difficult to master.
Often, even the graphics pros who use Photoshop on a daily basis haven’t
explored all its many capabilities.
Photoshop is an ongoing commitment, too. It’s not the sort of program that
you can use once a month and pick up where you left off. It works best when
used daily so that the commands and shortcuts become second nature.
Attempt to use a special feature after not working with Photoshop for a
month, and you’ll probably find yourself diving into the (excellent) built-in
Help system.
What you can do with Photoshop
What can you do with Photoshop? The short answer is, “Almost anything!”
In fact, it’s difficult to come up with anything that you’d want to do to a digi-
tal image that can’t be done in Photoshop unless it’s outright impossible in
the first place (such as transforming a total train wreck of a photo into a
work of art). Oh sure, a few tasks are faster or easier to perform in some
other programs. However, it’s hard to find a visual effect that can’t be dupli-
cated in Photoshop if you’re willing to invest the time and effort to get
acquainted with the program’s tools and to use those tools in innovative
ways. Best of all, Photoshop has many features that are useful to those using
digital cameras, including the ability to work with RAW camera files (the
basic, unprocessed camera file with all the original information captured by
the camera) for many popular models, facilities for matching colors between
images taken under different lighting conditions, and a new feature for stitching
panorama photos seamlessly. You’ll find a description of Photoshop CS2
improvements in Book VI, Chapter 1.
Here’s just one very simple example of an image enhancement that you can
create with Photoshop. Suppose you don’t like the flat, uninteresting sky in
the picture shown in Figure 3-2. No problem — you can quickly add some
better clouds by following these steps:
1. Click the Magic Wand tool and then adjust its settings.
The Magic Wand tool is the second button down in the right column of
the toolbox on the left side of the Photoshop window. You adjust the 
settings for the Magic Wand tool in the Options bar across the top of
the Photoshop window. In this case, I used a tolerance setting of 50 and
selected the Anti-Aliased and the Contiguous options. Those settings tell
the Magic Wand to select only the pixels in the sky. (For more information
on how the Magic Wand tool operates, see Book VI, Chapter 2.)

Photoshop selects the sky for editing and marks the selection by sur-
rounding it with a “marching ants” marquee.
3. Open a file with better clouds and select the clouds by using the
Marquee tool.
4. Copy the clouds by pressing Ctrl+C (or Ô+C on the Mac) and then
switch to the original castle image and press Shift+Ctrl/Ô+V to paste
the image into the selection.
Figure 3-3 shows the finished image with clouds added to the sky.

The Best of the Rest
Photoshop’s chief competitors are a diverse lot. They all have the ability to
edit and manipulate digital images, and they emphasize direct access to the
image over wizards and other automation for editing tasks. They are all less
expensive than Photoshop. However, that’s where the uniformity ends.
Some of the programs in this group are niche products that excel at dealing
with particular kinds of images, whereas others are general-purpose image
editors with nearly as much versatility as Photoshop CS2. Each of the 
programs in this collection has its own set of strengths and weaknesses.
Depending on your specific needs, the program that is a perfect fit for you
might be unsuitable for another digital image maker.
Adobe Photoshop Elements
Photoshop Elements 4.0 is the little brother of the full Photoshop program and
is available in similar, but not identical, versions for both Windows and Mac

OS. Adobe created Photoshop Elements (often shortened to just Elements) as
a more accessible version of Photoshop for the numerous people who want to
use Photoshop but don’t need some of its more advanced features.
Photoshop Elements, as shown in Figure 3-4, shares much of the same user
interface with its big brother, Photoshop, although in a revamped form
because Elements 4.0 was introduced after Photoshop CS2. Compared with
the full version of Photoshop, Elements has an abbreviated feature set, but it
includes most of the basic image editing tools that the typical digital photog-
rapher needs on a regular basis. That includes image selection, retouching,
and painting tools; a generous assortment of filters; and the ability to expand
those filters by accepting the same Photoshop plug-ins as its sibling program.
Figure 3-4: Photoshop Elements 4.0 at work.
What’s good about Elements
Photoshop Elements is competitively priced at about $100. Elements is con-
siderably less powerful than its big brother, but by sacrificing some of the
immense power of Photoshop, Adobe created a program that is significantly
less complex and is therefore easier to use than Photoshop.

The Best of the Rest
496
In general, Adobe did a pretty good job of selecting which Photoshop fea-
tures to include in Elements. The program’s feature set is a reasonably good
match for the needs of the typical digital photographer. Most of Photoshop’s
standard selection, retouching, and painting tools are available in Elements.
If your image editing needs revolve around retouching and manipulating
individual pictures one at a time, you’ll probably never notice the more
advanced Photoshop features that are missing from Elements.
Rest assured, though, that Elements isn’t just a slimmed-down version of
Photoshop. The program includes a few interesting features that Photoshop
lacks. For example, Elements features an un-Photoshop-like Palette bin
(shown at the right in Figure 3-4) with quick access to features like How To,
Styles and Effects, and Layers. You can also store palettes in more traditional
Photoshop nested tab palettes, as you can see in the lower right in the figure.
The automated commands on the Enhance menu make quick work of
common image editing tasks, such as adjusting backlighting or color cast.
As a result, an occasional user working with Elements can complete those
tasks faster and more accurately than a seasoned graphics pro working with
Photoshop. You can find out more about color casts in Book IV, Chapter 1.
Elements also makes a good set of training wheels for Photoshop. After you
master this program, you can use Photoshop much more easily than if you
started with Photoshop from scratch.
What’s not so good about Elements
The similarity of the Elements user interface (the arrangement of menus and
floating palettes superimposed on the workspace containing multiple docu-
ment windows) is a boon to Photoshop users and wannabes who might need
to switch back and forth between the two programs. However, the Photoshop
interface (and thus, to a large extent, the Elements interface) isn’t known for
its ease of use. Many newcomers to the program don’t find the menu arrange-
ments and other details to be very intuitive.
What you can do with Elements
One very nice feature of Elements is the broad array of automatic fixer com-
mands, which can adjust color, contrast, lighting, or even all of these at once
via the Smart Fix feature. (Elements also has an Auto Smart Fix command
that does all these things automatically.) Follow these steps to apply the
Auto Contrast command to an image you’re editing in Photoshop Elements:
1. Open the file containing the image you want to edit.
The image opens in the Elements workspace and is shown in the Photo
Bin at the bottom of the window, as shown in Figure 3-5.

If your image looks muddy and unnatural after applying the Auto Contrast
command, try applying the Enhance➪Auto Levels command to restore a
more natural tonal range.

Corel PhotoPaint
Corel PhotoPaint, one of three upscale image editing packages available from
the graphics powerhouse Corel, is the image editing program that is included
in the popular CorelDRAW Graphics suite. Various versions of this program
are available for both Windows and Mac computers.

The Best of the Rest
498
PhotoPaint, shown in Figure 3-6, is a full-featured photo retouching and
image editing program. Although its feature set cannot match the full version
of Photoshop, PhotoPaint stands solidly among the second group of prod-
ucts, delivering a large portion of Photoshop’s functionality for a relatively
small portion of that program’s price. PhotoPaint is far more powerful and
versatile than programs that stress ease of use.
Figure 3-6: Corel PhotoPaint comes with the CorelDRAW graphics suite.
PhotoPaint offers a full set of selection, retouching, and painting tools for
manual image manipulations and also includes convenient automated com-
mands for a few common tasks, such as red-eye removal. PhotoPaint also
accepts Photoshop plug-ins to expand its assortment of filters and special
effects.
New in Version X3 (13!) is the PhotoPaint Image Adjustment Lab, a one-
click facility that lets you correct the color and tone of photos quickly and
easily. By using the automatic correction control, you can fix most color and
contrast problems. You can also manually remove color casts and adjust the

brightness, contrast, highlights, shadows, and midtones of a photo. To help
you choose the best photo-editing results, you can compare snapshots of a
photo with different settings applied.
The “Cutout Lab” simplifies making selections, making it easier to isolate
parts of your images. You can touch up your cutouts by adding and remov-
ing detail, and you can redo and undo actions if necessary. In addition, you
can choose to keep both the cutout and the original image or to create a clip
mask from the cutout.
What’s good about PhotoPaint
Corel PhotoPaint is a respectable product as a stand-alone image editor.
However, its greatest strength is its integration with CorelDRAW and the rest
of the Corel graphics suite. If you use CorelDRAW to create and edit graphics,
you probably have PhotoPaint installed on your computer, and you’ll feel
right at home using the product. All the menus, dialog boxes, and palettes
behave just as you expect from your experience with DRAW.
What’s not so good about PhotoPaint
Perhaps the worst thing about PhotoPaint is that it’s available only as part of
the CorelDRAW graphics suite. That’s also one of the best things because the
Corel Graphics applications are a powerful combination. At a $159 upgrade
price for the downloadable version (it’s a $179 upgrade if you want the retail
package), the CorelDRAW graphics suite is a good value, provided that you
need the main CorelDRAW program and any of the other components of the
suite. However, that might be a lot to pay for PhotoPaint alone, especially
because other image editors in this tier are available for around $100.
What you can do with PhotoPaint
You can do many of the things possible with Photoshop except for complex
color separation tasks. It’s an all-around good editor for the average user.
Where to get PhotoPaint
To get PhotoPaint, you need to purchase the CorelDRAW graphics suite for
about $159 to $400, depending on whether you are upgrading or buying it as

Corel Paint Shop Pro
Corel Paint Shop Pro, shown in Figure 3-7, is one of the leading second-tier
image editors. It’s a general-purpose image editor for Windows only that has
gained a reputation as the “poor man’s Photoshop” for providing a substan-
tial portion of Photoshop’s capabilities at a fraction of the cost. The program
lists for about $100, but you can often find it for sale at a substantial discount.
In recent years, however, Corel has stuffed in the features, going beyond
achieving feature parity with Photoshop in many areas and exceeding
Adobe’s flagship product with specialized tools and effects. Indeed, the pro-
gram has more than 500 special effects, counterparts to Photoshop’s filters,
that can add an amazing number of interesting looks to your photos, from
the fading of an aged newspaper clipping to faux infrared transformations.
Figure 3-7: Paint Shop Pro has some features you won’t find anywhere else, including more
than 500 special effects filters.
Paint Shop Pro features a complete tool kit that includes selection, painting,
and retouching tools for direct manipulation of your images. It also includes
a sizable collection of wizard-like commands that automate common tasks,

such as removing red-eye and scratches. Paint Shop Pro includes an incredi-
ble assortment of filters and effects, and you can expand that assortment by
adding most any of the Photoshop plug-ins.
What’s good about Paint Shop Pro
Paint Shop Pro has been around for a while, so the program has had time
to evolve and mature. Over that time, it has developed a reasonably robust
feature set and a refined user interface. Many people rate Paint Shop Pro as
the easiest to use of the general-purpose image editors, and it’s among the
lowest priced programs in its class.
The latest version, Paint Shop Pro X, includes a friendly Learning Center that
can show you how to edit your photos, remove objects from your photos,
and assemble composite photos. If you just want your photo fixed, fast,
Smart Photo Fix corrects color, exposure, and lighting problems. The new
Makeover Tools remove blemishes, whiten teeth, lather on a suntan, remove
wrinkles, and zap red eyes.
This version adds 16-bit editing — useful for those who have cameras that
can produce files with expanded color palettes — advanced CMYK and 
color management, and screen calibrations options you might have needed
Photoshop for in the past.
The program includes Corel’s Photo Album 6 digital asset management pro-
gram and Pixmantec RawShooter Essentials, a fully functional RAW converter
that simplifies translating RAW files.
What’s not so good about Paint Shop Pro
The breadth and depth of the Paint Shop Pro feature set is a little uneven.
The program shows surprising depth in some areas (such as the availability
of layers) and shallowness in others (such as the limited choice of selection
and paint tools). Also, some tools (such as the Histogram Adjustment com-
mand) require more knowledge and experience to use effectively than do the
corresponding tools in some of the other editors.
You need to evaluate the program carefully to determine whether its particu-
lar strengths and weaknesses are a good match for the mix of work you need
to do.
What you can do with Paint Shop Pro
Paint Shop Pro includes a huge number of special effects filters. It also
includes a useful little command that helps you select the filter you want
to use. Here’s how it works:

The Best of the Rest
502
1. Choose Effects➪Effect Browser from the main menu.
The Effect Browser dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 3-7. The dialog
box contains a list of effect filters on the left and thumbnail (small) pre-
views on the right.
2. Click an item in the Effects list to preview the effect.
When you click an item in the list, a short description of the effect
appears, and a Sample Preview thumbnail for each effect shows an
approximation of how the effect will look on your image. Continue try-
ing different effects until you find one you like.
3. Click Apply.
The Effect Browser dialog box disappears. This is the equivalent of
choosing the corresponding effect from the Effects menu. If no settings
are available for the selected effect, the effect is applied immediately,
and you’re done. Otherwise, the effect’s dialog box appears.
4. Adjust the settings in the effect-specific dialog box as needed.
Depending on the specific effect you selected, you might need to set
options to control the intensity and other attributes of the effect.
5. Click Apply.
The dialog box disappears, and Paint Shop Pro applies the effect to your
image.
Where to get Paint Shop Pro
Paint Shop Pro started life as a shareware program but has since expanded
its market presence and gone mainstream. As a result, now that Corel has
taken it over from Jasc, it now sports the slick packaging and complete docu-
mentation that most people expect from a commercial software product. 
You can buy the boxed version of Paint Shop Pro at all the usual computer
software outlets. You can also order the product from the Corel Web site at
www.corel.com.
Corel Painter
If PhotoPaint and Paint Shop Pro don’t suit you, Corel has a third image 
editing program for you to consider. Surprisingly, there is very little overlap
among Corel’s three image editing options. Painter, available for Windows
and Mac computers, is a unique image-editing program. In fact, the term
image editor is a bit of a misnomer for Painter. It’s more of a program for cre-
ating original images than it is an editor for images from your digital camera.

Painter IX.5, shown in Figure 3-8, specializes in re-creating in digital form a
wide range of traditional artist media, such as charcoal, pastels, and various
kinds of paint. Painter includes a basic assortment of tools that you can use
to edit existing images, but the program is really designed for artists to use to
create original illustrations.
Figure 3-8: An image being edited in Painter, with only a few of the scores of different palettes
visible.
What’s good about Painter
Painter’s natural media effects are really impressive. Although other pro-
grams allow you to select different paintbrush tools and adjust their color,
size, edge softness, and a few other attributes, Painter takes the concept of
brush effects to a whole new level.
In Painter, you can define not only the characteristics of the brush but also
the texture of the paper or canvas; the thickness of the paint on the brush;
and how the paint, brush, and paper interact. As a result, the program can
realistically simulate the very different effects of a watercolor wash on hot-
press paper, oil on canvas, pastels on a sanded board, or any of a huge

The Best of the Rest
504
assortment of other media/material combinations. Painter comes with a
large inventory of predefined brushes and art materials that you can use or
modify to suit your artistic impulse. With the right settings, you can even
watch the digital paint drip and run.
Note: A pressure-sensitive graphics tablet and pen is an essential tool for
using a program like Painter. The pen gives you much better control of the
cursor than a mouse does, and the pressure-sensitive tip adds a new dimen-
sion to your digital brush strokes. A graphics tablet makes any image editor
easier to use, and you can’t use Painter effectively without one. Expect to
pay $50 to $150 and up for one of these.
What’s not so good about Painter
Painter can be confusing and difficult to work with at first. It has a bewilder-
ing array of different palettes filled with options that allow you to exercise
precise control over each brush stroke. Just figuring out where everything is
can be a challenge, and working your way through the various options each
time you want to do something can be tedious. After you gain experience
with the program, it becomes easier to use, but learning to use Painter effec-
tively takes no small amount of time and commitment. This isn’t a program
that lends itself to occasional, casual use.
Painter’s image editing capabilities are more attuned to the needs of an artist
who wants to incorporate a portion of an existing image in a new composite
composition — not so much for routine image enhancements and corrections.
If you’re looking for a digital darkroom where you can crop, color correct, and
repair your digital photographs before printing, you need to look elsewhere.
Painter is second only to the full version of Photoshop as the most expensive
product in this roundup of image editors. Its price tag (about $199 for an
upgrade, $399 if you want a full boxed version) is not unreasonable if you
really need its specialized natural media brush effects, but its high price
puts Painter beyond the reach of most hobbyists equipping a typical digital
darkroom. Few people can afford to buy Painter for casual experimentation.
What you can do with Painter
Painter is designed for digital artists to use when creating illustrations from
scratch. However, you don’t always have to start every image with a blank
canvas. Painter can also apply its rich assortment of paper textures to an
existing image. Here’s how:
1. Select the paper texture that you want to use by expanding the Papers
menu in the Art Materials palette and then clicking a paper sample.

control over the depth and character of the texture, how the light strikes
and defines the texture, and how the texture is applied to the image.
As you adjust the settings, the Preview box shows a sample of how the
settings affect your image.
4. Click OK.

Where to get Painter
Like most of the other programs in this roundup, Painter IX.5 is a commercial
software product that is available through the normal purchasing channels.
It’s a bit of a specialized product, so you might need to go to a larger soft-
ware dealer or one that specializes in graphics products. The suggested
retail price is close to $400. A time-limited free trial version of the program is
available for download. For more information on Painter, including how to
get the free trial download, visit www.corel.com.
Macromedia Fireworks
It’s hard to predict what will happen to Fireworks, the image editing program
from Macromedia, which Adobe acquired along with the market-leading Web
development software (Dreamweaver) and Web animation software (Flash).
Fireworks has been available as either a separate, standalone program or
bundled with Dreamweaver, Flash, and Freehand (a drawing program) in the
Studio MX package, and it runs on both Windows and Mac machines. Now
that Fireworks has joined the Adobe fold, its days as a separate program
may be limited.
I hope it remains available, because Fireworks, shown in Figure 3-10, has all
the features it needs to handle most any routine image editing chore and 
is especially adept at producing images for the Web. The basic selection,
retouching, painting, text, and drawing tools are all present and accounted
for, and the program supports layers and Photoshop plug-ins to expand its
basic filters. However, Fireworks doesn’t try to be the most versatile general-
purpose image editor on the market. Instead, the program excels in the more
specialized job of preparing images for use on the Web.
What’s good about Fireworks
Fireworks really shines at two kinds of Web-related activities:
✦Creating Web graphics, such as banners, image maps, and rollover
buttons: Fireworks provides an excellent set of tools for working with
text and shapes, and the program can automatically generate the HTML
and JavaScript code needed for rollover effects and image maps.
✦Optimizing images for use on the Web: The Preview tab of each docu-
ment window in Fireworks allows you to instantly preview different image
optimization settings while you edit your image. The Image Optimization
dialog box pulls all the various file format, color depth, size, and resolu-
tion settings together into one place where you can experiment with 
various settings and observe their effect on file size and image quality.

507
Figure 3-10: An image being edited in Fireworks.
Fireworks is bound in a symbiotic relationship with Dreamweaver. Although
each product works independently, using them together can dramatically
streamline the usual process of optimizing images for a Web page under
development. For example, if you’re building a Web page in Dreamweaver
and need to optimize an image on that page, all it takes is a couple of mouse
clicks to open the image in Fireworks’ Image Optimizer dialog box. With a
few more mouse clicks, you can optimize and save the image and then return
to Dreamweaver, where the newly optimized image appears automatically on
the Web page being edited. You have to see this feature in operation to
appreciate just how slick it is and how much time it saves.
What’s not so good about Fireworks
Fireworks’ concentration on creating and optimizing images for the Web
leaves it a bit weak in some other areas. For example, although the basic
image editing tools are present in Fireworks, the selection of retouching and
painting tools isn’t as comprehensive as you might find in some of the other
image editing programs.

The Best of the Rest
508
The list of file formats available for import and export is also somewhat
restricted. All the major file formats (such as TIFF, JPG, and GIF) are repre-
sented, as well as Fireworks’ native PNG format and a number of others, but
the list of supported file formats is less than half as long as its counterparts
in some other image editors.
What you can do with Fireworks
One of key features of Fireworks is its ability to optimize images for the Web.
Here’s an example of that feature at work:
1. Choose File➪Export Preview from the main menu.
The Export Preview dialog box appears. On the right side of the dialog
box is the preview pane that shows how your image will look when
saved with the current settings. If necessary, adjust the zoom setting
(the drop-down box showing a percentage at the bottom of the screen)
to adjust the size of the preview image. Drag on the preview image to
bring different portions of the image into view.
2. Adjust the settings in the Options tab.
Select the file format, quality, smoothing, and other settings as needed.
Depending on the file format that you choose, the other setting boxes
change to reflect the options that are available for that file format.
3. Experiment with different settings as needed.
Adjust the settings and note the effect on the preview image and on the
file size and download speed display above the preview box. If neces-
sary, adjust the image size settings on the File tab as well. Keep trying
different settings on the Options tab until you achieve the smallest file
size that still retains acceptable image quality.
4. Click the Export button.
The Export Preview dialog box disappears, and Fireworks exports your
image to a file using the settings that you selected.
Where to get Fireworks
Fireworks has been available from all the normal suppliers for less than 
$300 and is still being sold by Adobe at that price as Fireworks 8. For details

time this book is published) and the other Macromedia programs, go to

Ulead PhotoImpact
Ulead PhotoImpact, shown in Figure 3-11, is a general-purpose, Windows-
only photo editing program with a particularly robust feature set. In fact,
PhotoImpact is arguably second only to Photoshop in the overall scope of its
features, although Paint Shop Pro is virtually neck-and-neck.
In addition to the usual selection, cropping, and fill tools, PhotoImpact fea-
tures a rich assortment of brushes for painting, retouching, and cloning.
You’ll also find tools for text and vector shapes as well as tools for creating
slices and image maps for use on the Web. PhotoImpact supports layers and
includes a generous collection of effects filters, which you can expand with
Photoshop plug-ins. Auto-process commands are available to automate
many of the most common image correction and enhancement tasks.
Figure 3-11: PhotoImpact is almost as versatile as Photoshop, for a lot less money.
What’s good about PhotoImpact
PhotoImpact is one of the most powerful and versatile of image editors, and
yet it’s modestly priced at less than $100. This combination of high capabil-
ity and low price makes PhotoImpact an excellent value.

The Best of the Rest

If you frequently find yourself performing the same image manipulations on
a number of files, you’ll appreciate PhotoImpact’s batch operations. With this
feature, you can select multiple image files and then apply any one of a long
list of filters, enhancements, or auto-process commands to all the selected files.
What a timesaver!
PhotoImpact also includes some specialized features for creating Web graph-
ics. The program includes wizards to help you create Web backgrounds, ban-
ners, and buttons, and its image-optimization features are especially strong.
Although PhotoImpact’s Web graphics features aren’t quite as slick as those
in Fireworks, they’re quite good.
What’s not so good about PhotoImpact
PhotoImpact’s user interface can be a bit quirky and inconsistent in places.
Some of PhotoImpact’s features, although effective and very useful, feel like
they are the result of grafting separate modules onto the program instead of
seamlessly integrating the features into the program. Overall, the PhotoImpact
user interface is not as polished as Photoshop, Fireworks, or PhotoPaint. To
be fair, however, after you get past the program’s quirks and idiosyncrasies,
you’ll find that PhotoImpact is a very capable, Windows-only image editor.
What you can do with PhotoImpact
PhotoImpact is a versatile image editor, capable of most any image manipula-
tion you might want to do. Picking just one example to show here is difficult.
PhotoImpact comes with a generous assortment of effect filters, and playing
around with the filters is lots of fun. Here’s an example of a filter that gives
an image the look of an oil painting:
1. Open an image that might make a good painting.
2. Choose Effect➪Artistic➪Oil Paint from the main menu.
The Oil Paint dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 3-12. The Dual View
tab shows two thumbnails: your original image on the left and a preview
of the effect on the right.
3. Drag the sliders to adjust the Stroke Detail and Level.
Adjust the sliders as needed to achieve the desired effect. You can also
use the spin boxes to the right of each slider if you want to make more
precise adjustments.
4. Click OK.
The Oil Paint dialog box disappears as PhotoImpact applies the effect to
your image.

Microsoft Digital Image
Microsoft’s image editing software doesn’t get the attention that the big-name
Microsoft programs like Microsoft Office get. Despite the Microsoft name,
these Windows-only programs aren’t the dominant programs in their class.
However, all are respected players in the field, and you might find that one of
the company’s three tiered offerings can work for you
The three programs are Microsoft Digital Image Standard, Digital Image Suite,
and Digital Image Suite Plus, ranging in price from $34.99 to about $99 (see
Figure 3-13). Each of the upscale editions piles on more goodies that can be
useful for digital camera owners.

The Best of the Rest
512
Figure 3-13: Microsoft offers three versions of its Digital Image program — all priced less 
than $100.
The entry-level version, which forms the basis for all three editions, is a
simple program that makes accessing your images easy (whether they are in
your camera or scanner or stored on your hard drive) and then lets you edit
and print those images with a minimum of fuss. The image editing capabili-
ties are limited when compared with some of the more advanced editors, 
but they cover the basics. You can perform tasks such as cropping, rotating,
adjusting brightness or color balance, and fixing red-eye and scratches. It also
includes a modest collection of effect filters and edge treatments that you
can apply to your images. The program even includes some basic painting
tools as well as tools for adding text and shapes to your images.
Microsoft’s imaging software comes in several variations. The key difference
among them is the number of artistic design templates and photos. Digital
Image Standard comes with 1,500 designer templates and 2,400 photos,
versus 3,000 templates and 5,000 photos in the Digital Image Suite and 
Digital Image Suite Plus. The two advanced editions add more filters (200-
plus instead of 10 for the low-end version) and retouching tools, including
flash and backlight corrections; dodge and burn tools; and the ability to

Book V
Chapter 3
Choosing the Right

513
adjust shadow, midtone, and highlight levels independently. Digital Image
Suite/Plus also accepts Photoshop plug-ins for even more filter effects and
has a total of 3,000 templates.
What’s good about Microsoft image editors
Like most Microsoft products, the Digital Image Standard, Suite, and Suite
Plus products have a slick-looking user interface that is well thought out and
easy to use. Microsoft can afford to invest time and money in focus groups
and usability testing — and it shows.
These editors also have the ability to select several image files and apply the
same adjustment to all the selected files at once. This ability isn’t unique to
the Microsoft editors, but it’s unusual in image editors at this level.
What’s not so good about Microsoft Digital Image editors
The added features of the Digital Image Suite versions are an obvious
attempt to give the program capabilities comparable to some of the more
full-featured image editors. In my opinion, the attempt falls short. However,
you might find that Digital Image Suite gives you just enough capability to
handle your occasional image editing tasks without needing a more
advanced editor.
What you can do with Microsoft Digital Image editors
Programs in this collection excel at quick fixes. Here’s an example of making
a couple of quick adjustments in Digital Image Suite to an image that needs
color correction:
1. Open a photo that you want to correct.
2. Click the Levels AutoFix button in the left toolbar (see Figure 3-13).
Digital Image Suite automatically adjusts brightness and contrast to
achieve a full tonal range of blacks, whites, and all the tones in between.
3. Click the Color Auto Fix button in the left toolbar.
The program displays the Color and Saturation panel on the left side of
the program window.
4. Click the Eyedropper icon and then click an area of the picture that
should be gray.
Digital Image Suite automatically adjusts the color settings as needed to
render the selected area as gray. If the image still doesn’t look right, you
can try clicking another gray spot or adjusting the Color Balance sliders
manually.

5. Click the Done button at the bottom of the Color and Saturation panel.
The Adjust Tint panel disappears, and the program returns to the
normal display with the changes applied to your image.
Where to get Microsoft image editors
All three Digital Image programs are available in many retail software stores
and online outlets. You can also order the program direct from Microsoft.
For more information, go to www.microsoft.com/products/imaging.
Roxio PhotoSuite
Roxio PhotoSuite, another Windows-only program, is perhaps the best
known of the basic image editors. (Note: Roxio PhotoSuite was formerly
known as MGI PhotoSuite.) It’s inexpensive (less than $50) and easy to use.
At this writing, Roxio is selling PhotoSuite 7 for $29.95. I recommend spend-
ing a few dollars more for Easy Media Creator 8, which includes a later 
version of the program plus utilities for burning CDs and DVDs to boot.
PhotoSuite’s opening screen is uncluttered and features big, graphical icons
with lots of interactive feedback. This approach is in stark contrast to the
multiple toolbars and floating panels that fight for the user’s attention in
most of the first-tier and second-tier image editors.
Despite PhotoSuite’s apparent simplicity, it offers a reasonably good assort-
ment of image editing tools for this level of image editor. You’ll find basic 
versions of the standard selection, paint, clone, erase, and fill tools, plus
an effect brush and tools for drawing simple shapes (but not text). And, of
course, you can crop and rotate the image, remove scratches and red-eye,
and touch up the brightness and color balance, among other things.
PhotoSuite, shown in Figure 3-14, also includes tools to help you organize
and distribute your pictures. You can gather a set of pictures together into
an album and then share an individual picture or an entire album on the
Web, show them as a slide show, or send them via e-mail. You can even
install your pictures as wallpaper on your Windows desktop or display an
album of pictures as a screen saver.
What’s good about PhotoSuite
PhotoSuite’s strength is its ease of use. The uncluttered user interface keeps
the screen simple and clean. A permanent panel on the left side of the screen
contains either buttons that enable you to select a procedure or detailed
instructions that walk you through the procedure step-by-step.

Figure 3-14: Roxio PhotoSuite is great for image editing neophytes.
The built-in projects make it easy to create greeting cards, calendars, report
covers, and many other items that incorporate your pictures into the design.
This is a nice bonus that enables you to use your pictures in fun and interest-
ing ways without needing another program to do so.
What’s not so good about PhotoSuite
The almost stark simplicity of the user interface means that most of the
available tools and options are hidden from view at any given time. You often
have to drill down through several layers of options to reach a specific tool
or to apply an effect. The program’s constant hand-holding is helpful for
newcomers, but after you learn the ropes, you might find yourself getting
impatient and wishing that you could jump straight to the desired effect with
fewer intermediate prompts and clicks.
What you can do with PhotoSuite
Starting with one of PhotoSuite’s project templates, you can create a pretend
magazine cover containing a digital image from your collection. Just follow

5. Drag the thumbnail for your image from the Library panel and drop it
onto the template; then click Next.
PhotoSuite inserts the image into the template and automatically sizes it
to fit. If your image wasn’t already available in the Library panel on the
right side of the PhotoSuite window, you could have used the buttons in
the Magazine Covers panel on the left to open an image from your com-
puter, camera, or scanner.
6. Adjust the size and position of the image in the template (if needed)
and then click Finish.
Your project is done and ready to print.
Where to get PhotoSuite
Roxio PhotoSuite is available from most software retailers. You can also

Apple iPhoto
Although it has very limited editing capabilities, Macintosh owners will want
a copy of iPhoto, which started life free, migrated to become part of the iLife
suite, and now works smoothly and intuitively (if you’re running Mac OS X)
and does a lot more than just edit pictures. In fact, iPhoto’s strengths are in
importing pictures from your digital cameras, organizing and albuming your
photos into Photo Libraries, creating prints, and even sending pictures by
e-mail.
You can touch up photos by rotating, cropping, removing red-eye, convert-
ing to black-and-white or sepia, and performing a few other fine-tuning steps.
Apple finally added brightness and contrast controls, which had been lack-
ing in earlier versions, to iPhoto. Figure 3-15 shows an iPhoto album open

Deciding Whether You Need More 
Than One Image Editor
Sometimes one is just not enough.
Obviously, every image editing program doesn’t have the same feature set as
every other image editor. Some editing tasks, such as cropping a picture, are
common to all the editors, but many other features are available in some edi-
tors and not in others. Not even Photoshop includes every available image
editing feature.
If you evaluate your image editing needs thoroughly and inspect the fea-
tures of the available editors carefully, you might be able to find one editor
that has just the right mix of features to match your needs. If you’re fortu-
nate, you’ll find an editor that has all the features you need, and whatever
features are missing from that editor are in areas that you don’t care about. 
It could happen (especially if your image editing needs are modest), but
don’t count on it.
A much more likely scenario is that you find one editor that fulfills most of
your image editing needs. Then you need to find a second (or third) editor to
handle the editing tasks that your main editor just can’t manage.

Deciding Whether You Need More Than One Image Editor
518
You might also find that an image editor doesn’t perform all editing tasks
equally well. A specific editing task might be easier to perform in one editor
but more cumbersome in another. If your main editor is a little awkward to
use for some tasks that you do frequently, it might be worthwhile to keep
another editor around that can handle those tasks with aplomb.
The following list summarizes some common situations in which multiple
image editors are called for:
✦Artists: Artists who use Corel Painter for its ability to create images with
natural media effects often use another image editor (usually Photoshop)
to further manipulate those images and prepare them for publication
and other uses.
✦Web developers: Fireworks is a favorite of Web developers who build
pages in Macromedia Dreamweaver MX because of the close interaction
between those programs. Although Fireworks MX is great for optimizing
Web images and creating Web graphics, those users frequently turn to
another image editor to retouch photographic images.
✦Photoshop users: Serious Photoshop users often keep one or more
other image editors around to take advantage of a particular feature that
is available only in the other editor. Basically, the other editor serves as
an auxiliary utility program.
✦Digital photographers: Many digital photographers have Photoshop or
one of the higher-end, second-tier image editors for serious work but
find it easier to use one of the simpler programs to access images from
their camera and make quick adjustments and prints.
Instead of investing the big bucks in Photoshop, some digital photogra-
phers find that they can get all the features and capabilities they need

N
ow that you’ve gotten your image-editing feet
wet, I show you more of what you need to
know with two of the most popular image editing
programs, Adobe Photoshop CS2 and Adobe
Photoshop Elements. As I demonstrate, Photoshop
isn’t just for professionals anymore, and Elements
now has enough tools to appeal to dedicated pho-
tography enthusiasts. In the six chapters of this
minibook, I reveal the power of selections, the
best ways to brush away problems, techniques
for correcting faded or weird colors, and how to
achieve special looks using the Adobe editors’
built-in ﬁlters.
If you want to enhance your photos, I show you
how to “heal” photographic wounds, replace
unwanted content with other images, and adjust
light and shadows to give your pictures extra snap.

W
hen I wrote the first edition of this book, the state of the art in high-
end image editors was Adobe Photoshop 7. For powerful but easy-to-
use entry-level image editors, Photoshop Elements 2.0 was the way to go.
Within an impressively short period, however, both were replaced
(twice) with newer, better, and more powerful editions with
lots of extra features and improvements. For this book’s
third edition, the amazing advancements in digital cam-
eras in the past few months were only half the battle.
I also had to take into account the changes made for
Photoshop CS2 and Photoshop Elements 4.0. (Alas,
it’s also likely that new versions of each program
will be available during the life of this book.)
Some of the changes and improvements were
small, but some were fairly Earth-shaking. If you
were familiar with either of these image editors
before (or are still using the older versions), you’ll
want to review this chapter to see what’s new and dif-
ferent. You just might glean enough to prompt an upgrade
to the latest release — or, if you’re already working with
Photoshop CS2 or Elements 4.0, you might discover some changes
you didn’t even know about.
The Relationship between Photoshop 
and Photoshop Elements
As most Photoshopoholics know, Photoshop and Elements share many of
the same underpinnings and programming code. Indeed, in some respects,

What’s New in Photoshop CS2
522
Elements can be considered a version of Photoshop with some capabilities
missing or disabled. Their interfaces, dialog boxes, and many features are
virtually the same. They use the same filters and also have tool palettes that
are quite similar.
However, the differences are not quite simple enough to allow Elements to
qualify as a “watered down” version of Photoshop. Development on each of
these applications is ongoing and staggered, with releases scheduled at
roughly 18-month intervals.
The relationship between the two programs becomes even more complex
when you consider that Photoshop includes some features that will never
show up in Elements, and vice versa. Users of Elements probably don’t need
the ability to work with 16-bit channels or CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow,
black) files, and Photoshop workers wouldn’t deign to use some of the quick
fixes found in Elements. You can expect Photoshop and Elements to con-
tinue to converge and diverge, as appropriate, with features crossing from
one application to the other during their overlapping development cycles.
What’s New in Photoshop CS2
Photoshop CS2 has some new features that weren’t available in its predeces-
sors. Here’s a quick listing of the most important changes for photographers:
✦Bridge: The old Adobe File Browser has been revamped into a new
standalone product called Adobe Bridge, shown in Figure 1-1, which
works with all Adobe applications, including Photoshop, Illustrator,
InDesign, GoLive, and Acrobat.
✦Vanishing Point: This is a 3-D filter that lets you paint, add, or remove
objects while retaining their perspective.
✦Spot Healing Brush: This tool popped up in Elements 3.0 first, and it
was too good to withhold from Photoshop users. It speeds touching up
photos by eliminating the need to sample pixels to use as a cover-up; it
automatically samples the surrounding pixels as you click with it.
✦Red Eye Tool: The Red Eye Removal Tool from Elements was added to
Photoshop and renamed the Red Eye Tool. Just click red eyes and watch
the red vanish.
✦New Layers palette: The way the Layers Palette operates has been
changed, most significantly in the use of Shift-click and Ctrl/Ô-click
to choose multiple layers.
✦Box, Shape, and Surface Blur filters have been added.

✦Info palette: This palette now includes additional information, new set-
tings, and tips for using the current tool.
✦Lens Correction filter: This new filter, shown in Figure 1-2, fixes barrel
and pincushion distortion and corrects for other lens defects, such as
fringing.
✦Reduce Noise filter: Now you have a choice of reducing noise in your
camera, zapping the noise when converting RAW files, or using this new
filter in Photoshop.
✦Smart Sharpen filter: More sophisticated than the Unsharp Mask filter,
this new sharpening tool reduces the noise that inevitably results from
sharpening up your image.
What’s New in Elements 4.0
The biggest news about Photoshop Elements 4.0 is that it’s finally available
for the Macintosh. In a departure from its previous practice, Adobe upgraded
Windows users from Version 3.0 to 4.0 without introducing a similar enhanced
package for the Mac. Some months later, a version for the Macintosh became
available.

Mac owners shouldn’t have worried because there aren’t too many significant
new features in the latest version of Elements. Here are the key upgrades:
✦Magic Selection Brush: Just paint around the object you want to select,
and Elements tries to isolate the object as a selection for you.
✦Magic Extractor: This tool lets you paint around an object to select it
and remove it from its background.
✦Skin Tone Adjustment: Choose an area of skin in a photo, and Elements
uses that area’s characteristics to adjust the balance of the other colors
in an image.
✦Straighten tool: This tool is useful for aligning a crooked scan. Just draw
a line across the image to indicate a horizontal or vertical line, and
Elements will reorient the photo to match.
✦WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) font menu: Elements gets
Photoshop’s new font-display menu.
✦Red-Eye Removal on Import: Elements 4.0 can automatically remove
red-eye from your photos when you bring them into the program.

Chapter 2: Making Selections
In This Chapter
 Making rectangular and elliptical selections
 Selecting single-pixel columns and rows
 Creating freeform selections
 Making polygonal selections
 Selecting image content based on colors in the image
A
wag once noted that “Time is what keeps everything from happening
at once.” In a similar vein, selections are what let you modify only part
of an image without your changes slopping over into parts of a picture that
you don’t want to manipulate. Selections let you fine-tune your photos a
little at a time, making it easier to get the effects that you want.
Creating selections of the parts of the image that you intend
to modify is the key to successful image manipulation.
Indeed, the first step in many editing procedures is to
focus the software’s attention on the stuff you want
to edit — an area that needs to be lighter, darker, a
different color, or removed altogether. For this pur-
pose, Photoshop and Photoshop Elements both
offer a series of specialized tools that let you
select geometric shapes, rows and columns of
pixels, freeform shapes, and polygons. You can
also find tools for making selections based on
colors and pixel comparisons. The selection tool
that you choose is based on the kind of area you want
to select and the nature of the image itself. There are no
hard and fast rules for when to use a particular tool over
another; experience and experimentation show you which
ones work best for different situations.
Making Simple Selections with the Marquee Tools
Photoshop has four tools that all go by the moniker Marquee: the
Rectangular Marquee tool (for rectangles and squares), the Elliptical

Making Simple Selections with the Marquee Tools
526
Marquee tool (for ovals and circles), the Single
Row Marquee tool (to choose only one line of
pixels), and the Single Column Marquee tool
(to select a column that’s one pixel wide).
The Marquee tools in Photoshop and Photoshop
Elements are very simple to use. For example,
you can drag the Rectangular or Elliptical
Marquee tool to select a rectangle or oval. Hold
down the Shift key to select perfect squares and
circles. Photoshop’s Marquee tools are shown in
Figure 2-1. You can select the Marquee tools by
clicking them in the Tool palette or by pressing
Shift+M repeatedly until the Marquee tool that
you want is highlighted in the Tool palette.
Photoshop Elements offers the same two basic
shape selection tools as Photoshop — the
Rectangular and Elliptical Marquees — but does
not offer the Single Row or Single Column options.
Figure 2-2 shows a rectangular selection in
progress in Photoshop Elements.
Selecting geometric shapes
When you’re ready to make your geometric selection, the procedure is quite
simple. It requires only that you first select the layer that contains the area
you want to edit. Then, you’re ready to make the selection by following these
steps:
1. Click the Marquee selection tool in the Tool palette and choose the
shape (Rectangular or Oval) that you want to use.
2. Move your mouse onto the image and click where you want the selec-
tion to begin.
3. Drag away from the starting point until the marquee outlines the
selection you want to make.
If you want a perfect square or circle, press and hold the Shift key while
you drag; release the mouse and then the Shift key when the selection is
complete.
When you use the Shift key to make a perfectly square or circular selection
(equal in width and height), be sure to release the mouse before releasing
the Shift key when your selection is complete. If you release the key first, 
the selection will snap to the size and shape it would have been had you not
used the Shift key at all.

you want to select and then
drag to make the selection.

Figure 2-2: Click and drag diagonally to make the selection.
Both the Rectangular and Elliptical Marquee tools allow you to choose 
from different Style settings. Your choices are Normal, Fixed Aspect Ratio
(Constrained Aspect Ratio on the Mac), and Fixed Size. If you choose either
of the latter two, additional options appear on the tool’s Options bar, through
which you can enter the ratio or dimensions, respectively. If you use the
Normal style, these options are dimmed.
Selecting single-pixel rows and columns
Photoshop’s Single Row Marquee and Single Column Marquee tools allow
you to select a row or column that’s one pixel wide simply by clicking the
image to make the selection.
After you make the selection, you can delete it, paint it, fill it, cut it, or copy
it. You can use these Marquee tools to draw grids on the image, as shown in
Figure 2-3, by filling selections with a solid color. These tools are also useful
for creating a perfectly straight line anywhere on the image, going either up
and down or left to right. If you want a soft edge to the selection, you can
use the Options bar to set a Feather (fading) amount in excess of the default
0 pixels.

528
Figure 2-3: Use the single-pixel Marquees to draw grids on 
your image.
Adding to, reducing, and combining selections
The Marquee tools’ Options bar (the Photoshop version is shown in Figure 2-4)
offers four icons that you can click to customize your selections. You can find
these same tools, with the same powers, in the Options bars for the Lasso and
the Magic Wand tools, as well. The buttons are descriptively named, and it’s
quite clear what they do:
✦New Selection: Creates an entirely new selection
✦Add to Selection: Adds more area to an existing selection
✦Subtract from Selection: Removes part of a selection
✦Intersect with Selection: Creates a selection from only the overlapping
area of two selections
Each button represents a selection mode and controls whether you can add
to, take away from, or create a new selection based on the overlapping areas
within two concurrent selections. If you’re in New Selection mode, each time
you click and drag the mouse, a new Marquee selection is created, replacing
any other selections currently in place. If you switch to Add to Selection
mode, you can select noncontiguous areas on the image, or you can make
your current selection larger. Figure 2-5 shows both a set of noncontiguous
selections (lower right), and a selection that was created by selecting three
overlapping rectangles (upper left).

to extend a selection.
The Subtract from Selection mode lets you cut away from an existing selec-
tion or deselect noncontiguous parts of an initial selection. For Figure 2-6,
I originally created a rectangular selection that went all around the tower; I
tightened the selection by subtracting rectangular sections from the lower
half of the original selection.

Using the Intersect with Selection mode allows you to create new selection
shapes, such as the semicircular selection shown on the far right of Figure 2-7.
This semicircle selection was formed from the overlapping areas of a circle
and a rectangle. You can also move from one mode to another as you build or
tear down selections.

Snagging Irregular Shapes with the Lasso Tools
531
Snagging Irregular Shapes with the Lasso Tools
The Lasso tool, available in both Photoshop and Photoshop Elements, is a
freehand selection tool. You can use the regular Lasso tool to draw freeform
shapes that become selections, or use the Polygonal Lasso tool to select
polygons by dragging around an object with straight lines. 
You can also select by drawing with the Magnetic Lasso tool. In this case, you
guide the cursor around an object, and the software selects pixels by compar-
ing them with adjoining pixels and then chooses the ones that are different
on the basis of color and light. In all its incarnations, the Lasso is a pretty
powerful selection tool — probably the one I use most when retouching
photos. A Lasso tool selection is shown in Figure 2-8.
Figure 2-8: The Lasso can select irregularly shaped objects.
Selecting freeform shapes
The main Lasso tool is extremely easy to use. Just click and drag, drawing a
loop around the section of your image you want to select.

Snagging Irregular Shapes with the Lasso Tools
532
The other important thing to remember is to close your selection by coming
back to the starting point. This prevents the software from guessing how
you’d like the shape to finish, which usually results in some of the intended
selection (the tiger’s head) being omitted, as shown in Figure 2-9. If you don’t
close the shape, Photoshop and Elements do it for you by connecting the
start and end points with a straight line.
Figure 2-9: Don’t let Photoshop or Elements close the selection for you.
The Lasso Options bar offers a Feather setting, which allows you to add a
number of fuzzy pixels to the selection’s edges. This gives any fills applied 
to the selection a softer edge. Obviously, the higher the Feather setting, the
softer the edge. A higher Feather setting also extends your fill or other edits,
such as filter effects, farther beyond the actual selection.
You might remember from geometry class that a polygon is any shape made
up of three or more straight sides. Triangles are polygons, as are squares,
rectangles, and octagons. The Marquee tool takes care of rectangles and
squares, but what if you want to select a triangular shape, or a shape that
looks like a big sunburst, or an irregular shape? You use the Polygonal Lasso
tool, shown in Figure 2-10. From simple shapes to complex, many-sided stars,
the Polygonal Lasso tool gives you freeform selections with the precision of
straight sides and sharp corners.

Chapter 2
Making Selections
Snagging Irregular Shapes with the Lasso Tools
533
Figure 2-10: Using the Polygonal Lasso tool.
The tool works easily enough, and you can make it select just about any size
or shape on your image by following these steps:
1. Make sure that the layer you want to edit is the active layer; use the
Layers palette to choose the layer.
2. Click the Polygonal Lasso tool in the Tool palette to activate it.
3. Click the point in your image where you want to begin making the
selection.
4. Click the point where you want to create the first corner.
This creates the first side, and you can now draw the next side.
Don’t drag the mouse; just click where you want the corners to appear.
5. Continue clicking until you’ve drawn all the sides that your selection
needs.
6. Come back to the starting point and click (double-click if you’re using
a Mac) to close the shape and create the selection.
You can make your sides as small as you want (just a few pixels long) or as
long as you want. You can select the edges of complex shapes by drawing
many short sides. You might find this handy when there isn’t enough color
difference between pixels to use the Magnetic Lasso tool effectively.

534
Selecting magnetically
If you want to select a particular object, and that object is a different color or
shade than the objects touching it, use the Magnetic Lasso tool to select it.
The Magnetic Lasso tool works by following the edges of content in your
image, comparing pixels while you drag your mouse, and automatically snap-
ping to the edges where pixel values vary enough, based on your settings 
for the tool’s options. Use the Magnetic Lasso’s Options bar to control the
Magnetic Lasso tool’s sensitivity, detail, and the number of pixels it compares
while you move along your desired path. Pen Pressure (or Stylus Pressure
in some versions of Photoshop) might be dimmed unless you are using an
accessory drawing device.
Before using the Magnetic Lasso tool, you can adjust the following settings in
the Options bar:
✦Width: Sets how far from the mouse path (as you drag) the pixel com-
parisons will be made.
✦Edge Contrast: Set the sensitivity anywhere from 1% to 100%. The higher
the percentage you set, the higher the contrast must be between com-
pared pixels before the Magnetic Lasso tool snaps to pixels to build the
selection.
✦Frequency: Changes the number of fastening points (or nodes) that you
see along the line, as shown in Figure 2-11.
Figure 2-11: The more fastening points you specify, the closer the selection 
will adhere to the object you’re selecting.

The Magic Wand Tool’s Digital Prestidigitation
535
To use the Magnetic Lasso tool, you follow a procedure that’s similar to 
the one you use for the Lasso and the Polygonal Lasso tools, with minor 
variations:
1. Make sure that the right layer is selected so that your selection applies
to the right content.
2. Click the Magnetic Lasso tool in the Tool palette to select it.
3. Make any necessary changes to the tool’s settings so that it will work
to the best of its ability within the photo at hand.
You can adjust the width of the Magnetic Lasso tool’s attraction, how
many points it lays down, and the amount of contrast that must be pres-
ent for the attraction to take hold. The default values work best in most
situations.
4. Click the image to begin your selection.
5. Move the cursor and click along the edge of the desired object.
A click redirects the line whenever it begins to veer off the path you’d
like it to follow.
6. When your moving and clicking takes you back to the starting point,
click (or double-click) the starting point to finish the selection.
Clicking to redirect the Magnetic Lasso’s path is especially helpful if you get
to a section of the photo where there isn’t very much difference between the
color and brightness of the pixels and the object you’re trying to select.
Sometimes, the Edge Contrast setting won’t help you, and you have to redirect
the selection yourself or use the other Lasso tools to augment or reduce the
selection after using the Magnetic Lasso tool to make the main selection.
Has your Magnetic Lasso gone crazy, and you can’t bring it back into line by
clicking and moving? Press the Esc (Escape) key to abandon the current
selection and start over.
The Magic Wand Tool’s Digital Prestidigitation
The Magic Wand tool selects based on color. If you want to select all the flesh
tones on a face or all the green leaves on a tree, you need only turn on this
tool and click somewhere on the face or on a particular leaf, and the rest of
the face or tree that matches the brightness level and color of that original
pixel is selected. You can adjust how the tool works by increasing or
decreasing the Tolerance level required for a match, which increases or
decreases the number of pixels that are selected when you click the mouse
in the image. The higher the Tolerance level you set, the wider the range of
pixels included in the selection.

The Magic Wand Tool’s Digital Prestidigitation
536
Making and adjusting selections based on color
You can augment your selection (without changing selection modes) by
holding down the Shift key while you click the image. For example, as shown
in Figure 2-12, more of the picture is selected by Shift-clicking a slightly dif-
ferent shade of the color originally selected with the first click of the Magic
Wand tool.
Figure 2-12: Keep Shift-clicking to select more of the image.
To reduce the amount of the image that’s selected, press the Alt key (Option
if you’re on a Mac) and click an area that’s selected. The pixels in that area
are removed from the selection, and you can continue adding to the selection
elsewhere or simply perform whatever edit you’d planned for the color-based
selection.
Controlling the magic
To increase or decrease the threshold for the tool’s selections, adjust the
Tolerance setting on the Options bar (as shown in Figure 2-13). The higher
the Tolerance you set, the more pixels that Photoshop or Photoshop
Elements sees as a close match of the original pixel that you clicked. If you
set the Tolerance to a very low number (15 or less), you’ll find that very few
pixels meet the selection criteria.

Book VI
Chapter 2
Making Selections
Specialized Selection Tools
537
Figure 2-13: Setting the Tolerance level.
Another setting that’s useful for controlling the Magic Wand tool’s selection
is the Contiguous option. This option, when selected, limits the selection to
those pixels touching the original pixel you clicked and to the pixels contigu-
ous with those pixels, and so on. If you want to select pixels that aren’t
touching the original pixel and the first batch that was selected, clear this
option or use the Shift key and click elsewhere in the image.
Specialized Selection Tools
Both Photoshop and Photoshop Elements offer tools that go beyond the
normal selection tools that you find in just about any image editing applica-
tion. By giving you the ability to paint your selections with a familiar tool —
the Brush tool — you can make very fine or very large selections quickly and
easily.
In addition, both applications offer a Select menu, which you can use to con-
trol the existing selection, no matter which selection tool you used to make it.
Working with the Selection Brush tool
Photoshop Elements offers a selection tool that isn’t found in Photoshop —
and it’s one that might make you choose Elements at times, even if you have
Photoshop, too. The Selection Brush tool (see Figure 2-14, which shows the
active tool and its Options bar) allows you to select a snaking, freeform line
by dragging your mouse in any design you desire.
You can set the size and style of the brush, and you can also set the brush to
Selection or Mask mode:
✦Selection mode simply creates a freeform, snaking selection that follows
the path of your mouse while you drag. You can paint over and over in
an area to select a shape rather than a snaking line, or you can use a
very big brush to select a large area with a single stroke. 
✦Mask mode places a light red wash over the whole image except for the
places where you dragged the Selection Brush tool. If you made no selec-
tion prior to entering Mask mode, your strokes with the Selection Brush
tool create the masked areas. Masked areas are excluded from your
selection. If you revert to Selection mode, your masked areas are not
affected by any subsequent editing in the form of painting, filling, delet-
ing, cutting, copying, or pasting.

Specialized Selection Tools
538
Figure 2-14: Photoshop Elements has a Selection Brush tool.
Selecting in Quick Mask mode
Much like Element’s Selection Brush in Mask mode, Photoshop allows you 
to place your image in Quick Mask mode and then use the Brush, Pencil, and
Fill tools to make a selection or to paint the area that you don’t want selected
(whichever is easier for you). To enter Quick Mask mode, click the Quick
Mask button in the tool palette and then begin painting or drawing the out-
line of the area to be masked, as shown in Figure 2-15. If you want to fill a
shape and make that a mask, use the Fill tool to mask the area inside the 
outline.
If you want to paint the area that is not selected instead, double-click the
Quick Mask icon on the Tool palette before entering Quick Mask mode and
choose Color Indicates Mask Area (instead of Color Indicates Selected Area)
in the dialog box that pops up. When you return to standard editing mode,
your mask becomes a selection that excludes the areas you painted, drew,
and/or filled. If you want them to become the selected areas, choose Select➪
Inverse from the main menu.

Not sure when you’d use Quick Mask

small or fine that you can’t make it
with anything but the Brush or Pencil
tool set to 1 pixel. Or if you simply feel
more comfortable with the painting
and drawing tools, you might do better
making your selection by using familiar
features.
Using the Select Menu
You use the Select menu to control and
manipulate your existing selections, to
create selections, and to deselect areas
that are currently selected. In Figure
2-16, which shows Photoshop Element’s
Select menu, many of the menu com-
mands also have keyboard shortcuts.

Figure 2-16: The Select menu lets you
modify, load and save selections.

Using the Select Menu
540
One of the most convenient commands on the Select menu is the Inverse
command, which you can use to turn a mask into a selection or a selection
into a mask. If you selected an area with one of the selection tools, you can
invert that selection so that everything but that area is selected and
editable. Conversely, if you use Quick Mask mode (Photoshop) or the
Selection Brush in Mask mode (Photoshop Elements) to make a mask, you
can invert that mask so that the previously masked and uneditable area
becomes the selected, editable area.
Another very useful command on
Photoshop’s version of the Select menu
is the Transform Selection command.
With it, you can reshape an existing
selection, as shown in Figure 2-17. Here,
I start with a rectangular selection, 
created with the Rectangular Marquee
tool, and I reshape the box by dragging
the box handles that appear on the
perimeter of the selection when I issue
the Transform Selection command.
While transforming your shape, you
can rotate it (point to the corner 
handles; when your mouse turns to a
bent arrow, drag clockwise or counter-
clockwise) and make the shape wider,
narrower, taller, or shorter. You can
also resize it from the corner handles
to make it bigger or smaller while retaining the current width-height ratio.
The Transform Selection command also invokes a new set of options on 
the Options bar. You can enter a degree of rotation, new width and height
dimensions, and new position (x and y) coordinates.
When you finish making your selection transformations, press Enter to for-
mally apply them. If you want to skip the transformations in progress and
return to the selection as it was, press the Esc (Escape) key.

selections in size, shape, or rotation.

O
bviously, Photoshop and Photoshop Elements’ painting tools have
many uses when it comes to creating original artwork. You can paint
pictures from scratch, starting with a white or transparent background, 
and paint or draw anything from the realistic to the abstract. These 
original works of art can end up in print, on the Web, or both.
Because this is a book about working with digital images,
however, I focus on using these tools for retouching and
editing photographs.
Photoshop and Photoshop Elements’
Painting and Drawing Tools
The two applications’ painting and drawing tools
are basically the same, but you can find a few in
Photoshop that you won’t find in Elements, and
vice versa. Table 3-1 lists all the painting and draw-
ing tools, identifying which of the two applications
contains them.
You can find more tools for customizing your brushes in Photoshop
than in Elements, and more third-party brushes have been created for
Photoshop and are available online. You won’t feel terribly limited or bored
by Elements’ brush customization tools, however, and the core settings for
size, shape, color, and so on are in both applications.
This chapter concentrates on use of the Brush and the Pencil tools. The
History Brush tool (which restores parts of an image from a saved version)

Working with Brushes and Pencils

and the Art History Brush tool (which does the same thing but adds a brush
stroke effect) are beyond the scope of this book. You can find an entire 
chapter on using these two tools and related implements in Photoshop CS2
All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies, by Barbara Obermeier (Wiley). You
can find more about the Impressionist Brush tool (which paints using artsy
brush strokes) in Photoshop Elements 4 For Dummies, by Barbara Obermeier
and Ted Padova (Wiley).

However, all the controls for setting the size, fuzziness, and other parame-
ters of the Brush tool do apply to other brush-like tools, such as the Art
History Brush tool, the Blur/Sharpen tools, the Toning tools (Dodge/Burn/
Sponge), and the Clone Stamp. Thus, what you read in this chapter can be
applied to those tools as well.
Some people consider the Smudge tool as a painting tool because it can be
set to apply the foreground color if you put it in Finger Painting mode and
also because it does manipulate colors in the same way a brush or your 
fingertip would if you were working with real paints or pastels. On the other
hand, I think it’s more of a retouching and special effects tool. I show you the
basics of the Smudge tool in Book VI, Chapter 4.
Working with Brushes and Pencils
Photoshop’s and Photoshop Elements’ brushes and pencils are easy to use
and customize and can apply a wide variety of colors, textures, and special
effects. Painting and drawing with Photoshop or Elements mostly requires a
steady hand and the proper view so that you’re zoomed in close enough to
see what you’re doing. Figure 3-1 shows an extremely magnified view of a
portion of an image, with the Brush tool at work filling in some rough spots
in an old photo.

Figure 3-1: You can paint out scratches, stains, or dust spots if 
you zoom in tight enough.
You can also paint larger areas, filling in space lost to a tear or to add a col-
ored frame around an image. You can even create new content: Just paint
lines or shapes or simply apply a wash of color to a black-and-white or faded
color photo for an interesting effect. Whatever your painting or drawing
goal, these two applications offer the right tools for the job.
Painting with the Brush tool
The Brush tool, found in both Photoshop and Photoshop Elements, can
paint tiny dots, short strokes, or longer lines as small as a single pixel in
width or as large as several hundred pixels. Using the tool is easy. Just click
it on the Tool palette (or press B on the keyboard) to activate it, and drag or
click (or both) on the image. You want to make sure that you’re painting on
the appropriate layer first, of course.
If you want to control how the brush applies paint, you can change the fol-
lowing settings before you start painting:
✦Color: The color or tone painted by the brush
✦Size: The size of the brush. Note that in Elements 4.0, you can set the
size directly from a slider in the Options bar.
✦Mode: How the pixels painted by the brush blend with existing pixels
✦Opacity: The transparency of the pixels

Working with Brushes and Pencils
544
✦Flow: How quickly the pixels are applied while you stroke
✦Airbrush: Changes any brush tool to a fuzzy airbrush effect
With the exception of color, you can adjust all these settings from the tool’s
Options bar, shown in Figure 3-2. If you’re using Photoshop, you can tinker
with several more settings (and a few more for Elements users, too), but I get
to those in the upcoming section, “Customizing Your Brushes and Pencils.”
The settings listed here are those that you’d want to adjust whenever you’re
painting. More elaborate changes would be needed in fewer, more specific
cases.
Figure 3-2: The Brush Options bars for Elements 4.0 (top) and Photoshop CS2 (bottom).
One setting — Color — can’t be set from the Options bar but can be set
through the Color Picker. You open the Color Picker by clicking the toolbar’s
Set Foreground Color button, shown at left in Figure 3-3. From within the Color
Picker (shown at right in Figure 3-3), you can choose a color in three ways:
✦By eye: Click in an area that contains the color you want to choose.
✦By setting color levels: Type values in the H, S, and B (hue, saturation,
and brightness) or the R, G, and B (red, green, blue) boxes.
Figure 3-3: Click the Foreground Color button (bottom left) to access 
the Color Picker (right).

✦By using a hexadecimal number: Enter this number in the # field to
create colors in the language of your Web browser.
Select the Only Web Colors check box if you want the Color Picker to
show only the 240 colors considered completely Web-safe. (With virtually
all users having monitors that can show more than 256 colors, “Web-safe”
colors are not the concern they once were.)
If you want to paint with a color currently in use elsewhere in the image or in
another open image, click the toolbar’s Eye Dropper tool and sample (click)
the color that you want to use. This makes that color the new foreground
color.
Working with the Pencil tool
The Pencil tool is also found in both applications and works much like the
Brush tool. The only real difference is the nature of the line drawn. Just like
you’d expect a paintbrush to apply a relatively soft line, you’d expect a
pencil to draw a sharper line, depending on the hardness of the lead. The
Pencil tool works just as you’d expect and also offers its own set of adjust-
ments through the Options bar in Elements, as shown in Figure 3-4. (The
Photoshop CS2 version is similar.) From the Options bar, you can control the
Pencil’s size and density so that you can make whatever large or small edits
are required.
Figure 3-4: The Pencil Options bar in Elements 4.0.
Use the Pencil tool’s settings to control the size, mode, and opacity of the
line you draw. You can also choose from a smaller set of styles, most of
which are solid, fine lines. The Options bar also has an Auto Erase option,
which allows you to draw the background color over any pixels currently
colored in the foreground color as well as apply the foreground color only
where no color is currently applied. Auto Erase is sort of a confusing name
because no real erasing occurs — but you get the idea.
Customizing Your Brushes and Pencils
Beyond the basic adjustments that you can make with the Brush and the
Pencil tools’ Options bars, you can work with an additional set of options
in Photoshop Elements (see Figure 3-5) or with a set of Brush Presets
(shown in the Photoshop interface in Figure 3-6).

Customizing Your Brushes and Pencils
546
The Photoshop CS2 Brushes palette consists of 
11 different options, each of which has its own
dialog box. To view each of the 11 sets of options,
make sure Expanded View is selected in the Brush
Palette’s fly-out menu (that right-pointing triangle
at the upper right of the palette). Then, selecting
any of the 11 sets of options causes that option’s
dialog box to appear. Make the changes you want
in each option’s dialog box. You can activate or
deactivate any particular option by marking the
check box to the left of the option name. Figure 3-7
shows the settings for the Texture option.
Refer to the preview area at the foot of the
Brushes palette to see how your new settings
affect the brush size and shape that you select.
The sample stroke provided shows you what
effect the brush will have when you apply it to your photo.
If your Brushes palette is missing, simply choose Window➪Brushes from the
main menu to bring it back. You can also place it on the docking well (next 
to the File Browser) or drag it to the workspace to move it freely like the rest
of the palettes.

Choosing the right size and shape
Whether you’re working in Photoshop or Elements, the success of your
brush with a given image depends on setting the right size and shape for it.
Photoshop Elements brush settings
Photoshop Elements offers a list of Brush Presets in the form of a drop-down
list, as shown in Figure 3-8, accompanied by a separate Size setting and the
More Options button.
Figure 3-8: Photoshop Elements’ Brush presets provide an extensive set of styles and shapes.
To change the shape of your brush in Photoshop
Elements, follow these steps:
1. Click the Brush tool on the Tool palette to
activate it.
2. From the Options bar, set the style and
size of the brush by using the drop-down
list and slider, respectively.
3. Click the brush next to More Options on
the Options bar.
4. In the resulting dialog box, adjust the
angle by entering a number for the angle
you want to use or by dragging the arrow
clockwise or counterclockwise, as shown
in Figure 3-9.
Figure 3-9: Drag the brush
schematic’s arrow to change the
angle of the brush tip.

Customizing Your Brushes and Pencils
548
You might find that a specific angle is more
desirable for painting the kind of strokes
you want, and you can use this setting to
set that angle.
5. Adjust the Roundness setting the same
way — by entering a number or by drag-
ging the big black dots closer to or farther
away from the center of the sample brush
shape, as shown in Figure 3-10.
Dragging inward makes for a horizontally
flatter brush; dragging outward makes the
brush vertically flatter.
6. Tinker, as desired, with other sliders —
Spacing, Hue Jitter, Hardness, and Scatter.
7. Click your image to begin painting or
click somewhere on the workspace to
close the More Options box.
Photoshop brush settings
If you’re using Photoshop, you can
change your brush shape by using the
Brush Tip Shape option of the Brushes
palette, as shown in Figure 3-11. The
resulting settings look very much like
Elements’ settings. You can drag a
brush tip schematic to change the
angle and roundness of the tip, and
you can also adjust the size (diameter)
of the tip itself.
Here’s a quick summary of all the
customization changes you can make
to Photoshop’s brushes:
✦Brush tip shape: Here, you can
select the size and shape of the
brush tip, including its diameter,
angle, roundness, hardness, and
spacing.
✦Shape dynamics: Make your
brush strokes appear to be more
natural and less machine-like
(especially if you’re using a digital tablet) with these adjustments. They
modify the degree of randomness or variation produced when a stroke is
drawn, including the amount of fade, size, jitter angle, roundness, and
Figure 3-10: Make a soft, round,
fat brush or a lean, mean, flat
brush.

other options. The higher the value, the greater the amount of variance
produced for each option. Note that some of these options apply only
when you are using a pressure-sensitive digital tablet.
✦Scattering: Use this control to vary the amount and position of individ-
ual brush marks in a stroke. The higher the value, the larger the number
of brush marks and the farther apart they are. When Both Axes is
selected, the brush marks are distributed radially, as if on a curve. The
Count controls the number of brush marks at each spacing point. The
higher the value, the greater the number of marks.
✦Texture: The Texture control lets you add a preset or custom pattern to
a brush stroke. It includes these options:
• Invert: Mark the Invert check box to reverse the light and dark pixels
in the pattern.
• Scale: The Scale control adjusts the size of the pattern in each stroke.
• Texture Each Tip: Texture Each Tip applies each tip as it is stroked,
giving a more saturated effect.
• Depth: The Depth control sets how prominently the pattern appears
against the brush stroke.
• Minimum Depth: Minimum Depth specifies the minimum depth that
the paint of each stroke shows through the pattern.
• Mode: Mode lets you choose one of Photoshop’s blending modes.
✦Dual Brush: Yes! You can have a brush with two tips. The second tip can
have attributes of its own, which you can set here. You can also specify a
blending mode between the two tips so that the strokes they draw merge
together in a predetermined way.
✦Color Dynamics: You can also create a multicolored brush with this
control. It uses your foreground and background colors to generate
variations that give the stroke a more natural, organic look. You can
introduce jitter to the hue, saturation, brightness, and purity of the
colors as well as some randomness between the foreground and back-
ground colors as a stroke is drawn.
✦Other Dynamics: These controls add some natural-looking randomness
to the opacity and flow factors of a brush, again making the brush stroke
look more natural and less machine-like.
Here are some tip characteristics that you can modify:
✦Noise: This adds random pixels to your brush tips, giving them texture,
which works especially well with feathered brushes that fade out at the
edges.
✦Wet Edges: This option creates a stroke that looks like watercolor, with
color that builds up along the edges.

Customizing Your Brushes and Pencils
550
✦Airbrush: This option gives the brush tip a fuzzy, airbrushed look.
✦Smoothing: Use this control to help smooth out curves when drawing
arcs with the brush, which is especially helpful with a pressure-sensitive
tablet.
✦Protect Texture: If you want all your textured brush tips to use a uniform
texture, apply this option.
Obtaining third-party
brush sets
The brush sets that come with
Photoshop and Photoshop Elements
are fairly extensive (see Photoshop’s
in the Brush drop-down list options
menu, shown in Figure 3-12), but you
might pine for more of them.
A quick online search will net you
several sites where third-party
brush sets are available, usually for
a small fee. Some sites probably
offer brushes for free, but these are
not in abundance. One site to check
out is www.graphicxtras.com/
products/psbrush.htm. This 
particular site is chock-full of 
interesting new brushes, which you
can order for about $30 (U.S.). The
site, which is based out of Great
Britain, charges in pounds sterling,
so the day’s exchange rate dictates
what you pay.
Figure 3-12: Lots of brushes come with
Photoshop CS2, but you might want more,
more, more!

Chapter 4: Restoring Images
In This Chapter
 Shedding light and casting shadows
 Blending and bringing focus to your images
 Healing wounded photos
A
dobe’s image editing applications do a great job of fixing problem
images. Some of the most common problems that you’ll encounter
with your photos (both old and new) relate to lighting, clarity, detail, and
damage caused by poor storage methods. Even a vintage black-and-white
or sepia photo, if properly stored, won’t show unacceptable signs of age.
Any photo, however, that is tossed in a drawer or put in a frame and
exposed to direct sunlight for years will start to look a bit shabby and will
probably lose much of its detail and depth. 
A color photo will lose some color due to fading. It might
also have scratches and scuffs, as shown in Figure 4-1,
which displays a photo with several problems that
require Photoshop’s or Elements’ restorative tools.
I show you how to repair this photo in this chapter.
Because digital images saved on a hard drive or
removable media don’t suffer from the same 
ailments as photographic prints, negatives, and
slides, your restoration work will invariably
involve scanned versions of these originals. This
chapter focuses primarily on repairing scratches,
stains, dust, and lightness/darkness problems in old
monochrome images, but the techniques apply equally
well to color photos with the same problems. It’s just a
little easier to concentrate on lightening, darkening, and
repairing photos when color isn’t a major concern. I show you how
to work with color photo restorations in Book VI, Chapter 5.

Adding Light and Shadows
552
Figure 4-1: You can paint out scratches, stains, or dust spots if 
you zoom in tight enough.
Adding Light and Shadows
Whether because of fading with time or from poor original photographic tech-
nique, many of your photos might need more light or more shadows — or
more of both — in different areas of the same photo. What to do? Photoshop
and Photoshop Elements’ Dodge and Burn tools rush to the rescue!
Using the Dodge tool to lighten tones
The Dodge tool lightens portions of your image. The process is simple:
1. Click the Dodge tool in the Tool palette to activate it.
You might need to switch to the Dodge tool if the Burn or Sponge tool is
currently displayed on that button in the Tool palette. Hold down the
Shift key and press O until the tool that you want is active.
Multiple tools that are nested under a single icon are indicated by a 
triangle in the lower-right corner of the icon on the Tool palette.
2. Check out the Options bar, shown in Figure 4-2, and decide whether
you need to make changes to the range of tones that will be affected
or to the exposure (degree of intensity) that the tool will apply.
The Range drop-down menu determines which tones the Dodge tool
affects: Shadows (the dark areas), Highlights (the light areas), or Midtones
(everything in between). Most of the time, you want to stick to Midtones,

Book VI
Chapter 4
Restoring Images
Adding Light and Shadows
553
but if you want to open up some inky shadows or darken areas that are a
little washed out, you can do that, too.
The Exposure menu determines how rapidly the lightening process
occurs. Avoid lightening too much, too quickly. A value between 15 and
35 percent enables you to lighten slowly. You can always return to an
area and lighten it some more if you haven’t applied enough dodging.
Figure 4-2: The Dodge tool’s Options bar in Elements; Photoshop’s Options bar is similar.
3. Using the Options bar, set the size of the brush that you’ll use to apply
the light.
You can choose the kind of brush you use just as you would the ordinary
Brush tool. Both use the exact same Brush palette. You can find more on
setting brush sizes in Book VI, Chapter 3.
4. Drag over the area to be lightened or click a single spot, such as a face
or some other distinct area that’s suffering from too much shadow.
Figure 4-3 shows the woman’s face before and after dodging.
Figure 4-3: Use the Dodge tool to lighten shadows in faces.

Adding Light and Shadows
554
If your image isn’t very crisp or detailed and you have no desire to make it
that way, use one of the textured brush settings for the Dodge tool. This can
apply light in a dappled or mottled way, matching the image’s overall look —
perhaps a desirable one, in the case of vintage photos.
Burning your image to darken areas
The opposite of the Dodge tool, the Burn tool darkens areas. This can bring
out facial features lost to a sunny day or faded details in clothing or a garden,
or it can add depth lost to a photo that has faded with time or exposure to
sunlight.
To use the Burn tool in either Photoshop or Elements, follow these simple
steps:
1. Click the Burn tool in the Tool palette to activate it.
The Burn tool might be hidden under the Sponge or Dodge tool; they all
share the same position on the toolbox. Hold down the Shift key and
press O until the Burn tool is active.
2. Check the Options bar (as shown in Figure 4-4) for any adjustments
you’d like to make.
You can adjust the range and exposure, which respectively control
which elements of the image (Shadows, Midtones, or Highlights) are
affected by the Burning process and how quickly the darkening process
takes place.
Figure 4-4: The Burn tool’s Options bar.
3. Choose a Brush size in the Brush palette.
4. Begin darkening your image by dragging over the areas to be made
more shadowy or by clicking a single spot.
Figure 4-5 shows a face being darkened by a single click with a brush
that’s set to the same diameter as the face.
Don’t go too far with the Burn tool. If your image is in color, excessive use of
the tool creates a brownish, singed look that makes the image appear literally
burned. If your image is in black-and-white or grayscale, this won’t happen;
the worst that can occur is that your burned areas look so dark that details
are obliterated.

Using Smudging, Sharpening, and Blurring Tools
555
Figure 4-5: Paint with the Burn tool to darken an area.
Using Smudging, Sharpening, and Blurring Tools
When it comes to retouching photos with
Photoshop and Photoshop Elements, you’ll proba-
bly use the Sharpen and Blur tools quite frequently.
These tools are good for heightening or diffusing
details in some of an image, an entire image, or
along the edges of content that’s been pasted into
the picture from elsewhere. The Smudge tool is also
a powerful ally, but you might find that good mouse
skills are required before you can make really suc-
cessful use of it. Figure 4-6 shows these three tools
in Photoshop Elements. As in Photoshop, the tools
share one button, and you must switch between
them by holding down the Shift key and pressing R
until the icon for the tool that you want appears.
This isn’t an operational hardship, but it makes
identifying them in one image here rather difficult!
Although the Sharpen tool’s name clearly indi-
cates what it does, the Blur and Smudge tool
names might lead you to believe that the tools
essentially do the same thing. In reality, however, the Blur tool is a more
finely grained tool than the Smudge tool is in terms of its results. Whether
applied to a small area or painted over a large field, the Blur tool’s effects are
uniform: It makes the affected area fuzzy and less distinct. (Technically
speaking, the Blur tool reduces the contrast between the pixels, and our eyes
Figure 4-6: The Blur, Sharpen,
and Smudge tools in Photoshop
Elements.

Using Smudging, Sharpening, and Blurring Tools
556
see this reduced contrast as blur.) The Smudge tool smears the pixels into
each other, and its effects are entirely dependent on the length and direction
of your mouse or pen strokes.
What the three tools do have in
common is how highly dependent
they are upon their Options bar 
settings — or rather, how much you
are dependent on the settings.
Without controlling how drastic or
subtle an effect these tools have, you
might end up with very little blurring
or too much sharpening — or perhaps
some smudging that makes it look like
you were drunk when you tried to
retouch the photo. Figure 4-7 shows
an image in which the Sharpen tool
was taken a bit too far; instead of
adding contrast between pixels (to
make them all stand out just a bit), the
result is a very unpleasant effect —
definitely not what you want.
Finger painting to blend
colors and textures
You use the Smudge tool to drag tone from one spot to another spot right
next to it. Think of it like blending pastels or chalk on paper with your finger.
The smudging process can smooth an edge, blend two adjoining colors, or
smoosh out a background, as shown in Figure 4-8. You can also turn on a
Finger Painting option and bring the current foreground color into the mix,
smearing it into the image at whatever point you’re dragging the mouse.
Figure 4-8: Blend a background or soften sharp edges with the Smudge tool.
Figure 4-7: A little goes a long way with the
Sharpen tool. Take care as you set up how the
tool works.

Book VI
Chapter 4
Restoring Images
Using Smudging, Sharpening, and Blurring Tools
557
To use the Smudge tool, follow these steps:
1. Click the Smudge tool in the Tool palette to activate it.
This displays the Options bar, shown in Figure 4-9.
Figure 4-9: Control the effects of the Smudge tool.
2. Using the Options bar, change the setting in the Strength drop-down
menu to make the smudging more dramatic (a high percentage) or
subtle (a low percentage).
3. If you’d also like the Smudge tool to adjust the lights, darks, tones, and
colors of the area that’s smudged, choose an appropriate setting in the
Mode drop-down menu.
The Mode setting controls how the original pixels and smudged pixels
are blended together. Your options are as follows:
• Normal: No change to the quality of the colors or tones where you
smudge. They just get smudged.
• Darken: In addition to smudging, a Burn tool effect is applied.
• Lighten: In addition to smudging, a Dodge tool effect is applied.
• Hue: Smudges only the hue or color of one area onto another, dragging
the tone from your starting point onto another adjoining area of the
image. 
• Saturation: By smudging with this setting in place, you’re smudging
the color intensity instead of the image content.
• Color: Smudge color (both hue and saturation) from one area to
another without distorting the physical content.
• Luminosity: This mode smudges the brightness of your starting point
onto the adjoining areas through which you drag the Smudge tool.
The last four mode options allow you to adjust the color and quality of
the color as you smudge. I recommend that you tinker with the area
using other color- and hue-adjustment tools first and then smudge in
Normal mode.
4. Set the Brush size by using the Brush palette, just like you set all other
Photoshop brush-like tools.
5. Click and drag to smudge the image.
You pull color from the starting point onto the ending point.

Using Smudging, Sharpening, and Blurring Tools
558
Don’t use the Smudge tool to smudge large areas of your image unless you’re
going for a really smudgy background, as in the case of Figure 4-8. In most
other instances, although you can use a large brush size and make a big
smudge, you’ll regret it because you’ll end up distorting the image instead of
blending areas within it. For the best results with most images, use a small
brush and use it in small areas.
Using the Sharpen tool to add detail
The Sharpen tool heightens the contrast between adjacent pixels so that
each of the pixels stands out more. This can help you improve the apparent
detail in a blurry or faded photo. Small features, textures, and the like can be
brought out by making the pixels in and around them more diverse.
In versions 1.0 and 2.0 of Elements, the Sharpen tool lived all by itself on its
own button on the Tool palette, but from Version 3.0 to the latest version 4.0,
it shares a button with the Blur and Smudge tools just like in Photoshop.
In either case, the tool has the same options (see Figure 4-10) and works
the same way.
Figure 4-10: Using the Sharpen tool in Photoshop.
To sharpen some of or the entire image, follow these steps:
1. To control the area in which the sharpening will take place, use a
selection tool — Marquee, Lasso, or Magic Wand — from the Tool
palette to select an area within the photo.
2. Click the Sharpen tool to activate it.

Book VI
Chapter 4
Restoring Images
Using Smudging, Sharpening, and Blurring Tools
559
3. Use the Brush palette to adjust the brush size and whether you want a
hard-edged or soft-edged brush.
A smaller brush enables you to sharpen a very specific area, whereas 
a larger brush heightens pixel diversity in a wider area, with more 
generalized results.
4. Reduce or increase the intensity of the sharpening effect by adjusting
the Strength setting from its default of 50%.
Be careful not to sharpen too much, or you’ll end up with pixels that are
so bright and diverse that detail can actually be lost.
5. From the Mode drop-down menu, choose the mode setting that you
want for the Sharpen tool.
The mode setting controls how the pixels are blended. The modes are
the same as those for the Smudge tool — described in the preceding 
section’s steps list — and include Color, Hue, Saturation, or Luminosity.
Normal mode is good for most jobs.
6. Click and/or drag over the area to be sharpened.
You can go over the same spot more than once, but again, don’t go too
far. Figure 4-11 shows both effective (left side of face) and ineffective
sharpening (right side of face). Subtle effects are usually preferable.
Figure 4-11: At left, the unsharpened version. At right, the left side of the face has been
sharpened effectively, but the right side of the face has been sharpened too much.

Using Smudging, Sharpening, and Blurring Tools
560
Sharpen and Blur filters are available through the Filter menu in both
Photoshop and Photoshop Elements, and you can achieve more uniform
results with them than with the brush-applied Sharpen and Blur tools
because the mouse is removed from the equation. The filter is applied
evenly over the selected area or the entire active layer of the image. You
can read more about filters in Book VI, Chapter 6.
Blurring some or all of your image
The Blur tool is the Sharpen tool’s opposite. Instead of increasing the diver-
sity between adjoining pixels, the pixels are made more similar (reducing the
contrast), with their color and light levels adjusted so that no individual
pixels stand out too much. Obviously, you can blur a lot or blur a little:
The degree to which the tool is applied determines how much contrast is
removed from the pixels that you brush over with the Blur tool.
Blurring can be used as a quick-and-dirty substitute for cloning over unwanted
pixels. Figure 4-12 shows at left a scan of an old photograph that was folded
and wrinkled along the bottom edges. I could have used the Clone Stamp to
copy pixels over the wrinkles, but because this area of the subject would look
better if de-emphasized anyway, blurring the lower-left and lower-right corners
was faster.
Figure 4-12: Blurring the lower corners of this photo, as shown at right, de-emphasizes the
wrinkles that are clearly visible at left.
To use the Blur tool, follow these steps:

Book VI

561
1. Check to see that the layer you want to work with is selected in the
Layers palette.
If the Layers palette isn’t visible, you can choose it from the Window menu.
2. If you want to restrict the blurring to a particular area of the image,
use the appropriate selection tool (Marquee, Lasso, Magic Wand) on
the Tool palette to select that area.
3. Click the Blur tool to activate it.
The tool shares a spot with the Sharpen and Smudge tools.
Check out the tool’s options on the Options bar, shown in Figure 4-13.
Figure 4-13: The Blur tool’s Options bar.
4. Adjust the setting in the Strength drop-down menu (set to 50% by
default) to increase or decrease the amount of blurring that each click
or stroke applies to the image.
Obviously, a low setting results
in very subtle effects.
5. Set the brush size and type
(such as hard- or soft-edged) for
the area you’ll be blurring by
using the Brush palette.
Use the smallest brush you can if
you need to blur a very small or
detailed area. If you want to blur
a large area, use a large brush so
that you can avoid the obvious
signs of retracing your steps
with the tool.
6. Click or drag over the area to
be blurred.
Some scrubbing with the mouse
might be required if you want to
get rid of a very sharp edge
between two parts of the image.
Figure 4-14 shows the edge of
content that was pasted into a
photo, and the Blur tool is

that the pasted content looks

Sometimes you can use the Blur tool to make another part of the image seem
sharper in comparison. For example, if the Sharpen tool is having undesir-
able effects on your image, use the Blur tool to soften or remove the details
surrounding the parts of the image to which you want to draw attention.
Finding Relief with the Healing Tools
Both Photoshop and Photoshop Elements have tools that are considered
purely restorative. They’re intended for removing the signs of age, wear and
tear, and outright damage in the form of tears, rips, scratches, and missing
content.
In Photoshop CS2 and Elements 4.0, you can find two tools nested with the
Red Eye tool designed specifically with healing in mind:
✦The Healing Brush, which copies pixels from one place to another while
modifying the copied pixels so that they take into account the texture
and brightness of the underlying image.
✦The Spot Healing Brush, which performs its healing magic only on 
specific areas you click, such as dust spots, taking its samples from
the surrounding pixels automatically.
Photoshop CS2 has a third tool not found in Elements 4.0:
✦The Patch Tool, which overlays a portion you want to repair with a
patch taken from another area, but modified so that the patch takes into
account the texture and brightness of the image underneath.
You can also find a Clone Stamp tool in both applications, which copies undam-
aged content and allows you to paint it over damaged areas. You can do this to
replace missing content, cover up damaged content, or simply edit the content
of the image by painting over things you don’t want. Unlike the Healing Brush
and the Patch tools, the Clone Stamp obscures any detail being copied over.
The Clone Stamp isn’t purely a restorative tool. It has many uses in the cre-
ation of original artwork and in images that aren’t photographic in nature.
Its restorative uses are extensive, however, so I’ve grouped it here with the
healing tools.
Using the Healing Brush
The Healing Brush is so named because it repairs or heals the current image
being painted over — using it doesn’t replace it completely. The Clone Stamp

Book VI
Chapter 4
Restoring Images
Finding Relief with the Healing Tools
563
(to be discussed shortly) replaces
content in one place with selected
content from another spot in the
image. The color and lighting in the
source spot are cloned and placed in
the target location as well, which
might not be what you want if you’d
like to preserve a realistic look.
The Healing Brush is a bit more intel-
ligent and a bit less heavy-handed
than the Clone Stamp. As shown in
Figure 4-15, this view of a single
image shows the Healing Brush
effects. The tear on the right side of
the photograph is partially healed,
and the healed portion matches the
surrounding content even though the
healing content was derived from a
spot on the other side of the image
(marked by the cross hairs to the left
of the woman’s face).
To use the Healing Brush, follow
these steps:
1. Identify the area to be healed
and pick content from else-
where in the image that you can use to heal the wound.
2. Click the Healing Brush in the Tool palette to activate it.
A set of options appears in the Options bar, as shown in Figure 4-16.
Figure 4-16: The Healing Brush’s Options bar.
3. Using the Options bar, establish the following settings. You can leave
them at their default settings if you want, but you might want to make
adjustments:
• Brush: The Brush setting allows you to choose the size of the brush
you’ll use and whether it is hard- or soft-edged. This is the same 
setting that you use to control the way any content is applied with a
brush-based tool.
Figure 4-15: Select the healing content (at
the cross hairs) and then paint over the
“wound” on the right side of the image.

Finding Relief with the Healing Tools
564
• Mode: Choose how the pixels will blend. Normal is the default setting
and is probably your best choice because it lets the tool work as it’s
intended. With the Normal setting, the Healing Brush takes the heal-
ing content and applies it to the damage and then lets the “band-aid”
content blend in with the surrounding area. You can also use the
modes described in Book VI, Chapter 3.
• Source: If the Sampled option is selected, the Healing Brush copies
pixels from a place that you select in the image. This is the default
because it assumes you’re going to choose a spot on the image —
somewhere where there is no damage — and use that as the band-aid
for the damaged area.
If the Pattern option is selected, you can paint a pattern over the area
to be healed instead of pixels from another part of the image. If you
select this option, the pattern that you apply takes on the color and
lighting of the surrounding pixels. This can be a useful option if
you’re replacing missing content and have to invent the fill entirely.
Figure 4-17 shows a pattern applied to an area and the interesting effect
that it creates to cover a stain on the carpet. The content within the
circular cursor has not yet changed to match the surrounding pixels,
but you can see the previous clicks that place a pattern in context.
• Aligned: When you select your source area (where the healing content
is taken from), you can select this option so that the distance and
direction between the source and target remains the same as you paint
over larger damaged areas. This option is unchecked by default, which
means that the tool copies from the original source spot each time you
click the mouse to paint over the damaged area with the Healing Brush.
If you enable this option, new source areas are selected each time that
you apply the Healing Brush.
Figure 4-17: Applying a pattern.

4. After you adjust all the settings you want or need to, begin using the
Healing Brush. First, sample the spot that’s used to heal the damage
by Alt-clicking (Option-clicking on the Mac) the healing content that
you want to use.
5. With your healing content chosen, go ahead and click or drag over the
damaged area.
The content you sampled (with the Alt or Option key and your mouse)
covers the damage.
You might have to wait a few moments for the healing effect to finish. A lot of
calculating goes on as Photoshop matches the copied pixels to the new loca-
tion’s darkness and texture. At first, it might look like the exact color and
lighting from the source area is being duplicated on the damaged (target)
area. If you wait a second, however, you’ll see the Healing effect occur — the
content you applied with the Healing Brush automatically blends into its sur-
roundings, like a chameleon blending into the leaf or twig on which it sits.
The Spot Healing Brush in both Photoshop and Photoshop Elements works
the same as the Healing Brush, but doesn’t require clicking within your
image to select an area to be used as a sample. Just select the tool and click
over the area you want to “heal.” The pixels surrounding the “wound” will be
examined and used to construct the new pixels painted over it during the
healing process.
Working with the Patch tool
Unlike the Healing Brush and Spot Healing Brush, which allow you to paint
content from one place to another, the Patch tool works by applying a
selected shape from one spot on the image to a damaged spot somewhere
else in the image. You can use this tool to cover damage (such as scratches,
spots, and stains), or you can use it to replace unwanted content with some-
thing more visually appealing.
Photoshop Elements doesn’t offer the Patch tool; only Photoshop does
(starting with version 7.0). It’s similar to copying and pasting content from
one place to another, which is a procedure supported by both applications.
The difference between using the Patch tool and doing a simple copy and
paste to cover up unwanted content or damage is simple: The Patch tool is a
little more intuitive and a little more chameleon-like in that when you place
the patch over the unwanted content, the lighting and shading in the target
area is applied to the patch.
To use this really helpful tool, follow these steps:
1. Check the Layers palette to make sure the right layer is active.
If the Layers palette isn’t visible, you can activate it from the Window
menu. Using the correct layer prevents you from patching the wrong
layer’s content onto another part of your image.

Finding Relief with the Healing Tools
566
2. Decide which part of the image you want to use to cover the
unwanted or damaged area.
3. Click the Patch Tool to activate it.
You might have to switch to it from the Healing Brush because these two
tools share one spot on the toolbox.
4. Using the Options bar (shown in Figure 4-18), choose either Source or
Destination for the patch.
If you didn’t select the patch area before turning on the tool (and I haven’t
had you do that in these steps), select Destination.
Figure 4-18: Source or Destination? Choose which direction your patch will follow.
5. Using the mouse, drag a line around the area that you want to use as
the patch.
It’s a lot like using the Lasso tool, as shown in Figure 4-19.
Figure 4-19: Select the Destination patch to place on top of the 
damaged areas or unwanted content.

Book VI
Chapter 4

567
6. Drag the selected patch area onto the damaged/unwanted spot.
Wait a second and see the lighting and shading change to make the patch
match the surrounding pixels so that the patched content blends in.
7. If you have a large area to patch, you can do it in small pieces, repeat-
ing Steps 5 and 6 for each piece.
Figure 4-20 shows an extra kitten’s face added to a former pile of three
kittens. The shading and lighting of the new face match its location
among the existing kittens.
Figure 4-20: Patch a portion of the image over other content to 
make more of a good thing.
When your entire damaged or unwanted area is patched, you can use the
Blur or Smudge tool as needed on any visible edges. If you placed one 
large patch over a large trouble spot, you might have to blend it with any
drastically different adjacent pixels. Sometimes, if the damaged area is a very
light color and a dark area is right next to it, the patch-matching won’t be as
smooth as you’d have hoped.
Cloning content to cover damage 
and unwanted content
The addition of the Patch tool, Healing Brush, and Spot Healing Brush to
Photoshop might have eliminated more than half the uses for the Clone
Stamp for many users, but you’ll find the Clone Stamp to be a helpful tool in
many applications.

Finding Relief with the Healing Tools
568
The Clone Stamp duplicates content from one place and lets you click to place
it one or more times in the image, covering existing content (thus the term
stamp in the tool’s name). Figure 4-21 shows a good candidate for Clone Stamp
fixing. Unlike the Patch tool, there is no matching of the stamped content to
the surrounding pixels in the target area. If you stamp green grass on a blue
couch, you get green grass on a blue couch — you don’t get a blue, grassy 
texture on a blue couch.
Figure 4-21: Can we create a portrait of the bugle boy alone? 
Unfortunately, his mom’s hat and shoulder intrude into the picture.
To use the Clone Stamp, follow these steps, which are quite similar to the
steps for the Healing Brush and Patch tool combined. I use Photoshop
Elements here:
1. Verify the layer you’re in, making sure that the layer containing the
content you want to clone is highlighted in the Layer palette.
You can switch to another layer later when you stamp the content onto
the image.
2. Click the Clone Stamp tool in the Tool palette to activate it.
The Options bar (shown in Figure 4-22) appears, offering several settings
that you can tweak to control how the tool is applied, including
• Brush: This pop-up palette on the left side of the Options bar contains
the brush styles you set for painting, erasing, or using any brush-
applied tool. Pick a brush from the palette based on your target area,

Book VI
Chapter 4
Restoring Images
Finding Relief with the Healing Tools
569
going for a size that’s just a bit smaller than the area you want to
stamp over. You don’t want to leave an obvious edge to a single stamp-
ing of content. With two or more stamps in the area, you can avoid a
clumsily pasted look.
• Mode: You can choose a mode to control how the pixels will be merged
when the cloned content is pasted. The Mode controls were discussed
earlier, in the section, “Finger painting to blend colors and textures.”
Normal works for most jobs, but you might want to experiment.
• Opacity: If you want to see through your stamped content, reduce 
the opacity from the default 100%.
• Aligned: This keeps the same distance/offset between the sampled
spot and the stamped area. If you deselect this option, the tool
returns to the original sampled spot as its source each time you
release the mouse button and continue stamping.
• Use All Layers: If you want your cloning and stamping to affect all
the layers of your image, select this option. It’s unchecked (off) by
default, just so you don’t make more of an impact on your entire
image than you had intended.
Figure 4-22: The Clone Stamp’s Options bar.
After you customize the tool as needed, you’re ready to clone and stamp.
3. To clone the spot that will be used to cover unwanted content, hold
down Alt (Option key on a Mac) while you click the spot that you want
to clone.
The mouse pointer changes when you’re in clone mode, and a crosshair
appears in the center of your brush point.
In this example image, I Alt-clicked in the bugle boy’s sleeve to cover his
mother’s arm at the lower right corner of the picture.
4. Release the Alt or Option key and apply the cloned content by click-
ing to cover the unwanted content, as shown in Figure 4-23.
Here, multiple copies of the cloned content have been applied over a
large area to cover the seated woman’s shoulder and hat.
Note that I’ve also used the Clone Stamp to remove some dust spots and
other artifacts from the background and uniform.

P
hotos displayed on a sunny wall or desk can fade from the exposure to
sunshine, even if you live in a rainy climate. You’d be surprised how
just a small amount of sunlight or fluorescent light can fade a photo if it’s
exposed long enough. Time, too, can fade photos printed from old negatives
on old photo paper. You might also have photos that looked a bit
odd from the start — perhaps there was too much red or
green, or the colors looked washed out from the minute
you had the photo developed or captured it with your
digital camera.
Regardless of the cause, color photos present a
whole host of color-balance, level, and quality
issues, and Photoshop and Photoshop Elements
are well prepared to deal with them. This is where
Photoshop’s status as the standard for photo
retouching software kicks in. You can find several
ways to manually and automatically adjust color
levels and quality. Photoshop Elements has many of
the same tools that Photoshop does, as well as a few of
its own.
In Book VI, Chapter 4, I show you how to adjust tonal values and
eliminate artifacts while fixing old photos. This chapter focuses on the color
adjustments you can make to bring your images up to snuff.

Using Automated Tools in Photoshop and Elements
572
Using Automated Tools in Photoshop and Elements
Your first stop when attempting to correct your colors and tones is the auto-
mated tools built right into both Photoshop and Elements. These tools are 
a training wheels of a sort that work well for some basic image problems, 
but they don’t allow the kind of fine-tuning that you want to apply to really
optimize your photos. Try these automatic tools first and then turn to some
of the more advanced options described in the rest of this chapter.
Auto Correction in Photoshop
Your automated toolkit in Photoshop is located in the Adjustments submenu
of the Image menu and includes
✦Auto Levels: This command automatically examines the tonal values in
your image, including the lightest tones (highlights), the middle tones,
and the darkest tones (the shadows). Then it attempts to provide a 
balance among all those tones so that the lightest tones aren’t washed
out, the darkest shadows still have some detail, and the middle tones
are right in the middle.
✦Auto Contrast: This command looks at how many different tones are in
your image. If only a few are present, your image could have excessive
contrast. If the image information is spread evenly among hundreds of
different tones, your image might be low in contrast. Photoshop attempts
to redistribute the tones to provide a more pleasing picture.
✦Auto Color: This command attempts to determine whether the color in
your image is heavily biased toward one color or another and then
removes excessive color to provide some correction. (Remember, no
image editor can add color that isn’t there; colors can only be removed,
leaving whatever other colors are present.)
None of these commands have any options. You just invoke them and evalu-
ate your results.
Auto Correction in Photoshop Elements
Elements has the same three tools found in Photoshop, under the Enhance
menu: Auto Levels, Auto Contrast, and Auto Color Correction. Elements also
includes an Auto Smart Fix command that attempts to apply all three of
these commands, as appropriate, simultaneously.
You can throttle back the amount of correction applied by Smart Fix by
moving a slider in the Adjust Smart Fix dialog box. Choose Enhance➪Adjust
Smart Fix and move the Smart Fix slider from 0 percent (almost no correction)

Book VI
Chapter 5
Correcting Faded,
Funny, and Funky
Colors
Adjusting Color Balance
573
up to 200 percent (a whole lot of correction) until
you get the effect you like. The current effect can
be viewed in the original image’s window as you
adjust the slider.
Photoshop Elements also has a Quick Fix mode
(select it by clicking the Quick Fix tab on the right
side of the main window), shown in Figure 5-1,
with an assortment of correction tools for general
fixes, lighting and contrast, color, and sharpening.
Each of these has an Auto button that you can
click to apply the automatic version of that cor-
rection, as well as sliders for applying the fixes
manually. Read more about manual fixes in the
next sections.
Adjusting Color Balance
Say a photo has too much red or yellow, or the
whole picture is too dark or too light. These 
problems — problems you might think would
require multiple tools and several steps to 
solve — could just be a couple of clicks away
from their solutions. With automatic color and
lighting adjustment tools, commands that
address specific color levels, and Photoshop’s
Channels palette, you have the power to make
sweeping changes to your photos or sections
thereof, significantly shortening the amount of
time that you spend editing and improving your
photos.
Adjusting color levels
Both Photoshop and Photoshop Elements offer 
a Levels command. In Elements, it’s squirreled
away under the Enhance➪Adjust Lighting 
submenu; in Photoshop, you can find it on the
Image➪Adjustments menu. Or, just press
Ctrl/Ô+L to bring up the dialog box directly.
The Levels command in either application allows you to set the highlights and
shadows in an image by dragging three Input Levels sliders (in this case, a set
of three black, gray, and white triangles along the slider axis) to adjust the
Figure 5-1: Elements’ Quick
Fix mode gives you fast access
to automated and manual
correction tools.

Levels histogram. A histogram is a
visual representation of quantities —
in this case, levels of tones. The slid-
ers, as shown in Figure 5-2, allow you
to adjust levels of shadows, midtones,
and highlights.
As you drag the Input Levels sliders,
the levels of lights and darks change
in the photo. You can control the
effects by using the Set Black Point,
Set Gray Point, and Set White Point
eyedroppers. (The eyedroppers are
located under the Options button in
Figure 5-2.) 
While in Levels, double-click each of the Eyedroppers in turn to open the
Color Picker so that you can choose new colors for these three levels
(Shadows, Midtones, and Highlights). Alternatively, you can choose new
color levels by clicking existing shades within the image. As you make your
selections (using the Color Picker or the image itself) and okay them, you
see the results in your image.
You can find more about working with the Levels command in Photoshop
CS2 All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies, by Barbara Obermeier (Wiley).
Using the Variations dialog box
The Variations command (Color Variations in Elements 4.0) is a useful 
feature found on the Image➪Adjustments submenu in Photoshop and on 
the Enhance➪Adjust Color submenu in Photoshop Elements.
The Variations/Color Variations command enables you to view a series of
thumbnails, each showing a different color or contrast effect. As you can see
in Figure 5-3, clicking the Darker thumbnail shows you how adding more
black to the image will affect it. If color adjustment is your goal, you can see
what will happen if you bump up the Blue component just by clicking More
Blue (in Photoshop) or Increase Blue (in Photoshop Elements).
While you’re experimenting by clicking the Variations thumbnails, you can
always click the Original thumbnail to return all the thumbnails to their
default states. You can view the effects of multiple changes, such as making
the image lighter, adding more of one or more colors, or switching between
Figure 5-2: Adjust shadow, midtone, and
highlight levels.

the Midtones, Shadows, Highlights, and Saturation radio buttons. No matter
what variations you’re considering, Photoshop lets you see your results in a
Current Pick thumbnail, and Photoshop Elements shows an after version of
the image, as shown in Figure 5-4.
Figure 5-3: Photoshop’s Variations dialog box lets you see your results 
in the Current Pick version of the image.

Figure 5-4: Before and after thumbnails in Photoshop Elements.
Equalizing colors
The Equalize command has been christened with a name that clearly tells
you what it does. Choose Image➪Adjustments in Photoshop or Filter➪
Adjustments in Elements. The command evenly distributes color over the
range of brightness levels throughout your image (or in a selected area) from
0 to 255. When the Equalize command is issued, Photoshop or Elements
locates the brightest and darkest pixels, and the rest of the colors are adjusted,
making white the brightest value and black the darkest. Then all the colored
pixels that fall between these two extremes are equalized, or made to fall
between the two extreme shades.
If you don’t select part of your image before issuing the Equalize command,
no dialog box appears; the changes just take place automatically over the
entire image. If you do make a selection first, a dialog box appears, as shown
in Figure 5-5.
Use this dialog box to indicate whether you want to equalize a selected area
only or equalize the entire image based on the selected area. In Figure 5-6,

Book VI
Chapter 5
Correcting Faded,
Funny, and Funky
Colors
Adjusting Color Balance
577
only part of the image is equalized, and it’s easy to spot it. Therefore, be
careful that you don’t make the rest of your image look shabby by improving
just a small section so drastically.
The Equalize command affects each image differently. The effect depends
on how damaged, faded, and light or dark the image was to begin with.
Don’t assume that if equalization was a big problem solver in one photo,
it will be as successful with another.

colors.

Figure 5-6: Equalizing just part of your image might be too drastic, 
as it is in this case.
Fixing a color cast
A color cast is a tinge — a shade of red or maybe yellow — that discolors
your image in whole or in part. Casts occur for a variety of reasons, includ-
ing the age of the photo, the quality of your scanner (if you scanned a
printed original), the print from which you scanned the image, or the film
used to take the picture. If a cast appears in an image captured with a digital
camera, you need to reset something on the camera (what you change and
how you change it varies by the camera). A digital camera is rarely the 
culprit, however. Your cast probably came from a print, film, or age problem
instead.

Chapter 5
Correcting Faded,
Funny, and Funky
Colors
Adjusting Color Balance

To get rid of a cast, use Photoshop Elements’ Color Cast command (Photoshop
doesn’t have it) to rid an image of any unpleasant preponderance of a single
color. Just follow these steps:
1. Open the image with the unwanted color cast.
2. From the main menu, choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Remove Color
Cast.
The Remove Color Cast dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 5-7, 
offering instructions.
Figure 5-7: Correct a color cast and get rid of any dominant shade.
3. Use the dialog box’s Eyedropper tool (already activated within the
dialog box) to click the gray, and then white, and then black points in
the image.
As you click in the image (about three times — one for gray, one for
white, and one for black), the color cast in the photo changes.
You can keep clicking different spots until you like the results or bail out
entirely by clicking Cancel.
Make sure that you leave the Preview option on in the Remove Color Cast
dialog box. Most applications offer a Preview capability in dialog boxes that
adjust visual elements. Leaving it on means that you don’t have to apply the
changes just to see them in your image. If you do apply them by clicking
OK and then decide you don’t like the change, choose Edit➪Undo from the
main menu.
Displaying and using channels
Channels are the different individual color layers that make up your image.
Most photos are either in RGB (red/green/blue) or CMYK (cyan/magenta/
yellow/black) modes, and photos in those modes have either three (in the
case of RGB) or four (in the case of CMYK) channels.

Working with Color Intensity and Quality
580
Photoshop’s Channels palette (not found in
Elements) allows you to view the individual 
channels for your photo, as shown in Figure 5-8. 
If the Channels palette is not visible, you can 
display it by choosing Window➪Channels.
The channel that includes all the colors (the 
RGB or CMYK channel) is displayed when all the
individual channels are showing in the photo, and
it turns off (the eye disappears from that channel
in the palette) if any one of the channels is hidden.
Use the Channels palette to focus your editing
efforts on a single color channel’s content or 
on a combination of two or more channels. For
example, if you want to make changes only to 
the red portions of an image, you can edit the
Red channel alone without disturbing the Green
or Blue channels. You can edit any channel that’s
visible. When you hide all but one channel, your
edits affect only the channel that’s active. To edit
a single channel, keep these rules in mind:
✦White applies the selected channel color at 100 percent intensity.
✦Black wipes out the channel’s color wherever you paint or draw it.
✦Use a shade of gray to apply the channel’s color at a lower intensity.
To display a channel, make sure that the eye appears next to the channel in
the Channels palette. If you want to hide a channel, click the eye to the left of
the channel. You can’t turn off the RGB or CMYK channel directly; it’s visible
only if all the other channels are visible, too. Using Channels is a complex
topic, and I recommend checking out Photoshop CS2 All-in-One Desk Reference
For Dummies, by Barbara Obermeier (Wiley), for more information.
Working with Color Intensity and Quality
Automatic tools that ask nothing — or ask just a few questions and then
make global corrections to color and light — can fail you. In these situations,
Photoshop and Photoshop Elements can help. These applications provide
targeted tools that you can apply manually to adjust color, lighting, bright-
ness, and contrast. Whatever your photo’s color difficulty is, however,
chances are that these tools offer a quick and easy solution:

✦The Sponge tool for saturating and desaturating color
✦The Brightness/Contrast dialog box
✦The Curve dialog box, for adjusting individual colors
Increasing and decreasing color intensity
Found in both Photoshop and Photoshop Elements, the Sponge tool adds
color (in Saturate mode) or removes color (in Desaturate mode), depending
on how you set up the tool.
The Sponge tool can come in handy if you added too much color in a previ-
ous editing session and the edit can’t be undone. Or perhaps you simply
want a subtler, more faded look to some or all of an image. New photos are
often faded to look vintage or in preparation for the use of an artistic filter
that will make the photo look like a drawing or painting.
Regardless of your motivation, the Sponge tool is very simple to use. To satu-
rate or desaturate color in either Photoshop or Photoshop Elements, follow
these steps:
1. Click the tool in the Tool palette to activate it.
In Photoshop and Elements 3.0 and 4.0, the Sponge shares a space on
the Tool palette with the Dodge and the Burn tools. Hold down the Shift
key and press O to cycle through the three tools until the Sponge is
active. Elements versions prior to 3.0 give the Sponge tool its own spot.
2. Choose Saturate or Desaturate mode, using the tool’s Options bar, as
shown in Figure 5-9.
Figure 5-9: The Sponge tool’s Options bar.
3. Adjust the flow — how much saturation or desaturation occurs — by
using the Flow drop-down menu. In some Mac versions of Photoshop,
Pressure does the same thing.
4. Use the Brush drop-down menu and choose the right brush size for
the area to be sponged.
A small brush can give you undesirable results when used in a large
area, and a big brush can go too far. Choose one that lets you fix the
problem area with the least number of clicks or brush strokes.

Working with Color Intensity and Quality
582
5. Apply the Sponge to the image by clicking and/or dragging to add or
remove color where desired.
Passing over the same spot more than once intensifies the sponge effect.
You add or wash out more color on each successive pass, as shown in
Figure 5-10, where too much color has been sponged away.

away all your colors.

and Contrast command found in the

submenu in Photoshop Elements.
In either application, the command
opens a dialog box, shown in
Figure 5-11, that offers two sliders.
One adjusts the brightness, and the
other adjusts the contrast.
Although the Brightness/Contrast controls are tempting for the beginner, most
of the time, they are the worst choice for making corrections to your photos.
That’s because they provide uniform changes in brightness or contrast to all
the pixels in your image or selection. That might work out in some cases, but
most of the time, the results will be terrible. If you bump up brightness to
lighten shadows, you’ll find that your highlights are now completely washed
out. Darken highlights, and your shadows will turn black. And rarely will any
photograph need adjustment in contrast over its entire image. I recommend
using the Levels command (discussed earlier in this chapter) and Curves (dis-
cussed next) as your Photoshop or Elements proficiency increases. Each
of these commands deserves most of a chapter of its own, and that’s what
you’ll find in the companion books to this one, Photoshop CS2 All-in-One Desk
Reference For Dummies, by Barbara Obermeier, or Photoshop Elements 4 For
Dummies, by Barbara Obermeier and Ted Padova (both by Wiley).
Riding the curves
Another way to adjust the tones in your image is to work with the Curves
dialog box, available in Photoshop (but not in Photoshop Elements) by
choosing Image➪Adjustments➪Curves. You can use this box to adjust the
entire range of colors in your image. To adjust the tones and color balance,
drag the curved line up, down, left, or right, and watch the Preview to see
how the adjustments affect your image. You’ll also want to use the set of
three eyedroppers to set the shadow, midtone, and highlight samples from
within the image and then readjust the curve.
If you want to change only certain color levels in the image, choose which
color channel you want to adjust by selecting that channel within the
Channels palette. If you want to adjust multiple (but not all) channels, hold
down the Shift key as you click to select more than one channel.
Removing Red-Eye
Another tool that originated with Photoshop Elements and migrated to
Photoshop is the Red Eye Removal tool (called simply the Red Eye tool in
Photoshop). This tool allows you to literally click or paint away those glowing
Figure 5-11: Adjust brightness and/or
contrast with this handy dialog box.

Removing Red-Eye

pupils that affect children or anyone
else wide-eyed and close enough to
the camera and its overzealous flash.
Figure 5-12 shows an image in dire
need of red-eye treatment.
Using the Red Eye Removal tool
requires using the Options bar;
Photoshop’s Red Eye tool has a simi-
lar Options bar, but without the Auto
button. To use the Red Eye Removal
tool, follow these steps to customize
the tool’s effects and apply them to
the glowing eyes in question. In
Elements, you can also click the Auto
button and let the tool find and fix
the red eyes without your help 
(it does a fairly good job.)
1. Make sure that the layer with the demonic eyes is in fact the active
layer in the Layers palette.
2. Click the Red Eye Removal tool in the Tool palette to activate it; then
consider the following options:
• Pupil Size: The size of the brush you’ll use to paint over the red-eye.
• Darken Amount: The degree
you want the red eyes 
darkened.
3. Click in the area that includes
the red-eye effect.
The tool automatically seeks out
the red tone and darkens it, cre-
ating more natural-looking eyes.
4. If both eyes are glowing (they
usually are), you can repeat this
process for the second eye.
Figure 5-13 shows both eyes
exorcised, with no glow 
remaining.
The current  version of the Red Eye Removal tool does not work with the 
similar yellow- or green-eye effect produced in animals. Try using the Color
Replacement tool instead. For best results, be careful not to apply the same
exact pupil color to both eyes.

F
ilters allow you to apply groups of effects and formats to your images,
whether to a specific selected area or to the entire image on one or more
of its layers. You can use filters to add or change the color and texture of your
images or to add patterns. Each of the filters in Photoshop and Photoshop
Elements enables you to control how the filter affects your image, and most
filters give you a preview so that you don’t have to formally apply the
filter to your image until you see how it will look.
Telling you everything you need to know about using 
filters is beyond the scope of this book. After all,
Photoshop and Elements each include more than
100 different filters that span a broad range of special
effects. But this chapter certainly gets you started
using these fascinating tools. For more detailed
information on using filters, check out the
Photoshop CS2 All-in-One Desk Reference For
Dummies, by Barbara Obermeier (Wiley).
The main thing to remember when using filters is to
experiment and have fun with them. Several of the illus-
trations in this chapter are not simply digital photos with
a filter applied to them. Some of them are digital creations in
their own right, using a combination of digital photos cut and
pasted together, special editing techniques, and a bit of filter special
effects magic.

Working with Photoshop’s and Photoshop Elements’ Filters
586
Working with Photoshop’s and Photoshop 
Elements’ Filters
Both applications provide the 
same filter categories, shown in 
the Photoshop Elements menu in
Figure 6-1. Photoshop’s Filter menu is
similar, with Extract, Liquify, and
Pattern Maker commands added for
good measure. (Liquify has been
moved to the regular Filter menu
under the Distort submenu for
Elements 4.0. It can also be found in
the Styles and Effects Filter Gallery.)
Filters can be used for many different
purposes, including creating original
works of art from scratch. However,
for the purposes of this discussion
on editing digital photos, the filters 
I discuss fall into three categories:
corrective, artistic, and special
effects. These are the kinds of filters
that you’re likely to use to retouch
photos for personal or professional
use. As for those filters that fall out-
side these categories, you can take your newly found knowledge of the filters
that I actually cover and apply it when you experiment with other filters.
And just think of the fun you’ll have with the trial-and-error process!
Understanding how filters work
When you open the Filter menu, you see all the filter categories, each 
followed by a right-pointing triangle that spawns a submenu. Most of the 
categories have at least four filters in their submenus, and many of them
have even more to choose from.
Just about all the Filter commands work through either a dialog box or the
Filter Gallery found in both Photoshop and Elements. Either mode enables
you to both preview and customize the filter’s effect. Figure 6-2 shows a
standalone filter dialog box for the Smart Blur effect.
You access other filters through the Filter Gallery, which presents you with 
a large number of filters, all of which can be quickly tried out from within 
the Gallery. You can even add several filters together, change their order, 
and preview the results of the combination before you apply the effects.
Figure 6-1: Choose a category in the Filter
menu and then select a filter from the
submenu.

Figure 6-3 shows the Filter Gallery in
Photoshop Elements 4.0. Elements
also has other effects in the Styles
and Effects palette.
Before I discuss individual filters, con-
sider these important filtering tips:
✦Filters can be applied only to 
the active layer, and only if that
layer is visible. If your photo has
only one layer, this is a moot
point.
✦You can limit the filter’s effects
to a selection by using the 
various selection tools before
applying a filter.
✦If you don’t make a selection
before you apply a filter, the
filter is applied to the entire
active layer.
✦Certain filters work only with
certain file types. If your file type
doesn’t support a certain filter,
the filter command is dimmed in the submenu.
Not all filters have a dialog box or appear in the Filter Gallery. Some of them,
called single step filters, have no options to bother with and are applied 
the instant you click the command in the Filter menu within a particular 
category’s submenu. The downside? You have no control over the effects,
although you can select a section of your image beforehand. If you don’t like
the results, though, you can easily use the Undo command or the History
palette to get rid of the effect.
Fixing flaws with corrective filters
Corrective filters are those that improve the quality of the image without dis-
torting it, changing the content significantly, or applying any stylized effect.
The three filters that are most appropriate for a discussion of digital photos
fall into three Filter menu categories: Blur, Sharpen, and Noise.
These three categories contain several filters, each performing a relatively
subtle effect, depending on the settings that you employ in the available
dialog boxes.
Figure 6-2: The standalone Smart Blur filter
dialog box and preview pane.

Working with Photoshop’s and Photoshop Elements’ Filters
588
Figure 6-3: Photoshop Elements’ Filter Gallery is similar to the one found in Photoshop CS2.
Blur filters
Use the Blur filters (Blur, Blur More, Gaussian Blur, Motion Blur, Radial Blur,
and Smart Blur) to soften the content of your image. The Motion and Radial
blurs do a bit more than soften. They actually give the appearance of circu-
lar movement (Radial) or movement through space (Motion). The Blur and
Blur More filters don’t have dialog boxes; the commands automatically apply
a modicum of blurring to your image in its entirety or to a selection made
before issuing the command.
Use the Blur and Blur More filters instead of the Blur tool when you want
uniform results. When you use the Blur tool, your mouse has the greatest
effect on the results. You might be able to see the strokes that you used to
apply the blur, or you might miss some spots or apply the effect unevenly.
If you use the filter, the same amount of blurring is applied everywhere, with
no strokes or places that are blurred more or less than somewhere else.
In Photoshop and Elements, the last filter you used is repeated at the top of
the Filter menu so that you can access the filter quickly if you want to use it
again in the current session. In both applications, the keyboard shortcut to
reapply the most recently used filter is Ctrl+F (Ô+F on a Mac).
The specialized Blur filters — Gaussian, Motion, Radial, and Smart — have
their own dialog boxes where you can choose the degree of blurring. You’ll use

Book VI
Chapter 6

Special Effects
Working with Photoshop’s and Photoshop Elements’ Filters
589
the Gaussian Blur filter most often because it allows a high degree of control
over the amount and type of blur applied. Figure 6-4 shows a Gaussian Blur
applied to the background part of an image to make the foreground stand out.
Figure 6-4: Gaussian Blur lets you apply customized blurs to all or part of your image.
For the Motion blur, you can also choose the direction in which the object is
supposed to be moving. Figure 6-5 shows the Motion Blur dialog box as well
as a preview of its effect on an image created in Photoshop using actual
photos blended together in a creative way.
The Radial blur completely distorts everything to which it’s applied. If you
want to create a background that appears to be spinning around or behind
parts of the image, select the content that will remain static and copy it to a
new layer. Then apply the Radial Blur to the original layer, which should be
placed behind the static content layer. Voilà! Your objects are in the center of
a hurricane, but they’ve not moved a bit. Figure 6-6 shows a fanciful image
created in Photoshop from an actual vacation photo I took in London, with
the addition of some type and special filter effects.

Sharpen filters
Just as the Blur and Sharpen tools are opposites, so are the Blur and Sharpen
filters. They’re the same in one respect, though — the filters apply the effect in
a uniform way, whereas the tools are entirely dependent on your brush size,
mouse movements, and selection to control them. These are the four main
Sharpen filters (Photoshop CS2 has a fifth, called Smart Sharpen):
✦Sharpen: This filter has no dialog box. Just choose the command, and a
uniform, subtle sharpening effect is automatically applied. You might
want to repeat it two or more times if you need more sharpening than it
manages to apply in one pass.
✦Sharpen More: This is Sharpen
on steroids. The filter applies
more sharpening in one fell
swoop than the Sharpen filter.
✦Sharpen Edges: This makes the
edges, determined by a group of
pixels varying in color and light
levels from an adjoining group,
stand out by sharpening the 
connecting pixels. If you have
content in your image that just
fades into its surroundings, this
might be the filter for you.
✦Unsharp Mask: Despite its con-
fusing name, this filter sharpens
images. Very similar to Sharpen
Edges, this filter adjusts the con-
trast of edges. This filter is the
only Sharpen filter with a dialog
box, shown in Figure 6-7, which
you use to control the effects.
Noise filters
Among the Noise filters, the Despeckle and Dust & Scratches filters are the
ones you use to retouch photos. You use them to deal with artifacts, such as
dust spots or scratches that are distracting or that obscure parts of an image.
The Despeckle filter finds the edges in an image and blurs everything but
those edges. Although this sounds overly destructive, it can create an interest-
ing effect that blends together parts of an image despite differences in color
and texture that existed in the original. It’s also a good tool for minimizing the
halftone screen effects of photos scanned from newspapers or magazines.
Figure 6-7: The Unsharp Mask filter can refine
the detail of any photo.

Working with Photoshop’s and Photoshop Elements’ Filters
592
The Reduce Noise filter is a recent addition to the Photoshop and Elements
repertoire, with helpful tools for removing multi-colored speckles from your
images.
The Dust & Scratches filter eliminates much of the noise (dust, scratches, small
spots) by making pixels that are very different from their surroundings more
similar. You can use the Dust & Scratches dialog box (shown in Figure 6-8)
to adjust the Radius and the Threshold settings, which determine the scope
and degree of the effects, respectively. Figure 6-9 shows the result of adjust-
ing these settings.
The steps for using this filter are pretty simple:
Figure 6-8: This photo needs the Dust & Scratches filter in a big way!

has been removed.
1. Choose Filter➪Noise➪Dust & Scratches from the main menu to open
the filter’s dialog box.
2. Zoom in on the area with the greatest degree of dust and scratch
damage by using the Hand tool and the + button.
The Hand tool appears when you mouse over the preview. Examining the
image preview helps you determine whether your settings are doing
the job.
3. Adjust the Threshold setting by dragging the slider.
Watch the preview for the desired result to appear.

Working with Photoshop’s and Photoshop Elements’ Filters

4. Adjust the Radius, again by dragging the slider.
Don’t go too far with your Radius adjustment. The image can become so
blurry that any details in the photo are indistinguishable.
5. Click OK to apply the filter.
Turning photos into paintings with artistic filters
The filters found in three of the Filter menu’s categories — Artistic, Sketch,
and Brush Strokes — are not truly restorative or retouching filters, at least
not traditionally. However, as more people are either capturing images 
digitally or scanning prints, their needs and desires with regard to those 
pictures have become more sophisticated and complex. It isn’t good enough
to just scan a wedding photo and enlarge it for a framed copy on the piano.
You might want to make the photo look like a drawing done with pastels or a
painting created with oils.
For gifts, cards, Web graphics, and interesting marketing materials, you 
can turn any photo into an apparent work of hand-done art, as shown in
Figure 6-10. Here, a photo has been filtered to look like a painting, with soft
shapes and a slight texture that mirrors the weave of watercolor paper. I used
the Ink Outlines and the Accented Edges filters, followed by a heavy-duty
application of the Unsharp Mask filter.
Using artistic filters also performs another important role. If your image is
simply beyond repair or beyond your skills or interest level to repair, you
can hide a multitude of sins with the right filter. If your image is scuffed and
scratched and you don’t feel like dealing with each individual injury, just
clean up the most offensive or extreme of the marks and then apply a filter
such as Colored Pencil or Dry Brush. This way, you create something
entirely new while still preserving the content and history of the original
image by hiding the damage that would have normally relegated the image
to a drawer rather than a frame.
When you use these filters, you always get a dialog box, such as the one
shown in Figure 6-11. Through the dialog boxes, you can customize how
the artistic effect is applied — the thickness of the brush or pencil strokes,
the frequency of them, how detailed the effect is, the intensity of the effect,
and so on. You can select an area before using the filter to restrict the
amount of the photo that’s affected, or you can apply the filter to the
whole image.
Going a little crazy with special effects filters
The Distort and the Stylize filters (found in both Photoshop and Photoshop
Elements) and the Liquify command are the least conservative effects.
These unusual effects change the appearance of some or all of your image

by stretching, pulling, or pinching or by mimicking textures and overlays, such
as rippled water, glass, or by appearing to be ripped apart by a strong wind.
Figure 6-10: Photos become paintings and drawings with the use of artistic filters.

Working with Photoshop’s and Photoshop Elements’ Filters
596
Figure 6-11: Make sure you get the effect you’re looking for by controlling the filter’s attributes.
You might be wondering how on Earth you’d use these filters to restore or
retouch a photo. Well, you wouldn’t. However, you might use them to create
an interesting piece of digital art, using one or more of your photos — or to
achieve a symbolic look that’s suggested, but not artistically realized, in a
photograph you’ve restored traditionally. For example, if you have a photo
of someone’s boat, it might be interesting to apply the Ocean Ripple filter to
the water in the image, and the Wind filter to the boat’s sails. That’s a bit lit-
eral, but you get the idea.
As you work with these filters, their dialog boxes help you control how the
filters work their special effects magic. You can change the size of the tiles or
cracks in an image, choose which texture to apply, and adjust the degree of
pinching or twirling to use. Figure 6-12 shows the Emboss filter dialog box
(one of the Stylize filters) and the settings you can adjust to create a very
interesting relief map of your drawing. Check the preview window as you
drag sliders and enter values. When you like the results, click OK, and they
are applied to your image or to a selection within it.
For a brief description of the more creative filters, check out the following:

✦Texture filters: These filters apply artificial textures to your image.
Figure 6-13 shows Stained Glass (top), Craquelure (middle), and Grain
(bottom) applied to different sections of a single image, purely for
demonstrative purposes.
Figure 6-12: Emboss is one of the filters that provide a 3-D effect.
Use the Texturizer filter (found in the Texture category) to apply 
textures, such as Canvas, Sandstone, and Burlap to your photo. These
textures make a photo look like it’s printed on very textured paper or
some sort of fabric.
✦Distorting filters: These filters manipulate the apparent shape of your
image content, as shown in Figures 6-14, 6-15, and 6-16, in which the
Ocean Ripple, Pinch, and Glass filters have been applied to the same
photo. By creating an apparent shape to the surface of the image, the
content looks as though it’s being viewed through some sort of distort-
ing lens, or as though the photo exists within a substance and not simply
on paper or a computer screen.

✦Stylize filters: This category is
sort of a hodgepodge of filters
that don’t really fit anywhere else.
With names like Emboss, Glowing
Edges, Solarize, and Wind, you’d
be hard pressed to find a more
descriptive yet nondescript name
for them. In Figure 6-17, I applied
the Wind filter to the pepper on
the left and Glowing Edges to the
pepper on the right. The results
are extreme and might go beyond
your intentions for dealing with
digital photos. On the other hand,
these examples might inspire you
to create something unique.
✦Liquify: This is a command on Photoshop’s Filter menu and is found in
the Distort menu in Elements (see Figure 6-18), but it isn’t simply a filter.
Instead, it’s a miniprogram of its own that gives you a full set of distortion
and manipulation tools for pinching, twisting, scrunching, pulling, bloat-
ing, shrinking, or doing just about anything that sounds like some form
of torture to your image. Figure 6-18 shows the Liquify window and some
distortion in progress.
Don’t hesitate to mix and match with filters. Apply one, then another, 
then another after that. Stacking their effects can give you unexpected and
often quite beautiful results. Don’t be afraid to experiment with different
combinations!
The Photoshop Elements Styles and Effects Tab Palette
Photoshop Elements has a list of effects that you can apply to a selection or to
your entire image similar to the way you apply filters. The Effects are actually
canned applications of Elements’ filters using a predetermined series of steps,
much like a macro. Watch the status bar at the bottom of the screen as an
Effect is applied to see the names of the filters used as they are added in turn. 
You can view Elements’ effects as a list or as a series of thumbnails, as
shown in Figure 6-19. The effects can either be applied to a selection within
your image or to the entire active layer.

and Glowing Edges filter (right).

To switch between List and Thumbnail
views of the Effects palette, click the
More button in upper-right corner of
the list and choose from the menu that
appears.
If you choose to view the effects as a
list, you see additional effects that
apply only to text (the word Type
appears next to them). These allow you
to create type that looks like wood,
chrome, glass, pipe, or just about any-
thing you can imagine. Figure 6-20
shows the List view of the Effects
palette, and a Type effect selected.
Displaying and moving 
the tab
The Effects palette is normally docked
on the right side of the Photoshop
Elements window when the Palette Bin
is visible; if you click the tab, you can
display the palette with its top still
docked. If you want to move the palette
around, you can simply drag it away
from the Palette Bin by grabbing the
tab with your mouse. You can move it
anywhere on the workspace, and even
minimize it in place by clicking the
Minimize (–) button to shrink it to just
a title bar. When you want to use it
again, click the Maximize (X) button.
You can also close the Palette by 
clicking the triangle on the left side
of the tab.
Applying an effect
After you understand how to see either the thumbnails or list of effects,
and you know how to manipulate the Effects palette (see the preceding sec-
tions), you can apply these cool effects to your photos and text. Just follow
these steps:
1. Select the portion of your image to which you want the effect to apply.
Figure 6-20: View the effects as a list and
access effects intended for use on text only.

603
If it’s text, make sure that the Type layer in question is active and
double-click the Type icon on the layer to select all the text on that layer.
2. Display the Effects palette.
3. If you want to apply an effect to your image (not to text), drag the
desired thumbnail onto your image.
After a delay — how long a delay depends on your available system
resources — the effect is applied to the image. If you have part of your
image selected, drag the thumbnail into that selected area. You’ll get an
effect like the one shown in Figure 6-21, in which I applied Psychedelic
Strings to the background.
Figure 6-21: Photoshop Elements’ Effects are an easy way to 
apply canned filter transformations.
If you want to apply a Type Effect, remember that you have to be in list view
with the correct layer selected to see those effects. When you have the effect
in view, either drag it from the list onto your Type layer or click the Apply
button while your type is selected.
Click the drop-down list in the upper-left corner of the Effects palette to
choose from different effect groups — Textures, Frames, Text Effects, Image
Effects — to be displayed alone. The default setting for this drop-down list is
All, which shows all the available effects. Choosing one of the groups in the
drop-down list distills the displayed set down to just that group.

Getting Your Hands on Third-Party Filters
604
Getting Your Hands on Third-Party Filters
To find third-party filters for Photoshop (many of which work with Photoshop
Elements as well), simply do a search online for “filters for Photoshop.” Be sure
to use the quotation marks to restrict your search to sites that contain that
exact phrase. Otherwise, you’ll find sites pertaining to filters (for coffee, oil,
air) and sites pertaining to Photoshop but not to filters. Of course, the first few
will pertain to both, but you’ll have to wade through some losers, which is
good to avoid.
The Web is a great place to find other Photoshop products, such as actions
(automated series of procedures that create special effects at the click of a
button), brush sets, and pattern sets. Do a search for “Photoshop add-ins” or
“third-party Photoshop tools” and you’ll get an ever-growing list of sites where
you can download all sorts of cool stuff — usually for a fee, but sometimes
for no charge. Figure 6-22 shows the kind of looks you can get from non-
Adobe filters.
Figure 6-22: Many amazing filter effects for Photoshop and Elements are available from 
non-Adobe sources.
In addition to searching the Web, you can find interesting filters and other
stuff by poking around these sites:

Restoring Old
Photos

P
erhaps you’ve mastered digital photography
and now take only ﬂawless pictures that
need so little further improvement that most of
your image-editing efforts are just minor tweaks.
Fortunately, becoming a paragon of photographic
prowess leaves you that much more time to tackle
that wretched shoebox full of old photos you’ve
inherited, each infected by tears, speckles, stains,
faded spots, and, in a few cases, some vexing 
content (such as a tree) growing out of the top
of some poor soul’s cranium.
In this minibook, I show you how to use a scanner
to capture those vintage prints, negatives, and
transparencies, and then mend them using 
Photoshop and Elements. I explain how to
brighten dark shadows, sharpen blurry images,
correct and enrich faded colors, and replace torn

 Preparing your originals
 Selecting resolution
 Choosing other scanner controls
You basically have three ways of scanning a color or black-and-white
print into your computer: You can do it quickly, you can do it easily, or
you can produce a high-quality digital image. If you’re new to scanning, you
can probably choose the fast route and do things the easy way or tediously
create the best quality scan you can. If you want your scanning experience
to be all three (fast, easy, and aesthetically satisfying), you need to read this
chapter.
Modern scanning software helps you make the right decisions as
you capture images from prints, but you still need to know
what you’re doing and what questions to ask yourself
before you start. For example, what resolution should
you use to scan a particular image? What other set-
tings do you need to adjust? How can you scan
problem prints with stains, scratches, bad color, or
other defects?
How to get good scans is worthy of a book itself —
indeed, I’ve written nine scanner books since 1990,
including one just about scanning transparencies
and negatives. But this chapter provides you with
the basic information you need in order to grab good-
looking images from prints, without hassles, 99 percent
of the time. Whether you’re restoring photos or planning
to incorporate scanned prints into digital photo images, you
can find what you need here.
In Book VI, Chapters 4 and 5, you can find more information on fixing old,
blemished, or faded photos that you scan.

Prepping an Image for a Scan

Prepping an Image for a Scan
The first thing to do before scanning is to prep your original. Although you
might not have a lot of control over the artwork you need to scan, you can
still prepare ahead of time to improve your chances of success. Here are a
few tips:
✦Start with the best available original. Don’t use a copy print if you can
avoid it. Use a print that was made recently from the original negative.
Older prints are sure to have some scratches, or their colors might have
aged over the years. You might even want to scan from the original nega-
tive or slide instead of from a print. (See Book VII, Chapter 2, for infor-
mation on scanning transparent originals.) However, as long as you’re
scanning from a print, use the newest and best print you can find. If the
print is housed in an album, frame, or cardboard display, carefully
remove it before scanning unless removal will damage the picture.
✦Start with the largest print that fits on your scanner. If you can choose
between a 4 x 6 print and a 5 x 7 print, use the larger print. Because of
the grain of the color emulsion in the print, a larger version is likely to
be sharper and, more importantly, to have a larger tonal range — the
range of colors from lightest to darkest. An 8 x 10 print might be even
better, but there is a point of diminishing returns. An 8 x 10 might not
be any sharper or better; it might simply show the grain of the film in
a larger form, particularly if the print was made from a 35mm negative
taken with an inexpensive camera. In addition, some scanners are known
for having uneven illumination at the edges of the scanning area. A 5 x 7
print centered in the scanning glass won’t suffer from this defect; an 
8 x 10 print can’t avoid it.
✦Clean the print and your scanner glass before you scan. If you scan a
dusty print, like the one shown in Figure 1-1, or if dust covers the glass
platen or scanning bed of your scanner, you end up with an image that
has dust spots that you must remove in your image editor. Dust the 
print carefully with a cloth and use Windex and compressed air on your
scanner’s bed.
✦Make sure the image is aligned properly on the scanner glass. If you
scan a print that’s rotated slightly, you can always straighten it out in
your image editor. Of course, you lose some quality, particularly when
straightening horizontal and vertical lines that could have been scanned
with proper alignment in the first place. Some scanner software actually
can straighten skewed pictures for you, but you want to avoid that 
feature when possible. The straightening uses the edges of the photo for
reference, and that might not coincide with the correct orientation of the
image (if the picture itself was printed skewed, for example).

Figure 1-1: Dust off your prints before scanning!
Lining up images when they’re face down on the scanner glass is tricky.
Sometimes I hold the print up to the light and draw a straight line with a
pencil on the back of the print. Then I can make sure the line is parallel to the
top edge of the scanner glass so that the image in the photo is perpendicular
to the direction of the scan. Hewlett-Packard has helped this problem by
introducing a scanner with a transparent lid: You can see exactly how the
print is aligned when you close the top. The latest versions of Photoshop
Elements have a tool that can straighten up scanned images at the click of a
mouse.
Working with Scanner Settings
When you’re ready to scan an image, you’ll find an array of settings, and this
section is here to guide you through them. Setting the resolution probably 
gets the most attention, but your scanner likely has other settings — such as
interpolation, sharpening, blurring/descreening, and halftone — that might
also help you get the best possible scan. Read on to find out what these 
settings do, when they’re useful, and how to set them.

612
Choosing a resolution
What’s the best resolution to use for a particular scan? Note that this is very
different from the question, “What’s the top resolution I want for my scan-
ner?” The thing is, the top resolution available in any scanner is unlikely to
be of much use to you, and the figures the vendors provide don’t really tell
you much about the image quality you get at a given resolution, anyway. (For
more on the sordid tale of how scanner manufacturers play with resolution
numbers, see Book II, Chapter 4.)
Even so, particular tasks have recommended resolutions. Unless you’re
working with a special image, you probably want to keep within the guide-
lines that I lay out in the following sections.
Why not simply use the highest resolution of your scanner at all times and
be done with it? Here are a few reasons why this is a dumb idea:
✦Too much resolution wastes valuable hard drive space. A 4 x 5 image
scanned at 200 samples per inch (spi — the number of points in the
image captured per linear inch) has 800,000 pixels and can be up to
6.4MB in size. (With the image compression provided by file formats
such as TIFF and JPEG, the actual size on your hard drive is likely to be
smaller.) Scan the same image at 2400 spi, and you can end up with a
76.8MB file! It wouldn’t take long to fill up a hard drive with those babies;
even if you archived them to a CD, you’d be able to fit only ten images
on the CD and perhaps only 70 on a DVD. At 200 spi, you can pack 
125 images on the same CD.
Printers measure resolution in dots per inch, and scanners measure it in
samples per inch.
✦High-resolution (hi-res) images take a long time to scan. Depending on
your scanner model, you might be able to scan that 200 spi image in ten
seconds or so, but you’re sure to wait for two or three minutes when
scanning the same photo at 2400 spi.
✦High-resolution scans of prints don’t contain any more useful informa-
tion. This is the most important consideration, when you get right down
to it. When you scan at a resolution higher than you need, all you’re 
capturing is the grain of the paper (see Figure 1-2) or perhaps the film
used to make the print. You’re also getting beautiful close-up details of
any scratches and dust on the original film plus any dust you forgot to
remove before you scanned.
Also keep in mind that you actually need to consider three different 
resolutions:

Book VII
Chapter 1
Scanning Print
Images
Working with Scanner Settings
613
✦The resolution of the scanner that captures the image: I cover scanner
resolution in this chapter.
✦The resolution of the display device that shows the image in your
image editor: Display resolution isn’t something that you can do much
about. You’re probably working with a 17–19" color monitor and have
the display resolution set to anywhere from 1024 x 768 pixels to (in my
case) 1920 x 1440 or thereabouts.
✦The resolution of the output device, such as a printer that you’ll use
to reproduce the image: The resolution of the output device, such as a
600 dpi laser printer, a 1440 dpi inkjet, or a high-resolution image setter,
can affect the resolution you scan at. The higher the resolution of the
output device, the more of your scanner’s resolution that you can actu-
ally put to work.
Here are some guidelines for choosing a resolution for the two most common
kinds of scanning tasks.
Figure 1-2: High resolution can just highlight the grain.
Line art
Line art includes black-and-white or color drawings comprising only solid
lines, dots, or other strokes, with no shading. Artwork that has already been
printed, such as photos clipped from publications, also qualifies as line art

Working with Scanner Settings
614
because although such images might look like photographs, they’re actually
composed of black and white halftone dots.
Line art can usually be scanned effectively at the same resolution that you’ll
use to print the image, or a fraction of it. If a 600 dpi laser printer outputs an
image, use 600 spi. If you’ll be using a 1440 dpi inkjet, consider using 720 spi
(or something close). Doing this allows a 1:1 (or 4:1, if you halve the output
device’s resolution to make your scan) correlation between scanned pixels
and printed dots. This reduces the chance of the stair-step effect known as
jaggies. A 3200 spi scan is shown in Figure 1-3.
Figure 1-3: High-res scans of line art can provide sharp images.
Why not use 1440 spi when outputting to an inkjet printer? You’ll find that the
extra detail isn’t needed, your image file is four times as large (compared with
a lower resolution), and your file takes longer to print. However, if you’re
scanning something that really does have fine details and is so small that you
can avoid mega-file sizes (postage stamps and other small engravings are the
classic example), you can use the higher resolution.

Black-and-white and color photos
Black-and-white and color photos are known as continuous tone images
because they contain a full range of tones from very light to very dark as well
as all the shades in between. Photographs are a whole different ballgame
than line art.
As you scan photos, choose a resolution based on two factors: 
✦What you plan to do with the photo and whether you’ll be manipulating
it in an image editor
✦Whether you plan to enlarge it
For example, a print destined for a Web page might look just fine scanned at
75 spi because 75 spi is all you need for screen resolution. The same original
scanned for reproduction using a printer should be scanned at around
150–200 spi. If you intend to manipulate the photo in your image editor or
reproduce it at a size that’s larger than the picture’s original dimensions,
use a higher resolution: perhaps 300 spi. Notice that none of these recom-
mendations approaches the 1200–2400 spi top resolution of most scanners.
High resolutions simply aren’t required for photographs.
Most books about image editing, and even some scanning books, provide
you with arcane formulas that you can use to calculate scanning resolutions
for photos. These are usually based on the halftone frequency (the number of
lines of halftone dots per inch in the “screen” used to create the halftoned
version of your photograph). These formulas are needlessly complex. Who,
other than professional photographers and other professional graphics
workers, actually knows whether a photograph will be printed using an 
85-line screen or a 133-line screen or some other frequency?
Today, digital photographers don’t have to worry about these details. The
halftoning is automatically handled by the printer driver that resides in your
computer, and you don’t need to know much about what’s happening. If you
scan a photo at 150–200 spi (or up to 300 spi if enlarging it), you’ll get good
results most of the time. The real pitfall is scanning at too high a resolution,
which wastes your time and hard drive space. Your concern will probably
focus more on how to remove moiré effects, discussed in the “Blurring/
descreening” section, later in this chapter.
Many newer scanners can actually calculate an optimal resolution for you. You
tell the scanner software what type of destination your image is intended for
(Web page, laser printer, imagesetter, and so forth) and select a size for the
image (50%, 100%, and so forth). Based on this information, the scanner then
chooses the right resolution for you.

616
Interpolate, schmerpolate
I might as well tackle the topic of interpolation because you’re going to
e-mail me and ask about it anyway. Questions about scanner interpolation
are the second-most-common queries (after resolution) that I have received
in the last decade.
Interpolation isn’t limited to scanners, of course. You would think so only
because scanner vendors like to trumpet their products’ interpolation
prowess in their specifications lists. Interpolation is a process used to create
new pixels any time an image is made larger or smaller or changed to a color
depth other than the one at which it was captured.
Photoshop uses interpolation all the time. If you enlarge or reduce an image,
Photoshop has to create more pixels (when you enlarge) or fewer pixels
(when you reduce) to represent the same image. Photoshop also needs to
come up with a new set of pixels when you change an image from, say, 24 bits
at full color to 8 bits and 256 colors. Within Photoshop, interpolation is almost
always a bad thing (even if it’s a necessary thing) because you always lose
some quality when your image editor obliterates real, actual pixels and
replaces them with best-guess estimates. You should, therefore, try to retain
your image at its original resolution (such as the resolution it was taken at
with your digital camera) until you absolutely have to resize it. And always
keep an unedited version of the file to fall back on, should you need to!
Sometimes, the term interpolation is reserved for making larger images from
a given resolution. You’ll see the term downsampling to describe the type of
interpolation used to produce a smaller image. I’m not particularly fussy about
terminology that’s not often used correctly anyway, so I use interpolation to
mean both enlarging and reducing images or scans.
When scanning, interpolation isn’t quite as evil because the scanner is 
working with the original image and can avoid some of the quality loss
that plagues your image editor.
Some sort of scanner interpolation takes place whenever you scan at any-
thing other than the native resolution of the scanner. That means if you’re
using a 1200 spi scanner and scan at 2400 spi, the scanner actually captures
1200 samples per inch but creates 1200 new pixels to make the resolution
seem higher. The same scanner at 300 spi must figure out which 300 pixels
per inch best represent the full 1200 spi scan.
Actually, when scanning in even fractions or increments of the scanner’s
optical resolution, the results are usually quite good. The problems start
when you try to scan at odd resolutions like 5000 spi or 332 spi.
As the scanner interpolates an image, it doesn’t simply duplicate pixels
(say, doubling all the pixels in a 1200 spi scan to produce a 2400 spi image)
or throw away pixels (to create a 600 spi scan). Instead, the interpolation 

Book VII
Chapter 1
Scanning Print
Images
Working with Scanner Settings
617
algorithm examines the pixels surrounding the new pixel and produces one
with characteristics that closely match the transition between the pixels.
That is, if one pixel is dark tone and the next pixel is light tone, a medium-tone
pixel is created to insert between them, as shown in Figure 1-4.
Figure 1-4: Interpolation examines the pixels in the top line and creates the new pixels in the
bottom line.
Interpolation is not all smoke and mirrors. A good interpolation algorithm
can accurately calculate the pixels that would have been captured by the
scanner if it had been able to scan at the interpolated resolution used. That
is, you do get additional information through interpolation. However, there
are diminishing returns. A 9600 x 9600 spi interpolated image is not eight
times as sharp as one scanned at a true 1200 spi resolution.
Following are the most common interpolation algorithms, which have official
names:
✦Nearest Neighbor: With the Nearest Neighbor algorithm, the new pixels
are created by examining the pixel nearest where the new pixel will go.
This works fine with line art, in which the pixels change in predictable
ways. However, the method doesn’t allow for the fine and random 
gradations of tones found in photographs.
✦Bilinear: This algorithm examines the pixels on either side of the target
pixel and produces better quality images than the Nearest Neighbor
method, although it is a little slower.
✦Bicubic: The slowest commonly used method is also the best. Bicubic
resampling uses sophisticated formulas to calculate the new pixel based
on the pixels found above, below, and to either side of the new pixel.
Photoshop CS2 and the latest version of Elements have two new interpola-
tion options: Bicubic Smoother and Bicubic Sharper. These can be used to
fine-tune the most popular interpolation algorithm, making it (you guessed it)
either smoother or sharper than the unadorned Bicubic version.

618
Sharpening
You might think of sharpening as a way to increase the resolution of an
image without boosting its file size. That’s not exactly true. All scanners
include optional sharpening routines to enhance images as they are
scanned. (In most cases, leaving this feature turned on is a good idea.)
Sharpening actually only increases the apparent resolution of an image by
increasing the contrast between pixels, but it works very well.
In use, a scanner’s sharpening routines examine squares of pixels that are,
say, 5 pixels on a side. Depending on the values of the other 24 pixels in the
square, the scanner might (or might not) darken or lighten the center pixel
to increase the contrast between that pixel and its neighbors. If the scanner
determines that there is a significant difference in contrast between the center
pixel and its neighbors, it can increase the contrast even further, making the
pixel look sharper, at least in relation to its neighbors. The sharpening 
algorithms look at every pixel in an image as it relates to its neighboring
pixels and increase the contrast as appropriate to enhance the sharpness.
Pixels that are included in “edges” in your image are lightened or darkened
to make them more distinct, as shown in Figure 1-5.
Figure 1-5: Higher contrast (right) can equal extra sharpness.
Because sharpening brings out details that are present in an image but that
the scanner can’t see otherwise, sharpening really can enhance the apparent
resolution of the final image. That’s why sharpening in the scanner is probably

Book VII
Chapter 1
Scanning Print
Images
Working with Scanner Settings
619
useful when making most scans. Don’t overuse it with photographs, however,
because the extra contrast can be objectionable.
Blurring/descreening
The opposite side of the sharpening coin is a common scanner feature called
descreening. Descreening is used when you scan an image that has already
been printed and that contains halftone dots, such as those found in newspa-
pers, magazines, yearbooks, and other publications. The process blurs the
image slightly by reducing the contrast between the edges (in this case, the
dots) and tends to make the halftone dots merge together.
In practice, I’ve found that descreening settings in most scanners tend to
overdo the blurring, and you can get much better scans of halftones by doing
the blur yourself in Photoshop or another image editor, as shown in Figure 1-6.
Descreening can also help you avoid the moiré effect (an objectionable pattern
caused by interference between the arrangement of the original halftone
screen and the pixels in the scanned image).
Figure 1-6: You can usually produce better descreened halftones, 
like the one at bottom, in your image editor.

Working with Scanner Settings
620
Knowing when to halftone
Scanners sometimes have a halftone setting that lets you apply the halftone
dots at the time the scan is made. If you know what size your printed image
will be and what device will print the image, you can specify a halftone pat-
tern that the scanner can apply.
This is generally not a good idea, and most scanners don’t support this fea-
ture anymore. Because all the continuous-tone information is lost, you can’t
edit the image or scale it to a different size.
You can also apply the halftone dots in your image editor. Photoshop lets
you apply various dot and dithering schemes, and this might be the choice
of sophisticated users who know exactly what they want and need. This was
even a good idea back when printers could reproduce only 300 dpi.
In most cases, however, simply letting your printer apply the halftone dots
is best. Laser printers today usually have resolutions of 600 dpi and up,
and they have a lot more dots to work with when creating halftone dots
(360,000 per square inch with a 600 dpi printer versus a mere 90,000 dots per
square inch with a 300 dpi printer).
Other scanner controls
When you’re scanning prints, other controls at your disposal might include
automatic and manual exposure controls, fancy charts called histograms that
let you compensate for tonal variations in your photos, color-correcting tools,
or even a densitometer that lets you measure precisely the lightness, darkness,
and color values of your image before you scan. Which of these should you be
concerned with? Some controls actually duplicate similar features found in
your image editor. How can you decide? Here are some guidelines:
✦If you’re in a big hurry and need to scan only a couple photos, use your
scanner’s automatic features and don’t worry about fine-tuning your
scan. You can do that later in your image editor.
✦If your original image is of good quality, your scanner’s auto settings will
work well. You might not even need to make corrections in your image
editor.
✦If quality is very important and your original is a difficult one, use your
scanner’s controls to get the best original image possible because a
good scan enables you to get better results. For example, color correc-
tion in an image editor can never add colors that are missing from the
scan. However, you might be able to make adjustments with the scanner
to grab those colors when the image is captured.

Book VII
Chapter 1

Images
Working with Scanner Settings
621
✦If you’re scanning a group of images with the same problems, it often
makes sense to use your scanner’s controls to correct the problem once
and then scan each successive image using the same settings. Applying
the same tonal or color corrections to a large group of images in an
image editor can be tedious.
✦Your scanner might have controls not found in your image editor. For
example, my scanning software has Image Type controls that I can use to
precisely set the exact type of image being scanned. My choices include
Evening, Landscape, Skin Tones, Night, Snow, and Shadow. The scanner
has built-in settings for those types of photos, and I can choose an
appropriate image type to apply the settings before I ever make a scan.
✦You want to use automated features that make your scans go faster.
For example, my scanning software has choices for output resolution
that include Newspaper, Magazine, Art Print, Photo Print, and others. I
can choose a destination and let the software choose the resolution for
the scan.
A great deal of your flexibility depends on the scanning software you use.
Some scanning applications are fully automated, which means they collect
information during a prescan and then determine the kind of image (that is, a
color photo, grayscale photo, or line art), the proper exposure, and even
what resolution to use. Other software lets you make these settings yourself.
I like to use automation when it is likely to give me a good scan as long as I
can use manual settings when I need to. For example, my favorite scanning
software lets me choose a color filter to scan through. That’s a great tool for
removing stains from a spoiled black-and-white photograph.
For example, if there’s a greenish stain on the photo (who knows where that
came from?), I can choose to scan through a light green filter. The green stain
is invisible to the scanner through the green filter, so the stain fades away.
(The filter is simulated by manipulating the red, green, and blue information
of a full-color scan.) Meanwhile, the details in red and blue are made darker
and more visible. This works because the light green filter blocks only some
of the red and blue. (If it really let only green light through, the red and blue
tones would appear as black.)
Or, I might have a page with blue ledger lines and faded reddish text, as
shown in Figure 1-7. I can use a light blue filter to make the lines vanish,
simultaneously making the reddish text darker because the blue filter passes
all the blue light but blocks some of the red (and green). This technique is
great for scanning legal and family records, deeds, and similar documents.
Scanner controls can save your bacon if you know how to use them effectively.

ith the introduction in the past few years of $200–$300 scanners
designed especially for film, slide and negative scanning has finally
come of age. If you have a collection of 35mm slides or discover a treasure
trove of family negatives, you can now bring them into the digital
realm easily and inexpensively. Although film’s days as a pri-
mary snapshot medium are numbered, there’s no reason
why you can’t enjoy working with your film-originated
photos in your image editor.
Scanning old photos, slides, and negatives is a
great way to preserve and share your family his-
tory, especially when you restore the images using
the techniques described in the next chapter and
elsewhere in this book. Your great-great-great-
grandchildren will love you for it!
Of course, scanning prints and other opaque docu-
ments (or reflective originals) is far more common than
scanning transparent originals, such as slides and nega-
tives. In fact, most scanners can’t handle anything but reflec-
tive originals. Sometimes, however, your only copy of an image is
a transparency or negative. Other times, you might have both a hard copy
reflective original and a transparency or negative film version, but the film is
a better choice for scanning because film is usually in better condition and
contains all the information originally captured. (You find out the difference
between reflective and film originals in the “Examining Different Types of
Film Originals” section, later in this chapter.)

Film and Photography
624
Scanning film is not quite as intuitive a process as grabbing an image from 
a print. You can’t slap the slide or negative down on the glass and press a
button to begin scanning. Some of the same prep work I describe in Book VII,
Chapter 1 is necessary, and you have additional considerations to think about
as well. This chapter helps you put slide and negative scanning in perspective
and offers some tips for getting the best results.
Film and Photography
Although film has long been a key part of the photographic process, the
casual snapshooter has never given film itself much thought ever since the
late 1960s. In the past three decades, “film” has come to mean those pesky
strips, discs, slides, or canisters that you had to find when you wanted to
have the best-quality print of pictures that had already been processed.
Film became a necessary means to a desired end.
By the end of the film era, a sparkling color print for sharing or display
became that desired end. As proof, consider your own pre-digital photo-
graphic work. You probably have prints filed away in albums and other prints
in frames on your piano or over the fireplace. There are prints in your wallet
and perhaps a few stuck to your kitchen appliances with magnets. The prints
you aren’t using right now are probably stacked in shoe boxes. But do you
have any notion at all where the negatives used to make those prints are?
Of course you don’t, despite the valiant efforts of film manufacturers and
photofinishers to provide you with film storage envelopes or, in the case of
the Advanced Photo System, permanent archiving in the same cassette used
in your camera. Unless you’re the fastidious type, when you want a reprint of
a favorite picture, you probably take a print down to your finisher and have
a copy made. Film is pretty useless, right?
Actually, film made photography as we know it possible. Until George
Eastman introduced the first commercial transparent roll film in 1889, ama-
teur photography was a daunting hobby indeed, pretty much limited to
dry plates and other clumsy media that ordinarily only a professional pho-
tographer would be willing to mess with. For the hobbyist, photography
was a daunting and potentially expensive hobby.
Black-and-white negative film made it possible to produce compact and
more affordable cameras that anyone could use. By 1936, color photos (in
the form of Kodachrome slides) became feasible, and in 1942, Kodacolor film
for prints made the modern color snapshot possible. Is it a coincidence that
the modern refrigerator, now universally used to display these prints, was
invented at roughly the same time? I don’t think so.

Why Scan Film?
625
Amateur photographers used a mixture of color slides, black-and-white film/
prints, and color film/prints to capture their memories for several decades
until automated, low-cost color printing in the ’70s (and the ubiquitous mini-
lab in the ’80s) finally relegated both color slides and black-and-white prints
to professional photographers and serious amateurs.
Today, if you take pictures, you either use a color print film (and end up 
with prints) or work with a digital camera (and end up with electronic
images and prints). If you have slides or negatives to scan, you are probably
a serious amateur or professional photographer or need to convert an older
stash of film originals to digital form.
Why Scan Film?
One reason why you might scan film is that it’s the only form of an image you
have. You might not have a print at all, or the print you do have might be too
small or might have suffered some damage. Scanning even a well-made 4 x 5
print won’t yield the same detail you can get from a high-quality scan of an
original negative or slide. The original always has more information than a
second-generation copy, such as a print.
If you still shoot film regularly, you’ll find lots of good reasons to shoot either
slide film or print film and then scan the respective positives/negatives. Slide
film — for the creative control it offers you — is the choice of professionals for
a reason. What you shoot is what you get. When you shoot color negative film,
the prints you get might vary significantly from what you saw through your
viewfinder. For example, if you deliberately underexpose a shot to produce a
silhouette effect, the automated printing system at your photofinisher will try
to thwart your creative efforts by pumping extra light on your print. Instead of
a silhouette, you get a washed-out image with highlights that are too bright.
Figure 2-1 shows a typical image that has suffered these vagaries. Because the
lab printed for the dark shadows, they are rendered lighter, while washing out
the sunset. Scan the negative and make a print yourself, and you can optimize
the image for the dramatic sunset, as shown in the right half of Figure 2-1. 
Or maybe you took a picture at sunset and are surprised when the reddish
colors you remember are printed a little bluer than you’d like by the auto-
mated machinery. And try as hard as you like, Kentucky bluegrass is going to
come out green.
However, when you shoot slide film, what you see is what you get. If the
film is processed well and if you were using the proper film for the lighting
conditions, your image appears exactly as you composed and focused it.
You can then scan your slide and get the exact picture you visualized.

and adjust your print to get the dramatic rendition you really want (right).
All this fuss probably makes you realize exactly how great digital photography
is: You can take pictures the way you want them and never have to worry
about your photofinisher messing with your vision. In one sense, slide film 
is the closest thing to digital imaging available. Transparencies can make a
valuable complement to digital cameras for photographers who want the most
versatility in their image-capturing options.
Scanning Options
If you want to scan transparencies or negatives, you have four primary
options (ignoring the truly professional alternatives, such as drum scanners,
which aren’t available to the amateur digital photographer). I list them in
order of descending quality.
Let the pros do it
Your photofinisher is equipped with high-resolution scanners that can convert
your slides or negatives to a digital format. They can deliver the finished prod-
uct to you on a high-resolution Photo CD (now available from a very limited
number of labs, sometimes as a special-order item) or a lower-resolution
Kodak Picture CD. Going this route is a good idea for several reasons:
✦No equipment to buy: If you have an archive of film originals to convert
and don’t plan to scan slides or negatives on a regular basis, you’ll find it
economical to use your photofinisher’s equipment and personnel instead.

Scanning Options
627
✦Better quality: The pros have better equipment than you’re likely to pur-
chase and can give you better overall quality.
✦Less time: I scan slides and negatives all the time. It’s time-consuming.
After you’ve spent most of an afternoon scanning 30 or 40 slides, you’ll
wonder why you ever wanted to do the job yourself.
✦Lower cost: Unless you have a ton of film originals to scan on a continu-
ing basis, it will take you a very, very long time to amortize the cost of a
good slide scanner compared with the small fee your finisher will charge
for each scan.
Buy a slide scanner
Dedicated slide scanners are high-resolution devices designed specifically
for scanning slides, transparencies, and negatives. With the new breed of
inexpensive film scanners, just about anyone can justify one of these beasts.
There are some advantages to choosing this method, too:
✦Customized quality: Although your photofinisher will give you standard-
ized results that look good, you might want to scan a particular original in
a particular way to produce the exact image you want. Perhaps the infor-
mation in the highlights is most important, and you don’t care whether
the shadows go black. Perhaps you want to scan only a particular portion
of the original. If you have your own slide scanner, you can customize
your scan to meet your own creative needs.
✦Quicker turnaround time: I tell colleagues that I scan my own trans-
parencies because of the turnaround time. My scanner sits on a table
behind me, so all I have to do is turn around. I can have a scan on my
screen in five minutes; if I used a photofinisher, I’d probably have to wait
a week to get my results. If you’re in a hurry, making your own scans is
definitely faster.
✦Lower cost for higher volumes: If you do your own scans, your biggest
costs are the scanner and your own time. If you make many scans of
slides and negatives over time, your in-house capability will eventually
pay for itself if you factor in the time you expend running to the photo-
finisher. It takes a lot of scans to pay for a dedicated scanner, but serious
amateurs and professionals can justify their expenditure more quickly
than they realize. (Don’t forget the fun factor, too.)
Use a transparency-capable flatbed
Many flatbed scanners come with a slide-scanning attachment (chiefly a
light source to transilluminate [shine light through] the originals) and have
sufficient resolution and dynamic range to do a decent job scanning slides.
This option has a few advantages:

Scanning Options
628
✦Lower cost: There’s no expensive dedicated slide scanner to buy. You
can find flatbed scanners that can grab decent film images for $200 or
even less.
✦Acceptable quality: If “good enough” is good enough, you’ll find that
flatbeds do give you enough quality to work with. You can still do some
of the same customization steps with your scanner that make the dedi-
cated slide scanner attractive. Hey, it beats paying a gazillion dollars for
a slide scanner, doesn’t it?
✦Quicker turnaround: Again, just turn around and scan your slide or neg-
ative. No running to the photofinisher.
Figure 2-2 shows a typical scanner with a built-in transparency light source.
Figure 2-2: Some scanners have transparency light sources 
built into the lid.
Try the Rube Goldberg approach
Before I ever had a slide scanner or flatbed with a transparency attachment,
I was happily scanning my own slides by using my own cobbled-together
apparatus. All you really need to scan film originals is a flatbed scanner with
high-enough resolution to do a decent job with small pieces of film (probably
a minimum of 1200 samples per inch [spi]); a carrier of some sort to hold the
film or slide flat against the scanner glass while blocking off other stray rays
of light; and a broad, even, diffuse white light source.

I don’t recommend such arrangements if you plan to do much film scanning,
but if you’re in a pinch, you might see what you can put together. Rube
Goldberg would be proud.
I don’t list bullet-point advantages of this approach because other than cost
and the sheer joy of the do-it-yourself experience, there aren’t any.
However, you can try to copy film by using your digital camera and a home-
made rig if you’re very daring. A few camera vendors offer slide copying
attachments for their digital cameras, usually the digital single lens reflex
(dSLR) versions. They can cost $100 or less and give decent results if your
expectations aren’t high. The more resolution your digital camera has, the
better your results will be.
Examining Different Types of Film Originals
To successfully scan film originals, you need to understand the differences
between prints, negatives, slides, and transparencies. I summarize them in
this section.
Prints
You already know about scanning prints if you used the tips in Book VII,
Chapter 1. However, it’s useful to go a little deeper into prints (so to speak)
so that you can better understand the challenges that film originals present.
Do-it-yourself limitations
You’ll probably run into some limitations when
scanning film yourself using an inexpensive slide
and negative scanner or when using your flatbed
scanner. Here are a few things to keep in mind:
 35mm only: The least expensive dedicated
film scanners handle only 35mm and smaller
film formats. If you have 620/120 roll film or
sheet film, like those used in old box-and-
view cameras, twin-lens reflexes, or even
“press cameras,” you won’t be able to scan
it yourself. Dedicated film scanners that work
with larger sizes typically cost $1,000 or more.
 Size limitations: Even flatbed scanners that
can capture film can probably scan only 
limited sizes. Perhaps your unit can accom-
modate up to 21⁄4" wide film (6cm) but no
larger. If you’re lucky, you may have a flatbed
that works with 4 x 5 or 5 x 7 sheet film.
 Dust busting limitations: More expensive
scanners use a sophisticated feature called
Digital ICE to remove dust from film. This
hardware/software combination is actually
able to discern dust spots on film and remove
them without degrading the rest of the image.
Lower-cost scanners might have some sort
of software “dust brush” that actually blurs
the image a bit.

Examining Different Types of Film Originals
630
Prints consist of color dyes (or a black-and-white emulsion in the case of
monochrome prints) coated on a substrate of paper or plastic. You view
prints by the light that passes through the dyes or emulsion and reflects
back to your eyes. Scanners capture images of prints in much the same
manner, using sensors instead of eyeballs.
Every print has light areas, dark areas, and tones in between. The lightest
areas with detail (minimum density, called Dmin by the techies) can be no
lighter than the whiteness of the paper itself. For that reason, photographic
manufacturers are constantly looking for ways to produce whiter and brighter
papers. The very darkest areas with detail (maximum density, called Dmax) are
determined by how much light the dyes or emulsion can absorb. The better
the Dmax, the darker the dark areas of a print appear to be.
The difference between the very lightest areas and very darkest areas is the
dynamic range, or tonal range, of the photo. Even the best photographic
papers don’t have whites that reflect all the light back to our eyes (only a
mirror can do that) or blacks that absorb all the light (only a black hole does
that). Thus, the dynamic range of a print is fairly limited. No print comes
close to taxing the dynamic capabilities of a scanner.
Slides
The term slide is usually applied to a 35mm transparency that has been cut
from the film strip and placed in a mount so that it can be inserted in a slide
projector. Larger film sizes can also be mounted and projected this way, but
they usually aren’t (except in the case of large overhead transparencies used
in schools and businesses).
Slides, like the other transparent
media that I describe next, have 
an interesting characteristic when
compared with prints: Slides are not
usually viewed by reflected light
(at least, in the strictest sense).
Slides, transparencies, and negatives
are lit from behind (transilluminated)
and viewed by the light that passes
through them. Of course, a slide can
be projected onto a screen and
viewed by the light that reflects off
the screen, but that’s another matter.
You can view any slide quite well by
shining a diffuse light through it and
viewing it directly, as shown in
Figure 2-3.
Figure 2-3: View any transparency just by
shining light through it.

The limitations of the substrate don’t apply to slides. That is, where a very
white piece of paper might reflect 75–80 percent of the light striking it, a
slide can easily pass almost 100 percent of the illumination (in the clear or
almost-clear areas). The dynamic range of a slide is likely to be much, much
greater than that of a print. You can easily find detail in the lightest areas 
of the slide as well as detail in the darkest areas. That presents a challenge 
to the scanner: It must have an extended dynamic range that’s capable of
registering both those bright details and dark details. For a longer discussion
of dynamic range and scanners, see Book II, Chapter 4.
Transparencies
In one sense, color transparencies are nothing more than color slides without
the slide mount. You can even ask your photofinisher to process your 35mm
slide film but not mount it, if you want, giving you long strips of 24mm x 36mm
transparencies.
Transparencies come in other sizes, too. The most common roll film sizes
are 21⁄4 x 21⁄4 inches (now more commonly referred to as 6 x 6cm), 21⁄4 x 23⁄4 inches
(6 x 7cm), 21⁄4 x 31⁄2 inches (6 x 9cm), and so forth. Transparencies also are
available as sheets of film in 4 x 5, 5 x 7, 8 x 10, and 11 x 14 sizes (among
others).
You also see very large transparencies used for advertising displays in large
light boxes, up to the mammoth 60'-wide Kodak Colorama (“The World’s
Largest Photograph”), which graced the east balcony inside Grand Central
Station in New York City from 1950 to 1990.
Black-and-white or color negatives
Negatives are the film that can be used to make prints (and also film positives,
including slides, if you want to go that way). They have a reversed image, with
the dark areas of the subject appearing light in the negative, and vice versa.
In a color negative, the colors are also reversed, so blues appear to be yellow,
reds appear to be cyan, and greens appear to be magenta.
There’s an additional complication in the orange mask that overlays all color
negative films, which exists to provide better separation of the colors when
printed on photographic paper. Because a scanner doesn’t respond to the
light passing through a color negative the way color paper does, there’s no
need for the mask, which has to be removed during the scan. Things get
interesting because different vendors’ color films have different types of
orange masks. Photofinishers compensate for these by using filter packs
designed for a particular type of film. Any negative-capable scanner has set-
tings to accomplish the same thing.

Examining Different Types of Film Originals
632
Like color slides and transparencies, negatives have the same long dynamic
range. That makes them much better for making prints but increases the
challenges your scanner faces in capturing all that extended information.
Exotica
As your reputation for old photo restoration magic grows, you’ll be called
upon to scan and fix up some really old, faded pictures of a rather exotic
(for our 21st-century eyes) nature. These can include old daguerreotypes,
silver prints, 19th-century glass plates, or even tintypes like the one shown
in a wretched, unrestored version at top in Figure 2-4, and a wretched, 
partially restored version at bottom.
Figure 2-4: Family members who discovered this old damaged tintype (top) were pleased 
when even a small amount of the picture information was able to be restored.

Although these old photos were captured using different technologies, they
all share some common attributes. First, they may be housed in folders,
glued to cardboard, or tucked away in frames. You’ll need to be very careful
when removing them for scanning to avoid damaging the picture.
Second, it’s very likely that the old pictures will be faded, dark, or low in con-
trast. You’ll want to increase the contrast and sharpness in your scanner’s
controls, if possible, because the improvements you make can sometimes
be even better than what you could achieve later in your image editor.
That’s because the scanner is working with the original material.
Finally, your old photos probably have dust spots, pits, mottling, and other
defects that can’t be removed by scanning alone. Your best bet is to try to
correct these problems in your image editor. It’s a good idea to scan the
photo several times using different tonality settings. You’ll end up with sev-
eral versions, each with different details brought out. You can combine the
best portions of each to create one finished photo.
Scanning Film
If I haven’t scared you off scanning slides, transparencies, and negatives by
now, it’s time to get to work. You need to refer to the instruction manual for
your scanner and the slide scanning software for the exact steps to follow,
but here are some general tips.
Prepping the film
You absolutely must make sure the film is clean, particularly if you are scan-
ning a 35mm slide or negative. Sometimes dust settles on the film when it’s
still wet and becomes embedded in the emulsion side; sometimes film just gets
plain dusty. Because small film images are enlarged many times as you work
with them, you magnify the size of the dust or other artifacts at the same time.
For example, a 24mm x 36mm transparency enlarged to 5 x 7 inches is blown
up to roughly five times its original size — and each tiny dust mote is visible
when magnified that much.
Dust on either transparencies or negatives appears as dark black dots when
scanned, of course, because the dots block the light from passing through to
the sensor. However, when scanning a negative, you reverse the negative
image to create a positive, turning the dust spot into a white speck. Tiny
white specks can blend in with lighter areas of your image a little and are
fairly easy to retouch out of the dark areas. (That’s not to imply that you can
go ahead and scan dusty negatives.) Dust on transparencies shows up as
dark spots that are very visible and unsightly, so you should take extra care
to make sure your transparencies are extremely clean when you scan them.

Scanning Film
634
Clean dust from either a transparency or negative with a soft brush, an ear
syringe, or a blast of canned air. Be careful not to allow the residual dust to
scratch your soft film as you remove it. That’s why soft brushes and air are
your best tools. Figure 2-5 shows a typical slide scanner’s film carriage. Dust
off the film after you mount it in the carrier.
Figure 2-5: Dust off your film after inserting it in the scanner’s carrier.
Film always has two sides: an emulsion side (where the image information 
is stored) and a base side. The emulsion side is usually dull looking when
compared with the shiny base side. If you’re somewhere that is fully lit, you
can tell which is which by holding the film sideways and looking across the
film. If you view a strip of negatives, you’ll find that the film curls toward the
emulsion side. If you plan to scan a Kodachrome slide, the emulsion side
appears to be etched.
There is another way to tell which side is the emulsion side, and it works
even in total darkness, but you’re not going to like it. Back in my darkroom
days, when I wanted to know which was the emulsion side of a piece of film
or photographic paper, I’d put an edge between my lips. The emulsion side
sticks to your lip. If you want to test this out, don’t slobber all over the
image area of an important image.
You can sometimes remove stubborn artifacts by soaking the film in distilled
water. However, this works only if the dust hasn’t replaced some of the image-
forming part of the emulsion. In addition, the water removes the protective

chemical applied to color film as a last step (black-and-white film is simply
washed and allowed to dry after processing), so you need some of that solu-
tion if you want your film to last after cleaning. As you might guess, washing
film should be done only as a last resort and only by those who know what
they’re doing. In the olden days, photographers used to do wild and crazy
things with film to make it printable, including soaking it in oil to mask
scratches and printing it “wet.”
Performing the scan
When your film is clean and you’re ready to start scanning, here are the
steps to follow:
1. Place the film on or in the scanner (depending on whether you’re
using a flatbed scanner or a dedicated film scanner) in a holder
designed for it.
The holder masks off the areas outside the image portion of the film.
This is an important step that reduces the possibility of stray light strik-
ing the sensor, thus reducing the amount of contrast in your image.
2. Insert the film in the holder so that the emulsion side of the film is
facing the sensor.
You want the light to pass through the film’s base side and leave through
the emulsion side. If you do the reverse, the light passes through the
emulsion and is then diffused by the base side, giving you an image that
is less sharp than it might be.
3. Make sure you’ve done whatever is necessary to turn on your flatbed
scanner’s transparency light source.
Usually, this step is performed in the scanning software. If you’re scan-
ning a color negative, your scanning software has a dialog box, like the
one shown in Figure 2-6, that lets you specify what brand and type of
color film is being scanned. That ensures that the orange mask and other
characteristics of that particular color negative film are dialed into the
scanning software. You’ll find the brand name of the film printed along
the edge of the film itself.
4. First do a prescan, which is the step that all scanner software pro-
vides to let you capture a preview image before doing the main scan.
While you’re viewing the prescanned image, your scanning software
might offer various controls that let you choose black points and white
points (the darkest and lightest areas of the image that contain image
information).

Scanning Film
636
Figure 2-6: Choose your film brand and type to optimize the scan.
5. Make any corrections that are appropriate by using the dust removal,
sharpening, brightness, contrast, and tonal controls of your scanner
software.
The options vary widely from program to program.
6. Set the black points and white points and then choose your 
resolution.
If you’re making an important scan, you’ll want to choose the highest
optical resolution your flatbed scanner provides, typically 1200 to 
2400 spi. A dedicated film scanner has resolution choices in the 2700 to
4000 spi range (and up). You can choose the setting recommended for
the size of film you’re scanning.
Be prepared for a long wait while the scanner painstakingly captures all
that detail, and for the size of the file you end up with. A good scan of
a transparency is a beautiful thing to behold, so I can assure you it’s
worth the wait!

Fixes for Vintage Photos
In This Chapter

 Replacing what’s been lost to rips, tears, and deep scratches
T
his chapter concentrates on fixing up vintage photos. After all, vintage
photos present a unique situation. They’re often the most cherished yet
the least cared-for photos we have. I don’t know about you, but I have boxes
of them in my house, and I’d despair for weeks if they were lost. But am I
storing them properly and making sure they don’t get damp, too dry, too
hot, and so on? Nope. So they’re precious to me, but I don’t have the
time to put them all into acid-free paper photo albums or frame
them, and the boxes keep getting moved around, stored
wherever there’s room, with no regard for the tempera-
ture or humidity. Inside the boxes, the photos are
scuffing each other every time the box is moved.
So what can I do? Of course, the first step is to
properly store and archive them, but in addition
to or in lieu of that, I can scan them, store the
scanned files in my computer, use image editing
software to clean them up, and then print them.
The printed digital versions can be kept in frames,
hung on the wall or stood up on the piano, with no
fear of sun damage, because they can always be
reprinted. I can give them as gifts and store the really
precious ones in a safe place so that I always have a backup
of the last known picture of my great-great-great-grandmother
should anything happen to the original. Better yet, I can make copies on
multiple CDs or DVDs and store them in several different locations (such as
a safety deposit box) to guard against even the worst-case scenarios.
If this sounds like a good plan to you — and I assume it does or you wouldn’t
be reading about restoring old photos — then read on. In this chapter, I
explain some common solutions to all-too-common problems — photos that
show the signs of age, wear, and tear. If you need to get your old photos into
digital form, check out the material on scanning in Book VII, Chapter 2.

Repairing Vintage Photos: The Basics
638
Repairing Vintage Photos: The Basics
Vintage photographs present some very common problems, some of which
are explored in earlier chapters. Over time, the image fades because of age,
developing procedures, the paper it was printed on, or exposure to the sun,
extreme heat, or dampness. Dampness can cause even more harm because it
can cause mold to grow, which eats away the coating on the photos and can
damage the paper as well. In many cases, multiple culprits have been and
are at work, and you’ll have multiple problems — faded image content along
with scuffs, scratches, stains, mold, dust, and outright damage in the form of
rips, tears, and missing corners. Some old images may be in the form of
slides or negatives, which have their own deterioration problems. 
Figure 3-1 shows a vintage photo that
was originally glued to a piece of card-
board. Over time, the cardboard dried
out, and one of the corners has cracked
and fallen off. The image itself is quite
faded; the original crisp blacks and
whites are now very muted shades 
of gray.
When faced with an image like this, you
need to perform a little triage. What do
you do first? Improve the color? Replace
the corner? Clean up the scratches and
scuff marks? It really depends on the
location and severity of the problems
and which problems bother you the
most.
Consider these ideas for how to
approach an image with multiple 
problems:
✦If multiple problems appear in a
single area, solving one might
solve the other(s). Consider a torn
corner with a big stain along the
tear. If you paste content from the opposite corner over it (rotating the
pasted content, of course), you might get rid of the stain, too (assuming
that the other corner isn’t similarly stained). You find out how to replace
torn or missing content later in this chapter.
✦If a portion of the edge or frame is missing, try to crop out the damaged
part. When you can crop around the image, you eliminate the need to
replace the missing corner or side. Of course, you have to consider
Figure 3-1: Faded, worn, and torn old
photos often present multiple problems.

Book VII

whether the missing portion includes part of the image that is important
to its composition. Figure 3-2 shows an image that can be cropped to just
the important parts, eliminating hours of restoration work that would
have been spent rebuilding the damaged mat the image was glued to.
Figure 3-2: Crop away the damaged edges, leaving a cleaner, 
neater image.
If you can’t crop, how bad is the damage? Does it lend an air of history to
the picture? Part of the charm of vintage photos is that they look old. The
places, people, clothes, scenery, and architecture all add to that charm.
So if the photo itself looks like it was taken in 1897, what’s the harm in that?
If the damage is on someone’s face or across the front of the family home,
yes, try to fix it. If the damage is on the periphery or doesn’t detract from
the overall appeal of the image, consider leaving it alone.
✦Tackle structural problems first. First, replace that missing corner or fill
in that the hole or deep crack in the photo. Then go about improving
color quality, eliminating tiny scratches and spots, or bringing out detail
lost to fading or bad lighting. You’ll find more information on replacing
missing or damaged content later in this chapter.
✦Work slowly and deliberately. Don’t try to work fast or do too many
things at once. Your results show your approach, and a slap-dash job
leaves you with a slap-dash photo. If the picture is that precious or his-
torically important, it’s worth laboring over, zooming in to get things
right, editing pixel by pixel.
When restoring photos, you probably want to go against my advice in Book
VII, Chapters 1 and 2, in which I say that high resolutions aren’t needed for
scanning photographs. Scanning a photo for restoration is a special case.
You may want to scan at a fairly high resolution of 600 samples per inch (spi)
or more. You can always reduce file size later when optimizing a photo for

use on the Web, or if you need to send the file via e-mail or store it on some
low-density media.
By scanning it at a high resolution, you get all the color, light, and texture
information possible, and all that information gives you more to work with.
If you scan at a lower resolution, and a face’s features have been lost to
time, you won’t have as many colors and details to work with as you rebuild
that face. When the image looks right, you can reduce the resolution for a
more reasonably sized file. You end up with a photo that’s about the same
resolution as an ordinary photo you’ve scanned, but you’ll be glad you had
some extra information to work with during the restoration.
Replacing Depth and Detail
One of the things that gets lost when a photo ages is the detail — the textures,
the features, the small elements that gave the photo clarity and interest when
it was new. The details can be scuffed off by constant abrasion of the photo’s
surface, or they can be bleached away by exposure to the sun. If your photo’s
details are lost to either or both of these causes, you can find tools in virtually
any image editing application to solve the problem:
✦Burn and Dodge tools deepen shadows and brighten highlights, respec-
tively. You probably need to use these tools during restorations more
than when working on ordinary photos because you encounter faded
images and dark areas more often in old photos.
✦Sharpening filters and tools bring image content into focus. Again,
restorations need this kind of manipulation because, frankly, many old
photos weren’t that sharp to begin with.
Shedding light on the subject
I talk about the Dodge (lightening) tool found in Photoshop and Elements in
Book VII, Chapter 4. However, most image editing applications have a Dodge
or similarly named tool. Dodge is an old photography term, so it’s not specific
to any particular software manufacturer’s lingo. You can use the Dodge tool
to add light to images that you’re restoring by clicking and/or painting over
the image after customizing the tool as needed to make sure it creates the
desired effect.
To use your image editor’s Dodge tool, follow these simple steps:
1. Click the Dodge tool to activate it.
You usually find the Dodge tool on your image editor’s Tool palette.
It might also be a special mode for the Brush tool.
2. Check out the tool’s options, whether they appear on a bar or in a
dialog box or palette, and adjust the intensity or strength of the tool

(how much light it will shed) and the size of the brush with which
you’re applying the light.
3. After the settings you want are in place, click or drag over the area to
be lightened.
If the results are too harsh or dramatic, undo them (press Ctrl+Z on a
PC/Ô+Z on a Mac) and tweak the tool’s settings. Then try again.
You might find that the Dodge tool actually removes detail if you use it too
much. It’s best used when shadows are so deep that detail is impossible to
discern or when age has darkened (rather than lightened or washed out)
image content.
Don’t be afraid of dark shadows
In most image editing applications, you can find a Burn (darkening) tool, too.
The Burn tool intensifies dark shadows to make a faded shadow in an old
photograph dark again or to add darkness where there was none. In the
process, using this tool can heighten the perceived level of detail in a photo.
Adding detail to a faded photograph is difficult, but using the Burn tool can
help. As shown in Figure 3-3, when a faded face in this old-time photo is
slightly darkened with the Burn tool, the features become more distinct.
Figure 3-3: At left, the left half of the face is the original; the right half was burned to bring 
out details. At right, more shadows are applied.

The Burn tool works much like the Dodge tool, and here are the simple steps:
1. Click the Burn tool to activate it.
You can find the Burn tool on the Tool palette of most image editors, or
as a special mode of the Brush tool.
This typically activates an Options bar or palette that gives you settings
to control how the Burn tool works.
2. Set the Burn tool’s options to the levels needed.
These usually are settings to specify whether the burning is applied to
highlights, midtones, or shadows, and how big a brush is used to apply
the darkening effect.
3. When your settings are in place, drag over the image to darken it.
You can also click one or more times on a spot that needs more darkness,
as shown at right in Figure 3-3.
Just like a big fire is much worse than a little one, a little burning is good, but
too much is destructive. Don’t go over and over a spot with the Burn tool
because you’ll end up scorching the image with so much darkness that you
lose some or all of your image detail.
Creating focus by sharpening images
Many old photographs were taken with relatively long exposures by today’s
standards, resulting in blurs from the movement of fidgety subjects. In addi-
tion, many old-time cameras had what photographers would call soft lenses
that produced a somewhat blurry rendition. You can sharpen such images
with manual tools, such as brush-based tools that allow you to paint on a
sharpening effect with your mouse, or you can use sharpening filters to do the
job in a more uniform way. Either method has the same effect in terms of how
the focus is achieved. When you sharpen an image, you increase the contrast
between adjacent pixels. By making dark pixels darker and light pixels lighter,
you make each pixel stand out — therefore, its neighbor stands out, too. The
sharpen tools and filters can be taken too far, of course, but if used sensibly,
they can bring out the details that you thought you’d lost forever.
Running with Sharp(en) tools
Using a Sharpen tool (you can find one in just about any image editing appli-
cation) is pretty straightforward. Before using a Sharpen tool, however, make
sure that you’re on the right layer if your image has layers. Also, if you want
to confine your sharpening to a specific area, make sure that area is selected.
Now, go!

1. Click the Sharpen tool to 
activate it.
You can usually find this tool in the
Tool palette of your image editor.
When you click the tool, an
Options bar or palette appears.
2. Use the tool’s Options bar or
palette to control the way the tool
works.
You can usually adjust its intensity,
and you can always choose a larger
or smaller brush size to control
how much of your image or selec-
tion is sharpened with each click
or drag.
3. Click and/or drag over the area to
be sharpened.
You can go over the same spot
more than once, but don’t go too
far. Figure 3-4 shows the results of
sharpening that’s been overdone,
producing an exaggerated, pixe-
lated effect.
Focusing with filters
Sharpening with a filter requires, of course, that your software has filters —
or at least special-effects tools that perform this particular kind of task. If
you’re using Paint Shop Pro, PhotoImpact, Corel PhotoPaint, or many other
image editors, you have at your disposal various sharpening filters that you
can use to apply generalized sharpening or edge-specific effects to your old
photographs. Located on the Filter menu (or its equivalent) in most editors,
you can apply an all-over sharpening or an unsharp mask effect — a mask that
applies sharpening to the edges within a photo and blurs the rest. The results
might be just what the doctor ordered!
To use the typical Sharpen filters, follow these steps:
1. Locate the Filter menu, go to the Sharpen submenu, and choose the
filter that you want to apply.
If you choose any of the Sharpen filters other than Unsharp Mask, the
sharpening occurs without any intervention from you; there is no dialog
box or anything to adjust.
Figure 3-4: Photos can be sharpened
beyond recognition.

Correcting Faded Colors
644
2. Choose Unsharp Mask if it’s available in your image editor.
Use the settings in this dialog box to control the intensity of the results.
A preview window within the dialog box makes it easy to see how your
adjustments to the filter’s settings affect the outcome.
If you want all-over sharpening in your image or selection, you might prefer
using the Sharpen filters because there’s no chance of your mouse strokes
being visible or of going too far in one spot and not far enough in another.
You can focus the filter’s effects by making a selection prior to invoking the
filter command, which limits the filter’s effect on the entire image but still
gives you a uniform result within the selected area.
Correcting Faded Colors
Of course, not all old photos are black and white. Many treasured pictures
date from the 1950s or later, when family photographers began the great
changeover to color film. Unfortunately, films of that day weren’t as stable as
they are today, and the colors of many of these old pictures have faded dras-
tically. When colors wash out over time, they take with them the information
that was originally available in the image. Was it a sunny day with a blue sky?
Was it summer? Winter? What color dress is your grandmother wearing? Was
that a brown dog or a black dog? To get the answers to these questions, you
go to your image editing software and ask whether the original colors can be
restored. If you have the right software, the answer should be yes. You might
have to make up some stuff, depending on how washed out and faded the
photo has become, but some quick and easy tools can resurrect whatever
color is still available.
Adjusting color levels
Most image editing applications have several automatic color-adjustment
tools. Some of these tools work without requiring any information from you,
and others present a dialog box that you can use to decide how much color
and which colors to increase or balance. Using Photoshop and Paint Shop
Pro as examples, you can use the following commands:
✦Photoshop’s Levels, Auto Levels, and Auto Color commands, located on
the Image➪Adjustments submenu
✦Paint Shop Pro’s Color Balance, Hue/Saturation/Lightness, and Colorize
commands, found on the Color➪Adjust submenu or on the Color menu
itself
If you see an ellipsis (...) after a menu command, a dialog box appears when
you choose the command. If there is no ellipsis, the command is one that
just happens; you choose it, and it does its job, whatever that may be. The

job it does is based on default settings that are part of the program, and you
might or might not be able to edit these settings.
Increasing saturation
When it comes to controlling color, you don’t have to rely purely on menu
commands and dialog boxes to revive your image colors. If you’d prefer,
you can use your mouse to manually adjust colors, clicking and dragging to
add or take away color with the Sponge tool, found in both Photoshop and
Photoshop Elements.
The Sponge tool adds color (in Saturate mode) or removes color (in Desaturate
mode), and you can control how much color is added or taken away through
the tool’s Options bar.
To adjust your color intensity with the Sponge tool, follow these steps:
1. Click the Sponge or Desaturate tool to activate it.
You can find this tool on the Tool palette of most image editors.
2. Choose Saturate or Desaturate from the Mode drop-down list in the
Options bar (or your image editor’s equivalent).
3. Adjust the setting in the toolbar’s Flow drop-down menu.
Some image editors use Pressure or Opacity to indicate this parameter.
A greater number here could mean more saturation or more desatura-
tion, depending on what mode you chose in Step 2.
4. Use the image editor’s Brush menu to set the brush size for the area to
be edited.
You want to choose a brush that’s big enough to do the job without a 
lot of repeated strokes. Each pass over the same spot increases the
effects of the tool in that spot.
5. Drag your mouse over the area to be sponged, being careful not to go
over the same spot too many times.
Going over the same spot too many times or using a Flow setting that’s
too high makes your strokes seem too obvious.
Adding color adjustment layers
What if the color is really gone and you can’t retrieve it or rejuvenate it?
You’re faced with the same decision that Ted Turner faced when his organi-
zation began colorizing old movies. What color was that dress, really? How
about that hat? The sky is blue and the grass is green, but some of the other
colors are pure guesswork.

Correcting Faded Colors
646
Fortunately, however, guessing
the color is the hardest part
when making a photo restora-
tion of a faded color picture.
You can add any color you like
via a new layer. Of course, this
approach requires that your
software supports the use of
layers, and that you’re familiar
with the Layers palette in your
application — how to select a
layer, delete a layer, and so on.
I use Paint Shop Pro for this
demonstration.
So what does a new layer do
for your color? Well, nothing
if it’s just a regular old blank
layer. But if it’s an adjustment
layer, it can do a lot. Figure 3-5
shows Paint Shop Pro’s Color
Balance dialog box, which you
access by choosing Layers➪
New Adjustment Layer➪Color
Balance.
This same process is available
in Photoshop — just choose
Layer➪New Adjustment Layer,
and its submenu offers a similar set of choices for the role the new layer
will play.
Adjustment layers
Adjustment layers are special layers that 
control a particular type of modification, such
as brightness/contrast, color balance, hue/
saturation, or even curves. Any changes that
you make to a particular adjustment layer apply
only to the layers stacked beneath the adjust-
ment layer in your image editor’s Layers palette.
The advantage of adjustment layers is that you
can change the adjustment at any time or even
turn it off entirely to cancel the changes or to
review what your image looks like without the
adjustment. In contrast, if you apply a particu-
lar modification directly to a layer — say, to
change color balance — there’s no easy way to
reverse that adjustment without reverting to an
earlier state in your image editing process.
Figure 3-5: When you create a new Color Balance
Adjustment Layer, this dialog box appears.

Book VII
Chapter 3
Some Common
Fixes for Vintage
Photos
Correcting Faded Colors
647
To create an adjustment layer, follow these steps:
1. With your faded image open on-screen, choose Layer➪New Adjustment
Layer➪Color Balance from the main menu bar.
The dialog box that appears lets you raise and lower the color compo-
nents, one level at a time. If your image is in RGB mode, you can adjust
the red, green, and blue levels. If your image is in CMYK mode, you can
tweak the levels of cyan, magenta, yellow, and black in the picture.
Each of the New Adjustment Layer submenu commands produces a dif-
ferent dialog box, and each dialog box offers sliders and text boxes into
which you can enter levels for the image component being adjusted —
brightness or contrast, hue, lightness, and so on. If it’s not clear which 
of these components your image needs help with, be brave and do some
experimenting. You can always undo an edit by pressing Ctrl+Z (Ô+Z on
a Mac).
2. Make your adjustments by dragging the sliders to the left or right or
by entering new color levels.
You can also choose which elements of your image you’re going to
adjust: Shadows, Midtones, or Highlights.
3. To see the results of your adjustments before you commit to them,
click the Proof button (the big eye) to get a preview in the image
window.
With some image editors, the results of your change appear in the main
image window as you apply them.
4. When you like the results, click OK to apply the changes to your image.
A new layer appears in the Layers menu, as shown in Figure 3-6.
Figure 3-6: Each adjustment layer you add appears on 
the Layers menu.

Getting Nostalgic with Sepia Tones
648
Of course, if you change your mind after adding an adjustment layer, you can
use the Undo command or History palette (if you’re using Photoshop or
Elements) to go back in time before the adjustment layer was created. You
can also delete the layer, and your image returns to its original state.
Eastman Kodak Company’s Applied Science Fiction division (www.asf.com)
offers a selection of Photoshop-compatible plug-ins that can streamline 
correcting colors and tweaking your images in other ways.
Getting Nostalgic with Sepia Tones
Don’t you love those old brownish photos? They’re so much warmer than
black-and-white but not as garish as color. A sepia-tone photo just says 
vintage photo. Over time, sepia-tone photos can become less sepia. They can
fade to a pale yellowish color or be mistaken for a dirty black-and-white
photo if the fading is allowed to go too far.
If your sepia-tone photos aren’t very sepia anymore, or if areas of them have
been bleached by sun damage or abuse, you can restore the sepia-ness to
the whole image or just to part of it. You can also make a black-and-white
photo look like a sepia-tone image.
Evening out existing sepia tones
So your sepia-tone photo is blotchy; some of the photo still has those warm
sepia tones, but other areas are faded and dull. What to do? Select the faded
area and then, in Paint Shop Pro, choose Effects➪Artistic Effects➪Sepia. I use
Paint Shop Pro here just as an example; most image editing applications have
a similar feature. Even if your particular program doesn’t offer it, you might
be able to find a third-party effect that you can download off the Internet —
a filter for Photoshop, for example.
To use Paint Shop Pro’s Sepia Toning dialog box, follow these steps:
1. Select the area to be adjusted.
I recommend using a freeform Lasso selection tool. Avoid the geometric
shape selectors because they make the adjusted area stand out too much.
2. Choose Effects➪Photo Effects➪Sepia Toning from the main menu.
The Sepia Toning dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 3-7.
3. Use the Amount to Age slider to increase or decrease the amount of
sepia added to the image.

The Before version of the image appears on the left, and the After version
on the right.
4. When you like how the After version looks, click the Proof button
(the big eye) to see the change previewed in your image window.
5. If you’re happy with the preview, click OK to apply the changes to
your image.
Figure 3-7: Sepia tones looking sapped? Restore their original 
glory with the Sepia Toning dialog box.
If you’re tinkering with a very small area, use the Sepia Toning dialog box
zoom tools (located between the Before and After images in the dialog box)
to get close enough to judge the effectiveness of your adjustments.
Converting a black-and-white photo to sepia tone
The process of converting a black-and-white photo to sepia tone is virtually
identical to the process of evening out the sepia tones in a photo that’s
already a sepia-tone image. The only difference is that you might have
to change the color mode of your image beforehand. If your application
(Paint Shop Pro, in this case) sees your image as a true black-and-white or
grayscale image, the Sepia command is dimmed in the Effects submenu.
Proof button

Rip! Replacing Torn or Missing Content

What to do if it’s dimmed? Choose Image➪Increase Color Depth. One or more
of the submenu’s commands (as shown in Figure 3-8) become available,
depending on the photo’s current color status. Choose the highest depth
level possible (up to RGB - 8 bits per channel; more than that isn’t necessary)
because the more color information you add to your image the more color
manipulation you can perform.

the Sepia command.
After you make this change, the Sepia command becomes available, and you
can open the Sepia Toning dialog box and go to work making your black-and-

Rip! Replacing Torn or Missing Content
Although you encounter physical defects in all kinds of photos, these defects
seem more prevalent in old pictures that have been stored carelessly, maybe
ripped out of an album a time or two or even pinned up on a bulletin board.
Cracks and crevices are the sort of damage that you might think is beyond
repair. How wrong you’d be if you thought that! Although not all image editing
packages are capable of fixing these instances of very serious damage, most of
them are. Certainly Photoshop, Photoshop Elements, and Paint Shop Pro —
three of the most popular tools available — are capable of restoring even the
most seemingly hopeless photo.

Sometimes the answer to your problem is much easier or straightforward
than you thought it would be. In the case of photo editing, nothing is
simpler than a paintbrush. You pick the color to paint with, set the size
and style of the brush, adjust the shape of the brush, and paint over the
scratch, scuff mark, or other type of small mark on your image. What could
be easier? Most packages have more sophisticated tools, some that even
let you borrow content from one spot in the image and use the content 
elsewhere. But if the scratch or spot is really tiny, do you need to go to any
more trouble than you’d go to if you had to touch up a tiny chip in your car’s
paint? No. You probably wouldn’t call the auto body shop and have the car
sanded, primed, and painted; you’d whip out the touch-up paint, and good-
bye chip. 
When you’re ready to take the easy way out, follow these steps with your
application’s Paint Brush or Brush tool. You can even use a Pencil tool if
your scratch is very thin:
1. Click either the Brush or Pencil tool.
Use the Brush for larger areas or with damage that has soft edges, such
as scuff marks, abrasions, or tears. Use the Pencil tool if your scratches
are very fine and sharp-edged.
2. Set the options so that they fit with the task at hand.
When the tool becomes active, so do its options. As shown here for
Photoshop Elements (Figure 3-9), you can adjust the size, shape, and
style of the Brush tool, which controls how and how much color it
applies.
Figure 3-9: Change the specs for your brush to meet your needs.

Rip! Replacing Torn or Missing Content
652
3. Select the color you want to
apply in order to cover up the
flaw in your image.
In Photoshop, you have the
Color Picker, which you open by
clicking the Foreground Color
button on the toolbox. Other
applications might have a color-
sampling tool in the brush palette
or along the side or bottom of
the application window.
4. With the proper color selected,
go back to the desired tool 
(the Brush or Pencil) and then
begin painting or drawing 
out the unwanted scratches,
scuffs, and spots, as shown in
Figure 3-10.
You can click to get rid of a 
small dot, or drag to get rid of 
a scratch.
Got a long stretch of scratch to cover? Don’t try to do it in one stroke. Instead,
nibble at the problem with short strokes, one after the other. That way, if you
mess up, you can undo the small changes with the Undo command or the
History palette without undoing your entire painted line. Only the last short
stroke where you went astray disappears.

scuff, or other small mark.

igitally captured and retouched photos live on your computer. That’s
where they came to life, whether you captured them with a digital
camera or scanned a printed original. It’s also where they may have been
doctored for any number of purposes — to make them smaller so that you
can e-mail them to friends and family, to make them safe for use
on a Web page, or to make them picture-perfect for printing.
However, unless you deal only in Web images or 
on-screen presentations, you probably need lots and
lots of prints of your photos. In this chapter, you
discover when and how to print your photos,
which printers do what kind of job, and how to
create the best-quality print of your digital images.
You’ll find more information about choosing print-
ers in Book II, Chapter 4.
Why Do You Need Prints?
The reasons you might need to print your photos are as
numerous as the photos themselves. Look for your own 
reasons among these:
✦You need to create a suitable-for-framing version of a photo that was too
small or too damaged to be framed before you edited it. You can trans-
form that wallet-sized photo into a framed picture suitable for the top of
your grand piano. Or, perhaps, a picture has wrinkles or tears you can
fix with your image editor before making a pristine, new print. See Book
VII for tips on restoring damaged photos.

Why Do You Need Prints?
656
✦You want to create a backup print of a very precious photo in case
something happens to the original. Better yet, display the duplicate and
keep the precious original in a safer place, such as a safety-deposit box.
Put a disc containing the digital version of the original in the box, too, so
you won’t have to duplicate your editing efforts.
✦You’re building a portfolio of your digital artwork, and you need a printed
copy to show to prospective employers or clients. Make as many prints
as you want economically, and distribute them far and wide.
✦You need a proof, or printed evaluation image, that you can submit to
someone who can’t view the image online for his or her approval. You can
fiddle with the proof print to make sure it’s an accurate representation so
the person passing judgment on it will have the best copy possible to
approve.
✦You require an evaluation proof for comparing the digital image with the
hard copy original, and just viewing the file electronically won’t provide
the necessary information about print quality. The proof of the pudding,
in this case, is in the viewing.
✦Your photo is for printed marketing materials, such as ads, brochures,
or flyers, and you need to create camera-ready art that a professional
printer can use to create the finished materials. Although many profes-
sional printers today can work with digital files, some cannot. You need
a print for the print shop’s use.
✦You’ll often need prints for holiday greeting cards or birth announce-
ments and other special events.
✦When I prepare publicity pictures for my local newspaper, I always pro-
vide the original photo on CD. But I also include a print so the editor
can decide whether the photo is worth using without having to pop the
CD in a drive and go to the trouble of digging down into it to view the
picture.
Although this chapter’s title is “Printing Your Final Result,” you may also
want to print versions of your image as you go along in the editing process.
Because computer monitors aren’t capable of displaying colors exactly as
they print, you may want to print at least one “in-progress” version of your
image so that you can check for color, clarity, and other qualities before you
commit the final version to that sheet of expensive photo paper. You can
purchase lower-priced photo paper for your test prints (because printing on
plain old inkjet paper may be misleading) and then use the good stuff for
your final printout.
Why does the same photo look different if you print it on plain inkjet paper
than it does on photographic paper? The porous nature of regular inkjet
paper absorbs more of the ink, and this affects the reflective quality of the
colors. Images look darker, contrast is lost, and overall quality is diminished
if you print on porous paper. If you print on glossy or matte photographic

Book VIII
Chapter 1
Printing Your 
Final Result
Evaluating Your Printing Options
657
paper, where a coating on the paper prevents absorption, your photo’s color
and content stand on their own, unaffected by the paper. No details, color, or
contrast is lost.
Evaluating Your Printing Options
After you know that you need to print your photo, it’s time to decide how 
to print it. If you have only one printer and no money for or access to
another printer, then the decision is already made — you’ll use your one and
only printer. If you have the cash for the perfect printer for your particular
photo, that’s great. If you don’t have the cash but have access to a variety of
printers, that’s great, too. With the assumption that you have some choices
available to you, consider the list of printing possibilities found in Table 1-1.
You’ll find more information on choosing printers in Book II, Chapter 4.

Inkjet printers
The name inkjet gives you an idea of how the inkjet printer works — assuming
that the word jet makes you think of the water jets on a whirlpool bath or spa.
The way these printers work is rather simple. Piezoelectric crystals make the
ink cartridges vibrate (the crystals are sandwiched between two electrodes,
which make the crystals dance). Different levels of voltage cause the crystals
to vibrate differently, which adjusts the colors and the amount of color sprayed
through a nozzle onto the paper.
Color inkjet printers can create photo-quality images, assuming you use
good-quality photo paper for the output. Price isn’t necessarily an indication
of print quality, and you should print a test page before making a purchase
or go on the recommendation of someone who owns the same model.
Laser printers
Laser printers work very much like photocopiers. A laser beam is aimed at a
photoelectric belt or drum, building up an electrical charge. This happens
four times, once for each of the four colors used to make all the colors in
your image — cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. The electric charge makes
the colored toner stick to the belt, and then the belt transfers the toner to

Touring the Print Process
658
the drum. The paper rolls along the drum as it moves through the printer,
which transfers the toner from the drum to the paper. Then, either pressure
or heat (or both) makes the toner stick to the paper.
Color laser printers are more expensive than inkjets and black-and-white
laser printers and are more expensive to operate. Indeed, now that the
prices for color laser printers have dipped down to affordable levels, many
users are complaining that they easily spend more on toner in the first few
months they own these devices than they spent on the printers themselves!
If you’re creating camera-ready art for very important, detailed publications,
you probably want a color laser printer (assuming the images are in color)
rather than an inkjet, but the image quality is not as good as what you’d get
with a dye-sublimation printer.
Dye-sublimation printers
Here, the name of the printer doesn’t tell you much about the way the
printer works. Despite their cryptic name, dye-sublimation printers work in
a relatively straightforward way. A strip of plastic film, called a transfer
ribbon, is coated with cyan, magenta, and yellow dye. When a print job is
sent to the printer, a thermal print head heats up the paper-sized (4-x-6-inch
or 81⁄2-x-10-inch) panel of plastic transfer ribbon. Variations in temperature
control what colors and the amount of color that are applied to the paper.
Because the paper has a special coating on it, the dye sticks.
Dye-sublimation printers produce an excellent image, especially for color
photos. The subtle results are great for professional designers, artists, and
photographers. The expense for full-sized dye-sub printers may be prohibi-
tive for small businesses and home users, but the lower-priced models that
produce only snapshot-sized prints and cost less than $150 (plus about
30 cents per print for paper and ribbon) may be within reach.
Touring the Print Process
Regardless of the photo editing and retouching software that you’re using to
process your photographs, some aspects of the image-printing process are
the same. With most image editors, the print process consists of the follow-
ing options:
✦You get to choose which printer to print to. If you have a black-and-white
laser and a color inkjet, for example, you can choose to output to the
color inkjet.
✦You can choose how many copies to print.
✦You can choose to print only part of the image by choosing the Selection
option. This assumes you made a selection before issuing the Print 
command.

Book VIII
Chapter 1
Printing Your 
Final Result
Touring the Print Process
659
✦You can adjust your printer’s properties to print at different levels of
quality, assuming the printout is the final version.
✦You can choose to print crop marks, which can help you or a profes-
sional printer cut along the edges of the printout. If you want to frame
a 5-x-7-inch photo, for example, and you’re printing it on 81⁄2 -x-11-inch
paper (letter size), the crop marks can help you cut the paper down to
fit inside the frame and within any mat you’re using.
Preventing surprises with Print Preview
Before you actually commit your image to paper, you may want to see a
smaller view of an image in the context of a sheet of the currently set paper
size, just to make sure everything is okay. This prevents nasty surprises such
as printing your favorite portrait in horizontal format and cutting your subject
in half. In virtually all software programs, you choose File➪Print Preview (or
just File➪Print, depending on which program you’re using) to see how the
printout will look. Figure 1-1 shows the Print Preview window in Photoshop
Elements. If you’re happy with what you see, you go ahead and issue the Print
command (File➪Print or Ctrl+P) to open the Print dialog box.
Figure 1-1: A Print Preview window shows how your image will 
look on paper.
Higher-end photo editing packages (such as Photoshop) let you choose to
print color separations, which means printing each of the image’s colors on a
separate sheet. This can be helpful to a professional printing firm that may
be using your printout to create the films that will generate your prints.

Touring the Print Process

Understanding your output options
In the Print Preview window, you can print the image by clicking the Print
button, and you can also change the scale (size) and location of the image
on the paper. With some image editors, a Show More Options check box
opens an extension of the original dialog box. Options here may include
applying a caption to your image or turning on crop marks. You may even be
able to apply a background color and a border, which can be helpful if you’re
printing an image for framing and don’t have a mat for the frame.
The Page Setup dialog box, which you open by clicking the Page Setup button
in the Print Preview dialog box, allows you to change the printer you’re sending
the job to and to view your printer’s properties (see Figure 1-2). It’s also
another place to choose the Background, Border, and Corner Crop Marks
options. In many packages, the Page Setup dialog box also allows you to
change the paper size and orientation.
Figure 1-2: You can specify paper orientation and size.
Printing your photos
When you’re ready to print your work, choose File➪Print (or choose Print
from the Print Preview window) and use the Print dialog box to take advan-
tage of your printing options — which printer to use, how many copies to
print, and so forth.

If the software you’re using offers a drastically different set of options
through its Print dialog box, you can press the F1 key (in Windows) to open
the software’s help files. (Mac users can click the Help button in the dialog
box.) If that doesn’t work (though it should because most applications sup-
port this feature), use the Help menu and look for help articles that pertain
to printing. The software may have also come with a Read Me file — a file
that came with the software if you downloaded it from the Web — or a
printed manual that you can refer to.
Of course, before you click the Print or OK button to begin the print job,
you’ll want to make sure the right paper is in the printer and be sure how
your particular printer wants the paper fed — good-side down, the proper
end in first, and so on. The printer should come with instructions, if not in a
printed manual then right on the printer trays themselves, through little pic-
tures of paper with arrows to show you how and where to insert the paper.
Most photographic paper has a “good side,” which has the image-enhancing
coating on it, and a repeated brand name on the back, making it easier to tell
which side you want to print on. If you’re not sure, though, do a test print
first. In the worst case, you’ll print on the wrong side and have to do it again,
wasting a single sheet of paper. If you’re planning to print several copies of
the image, it’s better to waste a single sheet than to print all ten copies on
the wrong side of the paper!
Using Professional Printing Services
Also known as a service bureau, a professional printing firm offers services to
graphic artists, photographers, fine artists, businesses (for business cards,
brochures, and so on), and the general public. Chains (such as FedEx
Kinko’s, AlphaGraphics, and Kwik Kopy stores) offer such services, and
some office supply stores print your graphic files for a fee. You can also find
small, privately owned printing services, which may charge more than the
chains do, but you get very personalized service and may find the staff more
willing to help you if you’re not entirely sure what you need to provide in
order for them to do a job for you.
I used service bureaus for many years, back in the days when laser printers
could output text at no more than 300 dpi. Service bureaus were an economi-
cal way to produce black-and-white camera-ready pages (which can be 
photographed by the printer to make printing plates) without the need to
purchase a high-resolution printer or imagesetter (a high-resolution printer
especially suited for images). Those can be costly. Today, most laser printers
have 600 dpi or better resolution, so the need for service bureaus for text
output is reduced. They are still a good idea for making full-color prints from
your digital photos if you don’t own a color printer that provides sufficient
quality.

Using Professional Printing Services
662
Choosing a service bureau
Not sure who to call when you’re ready to shop for a service bureau/printing
service? You can always check the Yellow Pages online or in print, or you
can ask friends and business associates for referrals. The best people to ask
are graphic artists or people who work for an ad agency; they’re likely to use
service bureaus pretty extensively, and their recommendations would be
valuable.
Before you hire a service bureau to print your photos, you want to ask the
folks there a few questions:
✦What do they charge, and how do they determine their prices? Do they
have minimum fees?
✦When can they finish the job? Note that most service bureaus will want
to fit your job into their normal queue of projects. They may charge
extra for “rush” jobs. Find out what constitutes a “rush” job — is that
overnight service, or anything less than a week?
✦What file formats do they support (so you know the format in which you
should save your photo after editing it)? At one time, service bureaus
could handle only Macintosh files and common Macintosh formats, such
as TIFF or PICT. Today, most service bureaus support all platforms and
all image file formats. It doesn’t hurt to check, though.
✦Can you view a sample of the printout before paying for the final copies?
It can be helpful to view a proof or evaluation copy, even if you have to
pay extra.
✦Is the kind of output you’re looking for something they’ve done before
and done frequently?
With answers to these questions in hand, you can choose the right service
bureau for your needs. If the person you’re working with isn’t open and
cooperative with you, run, don’t walk, to another company. I’ve worked
with both kinds of service bureaus — the kind where the staff assumes you
should know everything and doesn’t want to be bothered explaining things,
and the kind where folks are more than willing to help and answer any ques-
tion, no matter how simple it is. Obviously, the former type of company
doesn’t deserve your business, and the latter type of company is best.
Tell them what you want, what you 
really, really want
After choosing a service bureau to work with, you need to discuss your exact
printing needs. When you tell the person helping you how you plan to use the
printout, he or she should

Book VIII
Chapter 1

663
✦Suggest the type of paper for the printout.
✦Tell you what file format you need to use (a .psd file created in
Photoshop, a .tif file, and so on) and whether you need to provide
printed, camera-ready art.
If you do need to provide camera-ready art, ask whether you need to provide
color separations (each color within your image printed on a separate sheet
of paper) and what kind of paper the bureau prefers you print to. If you have
only an inkjet printer, the serviceperson may balk at your using it to create
the camera-ready art. In general, though, any good service bureau prefers to
get the image as an electronic file so that the staff can work with the image
as needed to give you the printout you require.
Knowing when you need a service bureau
In the end, the choice as to whether to work with a service bureau will come
down to money. Time is money, and money buys quality if you shop carefully
for printing services and/or your own printer. If you need a perfect, absolutely
beautiful printout of the photo and can’t afford a high-end printer of your own
(or don’t know anyone who has one you can use), then you need to spend the
money to have a service bureau create the printout for you. If you need a
high-quality printout and have a quality dye-sublimation or color laser printer
at your disposal, you may be able to do the printing on your own.
If I sound as though I’m disregarding the role of inkjets in the printing process,
I’m not. I’ve printed many photos with an inkjet printer and given them as
gifts, used them as camera-ready art for brochures and business cards, and so
forth. Some of my original artwork has also been printed on an inkjet, and the
items look just fine in a portfolio. The printer you use depends on the printout
quality you need and on whether the printer you have is capable of providing
it. You might love the output that your inkjet generates, and if so, that’s great.
You’ve just saved some money, and you have a quick and easy way to create
your prints!

Chapter 2: Sharing Pictures 
on the Web
In This Chapter
 Sharing your digital photo masterpieces with friends and family
 Showing off your business online
 Using commercial sites to share your pictures
 Creating your own Web page for displaying pictures
O
f course you can e-mail your photos to personal and business con-
tacts, but most people are pretty tired of getting images attached to
e-mail messages. They have to download the images in order to open and
view them, and if they’re on a dialup connection to the Internet, that can be
a pain. And after the download is (finally) complete, what do they
do with the pictures? If they don’t need the image them-
selves, or if the subject of the photo isn’t near or dear
to them, they either throw it out (into the Trash or
Recycle Bin) or squirrel the images away in a folder
they’ll never open again. I have a folder on my desk-
top called Other People’s Images where I drag
all the pictures that I would feel bad tossing but
have no use for.
So if e-mail isn’t the best way to share pictures with
people who need or want to see them, what is? You
have several options, including posting them on your
own Web site or using one of the many image-sharing
services. In this chapter, you discover what Web sharing
tools are available, how to pick the one that’s right for you,
and how to get busy sharing photos on the Web.
Appreciating the Advantages of Web Sharing
By using the Web to share images, you eliminate the other person’s need to
save or throw out the images you’ve sent. He or she can view them, say,
“Aw, isn’t that cute!” or “Wow! Cool car!” and that’s it. No need to download,
save, throw out, or do anything with the image other than just look at it. If

Appreciating the Advantages of Web Sharing
666
people want to save or print the image after they view it, that’s up to them,
but it isn’t required or even firmly suggested. Figure 2-1 shows a page of
images posted to a Web site. All people have to do to see the pictures is type
the Web address into their browsers and voilà! There are the photos.
By using the Web to share pictures, you’re saving your image recipients’
time, hard drive space, and aggravation by creating a single repository for all
the images you want to share. You’re also making it much easier for yourself
to keep an up-to-date selection of images available to all who want to see
them, so the Web option is a win-win proposition.
Figure 2-1: Share your photos on your own Web page.
Before you share a batch of photos with the world (remember, the Internet is
international!), check the photos for anything you’d regret sharing with the
rest of the population. You probably want to avoid sharing identifying fea-
tures, such as addresses and people’s last names, which enable strangers to
make undesired contact with you. Another thing to check for is embarrass-
ing content. Going over the images with a very discriminating eye before you
share them will pay off in the long run.

Sharing personal photos with family and friends
The benefits of using the Web to share personal photos are obvious. You can
share vacation photos, school pictures, shots of your new house, pool, car,
bathroom tile — whatever. Through your pictures online, you can share all
the stuff that you’d tell people about in a holiday newsletter. Think of the
savings in postage alone! Instead of enclosing that extra sheet (or sheets)
of paper, just write inside your holiday card the Web address where your
photos can be found, and your work is done. If most of your friends and
family have e-mail, you can alert them that way and save your wrist the
strain of writing a Web address 50 times. Figure 2-2 shows an e-mail contain-
ing a Web address set up as a link. Recipients need only click the link in the
e-mail and they’re taken directly to your photos, wherever they’re stored.
Figure 2-2: E-mail your picture link to a friend for point-and-click access.
Many e-mail programs will create such a hot link for you. For example, if you
type anything that begins with http:// into recent versions of Outlook,
Outlook Express, or America Online’s mail system, the e-mail software auto-
matically converts the address into a hot link, colors it blue, and supplies an
underline that lets the recipient know the link is live.
The recipient must also have the HTML option active for your link to be hot
when the message is received. If not, the recipient can still jump to your Web
page by highlighting the link, copying it (usually by pressing Ctrl+C, or Ô+C

Appreciating the Advantages of Web Sharing

on a Mac), and then pasting the link into a browser’s address bar (by press-
ing Ctrl+V, or Ô+V on a Mac).
Of course, some sharing is very targeted. If you want only your friends from
college to see one batch and your family to see another, and you don’t 
necessarily want the two camps to see each other’s photos, how can you
control it? By only telling certain people about certain images. Other than
someone deliberately searching for your photos online, people will go and
look only at the photos you direct them to, and by controlling whom you
tell, you control who sees your images. Of course, if you want everyone and
anyone to see all of your photos, you can store them all in the same place
and use your name to identify them, making it possible for anyone to find
them by searching the Web.
So where are these Web sites where your pictures can be found? They’re
everywhere — from the AOL Pictures feature at America Online to sites hosted
by the big names in photography, such as Yahoo! and Kodak. These sites are
easy to use, easy to access, and make sharing your photos with whomever
you want very simple. I talk about different sites and their pros and cons a
little later in this chapter.
Sharing images with business associates
So you’ve opened a new warehouse or have a new product to offer? Don’t
spend the extra cash printing up thousands of brochures or product infor-
mation sheets, and certainly don’t skimp and print up black-and-white flyers
because printing in color is so expensive. Color is cheap online, and the cost
(if any) of sharing your images online is just a tiny fraction of the cost of
printing. You can even promote your goods and services with pictures, as
shown in Figure 2-3.
You can put color images on your own company Web site, or if you don’t
have one yet, you can usually get some free Web space from the people
you’re already paying to provide your e-mail and Internet connection —
your ISP (Internet service provider). Whether your ISP is an online 
community, like AOL or MSN, or another firm such as Earthlink or AT&T,
you can take advantage of the free Web space allocated to each customer.
Although you probably don’t have a lot of space, it might be just enough to
share a bunch of photos because photos saved for the Web (in GIF or JPG
format) are much smaller in file size than photos shared in other formats.
Even if your ISP gives you only 10MB of space, you can get a lot of photos
in that space.
To find out if your ISP offers free Web space, you can call its support phone
number or go to its Web site. Most ISPs offer either online or phone support
to coach you through the process.

Figure 2-3: One reason for posting your photos online is to sell your company’s goods or
services.
Choosing a Sharing System
There are really too many free Web page hosting sites to list, and it’s hard to
tell which ones will remain active during the life of this book. I listed some in
earlier editions and found that they were nearly all defunct or had changed
within 12 to 18 months. Kodak, in particular, has changed the name of its
photo-sharing site three or four times in the last few years, the most recent
revision from Picture Center to Kodak EasyShare Gallery. You’ll find an up-to-
date guide to free or nearly-free hosting services at www.clickherefree.com.
Of course, I’m hoping that service won’t become defunct soon, too (but it has
hung around for a couple editions of this book!). 
Your best bet is your ISP or big operations like AOL, MSN, Kodak, and others,
which are likely to be with us over the long haul. Of course, longevity may not
be important to you. After all, when one service pulls up stakes and packs up
its tent, you can always switch to another, newer free service. As a bonus,
you don’t have to worry about erasing all your outdated photos on the old
service. They’ll do it for you when they close up the shop.

Choosing a Sharing System
670
You have a lot of choices. You can use an online sharing system to display
your images. Most of these systems offer the space for free. You can 
build your own Web site in the free space that your ISP offers, or you can
register your own domain and set up your own space on a host’s Web server.
In this case, a host offers space on its computer for you to store your pages,
usually for a monthly or annual fee. You can also set up your own Web
server (a computer that “serves up” Web pages to people on the Internet),
but I wouldn’t recommend it solely to store your images.
With all these options, choosing a sharing system is easy. The best option
for you depends on what you want, how much you’re willing to pay, and how
much time you want to devote to setting up your images online. From simple
and set up in no time to slightly complex and completely customized, your
choices run the entire spectrum.
Using commercial sharing sites and services
“Commercial” normally means “for a fee,” right? Well, not necessarily. Many 
of your sharing options are free or use something that you’re already paying
for. In the case of an online community, such as America Online, if you’re a
member, you’re already paying for that membership, which enables you to
send and receive e-mail, chat, surf the Web, and so forth. For AOL’s monthly
fee, you get access to the Internet and to its community features. One of those
features, as indicated earlier, is AOL Pictures, which enables you to view your
images online — and allows others to view them, too. You also get free Web
space with your membership, which you can use for storing and displaying
your photos.
Other commercial sharing services — Web sites known as online galleries —
allow you to post your images for free in exchange for making you look at
ads around the periphery of the Web page that displays your images. The
thinking is that, by exposing you (and those you send to the site to see your
photos) to the ads, the gallery’s advertising partners gain exposure to a 
considerable customer base. Others provide free space simply because they
want to be nice or to perpetuate an interest in photography. Some sell soft-
ware, which they offer you throughout their site, enticing you to buy their
image editing and/or photo album application. You don’t have to buy, but
the companies figure that many people will.
Quite a few different services are available. Your best bet for finding them is
to type Online Galleries or similar keywords into an Internet search engine to
find free or low-fee services.
If you’re willing to pay to store and display your pictures, you might be
better off with a service like SmugMug or PBase (www.smugmug.com and
www.pbase.com), both of which offer versatile photo sharing without many
of the limitations of the free services.

Book VIII
Chapter 2

671
For example, SmugMug offers three levels of service: Standard, Power User,
and Pro, for (at this writing) $39.95, $59.95, and $149.95 per year. Each serv-
ice offers unlimited capacity and uses an interface that makes it easy to
upload hundreds of photos quickly. With the basic service, you can track
visits to your gallery, password-protect your images, organize your photos
by keyword tags, and convert your images to prints and gifts. The Power
User service lets you add video clips and choose your own colors and fonts
for your gallery and allows much higher levels of traffic to your gallery, just
in case you become hugely popular. The Pro level galleries let you sell your
prints through SmugMug and even make a profit from your work.
PBase offers similar features, and some bonuses, not the least of which is a
slick online magazine with gorgeous photos and useful articles. PBase charges
$23 a year for 300MB of photo storage and $60 annually for 900MB of storage.
You can add additional storage in 300MB increments.
Other services to evaluate (all still alive and kicking as I write this) include
Yahoo!, Snapfish, Kodak EasyShare Gallery, and Shutterfly (at http://photos.
yahoo.com, www.snapfish.com, and www.shutterfly.com).
Displaying images on your own Web space
Whether your ISP provides the space for free or you enlist a paid host to 
provide you space for your own domain, you can use your Web space to store
and display photos that you want to share with friends, family, customers, and
business associates. Putting the images online requires a series of simple steps:
1. Prepare your photos for use on the Web by opening them in a photo-
editing package, such as Photoshop Elements, and saving them in a
Web-safe format.
The two formats that all Web browsers (notably Internet Explorer, 
Firefox, Netscape Navigator, and Opera) can deal with are .gif and .jpg.
.jpg is best for photos because it supports the multitude of colors and
shading within the images. Figure 2-4 shows the Save for Web dialog box
in Photoshop Elements and a photo being prepared for Web use.
2. Set up the Web page where the images will be displayed.
You can use a variety of graphical tools to design the page (Microsoft
FrontPage, Macromedia Dreamweaver, Adobe GoLive), or you can create
a page by writing HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) code. If you’re
using an ISP’s free Web space, the ISP gives you step-by-step procedures
for creating a Web page, and the software does most of the work for you.
3. Upload the Web page and the images.
This is typically done with FTP (File Transfer Protocol) software, or if
you’re using AOL or your ISP, it may provide an Upload page that loads
both the Web page you set up and the images you want to display.

Choosing a Sharing System
672
Figure 2-4: Photoshop Elements’ Save for Web feature creates an optimized image for
Web display.
You can find free or low-cost FTP software online from sites such as
www.tucows.com and www.hotfiles.com. You can also do a search for
“Free FTP Software” at Google (www.google.com). Venerable “oldies”
like WSFTP LE, shown in Figure 2-5, are very popular. “Newbies”
(new online users) may prefer a program like FTP Explorer, which has
a Windows Explorer–like interface, while Mac users like Transmit.
4. Visit the page online to see how it looks.
You always want to check your page online to see if it’s okay before you
send people there to see your images. With any luck, it won’t look like
my page, shown in Figure 2-6.
If you want to make changes, open the Web page file on your own com-
puter, make the changes, and upload it again.
If you check your page online and you see red Xs (in Internet Explorer) or
gray icons with a question mark (in Netscape Navigator) where images
should be, this means that the browser can’t locate the image that’s sup-
posed to be there. Check your Web page settings to make sure that you have
the right pictures in the right places, and check to see that you’ve uploaded
all the images to your host’s Web server.

Choosing a Sharing System
674
As time goes by, you can always expand and improve on your Web pages.
Here are a few things to try:
✦Refreshing content: Edit your Web pages and add new pictures. Or take
down the old ones entirely and replace them with your latest shots.
As you become more proficient in setting up images and designing
Web pages, your site can grow with you.
✦Organizing pictures: Set up multiple Web pages and use them to catego-
rize your images. Set up a Vacations page, a Baby Pictures page, or a
Graduation Ceremony page. Any category or special topic can have its
own page.
✦Adding links: Create links on your Web pages that take visitors to other
people’s sites or to online galleries where you have other pictures stored.
If you’re a real photography bug, you may have some of your more artis-
tic shots stored on a gallery site. Through a link on your own page, you
can direct people to your works of art.
✦Letting others join in: Set up a family Web site and have each branch of
your extended family post their own images to individual pages. This can
help distant members of the family stay in touch (add e-mail links to the
pages so people can view the images and then immediately write an
e-mail to talk about them), and let everyone in the family know about
new arrivals and special events like family reunions.
✦Advertising your business: If you’re in business, use the space to show
pictures of your products, services, staff, locations — anything that will
enhance your customer’s interest in you and your business. Like a family
site with individual pages for different branches of the family or types of
pictures, businesses can also categorize their images and set up individ-
ual pages to house each group.
If you thought your only goal for that box of old photos was to put them in
an album, you can now see that you can do so many more things with your
images. The Internet lets you share pictures with anyone, anywhere, and it
won’t cost you much money or take up much of your time. Have fun!

Glossary
additive primary colors: The red, green, and blue hues used alone or in
combinations to create all other colors you capture with a digital camera 
or scanner, view on a computer monitor, or work with in an image editing
program like Photoshop, Photoshop Elements, or Paint Shop Pro. See also
subtractive primary colors, CMY(K) color model.
airbrush: The airbrush is an image editing feature that simulates an artist’s
tool that sprays a fine mist of paint. It is used for both illustration and
retouching.
ambient lighting: Soft, nondirectional lighting that bounces off walls, ceil-
ings, and other objects in the scene, rather than appearing to come from a
single light source.
angle of view: The area of a scene that a lens can capture, determined by
the focal length of the lens. Lenses with a shorter focal length have a wider
angle of view than lenses with a longer focal length.
anti-aliasing: A process that smoothes the rough edges or jaggies in images
by creating partially transparent pixels along the boundaries that are
merged into a smoother line by our eyes. See also jaggies.
aperture-priority: A camera setting that allows you to specify which 
lens opening or f-stop you want, with the camera selecting the required
shutter speed automatically, based on its autoexposure system. See also
shutter-preferred.
artifact: A type of noise in an image, or an unintentional image component
produced in error by a digital camera or scanner during processing. For exam-
ple, a “hot” or “dead” pixel in a digital camera sensor can show up as a white
or black dot in your photos.
aspect ratio: The width-to-height proportion of an image as printed, displayed
on a monitor, or captured by a digital camera.
autofocus: A camera setting that allows the camera to choose the correct
focus distance for you, usually based on the contrast of an image (the image
will be at maximum contrast when in sharp focus) or set by a mechanism,
such as an infrared sensor, that measures the actual distance to the subject.
Cameras can be set for single autofocus (the lens is not focused until the shut-
ter release is partially depressed) or continuous autofocus (the lens refocuses
constantly as you frame and reframe the image).

averaging metering
676
averaging metering: A light-measuring system that calculates exposure
based on the overall brightness of the entire image area. Averaging tends to
produce the best exposure when a scene is evenly lit or contains equal
amounts of bright and dark areas that contain detail. Today, most digital
cameras use much more sophisticated exposure measuring systems based
on center-weighting, spot-reading, or calculating exposure from a matrix of
many different picture areas.
backlighting: A lighting effect produced when the main light source is
located behind the subject. Backlighting can be used to create a silhouette
effect. Backlighting is also a technology for illuminating an LCD display from
the rear, making it easier to view under high ambient lighting conditions.
See also ambient lighting, fill lighting, and front-lighting.
balance: A property of an image that has elements of equal weight, color,
size, or other attribute on all sides.
bit: A binary digit — either a 1 or a 0 — used to measure the color depth
(number of different colors) in an image. For example, a grayscale 8-bit scan
may contain up to 256 different tones (28), and a 24-bit scan can contain
16.8 million different colors (224).
black point: The tonal level of an image where blacks begin to provide
important image information, usually measured by using a histogram. When
correcting an image with a digital camera that has an on-screen histogram,
or within an image editor, you’ll usually want to set the histogram’s black
point at the place where these tones exist.
blur: In photography, to soften an image or part of an image by throwing it
out of focus or by allowing it to become soft because of subject or camera
motion. In image editing, to soften an area by reducing the contrast between
pixels that form the edges.
bounce lighting: Light reflected from a surface, often ceiling or walls, to 
provide a soft, natural-looking light.
bracketing: Taking a series of photographs of the same subject at different
settings to help ensure that one setting will be the correct one. Many digital
cameras will automatically snap off a series of bracketed exposures for you.
Other settings, such as color and white balance, can also be bracketed with
some models.
brightness: The amount of light and dark shades in an image, usually repre-
sented as a percentage from 0 percent (black) to 100 percent (white).
buffer: A digital camera’s internal memory, which stores an image immediately

(semi-permanent) memory or a memory card. A buffer lets a camera capture a
burst of images.
burn: A darkroom technique, simulated by most image editors, which
involves exposing part of a print for a longer period, thus making it darker
than it would be with a straight exposure. The term is also slang for creating
a CD or DVD using writing software.
calibration: A process used to correct for the differences in the output of a
printer or monitor when compared with the original image. After you cali-
brate your scanner, monitor, and/or your image editor, the images you see
on-screen more closely represent what you’ll get from your printer even
though calibration is never perfect.
Camera RAW: A plug-in included with Photoshop and Photoshop Elements
that can manipulate the unprocessed images captured by digital cameras.
See also RAW.
camera shake: Movement of the camera, aggravated by slower shutter
speeds, which produces a blurred image. Some of the latest digital cameras
have image stabilization features that correct for camera shake, and a few
high-end interchangeable lenses have a similar vibration correction or
reduction feature.
cast: An undesirable tinge of color in an image.
CCD: Charge-Coupled Device. A type of solid-state sensor that captures the
image, used in scanners and digital cameras. See also CMOS.
center-weighted metering: A light-measuring device that emphasizes the
area in the middle of the frame when calculating the correct exposure for an
image. See also averaging metering, matrix metering, and spot metering.
chroma: Color or hue.
chromatic aberration: An image defect, often seen as green or purple fring-
ing around the edges of an object, caused by a lens failing to focus all colors
of a light source at the same point.
chrome: An informal photographic term used as a generic for any kind of
color transparency, including Kodachrome, Ektachrome, or Fujichrome.
CIE (Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage): An international organ-
ization of scientists who work with matters relating to color and lighting.
The organization is also called the International Commission on Illumination.
This organization’s color model is based on human perception and is consid-
ered the most accurate.

close-up lens
678
close-up lens: A lens add-on, resembling a filter, that allows you to take pic-
tures at a distance that is less than the closest-focusing distance of the
prime lens alone.
CMOS: Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor. A type of solid-state
sensor that captures the image; used in scanners and digital cameras.
See also CCD.
CMY(K) color model: A way of defining all possible colors in percentages of
cyan (C), magenta (M), yellow (Y), and frequently, black (K). Black is added
to improve rendition of shadow detail. CMYK is commonly used for printing
(both on press and with your inkjet or laser color printer). A few image edi-
tors, including Photoshop, can work with images using the CMYK model.
color correction: Changing the relative amounts of color in an image to pro-
duce a desired effect, typically a more accurate representation of those
colors. Color correction can fix faulty color balance in the original image or
compensate for the deficiencies of the inks used to reproduce the image.
color filter array: A colored panel placed over the sensor, which keeps the
sensors photosites (which are sensitive to all colors) from responding to
light other than the color assigned to that pixel/photosite.
CompactFlash: A storage media commonly used in digital cameras, music
players, and other devices.
composite: In photography, an image composed of two or more parts of an
image, taken either from a single photo or from multiple photos. Usually,
composites are created so that the elements blend smoothly together.
composition: The arrangement of the main subject, other objects in a scene,
and/or the foreground and background.
compression: Reducing the size of a file by encoding using fewer bits of
information to represent the original. Some compression schemes, such as
JPEG, operate by discarding some image information; others, such as TIFF,
preserve all the detail in the original, discarding only redundant data.
See also GIF, JPEG, and TIFF.
continuous autofocus: An automatic focusing setting in which the camera
constantly refocuses the image as you frame the picture. This setting is often
the best choice for moving subjects. See also single autofocus.
continuous tone: Images that contain tones from the darkest to the lightest,
with a theoretically infinite range of variations in between.
contrast: The range of difference in the light to dark areas of a photo.

dock
679
contrasty: Having higher than optimal contrast.
crop: To trim an image or page by adjusting its boundaries.
dedicated flash: An electronic flash unit designed to work with the auto-
matic exposure features of a specific camera. Most such devices actually
measure the light reaching the sensor as a way of determining proper expo-
sure settings.
density: The ability of an object to stop or absorb light. The less light
reflected or transmitted by an object, the higher its density.
depth of field: A distance range in a photograph in which all included por-
tions of an image are at least acceptably sharp.
depth of focus: The range that the image-capturing surface (such as a sensor
or film) could be moved while maintaining acceptable focus. See also depth
of field.
desaturate: To reduce the purity or vividness of a color, making a color
appear to be washed out or diluted.
diaphragm: An adjustable component found in cameras, similar to the iris in
the human eye, which expands and contracts to provide specific-sized lens
openings, or f-stops. See also iris.
diffuse lighting: Soft, low-contrast lighting.
diffusing: Softening detail in an image.
digital single-lens reflex (dSLR): A high-end digital camera that accepts
interchangeable lenses; usually used by professionals or advanced amateur
photographers.
digital zoom: A way of simulating actual or optical zoom by magnifying the
pixels captured by the sensor. This technique generally produces results
inferior to optical zoom. See also optical zoom.
dither: A method of distributing pixels to extend the number of colors or
tones that can be represented. For example, two pixels of different colors
can be arranged in such a way that the eye visually merges them into a
third color.
dock: A device furnished with some digital cameras that links to your com-
puter or printer, allowing you to interface the camera with the other devices
simply by setting it in the dock’s cradle.

docking
680
docking: The ability to lock an image editing program’s toolbars, palettes,
and other features of the interface at fixed locations, usually one edge of the
application window.
dodging: A darkroom term for blocking part of an image as it is exposed,
thus lightening its tones. Image editors can simulate this effect by lightening
portions of an image using a brush-like tool.
dots per inch (dpi): The resolution of a printed image, expressed in the
number of printer dots in an inch. You’ll often see dpi used to refer to monitor
screen resolution or the resolution of scanners. However, neither of these
use dots; the correct term for a monitor’s resolution is pixels per inch (ppi);
a scanner captures a particular number of samples per inch (spi).
dye-sublimation (dye-sub): A printing technique in which inks are heated
and transferred to a polyester substrate to form an image. Because the
amount of color applied can be varied by the degree of heat (and up to
256 different hues for each color), dye sublimation devices can print as
many as 16.8 million different colors.
electronic viewfinder (EVF): An LCD located inside a digital camera and
used to provide a view of the subject based on the image generated by the
camera’s sensor.
emulsion: The light-sensitive coating on a piece of film, paper, or printing
plate. When making prints or copies, it’s important to know which side is the
emulsion side so that the image can be exposed in the correct orientation
(not reversed). Advanced image editors, such as Photoshop, include Emulsion
Side Up and Emulsion Side Down options in its Print Preview feature.
equivalent focal length: A digital camera’s focal length translated into the
corresponding values for a 35mm film camera. For example, a 5.8–17.4mm
lens on a digital camera might provide the same view as a 38–114mm zoom
with a film camera. Equivalents are needed because sensor size and lens
focal lengths are not standardized for digital cameras, and translating the
values provides a basis for comparison.
EXIF: Exchangeable Image File Format. Developed to standardize the exchange
of image data between hardware devices and software. A variation on JPEG,
EXIF is used by most digital cameras and includes information such as the
date and time a photo was taken, the camera settings, resolution, amount of
compression, and other data.
existing light: In photography, the illumination that is already present in a
scene. Existing light can include daylight or the artificial lighting currently
being used but is not considered to be electronic flash or additional lamps
set up by the photographer. Also sometimes called existing darkness.

flat
681
export: To transfer text or images from a document to another format.
exposure: The amount of light allowed to reach the film or sensor, deter-
mined by the intensity of the light, the amount admitted by the iris of the
lens, and the length of time determined by the shutter speed.
exposure program: An automatic setting in a digital camera that provides
the optimum combination of shutter speed and f-stop at a given level of 
illumination. For example, a sports exposure program would use a faster,
action-stopping shutter speed and larger lens opening instead of the smaller,
depth of field–enhancing lens opening and slower shutter speed that might
be favored by a close-up program at exactly the same light level.
exposure values (EV): EV settings are a way of adding or decreasing expo-
sure without the need to reference f-stops or shutter speeds. For example, if
you tell your camera to add +1EV, it will provide twice as much exposure by
using a larger f-stop, slower shutter speed, or both.
f-stop: The relative size of the lens aperture, which helps determine both
exposure and depth of field. The larger the f-stop number, the smaller the
aperture. It helps to think of f-stops as denominators of fractions, so that f/2
is larger than f/4, which is larger than f/8, just as 1⁄2, 1⁄4, and 1⁄8 represent ever-
smaller fractions. In photography, a given f-stop number is multiplied by 1.4
to arrive at the next number that admits exactly half as much light. So, f/1.4
is twice as large as f/2.0 (1.4 x 1.4), which is twice as large as f/2.8 (2 x 1.4),
which is twice as large as f/4 (2.8 x 1.4). The f-stops that follow are f/5.6, f/8,
f/11, f/16, f/22, f/32, and so on. Most digital cameras have f-stops limited to a
range of about f/2.8 to f/8.
feather: To fade the borders of an image element so that it blends more
smoothly with another layer.
fill flash: A camera setting that causes the electronic flash to always fire,
which produces the effect of filling in shadows in brightly illuminated images.
fill lighting: In photography, lighting used to illuminate shadows.
filter: In photography, a device that fits over the lens, changing the light in
some way. In image editing, a feature that changes the pixels in an image to
produce blurring, sharpening, and other special effects.
FireWire (IEEE 1394): A fast serial interface used by scanners, digital cam-
eras, printers, and other devices. Introduced for the Macintosh and now
found on all new Macs, FireWire is now becoming more popular on PCs.
flat: An image with low contrast is said to appear flat.

flatbed scanner
682
flatbed scanner: A type of scanner that reads one line of an image at a time,
recording it as a series of samples, or pixels.
fluorescent illumination: Light produced by a tube coated on the inside
with a material that glows. Mercury vapor in the tube emits ultraviolet 
radiation that is converted to visible radiation by the fluorescent coating.
The most important aspect for photographers to consider is that fluorescent
illumination doesn’t have a true color temperature the way daylight and
tungsten illumination does, so special filtration or white balance settings
must be used to compensate for color shifts. See also tungsten light.
focal length: The distance between the film and the optical center of the
lens when the lens is focused on infinity, usually measured in millimeters.
focus: To adjust the lens to produce a sharp image.
focus range: The minimum and maximum distances within which a camera
is able to produce a sharp image, such as two inches to infinity.
focus tracking: The ability of the automatic focus feature of a camera to
change focus as the distance between the subject and the camera changes.
Some cameras use predictive focus to guess where the proper focus point will
be, based on the movement direction of the main subject.
four-color printing: Another term for process color, in which cyan, magenta,
yellow, and black inks are used to reproduce all the colors in the original image.
Four Thirds system: The Four Thirds system is a new open standard for 
digital SLR cameras with interchangeable lenses using a 4⁄3-inch image sensor.
Adopted by a few manufacturers, such as Olympus, the Four Thirds system
establishes a common standard for lens design and mounts, improving com-
patibility between lenses and camera bodies even if they are produced by
different manufacturers.
framing: In photography, composing your image in the viewfinder. In compo-
sition, using elements of an image to form a sort of picture frame around an
important subject.
frequency: The number of lines per inch in a halftone screen.
front-curtain sync: The default kind of electronic flash synchronization tech-
nique, originally associated with focal plane shutters, which consists of a
traveling set of curtains, including a front curtain (opens to reveal the film
or sensor) and a rear curtain (follows at a distance determined by shutter
speed to conceal the film or sensor at the conclusion of the exposure).
Front-curtain sync causes the flash to fire at the beginning of the exposure —
in the instant that the first curtain of the focal plane shutter finishes its

683
movement across the film or sensor plane. With slow shutter speeds, this
feature can create a blur effect from the ambient light, showing as patterns
that follow a moving subject with the subject shown sharply frozen at the
beginning of the blur trail (think of an image of The Flash running backward).
See also rear-curtain sync.
front-lighting: Illumination that comes from the direction of the camera.
See also backlighting and side-lighting.
full-color image: An image that uses 24-bit color, resulting in 16.8 million
possible hues. Images are sometimes captured in a scanner or digital camera
with more colors, but the colors are reduced to the best 16.8 million shades
for manipulation in image editing.
gamma: A numerical way of representing the contrast of an image. Devices
such as monitors typically don’t reproduce the tones in an image in straight-
line fashion (all colors represented in exactly the same way as they appear in
the original). Instead, some tones might be favored over others, and gamma
provides a method of tonal correction that takes the human eye’s perception
of neighboring values into account. Gamma values range from 1.0 to about
2.5. The Macintosh has traditionally used a gamma of 1.8, which is relatively
flat compared with television. Windows PCs use a 2.2 gamma value, which
has more contrast and is more saturated.
gamma correction: A method for changing the brightness, contrast, or color
balance of an image by assigning new values to the gray or color tones of an
image to more closely represent the original shades. Gamma correction can
be either linear or nonlinear. Linear correction applies the same amount of
change to all the tones. Nonlinear correction varies the changes tone by
tone, or in highlight, midtone, and shadow areas separately to produce a
more accurate or improved appearance.
gamut: The range of viewable and printable colors for a particular color
model, such as RGB (red/green/blue; used for monitors) or CMYK (cyan/
magenta/yellow/black; used for printing).
Gaussian blur: A method of diffusing an image using a bell-shaped curve to
calculate the pixels that will be blurred, rather than blurring all pixels, thus
producing a more random, less “processed” look.
GIF: Graphics Interchange Format. An image file format limited to 256 differ-
ent colors that compresses the information by combining similar colors and
discarding the rest. Condensing a 16.8-million-color photographic image to
only 256 different hues often produces a poor-quality image, but GIF is useful
for images that don’t have a great many colors, such as charts or graphs.
The GIF format also includes transparency options and can include multiple
images to produce animations that may be viewed on a Web page or other
application. See also JPEG and TIFF.

grain
684
grain: The metallic silver in film that forms the photographic image. The term
is often applied to the seemingly random noise in an image (both conventional
and digital) that provides an overall texture.
gray card: A piece of cardboard or other material with a standardized 
18-percent reflectance. Gray cards can be used as a reference for deter-
mining correct exposure or white balance.
grayscale image: An image that is represented using 256 shades of gray.
Scanners often capture grayscale images with 1,024 or more tones but
reduce them to 256 grays for manipulation by Photoshop.
halftone: A method used to reproduce continuous-tone images, representing
the image as a series of dots.
high contrast: A wide range of density in a print, negative, or other image.
highlights: The brightest parts of an image containing detail.
histogram: A kind of chart showing the relationship of tones in an image
using a series of 256 vertical bars, one for each brightness level. A histogram
chart typically looks like a curve with one or more slopes and peaks,
depending on how many highlight, midtone, and shadow tones are present
in the image. Histograms can appear in camera displays or in image editing
software to help judge an image. They identify the shadows, midtones, and
highlights of an image.
hue: The color of light that is reflected from an opaque object or transmitted
through a transparent one.
hyperfocal distance: When a lens is focused on the hyperfocal distance, the
depth of field extends from half that distance to infinity. The point can be
calculated or looked up in tables.
image rotation: A feature found in some digital cameras that senses whether
a picture was taken in horizontal or vertical orientation. That information is
embedded in the picture file so that the camera and compatible software
applications can automatically display the image in the correct orientation.
image stabilization: A technology that compensates for camera shake, 
usually by adjusting the position of the camera sensor or lens elements in
response to movements of the camera.
incident light: Light falling on a surface, as opposed to light reflected from a
surface.

JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group)
685
indexed color image: An image with 256 different colors, as opposed to a
grayscale image, which has 256 different shades of the tones between black
and white.
infinity: A distance so great that any object at that distance will be repro-
duced sharply if the lens is focused at the infinity position.
interchangeable lens: Lens designed to be readily attached to and detached
from a camera; a feature found in more sophisticated digital cameras.
International Organization for Standardization (ISO): A governing body that
provides standards used to represent film speed, or the equivalent sensitivity
of a digital camera’s sensor. Digital camera sensitivity is expressed in ISO set-
tings. The organization has chosen the word ISO as its standard abbreviation
because the name of the group itself varies in the different languages of its
members.
interpolation: A technique that digital cameras, scanners, and image editors
use to create new pixels based on the values of surrounding pixels whenever
an image is resized or changed in resolution. Devices such as scanners and
digital cameras also use interpolation to create pixels in addition to those
actually captured, thereby increasing the apparent resolution or color infor-
mation in an image. For example, in a typical digital camera, pixels capture
only red, green, or blue information, so the other colors present at that
image position are calculated by using interpolation.
invert: In image editing, to change an image into its negative; black becomes
white, white becomes black; dark gray becomes light gray; and so forth.
Colors are also changed to their complementary color: green becomes
magenta, blue turns to yellow, and red is changed to cyan.
iris: A set of thin overlapping leaves in a camera lens that pivots outward to
form a circular opening of variable size to control the amount of light that
can pass through a lens. See also diaphragm.
jaggies: Staircasing effect of lines that are not perfectly horizontal or vertical,
caused by pixels that are too large to represent the line accurately. See also
anti-aliasing.
JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group): A file format that supports 
24-bit color and reduces file sizes by selectively discarding image data. Digital
cameras generally use JPEG compression to pack more images onto memory
cards. You can select how much compression is used (and therefore how
much information is thrown away) by selecting from among the Standard,
Fine, Super Fine, or other quality settings offered by your camera. See also GIF
and TIFF.

landscape
686
landscape: The orientation of an image in which the longest dimension is
horizontal; also called wide orientation.
latitude: The range of camera exposures that produce acceptable images
with a particular digital sensor or film.
layer: A way of managing elements of an image in stackable overlays that
can be manipulated separately, moved to a different stacking order, or made
partially or fully transparent.
lens: One or more elements of optical glass or similar material designed to
collect and focus rays of light to form a sharp image on the film, paper,
sensor, or screen.
lens aperture: The lens opening, or iris, that admits light to the film or
sensor. The size of the lens aperture is usually measured in f-stops. See also
f-stop, diaphragm, and iris.
lens flare: An optical feature of photography that is both a bane and a cre-
ative outlet. It is an effect produced by the reflection of light internally
among elements of an optical lens. Bright light sources within or just outside
the field of view cause lens flare. Flare can be reduced by the use of coatings
on the lens elements or with the use of lens hoods. Photographers some-
times use the effect as a creative technique, and some image editors include
a filter that lets you add lens flare at your whim.
lens hood: A device that shades the lens, protecting it from extraneous light
outside the actual picture area that can reduce the contrast of the image or
allow lens flare.
lens speed: The largest lens opening (smallest f-number) at which a lens can
be set. A fast lens transmits more light and has a larger opening than a slow
lens. Determined by the maximum aperture of the lens in relation to its focal
length; the speed of a lens is relative: a 400mm lens with a maximum aper-
ture of f/3.5 is considered extremely fast, and a 28mm f/3.5 lens is thought to
be relatively slow.
lighten: An image editing function that is the equivalent to the photographic
darkroom technique of dodging. Tones in a given area of an image are gradu-
ally changed to lighter values. See also dodging.
lighting ratio: The proportional relationship between the amount of light
falling on the subject from the main light and other lights.
line art: Usually, images that consist only of white pixels and one color; rep-
resented in Photoshop as a bitmap.

midtones
687
line screen: The resolution or frequency of a halftone screen, expressed in
lines per inch. The term is used within the printing industry.
lithography: Another name for offset printing.
lossless compression: An image-compression scheme, such as TIFF, that pre-
serves all image detail. When the image is decompressed, it is identical to
the original version. See also compression.
lossy compression: An image-compression scheme, such as JPEG, that cre-
ates smaller files by discarding image information, which can affect image
quality. See also compression.
luminance: The brightness or intensity of an image, determined by the
amount of gray in a hue.
LZW compression: A method of compacting TIFF files in image editors and
other applications by using the Lempel-Ziv Welch compression algorithm,
which is an optional compression scheme also offered by some digital 
cameras.
macro lens: A lens that provides continuous focusing from infinity to
extreme close-ups, often to a reproduction ratio of 1:2 (half life-size) or 1:1
(life-size).
macro photography: The process of taking photographs of small objects at
magnifications of 1X or more.
magnification ratio: A relationship that represents the amount of enlarge-
ment provided by the macro setting of the zoom lens, macro lens, or with
other close-up devices.
matrix metering: A system of exposure calculation used in digital cameras
that looks at many different segments of an image to determine the brightest
and darkest portions.
maximum aperture: The largest lens opening or f-stop available with a par-
ticular lens or with a zoom lens at a particular magnification.
mechanical: Camera-ready copy with text and art already in position for
photographing to make printing plates.
midtones: Parts of an image with tones of an intermediate value, usually in
the 25–75 percent range. Many image editing features allow you to manipu-
late midtones independently from the highlights and shadows.

moiré
688
moiré: An objectionable pattern caused by the interference of halftone
screens, frequently generated by rescanning an image that has already been
halftoned. An image editor can frequently minimize these effects by blurring
the patterns.
monochrome: Having a single color, plus white. Grayscale images are mono-
chrome (shades of gray and white only).
monopod: A one-legged support, or unipod, used to steady the camera.
See also tripod.
negative: A representation of an image in which the tones are reversed,
blacks as white, and vice versa.
neutral color: In image editing’s RGB mode, a color in which red, green, and
blue are present in equal amounts, producing a gray.
noise: In an image, pixels with randomly distributed color values. Noise in
digital photographs tends to be the product of low-light conditions and long
exposures, particularly when you have set your camera to a higher ISO
rating than normal.
noise reduction: A technology used to cut down on the amount of random
information in a digital picture, usually caused by long exposures at increased
sensitivity ratings. Noise reduction involves the camera automatically taking a
second blank/dark exposure at the same settings that contains only noise, and
then using the blank photo’s information to cancel out the noise in the original
picture. With most cameras, the process is very quick but can double the
amount of time required to take the photo.
normal lens: A lens that makes the image in a photograph appear in a per-
spective that is like that of the original scene, typically with a field of view of
roughly 45 degrees. A quick way to calculate the focal length of a normal lens
is to measure the diagonal of the sensor or film frame used to capture the
image, usually ranging around 7–45mm.
optical zoom: Magnification produced by the elements of a digital camera’s
lens, as opposed to digital zoom, which merely magnifies the captured pixels
to simulate additional magnification. True optical zoom is always to be pre-
ferred over the simulated digital variety. See also digital zoom.
overexposure: A condition in which too much light reaches the film or sensor,
producing a dense negative or a very bright/light print, slide, or digital image.
panning: Moving the camera so that the image of a moving object remains in
the same relative position in the viewfinder as you take a picture. The even-
tual effect creates a strong sense of movement because the main subject
remains relatively sharp while the background blurs.

process color
689
panorama: A broad view, usually scenic. Some digital cameras also have a
panorama mode used with software to stitch the images together.
parallax compensation: An adjustment made by the camera or photogra-
pher to account for the difference in views between the taking lens and the
external optical viewfinder.
perspective: The rendition of apparent space in a photograph, such as how
far the foreground and background appear to be separated from each other.
Perspective is determined by the distance of the camera to the subject.
Objects that are close appear large, and distant objects appear to be smaller.
perspective control lens: A special lens that allows correcting distortion
resulting from a high or low camera angle.
Photo CD: A special type of CD-ROM developed by Eastman Kodak Company
that can store high-quality photographic images in a proprietary space-saving
format, along with music and other data.
Picture CD: A CD-ROM designed to hold digital images, often returned by
photo finishers with a standard order of prints. The images are stored in a
relatively low-resolution JPEG format of sufficient size for use for non-critical
applications at home.
pixel: The smallest element of a digital image that can be assigned a color.
The term is a contraction of picture element.
pixels per inch (ppi): The number of pixels that can be displayed per inch,
usually used to refer to pixel resolution from a scanned image or on a monitor.
plug-in: A software module such as a filter that can be accessed from within
an image editor to provide special functions.
portrait: The orientation of an image in which the longest dimension is 
vertical, also called tall orientation. In photography, a formal picture of an
individual or sometimes a group.
positive: The opposite of a negative; an image with the same tonal relation-
ships as those in the original scenes — for example, a finished print or a slide.
prepress: The stages of the reproduction process that precede printing,
when halftones, color separations, and printing plates are created.
process color: The four color pigments used in color printing: cyan,
magenta, yellow, and black (CMYK).

RAW
690
RAW: An image file format offered by many digital cameras that includes all
the unprocessed information captured by the camera. RAW files are very
large and must be processed by a special program, such as Adobe’s Camera
RAW plug-in or software provided by the camera vendor, after being down-
loaded from the camera.
rear-curtain sync: An optional kind of electronic flash synchronization tech-
nique, originally associated with focal plane shutters, which consists of a
traveling set of curtains, including a front curtain (opens to reveal the film
or sensor) and a rear curtain (follows at a distance determined by shutter
speed to conceal the film or sensor at the conclusion of the exposure).
Rear-curtain sync causes the flash to fire at the end of the exposure, an
instant before the second or rear curtain of the focal plane shutter begins to
move, allowing background light to record when taking flash pictures under
dim illumination. With slow shutter speeds, this feature can create a blur
effect from the ambient light, showing as patterns that follow a moving sub-
ject with subject shown sharply frozen at the end of the blur trail. If you
were shooting a photo of The Flash, the superhero would appear sharp, with
a ghostly trail behind him. See also front-curtain sync.
red-eye: An effect from flash photography that appears to make a person or
animal’s eyes glow red (or among animals, yellow or green). Caused by light
bouncing from the retina of the eye, red-eye is most pronounced in dim illumi-
nation (when the irises are wide open) and when the electronic flash is close
to the lens and therefore prone to reflect directly back. Image editors can fix
red-eye through cloning other pixels over the offending red or orange ones.
red-eye reduction: A way of reducing or eliminating the red-eye phenome-
non. Some cameras offer a red-eye reduction mode that uses a preflash that
causes the irises of the subjects’ eyes to contract just before a second,
stronger flash is used to take the picture.
reflection copy: Original artwork that is viewed by light reflected from its
surface rather than transmitted through it.
reflector: Any device used to reflect light onto a subject to improve balance
of exposure (contrast). Another way is to use fill flash. See also fill flash.
register: To align images, usually for lining up color separations for making
printing plates. See also registration mark.
registration mark: A mark that appears on a printed image, generally for
color separations, to help in aligning the printing plates. Many applications,
such as Photoshop, can add registration marks to your images when they
are printed.

sensitivity
691
reproduction ratio: Used in macro photography to indicate the magnifica-
tion of a subject.
resample: To change the size or resolution of an image. Resampling down
discards pixel information in an image; resampling up adds pixel information
through interpolation. See also interpolation.
resolution: In image editing, the number of pixels per inch. Resolution is
used to determine the size of the image when printed. That is, an 8 x 10-inch
image that is saved with 300 pixels per inch (ppi) resolution will print in 
an 8 x 10-inch size on a 300 dpi printer or 4 x 5 inches on a 600 dpi printer.
In digital photography, resolution is the number of pixels that a camera or
scanner can capture.
retouch: To edit an image, most often to remove flaws or to create a new effect.
RGB color mode: A color mode that represents the three colors (red, green,
and blue) used by devices such as scanners and monitors to reproduce
color. Photoshop works in RGB mode by default and even displays CMYK
images by converting them to RGB. See also CMY(K) color model.
saturation: The purity of color; the amount by which a pure color is diluted
with white or gray.
scale: To change the size of some or all of an image. Rescaling also affects
file size.
scanner: A device that captures an image of a piece of artwork, a slide, or a
negative and converts it to a digitized image or bitmap that the computer
can handle.
Secure Data memory card: A flash memory card format that is gaining
acceptance for use in digital cameras and other applications.
selection: In image editing, an area of an image chosen for manipulation, usu-
ally surrounded by a moving series of dots called a selection border.
selective focus: Choosing a lens opening that produces a shallow depth of
field. Usually, this is used to isolate a subject by causing most other elements
in the scene to be blurred.
self-timer: Mechanism that delays the opening of the shutter for some sec-
onds after the release has been operated.
sensitivity: A measure of the degree of response of a film or sensor to light,
measured in digital cameras using ISO ratings.

sensor array
692
sensor array: The grid-like arrangement of the red-, green-, and blue-sensitive
elements of a digital camera’s solid-state capture device. One vendor offers a
sensor array that captures a fourth color, termed emerald.
shadow: The darkest part of an image, represented on a digital image by pixels
with low numeric values or on a halftone by the smallest or absence of dots.
sharpening: Increasing the apparent sharpness of an image by boosting the
contrast between adjacent pixels that form an edge.
shutter: In a conventional film camera, the mechanism consisting of blades,
a curtain, plate, or some other movable cover that controls the time during
which light reaches the film. Digital cameras can use actual shutters or simu-
late the action of a shutter electronically. Quite a few use a combination,
employing a mechanical shutter for slow speeds and an electronic version
for higher speeds. Many cameras include a reassuring shutter sound that
mimics the noise a mechanical camera’s shutter makes.
shutter-priority: An exposure mode in which you set the shutter speed and
the camera determines the appropriate f-stop. See also aperture-preferred.
side-lighting: Light striking the subject from the side relative to the position
of the camera; produces shadows and highlights to create modeling on the
subject.
single autofocus: The camera lens focused only when the shutter release
button is partially depressed, just prior to taking the picture. See also contin-
uous autofocus.
single lens reflex (SLR) camera: A type of camera, often with interchange-
able lenses, that allows you to see through the camera’s lens as you look in
the camera’s viewfinder. Other camera functions, such as light metering and
flash control, also operate through the camera’s lens. See also digital single-
lens reflex (dSLR)
slave unit: An accessory flash unit that supplements the main flash, usually
triggered electronically when the slave senses the light output by the main unit.
slide: A photographic transparency mounted for projection.
slow-sync: An electronic flash technique for using the flash at a slow shutter
speed, which allows background details to show more clearly.
SmartMedia: A type of memory card storage, generally outmoded today
because its capacity is limited to 128MB, for digital cameras and other com-
puter devices.

threshold
693
smoothing: To blur the boundaries between edges of an image, often to
reduce a rough or jagged appearance.
soft focus: A diffused, unsharp image effect produced by the use of a special
lens that creates soft outlines.
soft lighting: Lighting that is low or moderate in contrast, such as on an
overcast day.
specular highlight: Bright spots in an image caused by reflection of light
sources.
spot color: Ink used in a print job in addition to black or process colors.
spot metering: An exposure calculation system that emphasizes a small 
portion of the image area, usually in the center of the frame. Some cameras
let you move the “spot” to other portions of the image area.
storage media: In the digital camera world, storage media most often refers
to the flash memory cards used to retain images before they are transferred
to your computer or another device. There are nearly a dozen different types
media used by digital cameras, and the number seems to grow monthly.
The most common types include two sizes of CompactFlash cards (the main
difference is in the thickness); microdrives (tiny hard disks), Sony Memory
Sticks, Sony Memory Stick Duo, Secure Digital (SD) cards, SmartMedia Card
(generally an obsolete format today), xD Picture Card, and Reduced Size
MultiMedia Card.
subtractive primary colors: Cyan, magenta, and yellow, which are the printing
inks that, when mixed together equally, theoretically absorb all color and pro-
duce black. In practice, however, they generate a muddy brown, so black ink is
added to preserve detail (especially in shadows). The combination of the
three colors and black is CMYK. (K represents black, to differentiate it from
blue in the RGB model, and is sometimes placed in parentheses to indicate
that it’s an optional part of the color model.) See also CMY(K) color model.
Tagged Image File Format: See TIFF.
telephoto: A lens or lens setting that magnifies an image.
thermal wax transfer: A printing technology in which dots of wax from a
ribbon are applied to paper when heated by thousands of tiny elements in
a printhead.
threshold: A predefined brightness level used by a device to determine
whether a pixel will be represented as black or white.

thumbnail
694
thumbnail: A miniature copy of a page or image that provides a preview of
the original.
TIFF (Tagged Image File Format): A standard graphics file format that can
be used to store grayscale and color images plus selection masks.
time exposure: A picture taken by leaving the lens open for a long period,
usually more than one second. The camera is generally locked down with a
tripod to prevent blur during the long exposure.
tint: A color with white added to it. In graphic arts, tint often refers to the
percentage of one color added to another.
tolerance: The range of color or tonal values that will be selected, with a
tool like an image editor’s Magic Wand, or filled with paint when using a tool
like the Paint Bucket.
transparency: A positive photographic image on film, viewed or projected
by light shining through the film.
transparency scanner: A type of scanner that captures color slides and/or
negatives.
tripod: A three-legged supporting stand used to hold the camera steady.
Especially useful when using slow shutter speeds and/or telephoto lenses.
TTL: Through the lens. A system of providing viewing through the actual
lens that takes the picture (as with a camera with an electronic viewfinder,
LCD display, or single-lens reflex viewing), or calculation of exposure or
focus based on the view through the lens.
tungsten light: Light from ordinary room lamps and ceiling fixtures, as
opposed to fluorescent illumination.
underexposure: A condition in which too little light reaches the film or
sensor, producing a thin negative (one with little density), a dark slide, a
muddy-looking print, or a dark digital image.
unipod: A one-legged support, or monopod, used to steady the camera.
See also tripod.
unsharp masking: The process for increasing the contrast between adjacent
pixels in an image, thus increasing sharpness, especially around edges.
USB (Universal Serial Bus): A high-speed serial communication method
commonly used to connect digital cameras and other devices to a computer.

zoom
695
viewfinder: The device in a camera used to frame the image. With an SLR
camera, the viewfinder is also used to focus the image if focusing manually.
You can also focus an image with the LCD display of a digital camera, which
is a type of viewfinder.
vignetting: Adding dark corners to an image; often produced by using a lens
hood that is too small for the field of view, or generated artificially by using
image editing techniques.
white: The color formed by combining all the colors of light (in the additive
color model) or by removing all colors (in the subtractive model). See also
additive primary colors and subtractive primary colors.
white balance: The adjustment of a digital camera to the color temperature
of the light source. Interior illumination is relatively red; outdoor light is rela-
tively blue. Digital cameras often set correct white balance automatically or
let you do it through menus. Image editors can often do some color correc-
tion of images that were exposed using the wrong white-balance setting.
white point: In image editing, the lightest pixel in the highlight area of an
image.
wide-angle lens: A lens that has a shorter focal length and a wider field of
view than a normal lens for a particular film or digital image format.
zoom: In image editing, to enlarge or reduce the size of an image on your
monitor. In photography, to enlarge or reduce the size of an image using the
magnification settings of a lens.
