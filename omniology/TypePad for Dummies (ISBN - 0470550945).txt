Authors’ Acknowledgments
This book was a team effort, in every sense. We heartily thank our hard-
working and patient project editor, Susan Pink — we learned so much from 
you! Many thanks to Amy Fandrei and Jodi Jensen of Wiley Publishing, who 
helped us in countless ways. Still more thanks to the rest of the Wiley team. 
Thank you, too, to Andy Wibbels of Six Apart for serving as our technical 
editor.
We give our deep thanks to the readers of our blogs, Blogging Basics 101 and 
Rocks In My Dryer. You guys are the reasons we get to do what we do and 
we’re endlessly thankful you’ve taken the time to offer us your support and 
encouragement over the years.
Melanie: I would like to thank my husband, Bill, and our awesome, funny 
children. Without your patience and support my blogging endeavors, let 
alone writing a book, wouldn’t be possible. Our life is the life I always wanted.
I also want to thank Jann Nelson, Donna Monthei, and John and Robin 
Monthei for always being available to help with anything that came up; 
Robert M. Brown, PhD for being a constant voice in my head telling me to 
write well; and Kathy Cordeiro for so many things I couldn’t possibly list 
them all. I appreciate all of you.
Shannon: I’d like to thank my parents, Don and Cathy Dunn, and my 
grandmother, Bonnie Young, for all the practical help and support through 
this hectic book-writing process. To the other family members and friends 
who offered healthy doses of sanity and encouragement — thank you. I 
couldn’t have done it without you!
A very special thanks to my four fantastic kids for being such good sports. 
I’m proud of this book, but I’m a million times prouder to be your mom. 
Most of all, thank you to Mac for being Mac, which is always just exactly what 
I need.

Introduction
T
he blogosphere is a busy place. It’s hard to nail down a firm number, but 
the best estimates indicate that there are more than 200 million blogs 
bumping around globally in cyberspace. It can be daunting for a beginning 
blogger (or even an intermediate one) to comfortably find a spot of his or her 
own in such a crowd. Where can you learn all the technical jargon you need 
to know? How do you host a blog? How do you manage a community? What 
do you do about privacy concerns? Is it really even possible to make money 
in the blogosphere?
Fortunately, TypePad exists as a very large and streamlined toolbox to help 
bloggers of all levels of experience and interest manage their home on the 
Web. It is widely regarded in the blogging world as a simple, affordable, and 
easy-to-manage platform, used by millions of bloggers around the world. 
TypePad is frequently updated with new features — including a complete 
overhaul in 2009 — in an effort to offer users the best of the blogosphere.
We have our own TypePad history — professional and personal. Melanie is 
a technical writer who has blogged professionally for years on numerous 
blogging platforms, including TypePad, giving her a solid basis for compari-
son. Shannon is a personal blogger who has been hammering out posts from 
the TypePad Dashboard since 2006. Just like you, we started out as begin-
ners. We studied the TypePad help section and submitted help tickets. We 
discovered some shortcuts and found out other things the hard way. We 
asked the same questions you’re asking now, and we’re eager to show you 
what our own TypePad experience has taught us.
About This Book
Because you’ve picked up this book, chances are you fall into one of two 
categories: You want to start your first blog, and you’ve heard that TypePad 
is a user-friendly way to find your place in the blogosphere; or you already 
have a TypePad blog, and you want to better understand some of the signifi-
cant changes Six Apart made in 2009 when it released the newest version of 
TypePad. Or we may be completely off-base and you just picked up this book 
because it’s a pretty yellow color. Whatever the reason, we’re glad you’re 
reading it.
We’ve written this book with the beginning to intermediate TypePad user in 
mind and have included information on the most recent features available to 
users as of late 2009.

2
TypePad For Dummies 
Even beginners can expect to find TypePad a hassle-free tool for building a 
polished, professional blog. Just as TypePad is known for its user-friendliness, 
we’ve written this book to be user-friendly as well. You won’t find an abun-
dance of technical talk, because we know that many TypePad users choose 
TypePad specifically to avoid technical headaches. We tell you the terms, 
techniques, and processes you need to know to navigate this software like 
a pro, even if you do not bring a lot of technical experience to the table. 
Whether you’re blogging as a hobbyist or as a professional, we fully expect 
this book to give you what you need to build a stellar TypePad blog.
Conventions Used in This Book
Conventions are large and scary gatherings of unknown people with name 
tags, but don’t worry — we don’t have any of those in this book. The conven-
tions we’re talking about in this book are simply formatting rules we’ll follow 
to make it easier to navigate the information we’ve shared. Here are the ones 
we’ll use.
When we place a word in italics, we’re telling you that it’s an important word 
you need to know, and we define it immediately. Let’s try it out:
Your userpic can be a picture of yourself or your brand. A brand is simply 
a concept or visual image your readers associate with you.
When you see a word written in bold, we’re referring to specific text that you 
need to enter in the designated field on your screen. Here’s an example:
If you’re looking for a post you wrote about the world’s best hash brown 
casserole, typing hash brown in the search bar will pull up every post 
you’ve written that contains those words.
When we change the font to look like this, we’re indicating that this is 
a Web address (URL), an e-mail address, or a piece of code. Here’s one last 
example:
Choose your blog URL. The URL is your blog’s address online (for exam-
ple, http://www.typepadfordummies.typepad.com).
What You’re Not to Read
You certainly don’t have to read this book from cover to cover. We expect 
that you’ll likely jump around between chapters, searching for answers to 
your particular questions. We’ve written this book with that in mind — you’ll 

3
 Introduction
notice that we frequently point you toward another chapter where the topic 
is discussed in further detail.
If you already have a decent amount of TypePad experience, you’ll probably 
skip some parts of this book altogether. The earliest chapters, especially, 
are geared toward true beginners. If that isn’t you, skip ahead until you find 
the information you need. Likewise, if you’re just starting out as a blogger, 
some of the later chapters about custom CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and 
advanced templates may seem overwhelming. Don’t sweat it. Get comfortable 
with the easier parts of the process and then look at the later chapters in a 
few weeks or months. They won’t feel so overwhelming then.
So scan ahead, reread, underline, make notes, draw daisies in the margins — 
do whatever you have to do to make this book helpful. That’s why we wrote it.
Foolish Assumptions
Assumptions can be dangerous, but we had to make a few as we wrote this 
book. We’ve assumed the following:
 
✓ You either own a computer or have access to one, and you are familiar 
with its most basic functions.
 
✓ You know how to access the Internet, and you know how to maneuver 
around Web sites by pointing and clicking. (If not, you might want to 
check out The Everyday Internet All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies, 
by Peter Weverka.)
 
✓ You have an e-mail address and know how to use it.
 
✓ You have a general sense of what a blog is and probably have already 
read at least a few of them. (If not, you’d benefit from Blogging For 
Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Susannah Gardner and Shane Birley.)
 
✓ You may not know much about TypePad (at least, not yet — we’ll fix 
that soon enough), but you do understand that TypePad has something 
to do with blogging, and you want to find out more.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is organized into five parts. Our goal is to introduce you to every-
thing you’ll need to best use TypePad as your blogging platform. We start by 
explaining the basic premise of blogging, move on to setting up your TypePad 
account and blog, and then show you how to take your blog to the next level 
(with customized designs, for example).

4
TypePad For Dummies 
Part I: The Basics of Blogging
If you’re new to blogging, Part I is where you want to start. We explain the 
dynamics of blogging so you can understand why people blog and why com-
munity is such an important part of blogging. We also discuss how you can 
develop your own blogging identity and build a community around your 
particular niche. Then we introduce you to some of the basic technology that 
powers blogs (such as RSS feeds and search engine optimization). By the end 
of Chapter 1, you’ll know the difference between hosted and self-hosted blog-
ging platforms and which is right for your blog’s purposes.
In Chapter 2, we introduce you to Six Apart (TypePad’s parent company). 
We explain the costs of TypePad and help you decide which pricing level to 
choose based on whether you’re blogging for business, pleasure, or both.
Part II: Getting Started with TypePad
Part II helps you establish your account with basic settings and billing informa-
tion. Then we describe a TypePad Profile and why it’s important, and we walk 
you through setting up your own Profile. We show you what the Dashboard 
is and discuss each of the options and features it offers. Next, we get to what 
you’ve been waiting for: setting up your first blog. We walk you through choos-
ing your basic blog settings (for example, handling your RSS feeds and sharing 
your content), checking your stats (to see who’s visiting your blog), and man-
aging your posts after you’ve written them. We not only give you instructions 
to compose a blog post (including how to insert images into the post, format 
the text, and set keywords for your post) but also address how TypePad can 
help you manage your blogging community as your blog readership grows.
Part III: Adding Useful Elements 
to Your TypePad Blog
In Part III, you find the real nuts and bolts. You begin to customize your 
TypePad blog to reflect what suits you — and your readers — best. We tell 
you about dozens of tools available to TypePad bloggers who want to maxi-
mize their online space. We show you how to use TypeLists (TypePad’s way 
of sharing content in your blog’s sidebars) and widgets (bits of code that 
offer additional functionality for your blog, such as a search bar) to help 
you organize your content and make your blog more user-friendly. We also 
explain how to integrate podcasting and video into your blog.
We figure if you’re blogging, you probably have other social media accounts 
as well (maybe Twitter or Facebook?), and you’ll want to connect those 
Profiles with your blog. We have you covered. If you don’t have other social 

5
 Introduction
media accounts or would like to know what social media is, don’t worry. We 
define it and explain how you can use it to promote your blog.
Part III also deals with the meaty issue of TypePad blog design. We show you 
how to harness TypePad’s powerful design tools.
Part IV: Taking Your Blog 
to the Next Level
Part IV is for those of you who are ready to blog like a pro. We tackle the 
issue of migrating an existing blog to TypePad from more than one blogging 
platform. If you’re interested in making money from your blog, we help you 
sort through the various monetizing options (affiliate marketing, ad net-
works, or personal ad campaigns) so you can determine which one fits you 
best. Last, if you’re not afraid to get your hands dirty in some coding, you 
may be ready to customize your TypePad experience at the coding level. 
We share a few easy tweaks (such as changing color options or using your 
own header image) and move on to more advanced changes (such as using 
custom CSS). We also explain Advanced Templates, starting you down the 
path of making this powerful option work for you.
As we stated, if you’re a beginning blogger, Part IV may be daunting. However, 
many experienced TypePad bloggers can tell you stories of jumping in feet first 
when they first began blogging. It really is the best way to learn — you might 
surprise yourself by discovering that you enjoy the technical parts!
Part V: The Part of Tens
Part V is the place to find a list of quick-reference tips and tricks. We’ve 
found the best tips, TypePad resources, and TypePad blogs and listed them 
for you (with their URLs, of course). You can find out how to publish a post 
through e-mail or your cell phone and add e-mail subscriptions to your blog. 
We also tell you where you can find help for your TypePad questions, and we 
share a few tips on engaging courteously and professionally with your blog-
ging peers. Finally, we show you some phenomenal examples of customized 
TypePad blogs that will blow you away with their originality. These bloggers 
are implementing the best that the TypePad platform has to offer.
Appendixes
This section offers you some additional helpful information for polishing up 
your own blog. Interested in having your own domain name? We walk you 
through the how’s and why’s of owning your own domain name, helping you

TypePad For Dummies 
put your most professional foot forward. We also show you how to install a 
third-party statistics counter and give you some basic pointers about inter-
preting the blog traffic that funnels through these counters.
Icons Used in This Book
 
Pay special attention when you see this icon, because it means we’re sharing 
something especially important. Read it, highlight it, and read it again.
 
This icon may not appear very often, but when it does, it means we’re sharing 
some especially technical information that the Average Joe probably doesn’t 
really need to know. But if you’re a tech geek, or you want to become one, look 
for this icon to give you some technical tips. If technical tips make your head 
hurt, skip right past it.
 
We all love finding tips that make life easier, and we give you plenty of them in 
this book. When you see this icon, know that you’re reading a trick or a short-
cut worth learning — maybe we can save you some time.
 
This spooky little icon has a bomb on it, but never fear: You probably aren’t 
going to blow anything up. We use this icon to point out potential problems 
with certain issues, and we give you the know-how to avoid them.
Where to Go from Here
This one’s easy: Just turn the page, and let’s get started. Right away, we 
want to fill you in on some basic blogging principles, and then we’ll fill you 
in on some simple history about TypePad. If you already have a TypePad 
account, you might want to skip ahead to Chapter 4 (where we explain what 
the Dashboard is and how to use it). If you have some solid TypePad experi-
ence behind you, you can jump ahead even further, to Chapter 8 (where we 
discuss using TypeLists and widgets). Wherever you rejoin us, we’re looking 
forward to helping you navigate this user-friendly blogging software with 
confidence. It’s our goal that this book will put you solidly on the path to a 
TypePad blog that represents you or your business well.

In this part . . .
L
et’s start at the very beginning! This part of the book 
is aimed at those who are new to blogging and aren’t 
familiar with TypePad. We explain the basics of blogging 
technologies and help you understand what TypePad has 
to offer you.

B
efore we move ahead with some technical TypePad how-tos, let’s start 
at the beginning. If you’re not an experienced blogger, this chapter pro-
vides a simple framework for you, explaining the basic social dynamics and 
technology of blogging. The definitions and concepts we introduce in this 
chapter are used throughout the book, so a solid understanding of them is 
helpful. If you’ve already been blogging for some time, feel free to skip ahead 
to the next chapter.
In this chapter, we help you understand the social dynamics of a blog — how 
it works and why people even do it in the first place. We discuss the idea of 
community — a key difference between writing for a blog versus writing for 
a book or magazine — and we offer considerations for managing this com-
munity. We also explain some of the fundamental technological elements of 
a blog (including RSS feeds and search engine optimization) and how you 
can harness these elements to create a successful blog. All these points work 
toward producing a polished, attractive, user-friendly blog that invites par-
ticipation from readers.

Part I: The Basics of Blogging 
Dynamics of Blogging
Even if you don’t have a blog yourself, you probably at least read a few of them. 
You may already have a sense of the general ebb and flow of a blogger’s rela-
tionship with his or her readers. But reading a blog and writing a blog are two 
very different creatures — if you’re just starting out, you’d be wise to have a 
solid understanding of the blogging dynamic before you jump in with both feet. 
This section gives those of you in the planning stages a few things to consider.
What is a blog?
The word blog is short for weblog. It’s an online journal written by one or more 
authors. Some are updated multiple times a day; others are updated rarely, per-
haps once a month. Most of the time, the author’s most recent post is the first 
thing you see when you visit his or her blog, and as you scroll down, you’ll be 
able to read the posts in reverse sequence, from the most recent to the oldest.
Unlike writing for a book or magazine, writing a blog offers the author imme-
diate access to readers. There is no waiting around for editorial approval. A 
blogger can write a post and click Publish, and his or her words are instantly 
transmitted to the Web. Blogs have quickly joined the ranks of mainstream 
media as a cutting-edge and (sometimes!) accurate source of information for 
readers on a wide range of subjects.
Fundamental to the blogging experience is the presence of reader feedback 
in the form of a comments section for each post. The comments section is the 
place where readers can instantly agree, disagree, encourage, or ask ques-
tions of the author. Any comment you leave will, most likely, be visible to 
other readers of the blog. Many bloggers will tell you that some of the best, 
most robust discussion happens not in their own posts, but in the comments 
section. (You will occasionally encounter a blog that does not have a com-
ments section, but this is rare.)
Why do people blog?
In the grand scheme of things, blogging is a relatively new form of human 
interaction. Engaging with readers through a computer screen can be enjoy-
able, but it can generate its fair share of headaches. Considering the millions 
of blogs that currently exist, countless people clearly think blogging is worth 
the effort. But why? Most of the answers to that question fall under two main 
categories: blogging for fun and blogging for business.

11
 Chapter 1: Understanding Blogging and TypePad
Blogging for fun
It’s the reason most of us first ventured into the blogosphere — to have an 
online spot of our own that documents something important to us. Some 
people blog as a way to keep long-distance family members updated on the 
kids. Others enjoy using their blog as a journal for a specific process, such 
as a house remodeling or a weight-loss journey. Others document a hobby, 
such as knitting or woodworking, by sharing their achievements and offering 
tutorials. Plenty of others write a blog with no specific aim in mind — they 
keep a blog as a life journal, with no thematic thread running through it. You 
certainly don’t need an official reason to start a blog.
You may often hear tips about how to develop your blog and gain a large 
readership; in reality, a large readership and a vocal comments section are 
not even remotely necessary to enjoy the process of blogging. You may start 
a blog and, quite unexpectedly, develop a following. Conversely, you may 
happily churn out posts for the benefit of only a handful of readers. Either 
option is acceptable, and you will find that your blogging satisfaction is high-
est when you focus on the quality of your own content, not on the number 
of people who may or may not be reading. Some of the finest blogs around 
are those written purely as a hobby, and the authors’ clear passion for their 
topic makes the blogs so appealing to readers.
Most bloggers will tell you that a benefit of blogging (perhaps an unexpected 
one) is honing your writing and communication skills. As with most activities, 
we get better with practice, and preparing posts for a readership of any size 
can help us sharpen our writing abilities. Many people stumbled into blog-
ging to document a particular process, only to realize that they enjoyed the 
act of crafting a good sentence. Think of it as your payoff for staying awake in 
freshman composition!
How to find related blogs
Wondering whether there’s already a blog on 
your topic of interest? Visit blogsearch.
google.com a search engine specifically for 
searching other blogs (as opposed to other Web 
sites). Or visit blogs.com, a site owned by 
TypePad’s parent company, Six Apart. This site 
regularly links to blogs offering quality content 
on a range of subjects. Sites like these give you 
an opportunity to find out how (or whether) your 
particular topic is being addressed in the blog-
ging community. Is left-handed cake decorat-
ing your thing? You’ll probably find that there’s 
a blog on the subject. Even if someone already 
has your particular topic or idea covered, don’t 
hesitate to jump in and start, especially if you 
think you can offer a fresh perspective or an 
interesting twist.

12
Part I: The Basics of Blogging 
Blogging for business
A growing number of bloggers are earning income on their blogs, primar-
ily through selling ad space, a subject we tackle more fully in Chapter 12. 
Especially in your early blogging days, keep your expectations realistic when 
it comes to earning income — only a small minority of bloggers are able to 
earn enough income to fully support themselves through blogging. But it’s 
not a bad way to supplement your main income, even if only modestly.
Business blogging isn’t just for individuals; companies large and small are 
setting up interactive spots in the blogosphere where they can engage with 
customers. Even if these blogs don’t generate income themselves, they are a 
valuable (and very inexpensive) marketing tool for talking about new prod-
ucts, offering technical support, or explaining your creative process. If you’re 
a book author or musician, you may find the blogosphere is an efficient way 
to support your primary artistic purpose by connecting with the people who 
buy your books or music. In this interactive age, consumers increasingly 
expect to be able to engage online. Chapter 2 offers you some information 
about TypePad’s services geared toward business bloggers.
Specifically, small business owners with limited marketing budgets may find 
blogging to be invaluable in showcasing their product or service. Use a blog 
to host a giveaway of your product or offer photographs of new products 
coming out soon. Allow customers to give you feedback, and you might find 
your next big idea in your own comments section.
Building a blogging community
Blogging is, at its core, an instant form of dialogue between blogger and 
reader. People connect online by agreeing, disagreeing, laughing, commis-
erating, learning, or questioning, among other things. This dialogue creates 
connection, which in turn leads to a word you’ll hear often in the blogo-
sphere: community. Whether you’re blogging as an individual or as part of a 
bigger team or corporate entity, establishing a community is key to increas-
ing readership. To encourage that community, you’ll need to consider a few 
things before you start blogging, such as how you will engage with your read-
ers, handle negative comments, and project your intended image.
Understanding online community
Community, as described in the context of blogging, is simply the idea that 
people connect with one another online. Community refers to the way that 
people congregate in cyberspace, bound together by common interests or 
causes. People engage with one another online through comments, e-mails, 
social media (see Chapter 10), and other means, forming a sense of togetherness. 
A common element (usually) of the most widely read blogs is a strong sense of 
community — a feeling that the blog in question is a reliable place to gather, 
receive information, share ideas, and possibly even generate friendships.

13
 Chapter 1: Understanding Blogging and TypePad
 
It’s important to note that in defining what blogging community is, we should 
also take note of what it isn’t. Most wise and experienced bloggers will tell you 
that the online connection can be a strong one, but it should never take the 
place of real-life relationships. Avoid the temptation of engaging so heartily 
in your online community that you neglect the real one. Finding balance as a 
blogger is key, and you can do this by seeking out blogging tools that help you 
engage in the online community without letting it govern your life. In Chapter 
7, we discuss TypePad’s commenting features, explaining how you can use 
those tools to streamline your blog interactions in a practical way.
Engaging effectively in the online community
You may be blogging just for fun, with no intention of developing a reader-
ship. As we say earlier in this chapter, this is a perfectly valid reason to write 
a blog, and you shouldn’t feel any sense of obligation to draw readers to your 
blog if that’s not why you’re blogging. But if your aim is to turn your TypePad 
blog into a place where people want to gather, be deliberate in how you 
engage in the blogosphere. Some bloggers pay consultants big bucks to help 
generate a sense of community on their blog. The truth is that there is no 
magic formula for this — just hard work, good manners, and common sense. 
Here are a few things you can try:
 
✓ Offer your readers something useful. Building a successful blog ulti-
mately involves offering good content with a clear purpose — for exam-
ple, to inform, entertain, or encourage. Write for your own enjoyment, but 
(if you want to develop a readership) do it with your readers in mind — 
what is valuable to them? Chapter 6 offers more advice about writing 
good posts.
 
✓ Participate generously in the blogging community. Especially as you’re 
starting out, you can encourage dialogue at your own blog by partici-
pating in the dialogue elsewhere. Leave thoughtful comments at other 
blogs, and when you find something worth reading, link to it from your 
own blog. This builds goodwill with other bloggers and has a way of 
coming back to you.
 
✓ Elicit feedback. If it’s feedback you’re after, write in a way that invites 
it! Ask a question of your readers, or bring up a topic that you’re sure 
people want to discuss.
 
✓ Write often. People are more likely to gather at a blog that is updated 
at least a few times per week. Don’t have the time or inclination to 
post this often? Depending on the TypePad level you choose, you can 
write posts ahead of time and then schedule them to publish in the 
future (see Chapter 6). This helpful feature allows you to write multiple 
posts when the mood strikes you and publish them at your desired 
pace.
 
✓ Be user-friendly. Offer a design that is easy on your readers’ eyes 
(see Chapter 11) and use categories to make your blog searchable and 
streamlined (see Chapter 6).

14
Part I: The Basics of Blogging 
Setting standards
The give-and-take dynamic of an online community is generally a good thing 
for bloggers; most of us find the dialogue intriguing and stimulating. Many 
blogs with large readerships have grown, at least in part, because they’ve 
engaged effectively with readers and other bloggers. They’ve offered their 
readers something that is useful or entertaining or both. They’ve asked their 
readers for feedback, offering them a chance to interact with one another.
It’s not a bad idea for bloggers to set some commonsense ground rules at 
their blog, defining how they’ll manage things and how they expect their 
readers to interact. Many bloggers will go so far as to set up a separate 
page in which they spell out their guidelines for community interaction and 
etiquette. (See Chapter 6 for instructions on how TypePad allows you to set 
up a page and to find out how a page is different from a regular blog post.) 
Especially if you plan to blog about hot-button issues that can breed contro-
versy, setting guidelines might be a sanity saver for you. Some suggestions 
for these guidelines include
 
✓ Explaining whether or not you delete comments and if so, on what 
grounds (such as offensive language or name-calling, spam, or off-topic 
comments).
 
✓ Letting readers know that they can always expect a response to your 
private e-mails or that they can never expect one, or (perhaps more real-
istically) something in between.
 
✓ Spelling out your own guidelines on whether you accept payments 
for posts or free products in exchange for a review (see Chapter 12). 
Transparency in this department, particularly, is an important element 
of developing trust in your readers.
 
The blogosphere is a wide-open space, which means there is limitless poten-
tial for interaction from a wide variety of people. Don’t fear the occasional 
troll, which is blogspeak for a commenter who hangs around your comment 
section purposely to stir up trouble. It happens to nearly every blogger at 
some point, even those who are blogging about noncontroversial topics. It is 
generally prudent to ignore trollish behavior; giving attention to it often makes 
it worse. (The exception, of course, is if the behavior reaches a level that is 
threatening. In this case, you should always contact the proper authorities.) 
Don’t let yourself become discouraged by the occasional negativity; dust 
yourself off and think of what you enjoy about blogging. For every story about 
negative comments, there are a dozen stories about positive, helpful interac-
tions that may even lead to real-life friendships.
Considering privacy issues
Privacy is understandably a big deal to many bloggers. You may be starting 
a blog with the intention of growing a large readership and even building a 
business — if this is the case, you may be happy to have as many eyes as 
possible browsing through your blog. But particularly for people who blog as 

15
 Chapter 1: Understanding Blogging and TypePad
hobbyists or to chronicle more personal items such as daily family life, it can 
be disconcerting to know that complete strangers may read the words you 
write. TypePad offers several privacy options, including password protection, 
comment blocking, and search-engine blocking (we tell you how to apply these 
options in Chapters 4, 7, and 5, respectively). Even with these options in place, 
it’s still a good idea for bloggers to apply common sense and restraint when 
dealing with the issue of privacy. Use the TypePad tools that best suit your 
needs, but use your head as well. Here are a few things to consider:
 
✓ Think of others. You might not be an especially private person, but 
perhaps your spouse, boss, or mother-in-law is. It’s a common courtesy 
to consider others’ privacy preferences before you write something 
about them.
 
✓ It’s a small world. Ask any blogger you know, and they will probably be 
able to tell you a story about the time a real-life acquaintance unexpect-
edly ran across the blog. If you write a post about how much you hate 
your neighbor’s dog, be aware that your neighbor might find the post. 
You’d be surprised how often this type of thing happens in the blog 
world, so remember what you already learned the hard way in eighth 
grade: If you won’t say something to someone’s face, don’t say it behind 
his or her back.
 
✓ Remember that you can’t take it back. Even if you delete something 
you’ve written, it may continue to be referenced by search engines 
indefinitely. There’s not much you can do to change that, other than 
changing your publicity options. Your mom’s advice to “think before 
you speak” applies to blogging too.
 
✓ Start slowly. Especially if you’re a new blogger and you’re not sure 
where your comfort level lies along the privacy spectrum, err on the 
side of revealing too little instead of too much. Perhaps you’ll want to 
withhold information such as real names and geographical locations 
until you’ve spent a little more time in the blogging community. You 
could use a pseudonym for yourself or your family, or you might not 
want to include photographs of your children, for example. After you’ve 
blogged for a while, you will likely develop a better sense of what pri-
vacy levels make you most comfortable. At that point, you can always 
begin to fill in more private details for your readers, should you so 
choose.
Finding an online identity
Your online identity is the face you present to the online world. It consists of, 
among other things, the name of your blog, your domain name, the name you 
use as a user id, your writing tone (on your own blog and in the comments 
you leave elsewhere), and the content of your posts. As a blogger, the words 
you write convey something about yourself, so be intentional about commu-
nicating authentically.

16
Part I: The Basics of Blogging 
Using your own voice
It might initially sound appealing to invent an online persona for yourself, 
and certainly some bloggers have done this with varying degrees of success. 
Ultimately, though, you will likely find the greatest personal satisfaction from 
conducting your online interactions the way you would conduct your real-life 
ones. In other words, be yourself. As you write your posts (see Chapter 6), 
avoid the temptation to imitate another blogger. Instead, develop your own 
writing style or refine the one you already have. If you fall in love with blog-
ging and use your blog as an online “home” for many years, you’ll be glad 
that you use the voice you’re most comfortable with — your own.
Choosing a name for your blog
It’s one of the first decisions you have to make about your blog, and it’s a big 
one: what should you name your blog? In Chapter 3, we tell you how to set up 
your TypePad account, and you’ll be asked right away to name your TypePad 
URL (your blog’s online address, such as http:// typepadfordummies.
typepad.com). We strongly suggest naming your URL the same name as your 
blog, as a way to keep one cohesive online identity. If your URL is http:// 
typepadfordummies.typepad.com, you can see why your readers might be 
confused if they visit your blog and see “A Million and One Uses for Orange 
Juice” splashed across the top of your header design. (See Chapter 3 for a 
further explanation of the difference between a URL and a header.)
Remember that the name of your blog will help a reader form an initial opin-
ion about the purpose and tone of your content. When you browse at a book-
store, aren’t you more likely to pick up a book with a catchy and descriptive 
title? It’s the same for blogs — if your blog title makes an impression, a new 
reader is likely to stick around and read more. Keep the following advice in 
mind as you develop your blog’s name:
 
✓ Check domain availability. Many bloggers like to have their own domain 
name (such as typepadfordummies.com). It’s a good idea to check the 
availability of your blog name as a domain name (and buy it right away) 
even if you’re not quite ready to use it. See Appendix A for an explana-
tion of domain names and how to map one to your TypePad blog.
 
✓ Be descriptive. Ideally, your title is an accurate reflection of your con-
tent. If you write snarky political commentary in your posts, reflect that 
tone in your title. If your blog is general in nature (such as a journal), 
you’ll probably want to choose a more general name.
 
✓ Avoid commonplace wording. Terms such as reflections, musings, and 
thoughts aren’t catchy and are overused. If you want your blog to be 
memorable, steer away from bland wording in your title.
 
✓ Use a thesaurus. Think of the words and concepts you hope to com-
municate to a potential reader. Write the words down and then use 
a thesaurus to list even more variations. Play around with them until 
something seems right.

17
 Chapter 1: Understanding Blogging and TypePad
 
✓ Keep it short. A long URL is hard to type, and a long blog title is hard to 
remember. Corporations choose short slogans because they stick in our 
heads, so apply the same logic to your blog name. Anything more than 
four or five words is probably too long.
 
✓ Brainstorm. Don’t just think of words that describe your blog. Especially 
if your blog is a personal journal, think of any creative word or phrase 
from your past that might translate into a good title. The name of the 
street where you grew up? A compelling phrase from your favorite 
poem? A goofy nickname your spouse calls you? Interesting blog titles 
can lurk in unexpected places. See Chapter 17 for some examples of 
TypePad bloggers who have made great title selections.
Understanding Blogging Technologies
When you decide to start a blog, you’ll need to choose a blogging platform. 
A blogging platform is simply the software you use for blogging. It’s the site 
you sign in to when you’re ready to write, edit, or manage your blog. Several 
platforms are available (TypePad, Blogger, and WordPress, for example), and 
they all offer a wide range of technical options. We offer a few comparisons of 
those platforms in Chapter 2. This section explains the basic blogging tech-
nologies present in most blogging platforms, including Rich Text and basic 
HTML editing choices, RSS feeds, and search engine optimization options. We 
also explain the difference between hosted and self-hosted platforms.
Rich Text
All major blogging platforms offer two ways to compose a blog post: HTML 
mode or Rich Text mode. HTML (short for Hypertext Markup Language) 
is the basic programming language (or code) that allows your browser to 
“read” your blog post and display it correctly. If you’re familiar with HTML, 
you can make changes or tweaks as necessary to manipulate how your text 
and images appear. Don’t worry if you don’t know a thing about HTML; you 
can still blog. You’ll just want to use the Rich Text editor instead of the 
HTML editor.
Rich Text is sometimes referred to as WYSIWYG (pronounced wiz-ee-wig) — 
it’s the acronym for What You See Is What You Get. In other words, when you 
type your post in the Rich Text (WYSIWYG) editor, you’ll see a preview of 
how the text and images of your post will look when published. The Rich Text 
editor is similar to what you’re used to working with in Microsoft Word or 
Apple’s Pages. The Rich Text editor has buttons to click to format text (such 
as bold, italic, and underline), to insert images and other multimedia files 
easily, and to change the alignment of your text. Chapter 6 explains these 
buttons more thoroughly.

and HTML editor.

 Chapter 1: Understanding Blogging and TypePad
 
Depending on the blogging platform you choose, your WYSIWYG mode may be 
called Rich Text (TypePad), Compose (Blogger), or Visual (WordPress). They 
all mean WYSIWYG.
RSS feeds
If you read a blog regularly and want to know when it’s updated, you could 
visit that blog several times a day to see whether the author has posted 
anything new, or you could subscribe to the RSS feed and let it do the work 
for you. RSS stands for Really Simple Syndication and is the standard way for 
your readers to be alerted when you update your blog. The RSS feed sends 
new content to a feed reader as that content is available.
A feed reader (also known as an aggregator) is a site that allows you to sign 
up for an account and add the RSS feeds of blogs and Web sites you’re inter-
ested in. The feed reader provides the updates for all the feeds you’re sub-
scribed to in one place. Two of the most widely used feed readers are Google 
Reader (www.google.com/reader) and NewsGator (www.NewsGator.com).
Using a feed reader yourself is easy. All you have to do is establish an 
account with a feed reader, subscribe to the RSS feed you want to monitor, 
and then check your feed reader when you have the time.
An RSS feed for your blog is automatically generated when you sign up with 
any of the major blogging platforms (TypePad, WordPress, or Blogger). There 
are several formats for RSS feeds: Atom, RSS 2.0, and RSS 1.0. Atom and RSS 
are basically the same types of blog feeds; it should not matter which feed 
you choose to offer or subscribe to. However, if you are podcasting and want 
to offer a feed for that service, you will want to offer RSS 2.0 to your readers 
because it offers the necessary parameters for that function.
Another way for readers to subscribe to your RSS feed is through e-mail. 
Many people prefer to receive new alerts in their e-mail inbox instead of 
through a third-party feed reader. You can offer this option with FeedBurner 
(which we discuss in Chapter 5).
Search engine optimization (SEO)
If you want people to find your blog when they do a search on a particular topic, 
you’ll want to think about how to use SEO (search engine optimization) on your 
blog. Search engine optimization is simply using keywords effectively in your posts 
and titles so search engines can catalog your blog and include it in search results.
Before we explain how to use SEO on your blog, though, let us first explain 
how search engines work. Search engines send out virtual search teams of 

20
Part I: The Basics of Blogging 
code called robots (also known as bots or spiders) that visit blogs and Web 
sites to look for words people use when they search for information. As these 
spiders crawl around each Web site or blog, they gather data relevant to 
what people are searching for and rank that data. (How they rank the data 
is based on algorithms and constantly changing formulas and is dependent 
on the search engine.) When spiders crawl your blog looking for relevance, 
they are looking specifically at semantic data (what you’re writing about and 
which words you use) as well as contextual data (who is linking to you and 
what words they’re using when they link to you). The more relevant your 
blog is to a specific topic or search term, the higher your blog appears on the 
results page for that topic or search term.
SEO is such a large topic that hundreds of books, blogs, and Web sites are 
devoted to teaching you how to use it effectively. We want to give you a few 
pointers to get you started, but this list is in no way exhaustive. Here are few 
suggestions on how to use keywords to help your blog’s SEO rankings:
 
✓ Use relevant keywords in your main post title. Titles have more weight 
with search engines than paragraph text (though that’s important, too). 
Including a keyword or two in your post title will help your SEO ranking. 
The title of your post will also be the permalink of your article. A perma-
link is the address of an individual blog post. Each post you write has its 
own address (permalink). Search engines consider your post titles and 
permalinks as they rank your site for relevance to a topic. Here are two 
examples of titles:
 
 Not so great: Back from Vacation!
 
 SEO friendly: New Orleans French Quarter: Cafe Du Monde, St. Louis 
Cathedral, and Bourbon Street!
 
 Not only is the second title more helpful to your readers by telling them 
what your post is about, but it’s also more likely to be picked up by 
search engines because it uses terms people search for regularly (that 
is, if they’re looking for information about New Orleans).
 
✓ Use keywords associated with your topic and niche within your post. 
One way to ensure that you’re using relevant keywords throughout your 
blog is to think about how you would find the information if you were 
searching for it. What words would you type into a search engine to find 
information on your topic? Use those words in your titles and articles.
 
✓ Choose your link words carefully. Try to be as descriptive as possible 
when making words into a link. For example, if you’d like your readers 
to read your blog policies, instead of writing “My blog policies are here” 
(where the word “here” is a link to your policies) or “Click here for my 
blog policies” (where the phrase “Click here” is the link to your poli-
cies), write something like “Before you leave a comment, read my blog 
policy for commenters” (where “blog policy for commenters” is the link 
to your policy). Not only are the longer links more descriptive, but also, 
they’re more search-engine-friendly. Spiders and bots are looking for 
interpretive word strings — phrases such as click here are everywhere 

21
 Chapter 1: Understanding Blogging and TypePad
on the Web and are hardly useful in setting your content apart from the 
crowd. Make your content stand out by using descriptive words and 
phrases as links.
 
✓ Assign relevant keywords and categories to your post before you pub-
lish. Chapter 6 shows you how to create categories that fit your topic 
and how to attach tags (or keywords) to your posts to make them more 
SEO-friendly.
Search engine optimization is important if you’d like to expand your reader-
ship or make your content readily available to others, but it shouldn’t take 
over your blog. Your readers will be turned off if all your content reads like a 
commercial or search results page. Write content that appeals to your read-
ers (interests them, helps them, or answers a question for them) and creates 
community. Incorporate SEO as you go, but not at the expense of alienating 
your readers. As your blog content grows, so will your SEO because it’s infor-
mation people want to know. The bottom line: Create content for people, but 
keep it friendly for the machines.
Hosted versus self-hosted 
blogging platforms
When you are comparing blog platforms to see which one is right for you, 
one of the things you’ll need to consider is whether the platform is hosted or 
self-hosted. A hosted blogging platform is one that allows the blog to reside 
on the host’s server. TypePad is an example of a hosted blogging platform. 
TypePad allows you to keep your blog on its server and use its software to 
blog — you don’t have to download anything to your computer. All updates 
to the server or software are handled by TypePad instead of you. Hosted 
blogging platforms such as TypePad are very popular because they offer an 
easy way to get started with a blog without having to know anything about 
HTML, CSS, or Perl (a few of the types of programming code that build your 
blog behind the scenes and allow your browser to read your blog design 
properly) — using a hosted blogging platform is pretty much a point-and-
click affair.
Although hosted blogging platforms are popular and easy to use, they have 
some issues you should consider before you commit:
 
✓ Blogs on hosted platforms can appear to be less professional because 
they have .typepad.com (or .blogspot.com for Blogger blogs) at the 
end of the URL (for example, http://typepadfordummies.typepad.
com). However, you can skirt this issue by buying your own domain 
name and mapping it to your account (see Chapter 3 and Appendix A for 
further information and instructions). What that means is that you can 
buy your own domain name (for example, www.typepadfordummies.
com) and map it to your TypePad account so when someone visits your 

22
Part I: The Basics of Blogging 
blog, they see http://www.typepadfordummies.com in the address 
bar instead of http://www.typepadfordummies.typepad.com.
 
✓ Hosted blogging platforms give you less control over HTML and CSS, and 
you won’t see any Perl. Although you can tweak your HTML in your Rich 
Text editor, that applies only to individual posts. If you’re fluent with 
CSS and HTML and are used to making changes to your blog by changing 
the code by hand, you’ll be disappointed. You’re not allowed to access 
the full code of your blog directly. There are work-arounds (see Chapter 
14, where we discuss how to use Advanced Templates with TypePad), 
but you’ll still be limited. If you don’t know the first thing about HTML 
and are fine not messing with your code (and, in fact, prefer not to), this 
issue won’t be a problem for you.
A self-hosted blogging platform is one that allows you to use its blogging soft-
ware but asks you to house your blog on your own server. Because you likely 
aren’t set up with your own server, you will need to pay a third-party Web 
host to host your blog (you can learn more about choosing a server pro-
vider at WebHosting Talk: webhostingtalk.com). Movable Type (sister to 
TypePad) and WordPress.org are self-hosted blogging platforms. The thing 
that makes self-hosted platforms attractive to bloggers is that they allow you 
to have full control over your HTML, CSS, Perl, and PHP. Code junkies love 
to have access to their code. The biggest con to using a self-hosted blogging 
platform is the learning curve. A self-hosted platform requires you to contact 
a server provider and rent space, install the software on the server (usually a 
one-click install with CPanel, which most server providers offer), and transfer 
files from your computer to the server (this is called File Transfer Protocol, 
or FTP). Although updates to the server will most likely be handled by your 
server provider, software updates will be handled by you (again, usually a 
simple one-click procedure, but one you’re responsible for).
If you’re new to the blogging world and aren’t sure if you’ll be staying or just 
want to get your feet wet before you commit to so much responsibility, we 
suggest going with a hosted blogging platform such as TypePad. The hosted 
platforms will help you slowly familiarize yourself with blogging and the 
mechanics behind it without overwhelming you. If you decide you want to 
manage your own code down the line, you can migrate your blog to a self-
hosted platform such as Movable Type or WordPress.org.
Considering some of the basic concepts and terminologies we’ve given you 
in this chapter will help you navigate more smoothly throughout the blogo-
sphere (whichever platform you ultimately choose). A successful blogger is 
one who is well-informed about blogging trends and solidly connected in the 
blogging community. Along with what we’ve told you here, keep a keen eye 
out for changing technologies and engage honestly and fairly in the blogging 
community around you. Most important, don’t let yourself get mired down in 
what you don’t know — the best way to learn is to jump in and start!

hether you’re blogging for personal pleasure or to help your business 
establish a solid online presence (or you’re somewhere in between), 
this chapter gives you an overview of where TypePad came from and what it 
does well. We explain the pros and cons of using TypePad and discuss which 
pricing options and features are right for your blog.
Discovering the History of TypePad
If you’ve read much about TypePad, you may have heard of Six Apart, the 
company that produces TypePad. In 2001, husband-and-wife team Mena and 
Ben Trott were looking for a better way to manage Mena’s personal blog, 
Dollarshort (www.dollarshort.org). In 2001, they developed and released 
Movable Type, a blogging platform geared toward people with a decent 
amount of technical know-how. The release of Movable Type was so well-
received that Mena and Ben formed their own company, Six Apart, to support 
Movable Type (interestingly, Six Apart’s name comes from the six-day span 
between Ben and Mena’s birthdates).
About the same time that Movable Type was taking off, the rest of the world 
had been bitten by the blogging bug. Less experienced bloggers were eager 
for software similar to Movable Type, but they wanted one that didn’t require 
advanced technical knowledge. With the addition of some new employees 
and some venture capital, Six Apart launched TypePad in October 2003. 
TypePad offered a simple, fee-based service to people who just wanted to 
blog without the hassles of coding and hosting issues.

24
Part I: The Basics of Blogging 
Now, many years later, TypePad continues to thrive as a leading platform for 
bloggers of all sizes and niches. TypePad is home to millions of blogs around 
the world. It has a strong presence internationally and has continued to roll 
out new features to keep users on the cutting edge of blogging technologies. 
In late 2009, TypePad released a new version of its platform, bringing about 
the most significant changes since the product was first released in 2003.
Blogging for Personal or Business 
Use with TypePad
Getting started with TypePad is fast and easy. Before we start, though, let’s 
look at how TypePad stacks up against some of the other blogging platforms. 
Several platforms are available, and they offer a range of technical options 
and price points:
 
✓ Google Blogger is free and takes care of hosting your blog, but it has lim-
ited design options unless you possess Web design experience (or can 
hire someone who does). Additionally, many users opt to install third-
party commenting software for additional functionality.
 
✓ WordPress.com is also free and hosts your site for you, but it doesn’t 
allow you to be part of ad networks — an important consideration if 
you’re hoping to earn a little money from your blog. WordPress.org 
(which is different from WordPress.com) requires that you have a signifi-
cant degree of comfort with managing code (if you don’t, you may want 
to hire someone who does). In addition, you are responsible for manag-
ing and paying for your own site hosting. WordPress.org allows you to 
have ads on your blog.
 
✓ Movable Type is also free. But as with WordPress.org, you must be 
comfortable with managing code (or hire somebody to do it for you). 
And again as with WordPress.org, you are responsible for managing and 
paying for your own site hosting. Movable Type does allow you to have 
ads on your blog.
 
✓ TypePad also has several account options, both free and paid. The free 
option, called Micro, is not as customizable as Blogger, though it does 
offer some significant advantages. In particular, Micro allows you to inte-
grate your content with your social media accounts. The paid TypePad 
account options are Pro Plus, Pro Unlimited, and Business Class and are 
priced comparably to what you would spend if you were paying for a 
server host. All TypePad account levels offer access to TypePad’s 
well-known customer support, a significant advantage over Google 
Blogger. You might say that TypePad is the happy medium of blogging 
platforms — the polish and flexibility of WordPress.org or Movable Type 
with the simplicity of Blogger.

 Chapter 2: The Benefits of TypePad
 
If you want more information about what the other blogging platforms offer, 
check out Google Blogger For Dummies, by Susan Gunelius, or WordPress For 
Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Lisa Sabin-Wilson.
We understand that all products have pros and cons. We’ve laid those out 
for you here. We include a few direct comparisons to some of the other well-
known blogging platforms available on the Web.
Pros
 
✓ It’s simple. For many users, this is one of TypePad’s biggest benefits. 
With TypePad, you can be a professional blogger with a polished and 
sophisticated-looking blog, and you never have to deal with coding or 
hosting.
 
✓ Reliable tech support is readily available. If issues do arise, TypePad is 
known for quick, round-the-clock customer service, and its help section 
is written without a lot of overwhelming techspeak.
 
✓ It’s affordable. As of this writing, TypePad’s monthly pricing ranges 
from free to $14.95 a month (Business Class rates are significantly 
higher, but more on that in a minute). Frequent coupon codes are avail-
able, as are discounts if you pay for a year at a time. That’s a pretty 
inexpensive hobby. And for those who use their TypePad blog as a 
revenue-generating business, those are nominal business costs (and 
possibly tax-deductible; ask your tax professional for details on this). 
This monthly charge is comparable to the amount you’d spend paying 
for hosting with a WordPress.org or Movable Type blog.
 
✓ TypePad has an impressive track record regarding security. TypePad’s 
sign-in information is transmitted via encrypted SSL login. SSL stands for 
Secure Sockets Layer and is the standard way to encrypt information as 
it passes between a Web server and a browser. Millions of Web sites use 
SSL to protect customer transactions. TypePad manages security issues 
for users, eliminating the need to install additional plug-ins or upgrade 
current ones as security technology advances. (With WordPress.org, 
users are responsible for this themselves.)
 
✓ The design templates are attractive and visually pleasing. TypePad 
offers dozens of design themes and several page layouts, ranging from 
very simple to more complex. Your design can be changed with a few 
clicks, which may be a big benefit if you like to change the look of your 
blog often.
 
✓ Custom designs don’t have to be complicated, either. Maybe you don’t 
want a standard design template, but you don’t want to pay a designer 
for an elaborate, allover blog design. TypePad makes it easy to install a 
simple personalized design by using a custom header. In Chapter 11, we 
tell you how to install a custom header, giving you a personalized look 

26
Part I: The Basics of Blogging 
on a budget. In Chapter 14, we explain some of the more sophisticated, 
coding-related customization tools available to TypePad users with a 
Pro Unlimited account and above.
 
✓ Frequent updates are provided automatically. Six Apart frequently rolls 
out new and improved features for TypePad users. You don’t have to 
download anything or install any additional plug-ins (as you might have 
to do in WordPress). TypePad does it for you! When you have a TypePad 
account, you can have updates on new features e-mailed right to your 
inbox, so you’ll never miss a thing.
 
✓ TypeLists are simple tools for organizing sidebars. TypeLists are a 
feature much loved by most TypePad users. They’re streamlined ways 
to categorize and organize your sidebar information (links, reading lists, 
images, and so on). TypeLists are easy to add, edit, delete and move 
around, and they make managing your sidebar very simple. We tell you 
how to use them in Chapter 8.
 
✓ You can manage multiple blogs with one account. Although you may 
begin writing a single blog, eventually you may want to start an addi-
tional one, or a member of your family may want a separate blog under 
your account. Instead of creating an entirely new TypePad account, you 
can simply add another blog to your existing one. The Pro Plus package 
allows you to have up to three blogs on one account, whereas the Pro 
Unlimited and Business Class packages allow unlimited blogs on a single 
account, and each can have its own domain.
Cons
 
✓ If you want customization, it isn’t free. TypePad’s Micro option won’t 
cost you a thing, but you have access to only one design theme. The 
only elements of this theme you can personalize are your banner photo 
and color scheme. If you’re firmly set on using a free platform that gives 
you full design customization, Google Blogger may suit you better. If 
you’re not sure yet, our best advice is to start with a free TypePad Micro 
blog and see whether the features suit you. If you decide you want to 
stake a more permanent, customized claim in the blogosphere, you can 
upgrade to a paid TypePad account later.
 
✓ You have limited access to your code. If you’re using the Micro or Pro 
Plus option, you’ll never see a single dot of code. It depends on your 
outlook as to whether you define this as a pro or a con (see the first item 
in the “Pros” list). If you’re the technical sort who loves to mess around 
in code, or if you’re starting your blog specifically because you want 
to learn coding, TypePad’s simplicity might be a turnoff. Bloggers who 
choose WordPress.org, for example, have to jump in to meatier techni-
cal issues from the first day, which might be your cup of tea. If you have 
a TypePad Pro Unlimited or Business Class account, you do have some 

27
 Chapter 2: The Benefits of TypePad
access to your code, either through custom CSS or Advanced Templates 
(both of which are covered in Chapter 14).
 
✓ It’s not as customizable as WordPress.org (see WordPress For Dummies, 
2nd Edition, by Lisa Sabin-Wilson). WordPress.org has a bajillion tem-
plates available for your blog. (Okay, that’s an exaggeration, but you’d 
be hard-pressed to count them all.) Most of those templates are custom-
izable to some degree. You need to be familiar with the coding necessary 
to make significant changes (PHP, CSS, and HTML), but because you have 
access to all that code in your WordPress.org template, you (or your 
hired designer or developer) can easily find problems and make changes 
as necessary. TypePad has dozens of templates available, but depend-
ing on which type of account you have, you may or may not be able to 
customize your template. If you have the Pro Plus package or above, it’s 
fairly easy to add a custom header to your blog. Completely customizing 
your template and styles requires using the Advanced Templates option 
(which is available only in the Pro or Business Class packages and is dis-
cussed in Chapter 14). A customizing option that’s less complicated than 
Advanced Templates is custom CSS, also addressed in Chapter 14.
 
✓ TypePad is not open source software. Open source software allows 
users to be the driving force of people who constantly create new plug-
ins, features, and templates for the vast open community. The advantage 
is that everyone is working together to better the software. TypePad 
offers several forums for community discussion, but any development 
released to the community is controlled by Six Apart.
 
✓ TypePad is not ideal as a Content Management System. A Content 
Management System (or CMS) is a way to manage more technologically 
complicated streams of content, such as rotating displays and aggre-
gated content. If you’ve seen blog designs that look more like a magazine 
than a typical blog (for example, rotating images with article excerpts 
or a list of additional article with links), you’re seeing a site that uses a 
CMS to populate certain areas of the design with specific new content. 
TypePad isn’t set up to do that. Content management systems aren’t 
for everyone — most typical bloggers don’t need one. If you do, though, 
you may want to consider Movable Type (also owned by Six Apart and 
a sister to TypePad; it’s a self-hosted blogging platform) or installing 
WordPress.org on your own hosted service.
Choosing the Right TypePad 
Blogging Package
TypePad offers its users four blogging packages, with widely varied features 
and pricing. Whether you think of blogging as a lone endeavor with the 
individual pounding out posts from a solitary kitchen table or as a necessary 

28
Part I: The Basics of Blogging 
business tool with posts from multiple authors, TypePad has a package that 
addresses your needs. Depending on your specific blogging needs, you can 
choose which pricing package offers you the features you want. Table 2-1 is a 
quick reference of pricing and features (a more thorough listing is at typepad.
com/pricing). We explain these features further in the rest of this section.

Business 
Class
$89.95/
month
Includes everything in the Micro, Pro Plus, and Pro 
Unlimited plans.
Allows multiple administrators (as opposed to just 
multiple authors).
Assigns you an account manager to oversee the 
deployment of the blog.
Provides yearly invoicing.
Provides unlimited storage (although no more than 
2000MB can be uploaded in any one month).
The Micro package offers 3GB of storage, which refers to how much space 
TypePad gives you to store your files (such as photos or audio) on its server. 
The three paid packages all offer you an unlimited amount of storage, but the 
rate at which you can upload files differs. For example, Pro Plus offers you 
150MB per month of uploads. This means that in the month of, say, January, 
you could upload 150MB worth of photos, audios, PDF documents, and so 
on. After you upload 150MB, you would not be able to upload anything else 
until February 1, at which point you could again upload 150MB. The files you 
uploaded in January would still be there, perfectly safe under the “unlimited 
storage” feature.
As you choose which package is right for you, consider how often you upload 
files, and at what size. Images, video files, and audio files can be quite large. A 
photo blogger or podcaster who uploads multiple large files a week may need 
a higher monthly upload number. A blogger who writes only text (and posts 
the occasional photo) would not need a very high monthly upload amount.
Each of TypePad’s packages also offers
 
✓ Access to TypePad’s customer support and design portfolio (except 
Micro, which offers you only the Chroma design theme)
 
✓ The option to post photos, video, and audio
 
✓ Password protection and comment blocking
 
✓ Full integration with social media accounts (for example, Facebook and 
Twitter)
 
✓ Mobile-posting options
 
✓ RSS feeds

Part I: The Basics of Blogging 
It’s at this point that the different levels begin to part ways, so let’s break 
down a few considerations for each one (please note that all pricing and fea-
ture options are current as of November 2009).
Micro
The Micro option is the newest addition to the TypePad family, added in 
November 2009. As mentioned, it’s free, offering a bare-bones approach to 
TypePad blogging. You have access to the most basic blogging functions 
(posting text, photos, video, and so on), and you can interact fully with your 
readers in your comments section. You’re limited to 3GB of storage, which is 
probably enough for most bloggers posting text only. If you plan to include a 
significant number of photos in your blog, or if you have a very long stash of 
archived posts, you might run out of space quickly.
Also, the Micro package has no design customization (except for your banner 
image and color scheme), and you have access only to the Chroma theme 
(pictured in Figure 2-1).

31
 Chapter 2: The Benefits of TypePad
The functionalities of the Micro package are good ones — certainly more than 
adequate for a hobbyist blogger who wants to learn the ins and outs of blog-
ging, or share posts with friends and family. With a Micro account, you can
 
✓ Use the Blog It widget (see Chapter 15)
 
✓ Post via e-mail
 
✓ Integrate your content with your various social media accounts
 
✓ Have a fully functioning comments section
 
✓ Search TypePad’s Knowledge Base (the help files)
 
✓ Follow the Profiles of other TypePad users to develop a sense of 
community
In the interest of keeping you fully informed, though, you should be aware that 
some features aren’t available to Micro users. With a Micro account, you cannot
 
✓ Schedule a post to publish in the future
 
✓ Customize your design (except a color scheme and banner)
 
✓ Have multiple authors
 
✓ Use trackbacks
 
✓ Create pages (Chapter 6 explains how pages differ from blog posts)
 
✓ Create or use TypeLists or widgets (therefore, you can’t include addi-
tional information or ad networks on your sidebars)
 
✓ Create a help ticket for your specific blogging issue
If you enjoy TypePad Micro but decide that more functionalities are attrac-
tive, you are perfectly positioned to upgrade to a paid TypePad account with 
just one click.
 
If you are a Micro user, you will still find much relevant information in this 
book. However, many of the features we explain in later chapters may not be 
available to you — when this happens, just skip ahead to a section that covers 
a feature you do have!
Pro Plus
Pro Plus is a middle-of-the road package that offers significantly more 
features than the Micro package, and they’re features that are generally 

32
Part I: The Basics of Blogging 
important to bloggers (especially those who plan to build a readership and 
possibly earn some revenue). For example, the Plus package allows you to 
engage in domain mapping, which means you can use your own personal URL 
(that is, www.mypersonalurl.com) to point back to your TypePad blog. We 
show you how to do this in Appendix A. The Pro Plus package also allows 
you to create two additional blogs under the same account and at least a 
measure of design flexibility (in particular, allowing you to insert a custom-
designed header, as described in Chapter 11). The Pro Plus package (as well 
as the Pro Unlimited and Business Class packages) allow you to schedule 
posts into the future — more on this in Chapter 6.
Your storage in Pro Plus is unlimited, but as we explain earlier, you can 
upload files at a rate of only 150MB per month. When they’re in, though, you 
can store them in perpetuity.
Pro Unlimited
The next level is Pro Unlimited, which brings in still more features. It pro-
vides a significant jump in the amount of monthly uploads allowed — a 
whopping 1000MB. For users who want a truly custom design (as opposed 
to just a custom header), Pro Unlimited gives you (or your blog designer) 
access to CSS. (We define and discuss CSS in Chapter 14.) The Pro Unlimited 
package offers unlimited additional blogs, which may make it a good option 
for a family who wants to host several blogs from the same account. This 
level lets you give an unlimited number of additional authors access to your 
Dashboard, which is often an important feature for small-business blogs.
Business Class
Savvy companies are jumping on board with blogging, providing their cus-
tomers highly interactive venues for learning about new products, leaving 
feedback, and engaging socially with other customers. It has become the 
norm, not the exception, for companies to have some kind of presence in the 
blogosphere. TypePad offers Business Class as a service aimed at midsize-
to-large companies. Unlike a corporate Web site, which may not be geared 
toward two-way communication, a corporate blog allows your business to 
jump feet first into the dialogue taking place online.
You’ll notice a significant price jump between the first three pricing levels 
and the Business Class package. This fourth level is designed for corporate 
users who need a blogging platform with some very specific features. Most 
notably, Business Class allows for additional administrators. This is differ-
ent from having an additional author; unlike an author, an administrator has 
full authorization to make fundamental, account-level decisions. This feature 
may be important to a large corporation that needs more than one employee 

33
 Chapter 2: The Benefits of TypePad
to help maintain a large-scale blogging effort. Additionally, being a Business 
Class member of TypePad gives you access to higher-level services (for an 
additional fee), such as implementing custom designs, coaching on how to 
knit together an entire social media presence, and access to priority support.
 
If you have a small or even midsize business, you will likely find that the Pro 
Unlimited level is sufficient for your company blog, especially if you’re primar-
ily using it for issuing updates on new products or general company news. 
The Pro level offers plenty of powerful features to produce a highly polished 
blog without requiring the business owner to incur the additional cost of 
Business Class.
 
The rest of this book focuses on bloggers using the Micro, Pro Plus, and Pro 
Unlimited pricing levels. If you’re a Business Class blogger, your Dashboard 
will have many similarities with those of these other levels, and you will cer-
tainly find plenty of helpful tips for managing your Business Class blog. But 
we do not address some of the more advanced options available to Business 
Class bloggers, such as multiple administrators and yearly invoicing — 
instead, you should contact the TypePad priority support team specifically 
assigned to you when you set up your Business Class blog.
Discovering TypePad’s Technical 
Support Services
Ask TypePad bloggers what they love most about this platform, and odds are 
that you will hear a mention of the excellent technical support. It’s one of the 
things TypePad is most known for throughout the blogosphere — quick and 
easy-to-understand help from a team of real-live people at TypePad’s help 
desk. You won’t find this same level of service with Blogger (which offers lim-
ited help files and virtually no personal assistance) or WordPress (which has 
a more open and vocal community, but its documentation tends to be laced 
with technical jargon and can be difficult to understand if you’re a beginner).
In Chapter 4, we explain how you can access TypePad’s Knowledge Base, or 
help section, from your Dashboard. We show you how to easily search for 
Knowledge Base articles that will answer your questions. If you can’t find the 
answer, we show you how to submit a help ticket. When you open a ticket, 
someone from the TypePad support community will get back to you (usually 
within 24 hours) with an answer. The best part? The answer is usually exactly 
what you were looking for, and if instructions are necessary and included, 
they’re incredibly easy to follow.
The Knowledge Base isn’t the only place to brush up on your TypePad skills. 
Six Apart provides ongoing support for users, educating them about how 
to implement the best TypePad has to offer and informing them of changes 

34
Part I: The Basics of Blogging 
just around the bend. In Chapter 16, we point you toward several of these 
resources in detail, including the Everything TypePad blog (TypePad’s official 
blog, full of company news), TypePad User Forums (a place to talk through 
your questions with other TypePad users), and Live Events (online and 
in-person seminars you can access to help you polish your TypePad knowl-
edge). See Chapter 16 for even more resources available to TypePad users.
Whether you’re a blogging newbie or have years of online experience under 
your belt, rest assured that TypePad users don’t have to do it alone. With an 
impressive amount of technical support behind you and opportunities to find 
out more being presented all the time, you’re sure to find the support you need 
from TypePad. This support, along with the other features offered to TypePad 
users, gives bloggers everything they need to produce a top-notch blog.

Part II
Getting Started 
with TypePad

In this part . . .
T
his part of the book gets you up and running with 
your TypePad account and shows you the basic lay of 
the land of your Dashboard. You also get moving on some 
of the most fundamental activities for a blogger: creating a 
blog, writing a post, and interacting with your readers.

Chapter 3
Creating Your TypePad 
Account and Profile
In This Chapter
▶ Getting onboard at TypePad
▶ Accessing your TypePad account
▶ Establishing your presence on TypePad
B
efore you can begin using TypePad, you need to sign up for an account. 
It’s a simple process, requiring an e-mail address and a password (for 
Micro, the free option), plus a credit card (if you’re opting for a Pro Plus or 
Pro Unlimited account). TypePad does the rest for you. You don’t need to find 
a server (TypePad will host your blog on its server) or install software (because 
TypePad is hosting your blog in their data center, the software is already there 
and ready to go). You just create an account, sign in, and get started!
Although the process isn’t complex, you do have to jump through a few 
hoops before you start blogging on TypePad. In this chapter, we tell you what 
you need to think about before and during the getting-started process. We 
give you some advice on specifying your blog’s title as well as its URL, offer 
a quick look at the TypePad Dashboard, and tell you what it takes to create a 
TypePad Profile and why you need one. After we have you set up with your 
account, we discuss a few issues you need to consider before you start 
blogging — for example, how much personal information you want to share 
and whether you want to connect your TypePad Profile with your other 
social media accounts (such as Facebook or Twitter).
Signing Up for a TypePad Account
 
For an explanation of the different TypePad account options, both free and 
paid, see Chapter 2.

38
Part II: Getting Started with TypePad 
Ready to get started with your TypePad account? Before you do, spend a 
little time thinking about the face you want to present to the blogging world. 
It’s a good idea to decide on your blog’s name and the URL you want (they 
should match) before you start typing stuff on the sign-up page.
Also, think about the e-mail address you want to associate with TypePad. TypePad 
uses the address you provide when you create an account to send you updates 
on TypePad features and communicate with you about support tickets you might 
submit. Also, if you set up your account to have your comments e-mailed to you 
(see Chapter 7), this is the e-mail address where the comments will be sent.
TypePad offers a free blogging option (Micro) or a free trial period before you 
commit to a paid option (see Chapter 2 for a complete overview of TypePad’s 
blogging tiers). Before you commit to anything, we suggest that you consider 
how much you’re willing to pay. TypePad accepts Visa, MasterCard, American 
Express, and Discover cards but doesn’t accept PayPal or personal checks as 
payment. Of course, if you choose TypePad Micro, you won’t need a credit 
card because it’s free.
Finally, you need to consider whether or not you want your blog to be found 
via search engines. If you’re hoping people will find and read your blog, and 
you want to develop a community around your topic, you’ll want search 
engines to include your blog in their results. If you are writing a private, pass-
word-protected blog, search engines will not index your blog. TypePad gives 
you this option when you sign up. Don’t worry if you change your mind later; 
you can change your settings using the Dashboard.
After you have your blogging ducks in a row, you just need to set up a 
TypePad account. We’ll explain how to do that, whether you choose the free 
Micro account or a paid Pro account.
TypePad Micro
Creating a TypePad Micro account is easy. In just a few short clicks, you’ll be 
ready to blog! To get started, follow these steps:
 
1. Type www.TypePad.com in your browser’s address box and press Enter.
 
 The TypePad home page appears. Look for the title Create Your Free 
Micro Blog in Seconds.
 
2. Type your e-mail address and password in the text boxes provided.
 
3. Click the Create Blog Now button.
 
 A new page with your TypePad Micro blog appears. Figure 3-1 shows 
what this page looks like.
 
4. Click the image you want to use for your banner.

39
 Chapter 3: Creating Your TypePad Account and Profile
 
 If you’d like to use your own image instead of one TypePad offers, you 
can do that by clicking the Browse button and uploading an image from 
your hard drive. Keep in mind that your blog’s color scheme is pulled 
from the colors in the image you choose for your banner; the more col-
orful the image, the more colorful your blog’s color scheme options.
 
Figure 3-1:

5. Click to select the button next to the color scheme you want to use for 
your blog.
 
 The bottom half of the screen shows you how your blog will look with 
those colors.
 
6. Click in the Your Display Name text box and type the display name 
you want to use with your blog.
 
 Your display name is the name that appears as the author of your blog 
posts and any comments you leave at other TypePad blogs.
 
7. Click in the Blog URL text box and type the URL you want to use for 
your blog.
 
 A little later in this chapter, we advise you on how to choose the best 
URL for your blog.
 
8. Click the Save and Continue button.
 
 Your blog’s Dashboard, as shown in Figure 3-2, appears. From here, you 
can start blogging immediately or choose to familiarize yourself with 
your Dashboard (see Chapter 4) or blog settings (Chapter 5).

Customizing your Micro color scheme
If you’re a TypePad Micro user and aren’t happy 
with the color scheme pulled from your banner 
image, we have a little trick that may help. You’ll 
need two images saved to your hard drive: one 
with very vibrant colors that you want to use as 
your color scheme and the image you want to 
use as your banner. When you have those two 
images ready, follow these instructions:
 1. Go to your blog’s Design tab.
 2. Click the Banner link.
 
 The Banner page appears.
 3. Click the Browse button to find and upload 
the vibrant image.
 
 Several color scheme options are pulled 
from the picture’s colors and appear as 
choices.
 4. Click to select the button next to the color 
scheme you want to use.
 5. Click Save Changes.
 6. Click the Browse button to find and upload 
the image you want to use as your banner.
 
 Several color schemes are offered, based 
on the new image. You also see Existing 
Color Scheme as a choice.
 7. Click to select Existing Color Scheme.
 8. Click the Preview button to see how your 
changes look.
 9. Click Save Changes to save your new 
image and color scheme.

 Chapter 3: Creating Your TypePad Account and Profile
TypePad Pro
TypePad offers three paid options for your blogging account: Pro Plus, 
Pro Unlimited, and Business Class (each option is discussed at length 
in Chapter 2). Because Business Class is a fairly customized option, you 
should contact TypePad directly to set up this option. To create a TypePad 
Pro (either Plus or Unlimited) account, follow these instructions:
 
1. Type www.TypePad.com in your browser’s address box and press 
Enter.
 
 The TypePad home page appears. 
 
2. Find the Blog Like a Pro box. Click the TypePad Pro: Try It For Free 
button.
 
 A new page appears, listing each of the three paid account options.
 
3. Click to select the button for the type of account that’s right for you 
(Pro Plus or Pro Unlimited).
 
4. Click the Continue button.
 
 On the resulting page, shown in Figure 3-3, you see several blanks that 
you must fill in before you can create your account.
 
Figure 3-3: 
Get Started 
with a 
TypePad 
account on 
this page.
 

42
Part II: Getting Started with TypePad 
 
5. Fill in the blanks on the Get Started with a TypePad Account form.
 
 You need to provide the following information:
 
• Your blog URL, which is your blog’s address online (for example, 
http://typepadfordummies.typepad.com). It is advisable, 
though not required, that your URL be the same as the title you 
want to appear in your blog’s header. The title is the name of your 
blog, and the header is where that title appears at the top of your 
blog. The title also appears in the title bar, which is at the top of 
your blog’s browser page (see Figure 3-4). Refer to Chapter 1 for 
advice on choosing a name for your blog
 
 If your aim is to use a blog to establish a solid online identity, read-
ers may find it confusing if the title of your blog is different from the 
URL. For consistency, the URL, blog title, blog header, and title bar 
should match. In other words, if your blog is TypePad for Dummies, 
your blog items will look like the URL, title, and header in Figure 3-4.
 
• Your e-mail address, which TypePad uses to send you feature 
updates, blog comments, and responses to help tickets. You can 
click the links to TypePad’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy 
under the Create Account button at the bottom of the page to see 
additional information about how your e-mail address will be used. 
You can change your e-mail address at any time.

43
 Chapter 3: Creating Your TypePad Account and Profile
 
• A password, which secures the access to your account. As always, 
when creating any sort of online account, choose a password that 
cannot be easily guessed, especially if you plan to share personal 
information on your blog. For example, if you plan to write about 
your dog Walter in your TypePad blog, you might not want to use 
Walter as your TypePad password!
 
 Be very careful when setting your password. The TypePad setup 
process asks you to type your password only once (instead of 
twice to verify that it’s typed correctly). If you accidentally make a 
typo, you could have trouble later.
 
• A display name, which is the name associated with you on your 
blog. The display name also appears in your RSS feeds (as the 
author) and when you comment at other blogs. Your display name 
can be your real name or a pseudonym.
 
• Your gender, which you mark by selecting an option.
 
• Your birthday, which helps TypePad determine that you are at 
least 13 years old, as required by law. TypePad does not share 
your birthday publicly.
 
6. Select the check box if you’d like to receive monthly TypePad 
newsletters.
 
 Although many people may be hesitant to sign up for e-mail newsletters 
of any sort, signing up for the monthly TypePad newsletter will keep you 
updated on new features, events, and offers from Six Apart (TypePad’s 
parent company). These e-mails frequently offer helpful information 
about changes to TypePad or useful suggestions on how to use your 
account more efficiently.
 
7. Click the Create Account button.
 
 A new page appears, asking for your billing information.
 
8. Select your payment options, enter billing information, and click the 
Continue button.
 
 You need to make the following decisions and provide the following 
information:
 
• Monthly billing or annual billing: You can prepay your TypePad 
account for one year and receive two months free, or you can be 
billed monthly.
 
• A discount code (if you have one): If you do a Google search 
using the phrase TypePad coupon code, you can generally find 
several offers. TypePad is offering TypePad For Dummies readers 
a 10 percent discount when you sign up for a TypePad Pro Plus or 
TyepPad Pro Unlimited account. The discount is good for your first 
year of service. When you sign up, just enter DUMMIES as your dis-
count code.

44
Part II: Getting Started with TypePad 
 
• The type of credit card you’ll be paying with: You can use Visa, 
MasterCard, American Express, or Discover. You cannot use 
PayPal or a personal check.
 
• Your credit card information: You need your full card number, the 
credit card’s expiration date, and the security code (the three-digit 
number on the back of your card).
 
• Your billing information: Your billing information is your name, 
address, city and state, postal code, and country of residence. 
Note that you won’t be billed until your two-week trial is over.
 
9. Click the Continue button.
 
 The Confirm Your Information page appears.
 
10. Review the information you’ve entered so far.
 
 You can edit your blog URL, e-mail address, or billing information.
 
11. Click the Confirm and Start Your Blog button.
 
 A new page appears that looks like the one in Figure 3-5.
 
12. Type a title for your blog in the box on the left.
 
13. Click the check box next to Publicize This Blog on Search Engines 
and My TypePad Profile if you would like your blog to be visible to 
search engines.
 
 Unless you’re writing a private password-protected blog, you’ll probably 
want search engines to index your blog so readers can find you.

 Chapter 3: Creating Your TypePad Account and Profile
 
14. Choose what to do first:
 
• Write your first post (see Chapter 6).
 
• Design your blog (see Chapter 11).
 
• Skip these options and head directly to your TypePad Dashboard 
(see the next section and Chapter 4).
 
 After you confirm your new TypePad account, you’ll receive a confir-
mation e-mail at the e-mail address you provided. This e-mail includes 
instructions on how to get started with your blog by writing a post, 
adding a picture, or changing your blog’s design.
Signing In to Your TypePad Account
Now that you have a TypePad account, you’ll need to sign in to access that 
account. After you sign in, you can visit the Dashboard or your account page, 
or search the Help section if you have questions. You can also edit your 
blog (or blogs) and connect your Profile to your other social media accounts 
(such as Facebook, LinkedIn, or Twitter).
If you’re ready to customize your TypePad information, type www.TypePad.
com/dashboard in your browser’s address bar and press Enter. The TypePad 
Sign In screen appears, as shown in Figure 3-6.
You can sign in to your TypePad account in two ways:
 
✓ Enter your e-mail address and password. Click inside the text boxes 
and enter the necessary information. Then click the Sign In button.
 
 If you are using your own computer and are the only one with access 
to it, you might want to consider selecting the Remember Me option 
if you’re using your e-mail and password to sign in to your TypePad 
account. That way, you won’t have to sign in each time you want to 
edit your blog. If you’re using a common computer at a library or other 
public place, you should not select the Remember Me option.
 
✓ Use an existing social media account (for example, Facebook, Twitter, 
or Google). Click the pull-down menu and choose the social media 
account you want to use as your sign-in. A button for that social media 
network appears; click it. A new page appears, asking you to confirm 
that you want to allow TypePad to access that account information. 
Complete the ID and password information as necessary and confirm 
that it’s okay for TypePad to access that account information.
After you’ve signed in to your TypePad account, the Dashboard appears (see 
Figure 3-7).

47
 Chapter 3: Creating Your TypePad Account and Profile
Your Dashboard is your starting point every time you sign in, so you’ll want 
to be familiar with all its features. Think of the TypePad Dashboard the same 
way you’d think of a car’s dashboard: It’s where all the basic controls for oper-
ation are gathered. From the Dashboard, you can access every part of your 
TypePad account (including your TypePad Library, your account information, 
and your blogs). We cover how to use the Dashboard at length in Chapter 4, so 
in the next section, we move on to creating your TypePad Profile.
Creating Your TypePad Profile
Before you start creating your blog (see Chapter 5), you’ll want to set up your 
Profile. A TypePad Profile is similar to an About page (and, in fact, TypePad 
uses some of the information you include in your Profile to populate your 
About page — which we discuss in Chapter 4). Your Profile includes infor-
mation such as your display name, bio, interests, and userpic. Your Profile 
also lists social media accounts you may have, any blogs you write that are 
housed at TypePad, and your homepage URL.
Think of your TypePad Profile as a hub that shows others where you can be 
found online. It integrates all your online presences into one central location. 
When you leave a comment at any blog that uses the TypePad comment-
ing system (see Chapter 7), readers can click your comment and be taken 
directly to your TypePad Profile. You may even want to link directly to your 
Profile from your own sidebar, in place of a more traditional About page, an 
option we discuss in Chapter 4.
 
You should be aware that your Profile page is public and shows your com-
menting activity on TypePad blogs.
To create and edit your TypePad Profile, you need to go from your 
Dashboard to your Profile page:
 
1. Click your display name.
 
 You can find your display name in the green account-level bar at the top 
of the Dashboard.
 
2. Click the Edit Your Profile button.
 
 Your Profile page appears (see Figure 3-8).
 
3. Fill in the information you want to share in your Profile.
 
 The rest of this chapter explains the options you have when choosing 
what information to share in your Profile.

48
Part II: Getting Started with TypePad 
 
Figure 3-8: 
Your Profile 
page deter-
mines what 
information 
you share 
with the 
world.
 
Sharing your personal information
You may want to share the following information in your TypePad Profile:
 
✓ Display name: This is the name that appears as the author of your blog 
posts, when you leave comments at other blogs, and when you respond 
to comments at your own blog. To edit your display name, click the Edit 
Display Name link, change the display name to your desired name or 
nickname, and save your changes.
 
✓ Profile URL: This is the address of your public Profile and is the URL 
you can link to if you’d like to share your Profile on your blog. Although 
the initial part of the URL (http://profile.typepad.com/) is static, 
you can choose the end of the URL (after the final /) — for example, 
http://profile.typepad.com/typepadfordummies.
 
 When choosing your Profile URL, use a word or phrase that is relevant 
to your blog and memorable. For example, you may choose to use your 
display name.
 
✓ Location: This information is optional. It’s worth considering how much 
information you want to share with the world at large. Do you want 
people to know exactly where you live (Jefferson, IA) or would you 
rather give them a general idea (Iowa or Midwest)? If you are not com-
fortable sharing any location information, leave this box blank.

49
 Chapter 3: Creating Your TypePad Account and Profile
 
 The information you choose to share is public and can be seen by 
anyone who views your Profile.
 
✓ One-line bio: Your one-line bio can be the tagline for your site. A tagline 
is a short sentence or slogan that tells readers a bit more about your blog. 
If your tagline is something especially catchy, you might want to consider 
including it on your banner design, too (see Chapter 11). Your one-line bio 
can also be a short sentence that encapsulates you and your blog content 
(such as “I like pie and I blog about it.”). Although there is no character 
limit to your one-line bio, it’s best to keep it to about 150 characters 
(including spaces). You can expand on your idea in the Interests section.
 
✓ Interests: Below your one-line bio is a place to fill in your interests. You 
can simply list your interests, separating them with commas, or you can 
explain your interests in a paragraph format. Reading about your interests 
is one more way for readers and community members to find out more 
about you quickly, so consider listing items that really explain who you are.
 
 Be specific when entering your interests: “Watching Firefly reruns” says 
more about you than simply “Watching television.”
Uploading your userpic
Including a userpic, short for user picture (also referred to by some as an 
avatar), of yourself in your Profile helps readers connect with you. Your user-
pic can be a picture of yourself or your brand, which is simply a concept or 
visual image your readers will associate with you. Your userpic will appear 
next to your comments on other TypePad blogs.
 
You may want to use a picture of your brand instead of a picture of yourself. 
For example, if you write a financial advice blog, and your logo is a bright-
green dollar sign, an image of that dollar sign might have more effect than 
a photo of you. On the other hand, readers like to feel a connection to the 
people who write the blogs they visit. Including a picture of yourself helps 
readers feel as though you’ve introduced yourself to them personally.
To add or change your userpic, click the Browse button under Choose an 
Image File. Find the image you want to use among the files on your hard 
drive, and click OK or Open. Then scroll to the bottom of the Profile page and 
click Save Changes to see your new userpic in action.
Connecting your Profile to 
the rest of the Web
The bottom half of your Profile (under Around the Web) offers you the 
opportunity to show readers where else you can be found online. You have 
the following options:

50
Part II: Getting Started with TypePad 
 
✓ Your Accounts Elsewhere: You can choose to include direct links to 
other online accounts you have, such as Twitter and Facebook. To add 
a link to one or more of these accounts, simply click Add an Account; 
you’ll be taken to the Other Accounts page of your Account Dashboard. 
We explain how to add links to other social media accounts in Chapter 4.
 
✓ Your Homepage URL: This is the URL that will be linked to your name 
any time you comment on a TypePad blog. You can type any URL 
here — it can be the URL for your blog or the URL for another Web site 
or blog that isn’t part of TypePad.
 
✓ Your Blogs: If you have more than one blog hosted at your TypePad 
account, you can choose which ones will be listed in your Profile. Any 
blog you choose to have displayed on your Profile page will also show 
updates. In other words, each time a new article is posted at a listed 
blog, anyone who looks at your Profile page will see the update.
 
✓ Show the Recent Activity Module: If you select this option, your most 
recent comments on other TypePad blogs (see Chapter 7) will be visible 
to your followers.
 
✓ Show the Blogs.com Module: Blogs.com is a Six Apart–owned Web site 
that offers, in the company’s words, “the best of blogs.” If you choose 
to show recent posts from Blogs.com on your Profile page, those posts 
will show up as links on the sidebar of your Profile page. You can ensure 
that these links are relevant to your blog’s niche or community by 
selecting a category from the drop-down menu under Show the Blogs.
com Module.
Congratulations! You’ve established your TypePad account, logged in, and 
set up your Profile. Now you can change your personal information as neces-
sary, access your blog (see Chapter 5 if you haven’t already set yours up), 
and get connected with the TypePad community.

Chapter 4
Touring the TypePad Dashboard
In This Chapter
▶ Knowing the navigation menu options
▶ Understanding the Library options
▶ Changing your account info
▶ Monitoring your TypePad community
▶ Having more than one blog
Your TypePad Dashboard is the hub of all your TypePad activity — it’s 
the first thing you see when you sign in to your TypePad account. Your 
Dashboard is the starting place for all the links you need to access your 
blogs, change your Profile information, manage your library of stored files, 
search the Knowledge Base (TypePad’s help files), access your account 
information, and keep tabs on your TypePad community. Navigating your 
Dashboard comfortably is critical to managing your blog well, and this chap-
ter provides a brief overview of what you can expect to find. Think of this 
chapter as your Dashboard geography lesson — we show you a left-to-right, 
top-to-bottom explanation of each button, link, and section. In other chap-
ters, we help you apply many of these functions in further detail.
 
Depending on which TypePad account you have, some of the items discussed 
in this chapter and others may not be part of your account. For example, 
TypePad Micro doesn’t have access to TypeLists or File Manager.
Understanding the Navigation Bars
To access the Dashboard, you simply need to sign in to your TypePad 
account (instructions on how to do that are in Chapter 3). Throughout this 
chapter, it will be helpful to refer to Figure 4-1 because it shows the basic 
layout of the Dashboard.

52
Part II: Getting Started with TypePad 
 
Figure 4-1: 
The 
TypePad 
Dashboard.
 
Account-level bar
 
The key to moving around the Dashboard is understanding the two primary 
horizontal navigation bars — the bars that run all the way across the top of 
the Dashboard. If you’ve just now logged into your account, you’re probably 
seeing only one bar — it’s a green one, and it contains links such as TypePad, 
Dashboard, and Blogs. This is the account-level bar. You use it to access core 
account information relevant to your entire account, not just your individual 
blog — an important distinction to draw, because many people manage mul-
tiple blogs from one account. When we explain how to establish and manage 
individual blogs (in Chapter 5), you’ll also see a blue bar right below the 
account-level bar. The blue bar is the blog-level bar. This bar provides links to 
blog-specific information, such as your posts, settings, and comments.
Right now, we want to discuss the account-level bar and make you familiar 
with its options. Table 4-1 explains the purpose of each link in the account-
level bar (moving from left to right).

See a pull-down menu of the blogs you’ve set up with this 
TypePad account as well as an Add a Blog link, which 
allows you to create a new blog on the same account or 
connect blogs on other blogging platforms to your TypePad 
account. You can choose which of your blogs (if you have 
several) you want to work on from this menu. When you click 
a blog name, you’re taken to a page that gives you an over-
view of that blog’s statistics and links to other tasks (posting, 
comment moderation, design, and settings).
Library
See a pull-down menu that allows you to access your photo 
albums, TypeLists, and files. If you have a TypePad Micro 
account, you do not have this option.
[Your Username]
See your TypePad Profile page as it appears to your read-
ers. The exception is that you also see the Edit Your Profile 
button — your readers don’t see that. We explain how to 
create and edit your Profile in Chapter 3.
Account
See and update your TypePad account information — if you 
have one of the TypePad Pro accounts. From your account 
information page you can edit your personal information, 
notifications, billing information, and About Me page infor-
mation. You can also add or delete additional social media 
and affiliate accounts (such as Amazon.com, Facebook, 
Twitter, or FriendFeed), change your password, or map a 
domain name to your blog (see Appendix A). We explain 
how you can edit account information later in this chapter.
If you have TypePad Micro, you can update your personal 
information and notifications settings, and add or delete 
social media accounts.

With the overview in Table 4-1 in mind, let’s begin exploring.

54
Part II: Getting Started with TypePad 
Locating Your TypePad Library
Your TypePad library is the repository for your files and TypeLists (see 
Chapter 8 for an explanation of TypeLists). When you click the Library link 
on the account-level bar, you see a pull-down menu with these choices: 
Photo Albums, TypeLists, and File Manager. Each choice offers you a way to 
manage a variety of files.
Knowing where your files are and how they’re organized helps you manage 
your blog as it grows. You’ll be able to find the information you’re looking for 
quickly and easily if you take the time to set up an intuitive folder system for 
the files you share with your readers. You may want to re-create the system 
you use on your home computer because you’re most likely already in a 
groove there and are familiar with where things are.
Finding photo albums
After clicking the Library link in the green account-level bar, choose Photo 
Albums from the drop-down menu. This takes you to a screen listing any 
photo albums you have created in your TypePad account. If you haven’t cre-
ated any albums yet but would like to, just click Add a Photo Album in the 
top-right corner (more detailed instructions on photo albums are in Chapter 9). 
Photo albums are a particularly handy tool under the following circumstances:
 
✓ You’re a photo blogger whose blog is geared largely to your photo-
graphic content, and you need a streamlined way to organize all the 
images.
 
✓ You’re documenting a specific event (such as a vacation or a home 
remodel) that generates a large number of photos, and you want those 
photos grouped in one place. In Chapter 11, we explain how you can 
set up your sidebars so that you link directly to one (or all) of these 
photo albums.
The Photo Albums tool in TypePad is such a large and powerful feature that 
we devote much of Chapter 9 to it (other multimedia tools are addressed 
there as well). In that chapter, we walk you through the specifics of setting 
up your photo albums, and we tell you how you can maximize your use of 
this tool. For now, simply be aware that the green account-level bar is where 
you access your photo albums; We dive into the subject more deeply in the 
later chapter.
 
If you’re a blogger who posts primarily text, posting photos only occasionally, 
you may find that photo albums are not an especially integral part of your 
TypePad use. When you write a post, you can easily insert an image or a photo 
with a few quick clicks (see Chapter 6) without ever accessing your photo 
albums.

55
 Chapter 4: Touring the TypePad Dashboard
Navigating TypeLists
TypeLists are TypePad’s way of organizing any sidebar information you 
include on your blog. Sidebar information can include everything from your 
contact information to links to your favorite or most popular posts to adver-
tisements. To access your TypePad TypeLists, create a new TypeList, or 
edit an existing TypeList, click the Library link in the account-level bar and 
choose TypeLists from the pull-down menu.
TypePad offers four kinds of TypeLists:
 
✓ Links TypeList: Post basic links in the sidebar, such as a text link to 
your Twitter account.
 
✓ Notes TypeList: Post customized HTML or complex code in the sidebar. 
You can use this kind of TypeList to place images or buttons in the sidebar.
 
✓ Books TypeList: Share and rate book lists in the sidebar. You can link 
the list to Amazon.
 
✓ Albums TypeList: Share music lists in the sidebar. Similar to the Books 
TypeList, the Albums TypeList enables you to rate and comment on the 
music you’ve listed.
TypeLists are an important part of your blog’s design because they control 
the contents of the sidebars. We discuss them at length, with specific instruc-
tions on how to set up individual TypeLists, in Chapter 8.
Managing stored files
A blog is often much more than just the text you see on the screen. Bloggers 
can share with readers a wide variety of files and media that they want read-
ers to see (or be able to download), such as photos, spreadsheets, PDF files, 
music, and video. To upload or access your various blog files, you use File 
Manager. On the Account-level bar, click the Library link and choose File 
Manager from the pull-down menu.
Any time you upload a file (such as a photo), it’s stored in File Manager. 
You don’t have to create a filing system to organize File Manager — many 
TypePad bloggers just upload files and dig around for them as needed — but 
if you take the time to set up a clear filing system, you can avoid some seri-
ous headaches down the road. You can reference parts of your blog easily if 
you know where you store the files.
Your main blog hosts its files and subfolders in the main Home directory. By 
default, each blog you set up on your TypePad account in addition to your 
first blog has its own folder in the Home directory. See Figure 4-2 for an exam-
ple of how File Manager might look with three blogs on the same account.

56
Part II: Getting Started with TypePad 
 
Figure 4-2: 
File 
Manager 
set up with 
multiple 
blogs on 
a single 
account.
 
While in File Manager, you’ll be able to create new folders and subfolders and 
create a file structure that makes sense to you. It may work best for you to mirror 
the file structure you’ve set up on your computer. For instance, if you keep all your 
PDF documents in a folder named PDF on your computer and plan to share PDF 
documents on your blog, it’s logical to make a folder named PDF in your TypePad 
File Manager and store the blog’s PDFs there. You may also want to consider set-
ting up folders specifically for podcasts or video files, as shown in Figure 4-3.
To create a new folder in the Home directory:
 
1. Click in the text box under Create a New Folder.
 
 Create a New Folder is in the right sidebar.
 
2. Type the name of the new folder.
 
3. Click the Create button.
To create a new folder within an existing folder (in other words, to create a 
subfolder):
 
1. Click the folder you’d like to open.

57
 Chapter 4: Touring the TypePad Dashboard

2. Click in the text box under Create a New Folder, which is in the right 
sidebar.
 
3. Type the name of the new folder.
 
4. Click the Create button.
When you upload files to TypePad, the process is similar to what you’re used 
to when uploading or downloading files to your own computer and its filing 
system:
 
1. Click the folder where you would like to store the new file.
 
2. Click inside the text box under Upload a New File (it’s the top box in 
the right sidebar).
 
 You see your own computer’s file manager.
 
3. Choose the file you want to upload.
 
4. Click Upload.
 
Right-click the name of the file you just uploaded and choose Copy Link 
Location to save the file location to your clipboard.

Part II: Getting Started with TypePad 
Editing Your TypePad 
Account Information
Your TypePad account information includes everything from your personal 
and billing information to links to your other social media accounts and pass-
word information. Only the account owner can see the information on the 
Account page — any guest or junior authors of your blogs can’t see this infor-
mation. You can change or edit any of your account information as needed 
by clicking the Account link at the top of the Dashboard. You’ll see a page 
that looks like Figure 4-4.
You’ll notice a list of options in the left sidebar. Each of these tabs opens a 
new form for you to edit. In this section, we walk you through each one, from 
the top down.
Summary tab
The Summary tab is exactly what you think it is: It lists a summary of the 
account information you shared when you initiated your TypePad account. 
You can change or edit the following information:
 
✓ First name
 
✓ Last name
 
✓ Display name
 
✓ E-mail address (and whether you’d like to share that e-mail address)
 
 You use your e-mail address to sign in to your TypePad account. If you 
change your e-mail address here, you’ll need to remember to use the 
new one the next time you want to sign in to TypePad.
 
 Sharing your e-mail address is a good idea because it allows other 
bloggers to contact you when you leave a comment at their blog. This is 
particularly handy when you’re part of a great discussion.
 
✓ Domain
 
 If you change your TypePad domain (for example, changing from type
padfordummies.typepad.com to dummies.typepad.com), you can’t 
change it back later. The name you stop using will be available to other 
TypePad users for use on their own blog(s). We suggest that you buy 
and map a domain to your blog (see Appendix A), rather than changing 
your TypePad domain here.

✓ Gender
If you make any changes on this Summary page, be sure to click the Save 
Changes button, or you’ll lose the changes you made.
If you want to change your password, scroll to the bottom of the Summary page 
to find the box titled Password Changes and then follow these instructions:
 
1. Type your current password in the Current Password box.
 
2. Type your new password in the New Password box.
 
3. Retype your new password in the Confirm Password box.
 
4. Click the Change Password button to save your changes.

60
Part II: Getting Started with TypePad 
Notifications tab
The Notifications tab is where you can set up how and when you are noti-
fied via e-mail about new comments, Six Apart newsletters and offers, and 
how those e-mails appear (that is, plain text or with HTML formatting). The 
Notifications tab has three sections: News, Activity, and Email Format. We 
describe each next.
News: Click to select this box if you’d like to receive newsletters from Six 
Apart and notices about your account. We strongly recommend that you 
select this box. Six Apart offers users new features and themes often, and 
being on its mailing list means you will understand the new features available 
to you. The notices are not sent very often, but when they are, the informa-
tion is usually important.
Activity: If you’re interested in knowing when someone responds to one of 
your comments on a blog (explained further in Chapter 7) or starts following 
your updates to your blog and other social media sites, you can be notified 
via e-mail. You can also choose to be notified via if someone selects your blog as 
a favorite. Click to select the box beside each option you’re interested in using.
 
If you think you’ll be distracted by watching your inbox for comments all day 
long, consider setting up a separate e-mail account just for your TypePad blog. 
You can use that e-mail address for all things blog-related and keep your blog-
ging correspondence separate from your private, “real-world” correspondence.
Email Format: You can receive your e-mail notifications in either HTML 
format or plain text. HTML format usually includes images and design ele-
ments. Plain text is just what it sounds like: words and links with no spiffy 
design. Your e-mail client can probably handle either format, so it’s really a 
personal preference. Click to select the radio button beside the type of e-mail 
you’d like to receive.
Billing Info tab
The Billing Info tab shows an overview of the billing information you provided 
when you set up your TypePad account and gives you a summary of your bill-
ing history (all the monthly charges you’ve incurred thus far and any changes 
you’ve made to your billing information, such as changing your credit card).
Billing Summary: This section shows you which billing options you chose 
when you set up your TypePad account:
 
✓ Current Plan lists which package you’re currently using (Chapter 2 
explains the blogging packages TypePad offers and helps you decide 
which one is right for you). You have the option of upgrading or down-
grading your current package or canceling your account.

61
 Chapter 4: Touring the TypePad Dashboard
 
✓ Billing Cycle tells you when you can expect to be billed (monthly 
or yearly). You chose your billing cycle when you established your 
TypePad account, but you have the option of changing it here, if you 
like. Your only choices for billing cycles are monthly or yearly (you get 
two free months of service if you choose yearly).
 
✓ Payment Method lists the last four digits of the credit card you have on 
file with the TypePad billing department (you shared this information 
when you set up your account). You have the option of updating your 
credit card. If you click the Update link, you can apply a discount code, 
update your credit card information, or change your credit card com-
pletely. You can also edit your billing address if necessary.
 
 If you do a Web search for TypePad discount code, you’ll usually find a 
few to choose among. Refer to Chapter 3 for a special discount code for 
readers of this book.
 
✓ Billing Rate is your monthly TypePad rate, which depends on which blog-
ging package you chose when you signed up for your TypePad account.
 
✓ Next Billing tells you when you can expect your next bill.
 
✓ Member Since tells you when you established your TypePad account.
Transaction History: This section shows you a complete list of all your 
TypePad billing transactions. This list includes billing dates, payments made, 
and any changes you may have made to your billing information (such as 
changing your credit card information or your billing address).
About Me Page tab
Every blogger needs an About Me page — it’s the place your readers can quickly 
find out more about you. New readers often look for a link to an About Me page 
(and click it!) the first time they stop by your blog. Your blog should include an 
obvious, easy-to-find link to your About Me page. (We tell you how to set up that 
link when we discuss blog design in Chapter 11.) You have four distinct options 
for setting up this important page on TypePad: your account’s default About Me 
page, your own HTML page, your TypePad Profile, and your own personally con-
structed About Me page written in your WYSIWYG editor. Let’s discuss all four of 
them, and you can decide which one fits you best.
TypePad’s default About Me page
Because we’re working our way through your Account Summary, you’ll 
notice an About Me Page tab on the vertical bar on the left side of the screen. 
Click that tab, and you see a list of information TypePad can pull from your 
account to populate the default About Me page. If you choose this option, 
simply click the items you want TypePad to pull into the page. Also notice 
that the URL to the default page is listed toward the top of the screen; click 
that, if you want to see how it looks.

62
Part II: Getting Started with TypePad 
The default About Me template allows you to share specific information from 
your Account, Profile, and TypeLists with your audience. To choose the infor-
mation and allow it to appear on your About Me page, simply click to select 
the box next to the item you want to include.
Account: The information listed under Account is pulled directly from the 
data you shared in your Account Summary and Other Accounts tabs, with the 
exception of the photo option (which is pulled from your Profile). You can 
choose to include
 
✓ Name
 
✓ Display name
 
✓ Photo (the photo you shared as your userpic when you set up your 
Profile in Chapter 3)
 
✓ Email (if you share your e-mail address, it’s automatically encrypted to 
keep it safe from spammers)
 
✓ Other accounts (any accounts listed in the Other Accounts tab is listed 
if you choose to include this option)
 
✓ Publish FOAF file (FOAF is an acronym for Friend of a Friend; the FOAF 
project creates machine-readable pages that contain information about 
people and the things they create online)
 
✓ Edit Account Settings (links to the Account Summary tab, where you can 
edit your name, display name, and so on)
Profile: The information options listed under Profile are pulled directly from 
the data you shared when you set up your Profile in Chapter 3:
 
✓ Web address (your blog’s URL)
 
✓ Country
 
✓ Interests
 
✓ One-line bio
 
✓ Amazon Wish List (you need to log in to your Amazon account and find 
your Wish List ID and, if you’re an Amazon Associate, your Amazon 
Associate ID); your Amazon Wish List is an option only if you’ve shared 
this information via your Profile (see Chapter 3)
 
✓ Edit your Profile (links directly to your Profile so you can edit any infor-
mation you’ve shared there)
TypeLists: You may want to include specific TypeLists in your About Me 
sidebar. The TypeLists option for your About Me page lists all the TypeLists 
you’ve set up for your blog (see Chapter 8 for instructions on setting up 
TypeLists); if you haven’t set up any TypeLists yet, you won’t see the option 

63
 Chapter 4: Touring the TypePad Dashboard
to include them on your About Me page. To include a specific TypeList in 
your About Me page, simply click to select the box next to the TypeList you 
want to include.
Biography: If you’d like to include a short biography or information that isn’t 
covered with the previous data choices, you can type that information in the 
text box labeled Biography. When you’re happy with your information, click 
to check the box next to Biography so your information will show up on your 
About Me page.
Choose a Style: You can choose to style your About Me page so that it reflects 
the theme (design) of your blog. Use the pull-down menu to choose which style 
you’d like to apply. If you’re using one of TypePad’s basic design themes, it’s a 
good idea to apply the same theme to your About Me page for consistency. To 
do this, click the pull-down menu and choose your own username.
If you are not using a basic TypePad theme (perhaps you use a custom 
header design like the kind we discuss in Chapter 11), you can still match 
your About Me page to your custom design. The instructions in the previous 
paragraph won’t work, though; you’ll need to set up a specific design for your 
About Me page to match your custom design. We cover this issue when we 
address all design-related questions in Chapter 11.
When you’ve chosen the information you’d like to share, written your bio-
graphical information, and think you have your About Me page finished, 
click the Preview or Save and Publish button. If you click the Preview button, 
a new window opens with a preview of your About Me page. If you’re not 
happy with the information, change what you need to by selecting new infor-
mation options or deselecting current information options. Rewrite your bio 
if necessary or change your userpic if you want to. Click the Preview button 
again and see how it looks. When you’re satisfied with the outcome, click the 
Save and Publish button.
Figure 4-5 shows you a sample of an About Me page constructed using the 
default template.
Your own HTML page
Below the Default Template section, you can see the Write Your Own HTML 
Page option. If you are comfortable with HTML and have an idea of how you’d 
like your About Me page to appear, you can type the code in the HTML box. 
You can check your progress by clicking the Preview button. When you’re 
satisfied with how the page looks and have finished tweaking the code, click 
the Save and Publish button to save the page and have it automatically pub-
lished to your blog. This option requires a good bit of coding knowledge, 
which the average blogger may not have. We advise that you tackle this 
option only if you have experience with HTML.

Your TypePad Profile
In Chapter 3, we explain that a TypePad Profile is essentially a hub site that you 
can use to show readers all the places you can be found online. Your Profile is cen-
tral to your participation in the TypePad community. Because it contains so much 
information about you, it could serve as a decent About Me page (you can insert a 
direct link to your Profile into the Content portion of the Design tab — Chapter 11 
details how). Figure 4-6 shows you a completed TypePad Profile. (Can’t remember 
how to access or edit yours? See the instructions in Chapter 3.)
One of the drawbacks of using the Profile as your About Me page is that you 
don’t have your e-mail listed on your Profile. Including a way to contact you 
is a crucial part of your About Me page. To get around this issue, you could 
easily create a TypeList (see Chapter 8) with a link to your e-mail address 
and include it in your blog’s main sidebar.
A personally constructed About Me page
All TypePad users (except those with Micro accounts) can create pages in 
addition to posts. (A page is basically a freestanding, undated post you can 
create in your Rich Text editor; we explain this further in Chapter 6.) Creating 
a page is as simple as writing a post. When readers click a link to one of your 
pages, they’re still at your blog, seeing your header and sidebar, just as if they 
were reading a post — this makes for much better design continuity. You can 
write an About Me page this way with great results (see Chapter 6 for instruc-
tions on publishing posts and pages). See Figure 4-7. Generally, a more narra-
tive About Me page is preferable to a simple bulleted list of hobbies.

 Chapter 4: Touring the TypePad Dashboard
 
Figure 4-6:

Your About Me page may form a reader’s first impression of you, so include 
succinct details that communicate who you are.
Apply your own sense of style to your About Me page (if your blog is, for 
example, inspirational, reflect that same tone in your About Me page). 
Here are some items you might want to include if you construct this page 
yourself:
 
✓ Your name (or the name you go by in the blogosphere)
 
✓ Where you live
 
✓ A general explanation of what your blog is about
 
✓ Your e-mail address
 
✓ Links to other social networking accounts, such as Twitter, Facebook, 
and LinkedIn
 
✓ Hobbies
 
✓ Your favorite movies, music, and sports team
 
Whatever option you choose, remember that sharing information online is 
sharing information with the world. Before you publicize certain aspects of 
yourself in an About Me page (or anywhere else on a blog), consider whether 
you really want people to know where you live or the names of your family 
members. If you haven’t already read the “Considering privacy issues” section 
in Chapter 1, this is a good time to do so.

Other Accounts tab
Your Other Accounts tab is where you list the other social media sites you 
belong to and link them to your blog. Social media includes all the ways 
you interact with friends and colleagues online (blogs, Twitter, Facebook, 
FriendFeed, Digg, LinkedIn, and so on).
You may want your readers to be able to find you on Facebook or follow you 
on Twitter. It’s a fairly simple process to integrate this information into your 
TypePad account. After you’ve established your additional social media links, 
TypePad can integrate them into your TypePad Profile or your default About 
Me page. (If you manually create your own About page, as we recommended 
in the previous section, note that the accounts you link here do not automati-
cally appear in your manually created page. You’ll need to link them yourself 
in your Rich Text editor when you create or edit the actual page.)
To add new social media account information to your TypePad account, 
follow these instructions:
 
1. Click the pull-down menu.
 
 You’ll see a list of many social media sites, some of which you won’t use. 
That’s okay. There are so many social media sites, you can’t use them all 
effectively. It’s best to choose just a few and concentrate on using them 
well. TypePad offers a fairly comprehensive list of social media options 
because so many people use different ones.

67
 Chapter 4: Touring the TypePad Dashboard
 
2. Choose the social media link you want to start with, such as Facebook.
 
3. Click the Add button.
 
 A pop-up window appears with sign-in information for that Web site 
(such as a Facebook sign-in). You must share your sign-in information so 
TypePad can access that account and bring the information to your blog.
What to include in your About Me page
Your About Me page is one of the most impor-
tant pages you’ll include in your blog. Think of 
it as your online business card of sorts. When 
people are new to your blog, one of the first 
things they will do is click your About Me link to 
see if the blog is a fit with their interests. Your 
About Me page is a way to engage with your 
readers and let them know a little more about 
you. Your About Me page is a highlight of you. 
It’s a page devoted to what sets you apart from 
everyone else.
If you’re at all interested in working with adver-
tisers or marketers, your About Me page is cru-
cial in helping you establish those relationships. 
Advertisers and marketers have hundreds of 
blogs to review to determine if they are a fit with 
their product or campaign. When they decide a 
blog is a fit, the advertiser or marketer contacts 
the blogger and extends an offer. If you’d like 
to help this relationship along, you can do a 
few things — and they all start with your About 
Me page:
 ✓ Make your contact information clearly vis-
ible. If a marketer or advertiser (or even a 
loyal reader) wants to contact you privately, 
they’ll need a way to do so. If your e-mail 
is buried or not even listed, visitors quickly 
tire of trying to find it and move to the next 
blog. If you’re worried about a text link to 
your e-mail being harvested by spammers, 
create a small image (or button) with your 
e-mail address and insert it into your About 
Me page that way.
 ✓ Give a brief overview of what your 
blog is about. You can give a bit of your 
background, why you chose to write about 
this particular blogging niche, your blog-
ging goals, and so on. This is the perfect 
opportunity for you to explain why you’re 
different from other bloggers in your area. 
When you’re writing about yourself, it can 
be hard to decide how much information is 
too much. Because your blog can probably 
speak for itself to some degree, try to keep 
your About Me page short but entertaining. 
Short and interesting trumps long and over-
done every time.
 ✓ Establish your credibility. Your About 
Me page is the perfect place to let read-
ers know why you’re the go-to source for 
your topic. If you have pertinent back-
ground experience, have won awards, or 
have professional designations or degrees 
that apply directly to your niche, mention 
them here.
 ✓ Explain what types of advertising or mar-
keting relationships you’re interested 
in. This might include giveaways for your 
readers, product reviews, or sharing press 
releases for causes you’re passionate 
about (then tell them which causes those 
are). If marketers can readily see that you 
are a good fit for their product, they’re more 
likely to contact you. You may also want 
to share a link to your disclosure policy. 
(Chapter 12 advises you further about 
how to disclose relationships and why it’s 
important.) These details can also be pack-
aged into what’s called a media kit (see 
Chapter 12).

68
Part II: Getting Started with TypePad 
 
4. Continue to add accounts as you see fit.
 
5. Click the Save button when you’re finished.
TypePad has a strong relationship with Amazon and allows you to easily 
share your Amazon Wish List or your Amazon Associates ID. (You can find 
out more about the Amazon Associates program by visiting affiliate-
program.amazon.com. It’s basically a program that allows you to receive a 
commission from goods sold when someone clicks to their site from yours.) 
You need to log in to your Amazon account to determine your account infor-
mation before you can share it with TypePad. After you have your Amazon 
account info, you can choose which Amazon vendor you want to work 
with (for example, Amazon.com, Amazon.co.uk, or Amazon.fr), type your 
Associates ID (if applicable), and type your Wish List ID (if you’d like to share 
it). Click the Save button, and you’re all set.
Password Protection tab
Not everyone finds it appealing to have complete strangers popping in to 
read their blog. You may decide you want to exert a little more control over 
which eyes see your posts. You can easily password-protect one, some, or all 
blogs under your TypePad account, and you can send the sign-in details to 
only the people you choose.
Click the Password Protection tab. Note the simple question at the top of 
this page: Do you want to password-protect your entire site? You can click to 
select the button next to the option that best suits your needs:
 
✓ No, Share My Site With Everyone: This option makes all your blogs 
public. They can be found by search engines and anyone online.
 
✓ Yes, Password-Protect My Entire Site: This options makes all blogs asso-
ciated with this TypePad account password-protected. If you choose this 
option, you’re prompted to choose a username and password.
 
 This username and password should be different from your TypePad 
username and password! Remember to send this new username and 
password to the readers you want to invite. They’ll need to use it every 
time they visit your blog. Click Save Changes at the bottom of the page 
to apply the password to all the blogs on your account.
 
✓ Password-Protect Some Blogs and Not Others: This option allows you to 
apply password protection to some blogs and leave other blogs open to 
the public. To password-protect a blog, click the Settings link next to the 
blog’s title. You’ll be taken to that blog’s Settings page. Click to select the 
Password option, and set a username and password. Then click the Save 
Changes button on that page.

69
 Chapter 4: Touring the TypePad Dashboard
If you make any changes to your privacy settings on the Password Protection 
page, be sure to click the Save Changes button at the bottom of the page so 
the changes will take effect.
Password protection is your most powerful privacy tool, but it’s not the only 
one. As we mention in Chapter 1, occasionally your blog might be visited by 
someone intent on stirring up trouble in your comments section. If this hap-
pens to you, don’t sweat it — this happens to nearly every blogger at some 
point. TypePad allows you to block unwanted commenters from ever leaving 
comments again — all you need is the person’s IP address, which you’ll be 
able to see the first time he or she leaves a comment. We show you how to 
do this in Chapter 7, where we deal with all comment-related issues.
 
Note that although TypePad allows you to block certain IP addresses from 
leaving a comment, it does not currently offer a way for you to block that IP 
address from viewing your blog. The only way to keep certain viewers from 
seeing your site is to implement password protection.
Domain Mapping tab
Domain mapping simply means that you’re using your own domain name 
(yourblog.com) instead of your hosted domain name (yourblog.typepad.
com). When you map your domain to your blog, you’re telling the browser to 
recognize the .com (or .net, .org, and so on) as your URL. TypePad has thor-
ough instructions for domain mapping with several domain hosts, including 
Yahoo! and GoDaddy — we also tackle domain mapping in Appendix A.
When you’re ready to use your own domain for your blog, you’ll come to 
the Domain Mapping tab and start the process. If you’re a new blogger, this 
may not mean much to you right now. If that’s the case, we encourage you 
to become comfortable with blogging first and consider this option in a few 
months. When you’re ready to find out more, flip to Appendix A, where we 
explain how to find out if your domain name is available, how to purchase the 
domain name, and how to map it to your blog.
TypeKey API tab
You may see an API Key tab at the bottom of the tab list on the Account page. 
API Key is the software that allows you to turn on the comment features in 
Movable Type (if you have a Movable Type account). If you see this tab but 
don’t have a Movable Type account, you can just ignore it; you don’t need it. 
If you don’t see this tab, that’s okay too.

Getting Help
Now that you’ve seen all the items you can edit in the Account link, let’s head 
back up to the green account-level bar and address the next link: Help. This is 
an important one, of course — it’s the link you should click any time TypePad 
issues have you stumped. As we mention in Chapter 2, TypePad prides itself 
on its technical support, offering a thorough help section written without a 
lot of complicated jargon. It also gives you quick access to a real live person, 
by using the help ticket system. We describe both approaches in this section.
Using the Knowledge Base
After you click the Help link, you see a help screen that looks like the one in 
Figure 4-8.
 
If you have a TypePad Micro account, your Help screen will look a bit differ-
ent: You are limited to searching the Knowledge Base, and you can’t open a 
help ticket.
 
Figure 4-8: 
TypePad’s 
Help 
Overview 
page.
 

71
 Chapter 4: Touring the TypePad Dashboard
When you’re facing a technical question, your best place to start is about 
halfway down the page, in the section called Knowledge Base. Knowledge 
Base is simply another word for a large collection of instructional articles 
users can access for assistance with questions. Many times, the particular 
question you’re facing has already been addressed here. To find an answer in 
the Knowledge Base, click inside the search bar under Knowledge Base. Type 
the word or phrase that best describes the issue. Click the Search button, 
and a list of relevant Knowledge Base articles appears. Take a few minutes 
to browse through these search results and see if they offer the information 
you need.
 
The Knowledge Base is updated so frequently that you might want to keep 
a close eye on new articles being issued by subscribing to Knowledge Base 
updates. You can do this by visiting help.sixapart.com/tp/us and click-
ing the Feed Subscribe to Updates link in the right sidebar.
If you can’t find an answer to your question in the Knowledge Base, you may 
require more personal assistance. In this case, opening a help ticket is the 
next step.
Submitting a help ticket
For direct access to someone on TypePad’s support staff, revisit the Help 
Overview page (refer to Figure 4-8). In the blue list of links on the left side of 
the page, click New Ticket. (TypePad Micro users don’t have this option.)
The next screen asks you what area of TypePad you need help with. Choose 
the best answer from the drop-down menu. Next, in the subject line, describe 
the problem succinctly. Be specific in the subject line: “Readers can’t see my 
comments” is more descriptive than “Comment problem.”
In the last field, describe your problem at length. Be thorough and specific — 
the support staff can best help you when you give them as much information 
as possible. Because the support team will try to replicate the problem to 
solve it, we suggest that you explain what you were doing when the problem 
occurred and also mention any error messages you saw. When you have fin-
ished describing the issue, click Create Ticket at the bottom of the screen.
After submitting the ticket, simply wait until the support staff responds — 
nearly always within 24 hours, and usually much less. You’ll be notified by 
e-mail with their response. You can either read their answer directly in your 
e-mail or use the Active Ticket section in your blog’s Help Overview page — 
just click the subject line of the ticket in question to see the answer. This will 
open a new page, with TypePad’s response listed.

72
Part II: Getting Started with TypePad 
If the support staff has answered your question fully (and we hope they 
have), click the Mark This Ticket as Resolved box at the bottom of the page 
(this serves as a helpful reminder to both you and them that no further cor-
respondence is required) and then click Submit Response.
If you’re still uncertain even after their response, however, don’t hesitate to 
write back for additional clarification. TypePad prides itself on customer ser-
vice, so take full advantage of this tool as often as you need to!
 
TypePad conveniently keeps a record of all your old help tickets, making it 
easy for you to revisit questions. From the Help Overview page, simply click 
View All Past Tickets in the list of links on the left sidebar, and you’re taken 
to a full listing of every help ticket you’ve ever submitted, complete with 
TypePad’s responses.
Using Quick Compose
Near the top of the Dashboard (refer to Figure 4-1) is a Quick Compose sec-
tion. You can enter text, photos, or videos here and then click Publish — the 
new post will publish instantly to whichever blog you’ve set up as your 
account’s default blog. If you click the Share button, you can even share the 
content with whichever social media accounts you’ve linked with your blog.
Use this tool if it appeals to you, but keep in mind that (as of this writ-
ing) the Quick Compose section has no space for including a title for your 
post. Many bloggers consider this a glaring omission. Instead of using the 
Quick Compose section, we recommend that you write your posts using the 
Compose editor, which we discuss fully in Chapter 6.
Locating Your List of Blogs
Earlier in the chapter, we mention that a complete listing of your current 
TypePad blogs appears in the drop-down menu when you click Blogs in the 
green account-level bar. That’s not the only place you’ll find them listed, 
though. On the Dashboard, look at the right sidebar (refer to Figure 4-1). You 
see the name of your main blog, with links to its settings tabs. Below that 
is a list of the other blogs (if you have any) associated with this TypePad 
account. TypePad lists your blogs in both places (the Blogs pull-down menu 
and the right sidebar of the Dashboard), but clicking a blog’s title in either 

73
 Chapter 4: Touring the TypePad Dashboard
spot ultimately lands you at the same place: the overview for that particu-
lar blog. Work from whichever list feels the most natural to you. If you’re 
a beginner who hasn’t yet created a TypePad blog, you won’t see anything 
listed in that box at this point. Don’t worry — we show you how to set up 
your first blog in the next chapter.
If you do already have a TypePad blog, notice that this sidebar offers you 
some handy shortcuts that can take you directly to where you want to go. 
Below the title of your main blog, you see links to the tabs available in your 
blog-level bar: Stats, Design, Settings, Compose, Posts, and Comments. The 
blogs listed below the main one have a link to the Compose tab. Clicking 
that link takes you to the page where you write a new post for that particular 
blog. Clicking the down arrow next to Compose displays a pull-down menu, 
offering shortcuts to various locations in that particular blog’s Dashboard. 
We cover each of those items thoroughly in Chapter 5; for now, know that 
this handy sidebar is a good starting point for managing every blog in your 
account.
Answering the Question of the Day
The Question of the Day (also known as the QotD) feature is tucked at the 
bottom of the Dashboard’s right sidebar. This option is just for fun, but you 
won’t want to miss it — it’s a simple way to engage in the TypePad commu-
nity, and it offers you some clever posting topics. TypePad freely accepts 
submissions for QotD; simply e-mail a creatively compelling question (95 
characters or less) to qotd@typepad.com. Each day, TypePad lists a new 
question in this box, and you’ll find that the questions range from the ridicu-
lous to the thought-provoking. Notice, too, that the author of each day’s 
question appears in the QotD box, garnering that blogger some good atten-
tion in the TypePad community.
To participate in the Question of the Day, click the yellow Answer button 
below the day’s question. This takes you directly to a new post, and the 
question is automatically inserted into the top of your new post. Write your 
answer, click Save (more on post publishing options in the next chapter), and 
your answer will post on your own blog. Conveniently, your QotD answer is 
also linked to all the other answers to that day’s question, and the answers 
are all listed at blogs.com, Six Apart’s hub site for featuring interesting 
content around the blogosphere. (To see that particular day’s answers, click 
View Answers in the QotD box.) This is not only a simple way to jump feet-
first into the TypePad community, but also a handy cure for writer’s block.

74
Part II: Getting Started with TypePad 
As you can see, there’s much to know and understand about the TypePad 
Dashboard. If you’re a beginning blogger (or if you’re an old TypePad pro 
who is still getting comfortable with the big redesign of late 2009), give your-
self some time to learn the ropes. Spend some time poking around on the 
Dashboard, and refer to this chapter as needed to help find your way around. 
In no time at all, you’ll be navigating with ease!

In This Chapter
▶ Determining your blog’s settings
▶ Understanding your design choices
▶ Finding out who’s visiting you and why
▶ Managing what you’ve already written
▶ Setting up your comment structure
B
efore you start writing posts, you need to set up your blog and make it 
as user-friendly (to you and your readers) as possible. Understanding 
and establishing your blog’s basic settings on the front end saves you many 
headaches on the back end! In Chapter 4, we show you how to navigate your 
TypePad Dashboard using the green account-level bar. When you click the 
name of the blog you want to work on (from the Blogs link in your green 
account-level bar or the Dashboard’s right sidebar), you see a blue blog-level 
navigation bar. In this chapter, we focus on the blue blog-level bar to get your 
blog set up and ready to share with the world.
Just as Chapter 4 gives you a road map of your green account-level bar, this 
chapter gives you a road map of your blue blog-level bar, explaining the 
purpose and function of every link and button. Some of these blog-level ele-
ments, we explain in full detail; still others contain enough features to require 
further explanation later in the book. But by the end of this chapter, you’ll 
have a working knowledge of the blog-level bar, and you’ll be ready to jump 
into writing posts in Chapter 6.
While you’re still in the blog setup stage, use the steps in this chapter to set 
your blog’s publicity options, configure your post and page options, set up 
your comment preferences, and ensure that your RSS feed is readily available 
to your readers. After you do that, we introduce you to the design options 
(though we cover them in more detail in Chapter 11) and show you how to 
check your stats (you want to know who’s reading you, right?). We also tell 

76
Part II: Getting Started with TypePad 
you how to invite additional authors to contribute to your blog and how to 
import or export your blog if necessary. Those are a lot of decisions to make, 
but this chapter gives the basics you need to plan wisely.
 
Depending on which TypePad account you have, some of the items discussed 
in this chapter and others may not be part of your account.
Choosing Your Basic Blog Settings
Taking the time to choose your blog settings saves you hassle later: You’ll 
know that search engines are finding your posts, your RSS feed is working 
and available, and your readers are able to comment. To establish your set-
tings, you’ll need to be signed in and looking at the blog-level bar:
 
1. Type www.typepad.com/dashboard in the browser’s address bar 
and press Enter.
 
2.  Sign in if necessary.
 
3. Click your blog’s name in the Dashboard’s right sidebar.
 
 A page that looks similar to Figure 5-1 appears.
 
4. Click the tab that says Settings. It’s the very last tab.
 
 You see a page that looks similar to Figure 5-2.

Figure 5-2: 
The Settings 
tab.
 
You already established some of the necessary information for your blog’s 
settings when you created your TypePad account and built your profile. 
That information is already filled in on the Settings tab. On the left side of the 
Settings page is a list of links to settings options. Those links are
 
✓ Basics
 
✓ SEO
 
✓ Sharing
 
✓ Stats
 
✓ Feeds
 
✓ Posts & Pages
 
✓ Categories
 
✓ Comments
 
✓ Authors
 
✓ Post by Email
 
✓ Import/Export
Let’s work our way down that list of links, discussing each one in detail. After 
you’ve had your TypePad blog up and running a while, you may decide you 
want to edit some of these settings. Don’t worry — you can come back and 
make changes any time.

78
Part II: Getting Started with TypePad 
Basics tab
The fields in the Basics tab are already populated with information you 
shared with TypePad when you set up your account.
SEO tab
The SEO tab deals with search engine optimization (SEO) — setting up your blog 
so search engines (such as Google and Yahoo!) can find and index your content. 
After the search engines do that, they rank your content based on its relevance 
to a topic. The more relevance your blog has to a topic, the higher your rank and, 
subsequently, the higher your blog appears on the search results page. If you 
want your blog to rank well, pay special attention to your blog’s SEO settings. If 
you’d like to find out a little more about how search engines work, read Chapter 1.
Publicity: If you’re interested in allowing anyone and everyone to find your blog 
using a search engine, click to select the Yes, Publicize This Blog option. If you 
allow your blog to be public, TypePad sends your newly updated blog out to 
search engines and blog indexes. If you don’t select this option, TypePad and 
search engines assume you’d like to keep your blog private and won’t help you 
promote your content publicly (though the content is still available to readers).
 
Keep in mind that if you don’t choose to publicize your blog, you won’t be 
able to sync your blog with your Facebook, Twitter, or other social media 
accounts — a feature we discuss in Chapter 10.
Google Sitemap: If you want Google to find and index your blog, you need 
to have a Google Sitemap. A Google Sitemap helps TypePad alert Google 
each time you create new content. When Google receives notification that 
you’ve updated your blog, it sends out search spiders to come and crawl 
through your blog. That’s not as creepy as it sounds; it simply means Google 
(and Yahoo!, Ask, Bing, and other search engines) is gathering the relevant 
information it needs to answer search queries. TypePad generates a Google 
Sitemap for you if you click to select this option.
Title Format: This title is not referring to your blog’s name. Rather, it’s refer-
ring to the text that appears at the top of your blog page in your browser’s 
title bar. Figure 5-3 shows the location of the title bar. Most bloggers choose 
to have the name of the post and the name of the blog included in the title 
bar. TypePad allows you to choose how those two names are displayed. Use 
the pull-down menu to select the option you like best.
 
Putting the post title first, followed by the blog name, makes for stronger SEO.

79
 Chapter 5: Creating Your First Blog
 
Figure 5-3: 
Your blog’s 
title bar.
 
 
Meta Keywords: Meta keywords are keywords that don’t appear on your blog 
but are coded into your blog’s template (in the <head> tag of your template; 
don’t worry, TypePad takes care of it for you). The meta keywords are invis-
ible to everyone but search engines (unless someone opens your coded tem-
plate; then they’re visible). In the past, search engines used meta keywords to 
help categorize a blog and determine if it was relevant to a particular search. 
Now, though, most search engines don’t use meta keywords in their algo-
rithms, and using meta keywords in your own blog isn’t necessary. Google 
and Microsoft Live Search ignore them completely. However, if you choose to 
use this function, use keywords that are relevant to your blog and what you’re 
writing about. It’s not wise to include words that are irrelevant to your blog’s 
purpose just to try to garner more search engine hits for your content (you 
won’t). The search engines are wise to this and penalize your blog by giving 
you lower rankings or blacklisting you completely.
Meta Description: Whereas meta keywords are basically irrelevant to your 
blog’s SEO, your meta description is not. Your meta description is located in 
the <head> tag of your template (TypePad takes care of the coding so you 
don’t have to) and is used by search engines to describe your blog when it’s 
listed on a search results page. However, not all search engines use your 
meta description. Instead, they pull a description of your blog from the copy 
of the blog post listed in the search results. If you choose to write a meta 

80
Part II: Getting Started with TypePad 
description for your blog, make it a concise description of your blog’s intent. 
Here are two examples:
Not so great: Camaro Crusade
Better: The story of how I’m restoring a 1967 Camaro to its former mus-
cle-car glory so I can drive it along Route 66
The latter example is more descriptive and includes keywords people are 
likely to search for (such as 1967 Camaro, Route 66, restoring 1967 Camaro, 
and 1967 muscle car). If a search engine uses your meta description at all, the 
second example will have more weight in determining your search ranking.
Sharing tab
Chapter 4 explains how to link other social media accounts to your TypePad 
Profile. Now we explain how to link your other social media accounts with 
your blog. Social media is so prevalent these days, everyone seems to have 
accounts with Facebook, Twitter, FriendFeed, LinkedIn, and so on. Sometimes 
it makes sense to share information among accounts. You may have differ-
ent audiences with different accounts (for example, you might have personal 
friends on Facebook and business peers on Twitter), and those audiences 
may be different still from your RSS subscribers. By linking your blog to these 
different accounts, you may be reaching several audiences without much 
effort on your part. Be careful, though: You don’t want to inundate your 
friends with multiple links to the same thing. If your audiences overlap sig-
nificantly (for example, you’re mostly friends with the same people at Twitter 
and Facebook), it may not be necessary to post your link in both places.
Share Your Posts with Friends on Other Social Networks: If you’ve set up 
social media accounts and linked them with TypePad already (as we show 
you how to do in Chapter 4), just click to select the accounts you’d like to 
link with your blog. As you update your blog, TypePad automatically sends 
a link to your latest post to those social media accounts. If you want to 
configure more social media accounts for sharing, just click the Configure 
More Accounts link, which takes you to the Other Accounts section of your 
Account page. Here, you can add more accounts (Chapter 4 tells you how to 
do that if you’re not sure).
Share This Blog on Your TypePad Profile: When you click to select this 
option, you’re agreeing that TypePad can share your blog throughout its site. 
Most notably, your blog is included in the Recent Activity list on your Profile. 
If you have multiple blogs on your TypePad account, you can choose which 
ones are listed on your Profile.

81
 Chapter 5: Creating Your First Blog
Let Your Readers Share Their Comments: If a reader is signed in to his 
TypePad account when he comments on your blog post, his comments and a 
link to your blog appear on his TypePad Profile.
Stats tab
When you click the Stats tab, the Stats page appears and asks for your Google 
Analytics UA Number. If you’re using Google Analytics, your UA number is your 
User Account number. See Appendix B for a full explanation of third-party statis-
tics tracking software and how to integrate those options with your TypePad blog.
Feeds tab
Moving down the menu, you see the Feeds tab next. Chapter 1 explains what 
an RSS feed is and the benefits of offering one to your blog’s readers. All blog-
ging platforms offer a default RSS feed. Following are your default TypePad 
RSS feeds (replace the necessary information with your own):
 
✓ Atom: http://blogname.typepad.com/folder_name/atom.xml
 
✓ RSS 1.0: http://blogname.typepad.com/folder_name/index.rdf
 
✓ RSS 2.0: http://blogname.typepad.com/folder_name/rss.xml
These days, most people expect to see an RSS button to subscribe to your feed. 
The official symbol of an RSS feed is the button to the right of Subscribe in the 
top-right corner of Figure 5-4. That figure shows how the symbol might look in a 
blog’s actual sidebar. Usually, but not always, the button is orange. By default, 
TypePad has a small orange RSS button or a text link or both in your blog side-
bar that says Subscribe to This Blog’s Feed. If you’d like to customize that default 
RSS link (such as a larger RSS button), flip to Chapters 8 and 11, where we show 
you how to include customized images and links on the sidebar via a TypeList.
 
You can find variations of this button by doing a Web search for RSS button.
Published Feeds: This is where you can decide whether you want to offer your 
readers the ability to subscribe to posts only, comments only, or both. At a 
minimum, you should click to select Blog Posts so your readers can include 
your RSS feed in their feed reader. It’s a good idea to offer readers the option 
of subscribing to comments on individual posts or pages as well. Sometimes 
a reader will leave a comment and may want to stay informed about how the 
discussion is progressing. By subscribing to the comments, readers are alerted 
via their feed readers when a new comment is posted to that same article.

82
Part II: Getting Started with TypePad 
 
Figure 5-4:

RSS feed 
button.
 
Feed Content: You have the option of publishing full or partial feeds. This 
means that when a feed reader shows your new content, it either shows the 
entire article within the reader or only a teaser of the article (which forces 
the reader to click over to your blog if he’d like to read the rest of the arti-
cle). There are pros and cons to each option. If you have advertisements on 
your blog or are hoping for more traffic to your blog, you might prefer a par-
tial feed because it provides only a teaser of the article and asks the reader 
to click over for more. However, many readers prefer to read all their articles 
within their feed readers without clicking to individual blogs. More than a few 
readers have unsubscribed to blogs that offer only partial feeds. Their argu-
ment is that if your content is compelling, they will click over to your blog to 
leave a comment or join in the discussion. In general, readers have little time 
for clicking around and prefer to read full articles within their feed readers.
Connect to FeedBurner: This is optional. TypePad automatically supplies 
an RSS feed for each blog you establish. You can use one of TypePad’s 
feeds, or you can use FeedBurner — a widely used, Google-owned tool for 
helping bloggers burn (or issue) an RSS feed. After you burn a feed through 
FeedBurner, you have access to numerous helpful features such as statistics 
and e-mail alerts (see more on this in Appendix B).
You can use FeedBurner by visiting www.feedburner.com, setting up an 
account, and following the helpful wizard to burn a feed for your blog (for 
example, http://feeds.feedburner.com/TypePadForDummies instead 

83
 Chapter 5: Creating Your First Blog
of the default feed that TypePad supplies). Once you’ve burned the feed, 
connect it to your TypePad blog by clicking the Connect to FeedBurner 
button on the Feeds page in your blog’s Dashboard. For an alternative to 
FeedBurner, visit www.feedblitz.com.
Posts tab
The options in the Posts tab are the ones that make your blogging go 
smoothly. Your decisions here determine how your readers navigate your 
blog and how your posts are presented and saved. Don’t worry; everything 
here is editable if you change your mind. Play around with your options to 
figure out what works best for you and your readers.
Default Publishing Status: When you write your blog posts, you have the 
option of publishing the post immediately, saving it as a draft, or setting a 
future date and time to publish the post (see Chapter 6). If you know that you 
usually write a post and publish it immediately, click to select the Publish 
Now option; if you know that you usually write a post and save it for later, 
click to select the Draft option.
 
It’s a smart safeguard to set your default publishing status to draft, because it 
keeps you from inadvertently posting something that wasn’t quite ready for 
public consumption.
Posts to Display: Your choices here determine how many posts appear on 
your blog at a given time. You have the option of choosing to display a specific 
number of posts or days on your blog’s home page (the page your readers see 
when they first visit your blog). Most people choose to show posts. When some-
one visits your blog, they expect to see several posts listed on your page. The 
number you choose to display affects how long your page is. In general, visitors 
don’t like to scroll and scroll and scroll. If you write short to medium-size posts, 
you might want to include up to ten posts on your main page. If your posts are 
fairly long, though, consider cutting that number to five or fewer.
Your archive pages list blog posts that you’ve already published. You can 
choose to list more posts on the archive pages because they are not the main 
page of your blog and won’t be cluttering up your blog’s home page. It’s fine 
to display ten posts on an archive page.
Navigation Links: When a reader is reading an individual blog post (not just 
those on your blog’s home page), TypePad provides navigation at the bottom 
of the post so the reader can move to the previous or next post easily. 
TypePad’s default navigation link words are Previous and Next. If you’d like 
to customize a navigation link word, click inside the text box, select and 
delete the word you want to change, and type the new word(s).

84
Part II: Getting Started with TypePad 
Post Date Format: Including a date on your posts helps your readers deter-
mine the content’s freshness. Depending on your niche, it may be important to 
know when you published the original content. For example, if you’re writing 
about technology, and someone visits your blog looking for information about 
whether or not to use meta keywords, they’ll need to know how old the post 
is. If you’re writing about your family, dating posts is also helpful if you ever 
decide to make your blog into a book or print entries in chronological order. 
Use the pull-down menu to choose how the date displays for each blog post.
Post Time Format: Each blog post you publish has a timestamp. Use the pull-
down menu to choose either standard or military (24-hour-format) time.
Front Page: Your blog’s front page (or home page, as some call it) can either 
display your most recent posts (usually in reverse chronological order) or 
show a page (we explain the difference between posts and pages in Chapter 6). 
If you choose to have a page as your home page, it will most likely be static 
(unless you plan on updating it at regular intervals). If your front page dis-
plays your most recent posts, it will be more dynamic.
 
Readers tend to prefer the dynamic format and expect a list of blog posts 
when they visit your blog; for this reason, we strongly recommend that you 
choose to display your most recent posts. At any rate, remember that many 
times readers find you through links from other sites or a search, in which 
case they might never even see your front page!
Order of Posts: Most bloggers list their blog posts in reverse chronological 
order (in other words, the newest post is at the top). Readers are accus-
tomed to reading blogs this way and appreciate it because the newest con-
tent is always on top and they don’t have to search for it. You do have the 
option of listing your posts in chronological order, though, and that may 
work for your blog. Click to select Newest First or Oldest First, depending on 
your preference, but again, keep in mind that choosing Oldest First will likely 
confuse the average blog reader.
Limit Recent Posts: Recent Posts is a sidebar module you can add to your 
blog design (we discuss blog design in Chapter 11). This module lists, obvi-
ously, your most recently written posts. However, you have a bit of control 
over what’s listed here. You can choose to include only posts within a spe-
cific category (we talk about those in a minute) or every post that comes 
through. Use the pull-down menu to choose whether you’d like to include all 
posts in your Recent Posts module, only a specific category, or multiple cat-
egories. If you choose Multiple Categories, a window with a list of your cat-
egories pops up. Press the Control key (PC) or the Command key (Mac) while 
you click to make multiple category selections.
Post Display Language: The default language for your blog is English United 
States. You can change the display language of your blog by simply clicking 
inside the text box and choosing the relevant language from the menu. Note 

85
 Chapter 5: Creating Your First Blog
that this option changes the supporting elements of the post (such as month 
names and archive headers), not the language of the posts.
Auto-Generated Excerpt Length: When you write a blog post, you can also 
write a short excerpt, or description, of the post (see Chapter 6 to find out 
how). Search engines use this excerpt to determine whether your post is rel-
evant to a query; feed readers use the excerpt to send a short teaser of the 
post via RSS (if you chose partial feeds in the Feeds tab earlier). If you do not 
write a customized excerpt for each post, TypePad generates one for you by 
using the first 100 words of the post. Click inside the text box and change the 
number of words if you’re not happy with 100.
Categories tab
Like most other blogging platforms, TypePad allows you to group, or orga-
nize, posts into one or more categories. Chapter 6 explains how to label a 
post with one or more categories, but here in the Settings tab is where you 
manage those categories. Using categories and including links to them is a 
helpful navigational feature for your readers, who can use them to see what 
else you might have said on a particular topic. If you choose to use this fea-
ture (and we strongly recommend that you do), each time you write a post, 
you’ll assign that post to one more of your categories. For example, if you 
write a post about a trip to Dallas in which you saw the Dallas Cowboys play, 
you might categorize that post under both Sports and Travel.
TypePad automatically offers several categories, which are listed in the 
Categories tab. Look through these and see if they’re sufficient for you; if 
they’re not, you can easily add more of your own. To change an existing cat-
egory, simply click Edit to the right of the current category. Type the new 
category you’d like to have appear in its place. If you want to delete a current 
category altogether, just click the Delete button on the same line.
If you need more categories than the ones listed (and you probably will), 
type the name of the new category in the text box entitled Add a New 
Category, and then click Add. The category appears alphabetically in the list. 
TypePad allows you to create an unlimited number of categories. And you 
don’t have to make a decision right now about every category you expect 
to need in your blogging career; you can revisit this same tab to add and 
rename categories as you go.
When it comes to naming categories, you can be as straightforward or as 
creative as you want. Some bloggers rely so heavily on categories as a good 
navigational tool that they keep categories as concise as possible (for exam-
ple, Recipes, Home Improvement, Recycling, Travel). Still other bloggers see 
categories as a chance to inject some cleverness and name them in ways 
that aren’t as direct (for example, I Am Addicted to Libraries, Sometimes I 

86
Part II: Getting Started with TypePad 
Do Stupid Stuff, I Think My Computer Hates Me). Either option is fine, but be 
aware that the latter option may not be quite as obvious to your readers.
The categories you create in the Settings tab appear in your Rich Text editor 
when you sit down to blog. In Chapter 6, we explain the specifics of writing 
and publishing posts, and we show you how to apply one or more categories 
to what you write.
Comments tab
The Comments tab is a tiny one with a big purpose: the presentation and 
management of your comments. As you probably know, comments are the 
lifeblood of the blogger/reader relationship. Understanding how to set up 
and manage comments effectively helps your blogging experience run more 
smoothly. This topic is such a big one, we devote an entire chapter (Chapter 
7) to it. For now, because you’re in the setup stage, keep TypePad’s default 
comment settings. We revisit this important tab thoroughly in Chapter 7.
Authors tab
As you continue to work your way through the Settings tab, you’ll see that 
the next link is called Authors, and this is where you can invite additional 
authors to guest-post on your blog.
 
It’s important to note that you see the Authors link only if you have the Pro 
Unlimited or Business Class level of TypePad.
Many bloggers enjoy inviting other people to write guest posts on their blog. 
It’s a great way to introduce your readers to a new and interesting blogger, 
and it’s a convenient feature if you’re traveling or otherwise away from your 
blog for an extended period of time but don’t want to stop offering your read-
ers good content.
 
If you’re interested in having a guest blogger post only once, it would probably 
be more convenient and reasonable for her to e-mail you her post. You can then 
cut and paste it into your Compose editor (see Chapter 6), and your guest blog-
ger doesn’t have to mess with signing in to your TypePad account. If you want 
the other blogger to post with some degree of frequency, however, you can give 
the person limited access to your account as a guest or junior author.
When you click the Authors tab, you see your own name listed as the blog’s 
owner. This means you are the only one authorized to make fundamental, 

87
 Chapter 5: Creating Your First Blog
account-level changes to your blog. (Business Class members are actually 
able to invite additional owners, but most TypePad users are limited to invit-
ing guest authors or junior authors only.) You will notice you can choose to 
invite a guest author or a junior author. A guest author has the most freedom 
of the two: he or she can save and write posts and can publish his or her 
own posts without waiting for your approval. That’s a significant amount of 
freedom, so issue a guest-author invitation only to someone whose blogging 
standards you trust. A junior author, on the other hand, cannot publish posts 
without your approval, giving you, the owner, final say as to what does and 
doesn’t appear on your blog. The junior author saves a post as a draft, and 
you, the owner, have to approve it for publication.
Neither guest authors nor junior authors have access to other parts of your 
Dashboard beyond creating posts. They won’t be able to see your statistics or 
edit your design, for example. They are authorized to do only their appointed 
tasks and nothing else. You, as the owner, can revoke their access at any time.
To set up additional authors, or to edit the status of existing ones, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Click the Authors tab in the bar on the left side of the Settings tab.
 
 To invite a new author, look for the section titled Invite Additional 
Authors (see Figure 5-5).
 
Figure 5-5: 
The Authors 
page.
 

88
Part II: Getting Started with TypePad 
 
2. Enter the name and e-mail address of the person you want to invite, 
and use the drop-down menu to choose whether you want to invite 
the person as a guest or a junior author.
 
3. (Optional) Use the text box below the name and e-mail address to send 
a personalized message with the invitation.
 
 You can also leave the default message.
 
4.  Click the Send Invitation(s) button.
Your invitee receives an e-mail with a link to accept or decline your invita-
tion. If she doesn’t have a TypePad account, she can easily set one up for free 
(the e-mail tells her how). If she is already a TypePad user, she’ll be able to 
sign in with her current sign-in information. In her own TypePad Dashboard, 
your blog would then appear in the list of blogs to which she can post.
After she accepts the invitation, you see your new author’s name listed 
under your own at the top of the page (refer to Figure 5-5). Revisit this page 
if you need to delete an author from your blog (note that this deletes just the 
author’s posting permission, not the author’s post). Also, you can use the 
pull-down menu next to the author’s name to upgrade a junior author to a 
guest author or to downgrade a guest author to a junior author.
Post by Email tab
Ideas for blog posts can come into your head any time, anywhere. 
Unfortunately, sometimes you want to write and publish a post, but you’re 
nowhere near your own computer. TypePad gives you the flexibility of 
e-mailing your post from any computer or your phone (that is, if your phone 
has e-mailing capability). For more about mobile posting tools (including the 
TypePad iPhone application), see Chapter 15.
Posting Email Address: Posting to your blog via e-mail is a quick way to 
update your blog while you’re on the go. TypePad assigns you a random (and 
boy, do we mean random!) e-mail address. You can check to see yours by 
clicking the Post by Email tab. The TypePad crew suggests that you e-mail 
your super-secret special e-mail address to yourself so you’ll have it in your 
phone address book or contacts and won’t have to memorize it. We think 
that’s a darn good idea, because the e-mail address likely contains about 15 
random numbers and letters.
Reset Address: Just as it’s smart to reset your passwords every once in a 
while, it’s smart to reset your TypePad posting e-mail address. Another good 
time to reset the address? If you think your e-mail address book has been 
compromised. To reset your TypePad posting e-mail address, simply click 
the reset button, and you’re finished. You’ll get a new address automagically.

89
 Chapter 5: Creating Your First Blog
Notifications: If you want to verify that your e-mail post is successfully pub-
lished on your blog, TypePad can notify you when that happens. Just click 
to select Notify Me Via Email When My Email Post Has Been Successfully 
Published.
Import/Export tab
Importing content from an existing blog is a fairly easy process with 
TypePad. Exporting your content for backup purposes or to another platform 
can be tricky, but it’s not so bad (depending on where you’re moving your 
content.). Chapter 13 covers the ins and outs of importing and exporting your 
TypePad content, but this section offers a quick overview of what you can 
expect when you click the Import/Export tab in your blog’s Settings.
Import: If you’re importing content from another blog platform, click to 
select the platform it’s coming from. Depending on the platform you choose, 
you’ll see different choices. Table 5-1 is an overview of what to expect when 
importing from a specific platform.

Managing Your Design
Knowing how to access and edit your blog design is important. The way your 
blog appears on the screen matters to your readers — people tend to click away 
from blogs that aren’t easy on the eyes. The Design tab in the blog-level bar is 
your starting point for managing your current design or applying a new one.

90
Part II: Getting Started with TypePad 
When you click the Design tab, you see several options for managing your 
design. You can choose a theme (another word for TypePad’s basic designs), 
select a layout (the “bone structure” of a blog, determining where sidebars 
and the main content column will go), organize content (click and drag to 
rearrange elements on your blog), and add Custom CSS (see Chapter 14).
The good news is that TypePad makes blog design pretty painless; the inter-
face is intuitive and highly visual. Even then, though, the topic of blog design 
is involved enough that we give it a chapter of its own (see Chapter 11). 
We revisit this Design tab there and explain how you can easily get the look 
you want.
Checking Your Stats in the Overview
One of the perks of writing a blog (as opposed to writing a book or a maga-
zine) is that you have almost immediate access to details about how many 
readers you have and how they found you. These details are referred to 
as statistics (often shortened to stats). It’s undeniably satisfying to see that 
people are stopping by to see the things you post — writers, after all, want 
to have readers! On the other hand, with the real-time measuring stick of 
blog statistics, it can be easy to get hung up on the numbers. Let’s take a 
minute to find out where to find your blog statistics, but let’s keep in mind 
from the start that they are not the ultimate definition of your blogging 
success.
From the blog-level bar, click the Overview tab. This takes you to a page that 
looks similar to the one pictured in Figure 5-6.
Immediately, you’ll see a graph of your pageviews. Every time a reader 
clicks to a new page on your blog, that’s a pageview. If they click around to 
several different spots on your page (for example, through your categories 
or archives), these clicks each count as a separate pageview. Above your 
statistics graph is a light blue bar giving you a quick snapshot of where your 
blog statistics stand right now. From left to right, you see Today’s Pageviews 
(the number of clicks you’ve received since midnight GMT today), Lifetime 
Pageviews (the number of pageviews you’ve received since you started your 
TypePad blog), and Average Pageviews (obviously, a daily average of how 
many pageviews you receive).
Use your statistics graph as a handy visual tool. The default setting for the 
graph shows you your pageview activity for the last 30 days. If you want 
to change that, click the small Edit link just above the graph, and you see 
a drop-down menu with options to view your pageviews in 120-, 90-, 30- or 
7-day increments. Click the one that serves you best.

91
 Chapter 5: Creating Your First Blog
 
Figure 5-6: 
The 
Overview 
page con-
taining your 
blog stats.
 
If you want to know your pageview history beyond 120 days, you have an 
option that sends you much further back. Below the graph is a small link 
that reads Download Pageview Records (.csv). Click that link and save the 
resulting .csv file (which lists your entire pageview history from the day you 
started your TypePad blog to the current day) to your computer. A csv (or 
comma-separated value) file saves data in a table format and can be opened 
in Microsoft Excel (Windows), Numbers (Mac), or a text editor.
Below the statistics graph is a small link to Bit.ly traffic. We define Bit.ly and 
tell you how to use it in Chapter 10.
If you scroll down, below your graph you’ll see a list titled Recent Referrers. This 
tells you where people are clicking from when they click to your blog. The left 
column tells you what time the pageview occurred. The center column shows 
you which page of your blog the visitor entered (remember, visitors won’t always 
enter through your front page). For example, if another blogger links to one of 
your older posts, when a visitor clicks over, he or she will land at the post to 
which the other blogger linked. The third and final column of this list is especially 
important: It shows which outside sites (including their URLs) are sending visitors 
to your blog. Clicking those URLs takes you directly to the page that referred you. 
If the referring URL looks like a search engine (for example, www.google.com/
search), clicking the link usually takes you to the search engine page that shows 
which search terms the reader used when he or she found the link to your blog.

92
Part II: Getting Started with TypePad 
Finding Existing Posts
In the blog-level bar, the Posts tab may be the one you use most often. The 
Posts tab hosts a list of all the posts and pages you’ve created (even those 
saved as drafts or those set to publish in the future). If you haven’t deleted 
the post or page, it’s listed here in reverse chronological order. From this 
list, you can find a post or page and edit it, change its setting (for example, 
change its status from draft to published or delete it), or find out at a glance 
whether it has open comments or is accepting trackbacks. (Wondering what 
a trackback is? See Chapter 7.)
You can filter the listed posts by using the drop-down menu at the top of the 
Posts or Pages page (as shown in Figure 5-7). Filtering your posts or pages 
based on category, author, or status (published, future, or draft) helps you 
quickly and easily find the post you’re looking for. Or, if you’d rather, you can 
click inside the Search box, type a few keywords, and click the Search button.
When you find the post or page you’re looking for in the list of returned posts, 
you can tell at a glance whether the post is accepting comments and trackbacks 
or the publish status (published or draft). Click the title of the post or page to 
edit the contents, change whether the file accepts comments, or change whether 
the file accepts trackbacks. Or, if you just want to change the status or delete the 
post completely, click the pull-down menu to the right of the title.

 Chapter 5: Creating Your First Blog
You can perform bulk actions by clicking to select multiple posts or pages 
and then scrolling to the bottom of the Posts page and clicking the Publish, 
Draft, or Delete button. For example, you can unpublish several posts at a 
time by converting them to draft mode in a bulk action. You can also choose 
other bulk actions from the pull-down menu (as shown in Figure 5-8).
You can do all the following to a single post or page or to multiple posts or 
pages:
 
✓ Add categories
 
✓ Replace categories
 
✓ Open comments
 
✓ Close comments
 
✓ Accept trackbacks
 
✓ Do not accept trackbacks
Bulk actions can be especially helpful if you need to perform the same task 
on multiple files. For instance, if you need to close the comments on five 
different posts, just select those posts, scroll down to the More Actions pull-
down menu (below the list of posts), and choose Close Comments from the 
menu. All finished!

Managing Existing Comments
Continuing to work your way through the tabs on the blog-level bar, you 
see a Comments tab. Click that tab to see a current list of existing comments 
(if you’re just now setting up your blog, you won’t have any. That’s okay! 
After we show you how to write a post in Chapter 6, you’ll be able to receive 
comments).
Be aware that this tab is one place to find a list of your existing comments, 
but once again (are you detecting a theme?), we wait to address the meaty 
issue of comment management and this tab in Chapter 7.
Creating More Than One Blog 
in Your TypePad Account
After you’re comfortable with setting up your first blog, you can host addi-
tional blogs in your TypePad account (unless you are a Micro user). Why 
would you want to host more than one blog? Well, other family members may 
want their own blogs, or you may want to set up a separate blog for a new 
niche. If you have a paid TypePad account, you can set up more than one 
blog on your account. The Pro Plus account allows you to have up to three 
blogs; the Pro Unlimited account allows you to have unlimited blogs on your 
account.
To set up an additional blog on your TypePad account, sign in and go to the 
Dashboard. In the right sidebar under Manage My Blogs, click the Create a 
Blog link. The Add a Blog page appears. You have the choice of creating a 
new TypePad blog or, if you have a blog at another platform, connecting that 
blog to your TypePad account.
To create a new TypePad blog, follow these steps:
 
1. Click to select Create a New TypePad Blog.
 
2. Configure your new TypePad blog as follows:
 
a. Name the blog.
 
b.  Assign a folder for the blog to reside in.
 
c. Choose whether you’d like the blog to be publicized.
 
 This option refers to whether you want the blog to be visible to 
search engines and listed on your Profile page.

95
 Chapter 5: Creating Your First Blog
 
 After you choose your blog name and folder name, you shouldn’t change 
them (if you change your blog name, it’s confusing for your readers; if 
you change your folder name, your links won’t work anymore). Your 
publicity settings, however, can be changed at any time.
 
 If you have a TypePad Pro Plus or Pro Unlimited account, you can assign 
a mapped domain to this blog or any other new blog at any time. See 
Appendix A for instructions.
 
3. Click the Create Blog button.
That’s a lot of decision-making for one chapter! You’ve discovered how to 
read your statistics, create a new blog (should you want to), manage your 
comments, invite other authors, and perform a host of other important tasks 
in the blog-level bar. You understand a little more about the alphabet soup of 
RSS feeds and SEO. Thinking through all your blog settings at the same time 
may seem tedious, but it ultimately serves you well. When you sit down to 
write your first post, you’ll know that you’re publishing it to a blog that’s set 
up to your best standards.

Your Blog Posts
In This Chapter
▶ Writing a blog post
▶ Managing how your post looks
▶ Categorizing your content
▶ Managing and editing existing posts
▶ Differentiating between posts and pages
I
t’s the reason you started a blog in the first place, most likely: You have 
a story to tell, either in words or pictures, and you’d like a place to tell it. 
You’ve signed up for a TypePad account, and you’re beginning to grasp the 
functionalities of the Dashboard. You have your first blog set up just the way 
you want it. Those are all important preliminary steps, but guess what? Now 
it’s time for the fun part: writing a post.
In this chapter, we show you not only how to write a new post in the 
Compose editor, including how you can tweak the font with different colors 
and sizes, but also how to categorize and edit existing posts. We also walk 
you through the simple steps of inserting images into your posts.
Composing Your First Blog Post
At the heart of the TypePad Dashboard is the Compose editor. The Compose 
editor is where you write and edit new posts (and edit older posts).
Finding the Compose editor couldn’t be simpler. On the Dashboard, look 
at your list of blogs (or blog, if you have only one) on the right side of the 
screen. Determine which blog you want to post to, and look to the right of its 
name for the Compose link (see Figure 6-1).

98
Part II: Getting Started with TypePad 
 
Figure 6-1:

Compose 
link next to 
your blog’s 
name.
 
Compose link
Clicking the Compose link takes you directly to the Compose editor, as 
shown in Figure 6-2. We will be referring to this figure often in this chapter.
 
As we mention in Chapter 4, you can also compose posts in the Quick Compose 
section on the front page of the Dashboard. The Quick Compose option may 
be appealing to some bloggers, but it doesn’t offer you full functionality — it 
doesn’t have a field to enter a title, for example, nor can you make many edits to 
your text (such as alignment and color). For the most features and flexibility, we 
recommend that you write your posts in the Compose editor.
The cursor is automatically inserted into the Title field. Naming your post is 
the most obvious place to start, of course, although you don’t have to enter 
anything in this field if you don’t want a title. If you’re writing a post with the 
hopes of being noticed by search engines (and, thus, new readers), remember 
the SEO (search engine optimization) tips we share with you in Chapter 5.
Your title isn’t just a place to put SEO principles in place. If you’re more inter-
ested in the artistic side of blogging versus the SEO side of blogging, you can 
use your post title as a place to be creative and grab a reader’s attention. Use 
a title that makes a reader want to jump into reading the post you’ve writ-
ten. “A Bad Day at the Office” doesn’t have as much zing as “My Ridiculously 
Horrible Encounter with a Fax Machine.”

particular post (see an example in Figure 6-3).

 Permalink bar
A permalink is the URL for a specific post (for example, http://typepad
fordummies.typepad.com/post_title.html) as opposed to the main 
URL for the front page of your blog (for example, http://typepadfor
dummies.typepad.com). If you (or any other bloggers) want to link to a par-
ticular post (whether on your blog or another’s), the permalink is what you 
use to point readers to that post. TypePad automatically sets your permalink 
to reflect the post title (or, if you don’t use a title, the first sentence of your 
post). If you don’t like the default permalink, you can change it by clicking 
the blue Edit button.

Tackling writer’s block
When you start your blog, you will likely find 
that you have many things you’d like to share 
with your readers. In fact, you may have so 
many things to write about that you find you’re 
writing several posts in one sitting! Our advice 
is to harness that energy and write away. But 
instead of publishing those posts immediately, 
think about them, edit them, and then set them 
to post at a future date. Why? Because there 
will come a day when you won’t have a thing to 
write about, and you’ll appreciate having those 
posts in your queue ready to go.
When you’re stumped for a post topic, poke 
around in your memory. You probably have a 
great story to tell about how your third-grade 
teacher inspired your love of history, or how 
your first business failed miserably, or how your 
gramps taught you to ride a horse.
And look around at your everyday life for ideas. 
Are you struggling with some health insurance 
difficulties? Compile a list of resources around 
the Web, and share them with your readers. 
Do you like the way the afternoon sun hits your 
kitchen? Find a poetic way to describe it. Your 
blog can be fertile ground for refining your writ-
ing skill — a built-in critique group, if you will.
Try to resist the urge to write a post about the 
fact that you don’t have anything to write about. 
Some people pull off a post like with great hilar-
ity, but most don’t. Dig around for a worthwhile 
topic, or say nothing at all.
Which brings us to an important point: A blog-
ging break can work wonders. The immediacy 
of the blogosphere can feel frantic at times, and 
that may throw water on your creative fires. It’s 
true that writing with regularity helps build an 
audience and helps you hone your skills, but a 
well-timed season of rest may be just what you 
need. Take off a few days, a week, or even a 
month or more, and you may find that you come 
back invigorated to write like never before.
When writer’s block does hit, here are a few 
blogs to visit that help you find your groove again:
 ✓ ProBlogger (problogger.net): Darren 
Rowse is one of the biggest names in blog-
ging, and he’s earned that title. He pro-
duces usable content every day (whether 
by him or a guest author). We suggest 
checking out his 31 Days to Building a 
Better Blog course, which gives you not 
only writing assignments, but also ideas to 
take your blog to the next level (garnering 
more traffic, implementing advertising, and 
becoming a more vocal part of your blog-
ging community). This course is available 
as a workbook, but you can also find the 
lessons on his site if you do a search for 
the course name.
 ✓ Confident Writing (confidentwriting.
com): With a tagline like “Power up your 
words and find your writing voice,” how 
you can you go wrong? Joanna Young is a 
go-to gal for inspired writing. She can help 
you tighten things up, flesh things out, and 
generally improve your writing. She offers 
new writing tips and ideas several times a 
week and frequently offers a writing series 
on her blog that encourage your participa-
tion. These series will definitely give you 
writing fodder and food for thought.
 ✓ Question Of the Day: In Chapter 4, we show 
you the TypePad Question of the Day box in 
the Dashboard. Not only does this offer an 
excellent new writing prompt each day, but 
it’s also an easy way to jump feet first into 
the TypePad community.

101
 Chapter 6: Writing and Editing Your Blog Posts
 
You can change a permalink at any time, though it’s not advisable to do so 
after the post is published. Why? If you change the permalink after an article is 
published, any incoming links to the previous permalink are broken.
Moving further down the screen, you’ll see a large white space titled Body, 
and this is where you write your post. Click inside this text box and start 
writing. Vast, empty white space can be overwhelming to any writer, regard-
less of your experience, but don’t be afraid to jump in anyway. See the 
“Tackling writer’s block” sidebar in this chapter for some encouragement.
TypePad is set up so that you are automatically posting in Rich Text (this is 
the same thing as the WYSIWYG editor we describe in Chapter 1). As long as 
you’re writing in Rich Text, your text appears in your published post just 
as it appears here, in the Compose editor (think of it as a word processor). 
This is by far the clearest, simplest way to write a post, but if HTML is your 
thing, you can write your post using the HTML editor instead. To do this, just 
click the HTML tab in the top-right corner of the Body section, as shown in 
Figure 6-4.
If you’re a blogging newbie who would like to begin to learn the nuts and 
bolts of HTML coding, try this: Click the HTML tab in your completed posts, 
and notice how the post is marked with HTML. You’ll soon find intuitive 
codes and start to see how they work. For example, <p> is the HTML code 
that starts a new paragraph, and </p> is the code that ends a paragraph. As 
you probably know, computers don’t just know how to do things; you have 
to tell them. That’s what HTML does: It tells the browser how to read and dis-
play the posts you write.
 
You can find HTML tutorials online. It’s worth knowing even a little HTML so 
you can have more control over how your posts are displayed or so you can 
troubleshoot any small issues that may arise (like why your image isn’t cen-
tered). The HTML editor is a great place to start learning the basics.
 ✓ NaBloPoMo (www.nablopomo.com): 
NaBloPoMo, which stands for National 
Blog Posting Month, is a monthly challenge 
that encourages participants to post a 
new article on their blog daily. Each month 
has a theme, but blogging to the theme is 
optional. The important thing is developing 
the habit of writing consistently so writ-
er’s block has a harder time setting in. 
NaBloPoMo offers groups, forums, and 
even prizes to help you get involved. If 
you need to bounce ideas off others, don’t 
be shy — head to the forums or join one of 
the groups.

Formatting Your Text
As you write your blog posts, there are times when you want to make a word 
or phrase stand out. TypePad’s editor makes this very easy to do by allowing 
you to simply highlight a word or phrase and click a toolbar button to change 
the font, weight, or color of the highlighted word(s).
In the Rich Text tab, you’ll see a variety of buttons; Table 6-1 explains the func-
tion of each one. Feel free to write a test post and start playing around with 
how those buttons work. Highlight a word and change its font or color; make it 
bold or underlined. You can also format your paragraphs so that they are bul-
leted lists, indented as blockquotes, or aligned to the right instead of the left.

How to write a great blog post
Consultants make big bucks helping bloggers 
implement strategies for SEO and community 
management. Those are both important parts 
of growing a blog, but ultimately, a good blog 
comes down to one thing: good content. All the 
gimmicks in the world won’t help a blog gain 
footing if the writing is tired or uninteresting, the 
grammar is poor, or there’s no clear purpose.
You may have started a blog purely for your 
own enjoyment, with no intention of growing a 
readership. That is a perfectly valid reason to 
blog. But if your aim is to produce blog content 
that draws in new readers, consider the follow-
ing as you sit down to write your post:
 ✓ Good form matters. Grammar, punctua-
tion, and spelling aren’t meant to be stuffy 
(your impressions from sixth grade notwith-
standing). Instead, these tools are markers 
to make it easier for our eyes and brain to 
navigate our language. Especially when 
publishing on a computer screen (which 
is harder on the eyes than ink-and-paper 
format), using good grammar, punctuation, 
and spelling makes it that much easier for 
your readers to understand you. A blog-
ger who consistently refuses to use capi-
talization, for example, or one who makes 
repeated, glaring spelling errors may push 
away readers who don’t want to have to 
work so hard to interpret posts. Don’t worry 
about being perfect (we all make mistakes), 
but try to edit yourself and apply some rea-
sonable style standards.
 ✓ Have a clear beginning, middle, and end. 
Some bloggers can successfully write ram-
bling lists about what they did today and 
still manage to be entertaining. That’s hard 
to pull off, though. Most of us benefit from 
sticking to a more structured, essay-style 
format in blog posts, using a clear begin-
ning, middle, and end. In other words, tell 
a story. For example, instead of a bulleted 
list that describes every single errand you 
ran last Saturday afternoon, write about 
the funny conversation you had with the 
89-year-old woman at the computer store.
 ✓ Be concise. There’s an old rule of thumb 
among writing teachers that you shouldn’t 
use ten words when five will suffice. This 
is especially true in blogging; a computer 
screen full of long, wordy posts may make 
a reader’s eyes glaze over. People gener-
ally visit blogs expecting shorter, bite-size 
stories and information, so write with that in 
mind. Be particularly sure, as a courtesy to 
your readers’ eyes, that you use brief para-
graphs, with a double-spaced line between 
them.
 ✓ Use good wording. The best way to 
encourage your own brevity is to choose 
words that pack a punch. Tighten your 
posts by striking as many be verbs as you 
can, replacing them with more descriptive 
verbs (“I was cold” isn’t as interesting as 
“I shivered in the December air”). Keep a 
thesaurus at your computer desk. You may 
surprise yourself: By holding yourself to 
high standards in your word choices, you 
may discover a love for writing you didn’t 
know you had!
 ✓ It’s not about you. Well, technically, it is 
about you, especially if you’re writing a per-
sonal blog. But it’s about your readers too, 
and the best way to gain more of them is to 
write with them in mind. Depending on the 
type of blog you write, your purpose may 
vary from the bloggers around you, but you 
can still be mindful of offering something to 
your readers. You can entertain, encourage, 
challenge, instruct, and much more. Are 
you writing about the minutia of your daily 
life? Make it funny. Are you ranting about

Inserting Extras into Your Blog Posts
As you write your blog posts, you’ll no doubt discover that links, images, and 
sometimes files (for example, PDFs) will enhance your message or be useful 
to your readers. Inserting links, images, and files into your posts couldn’t be 
easier with TypePad’s editor, and we explain how to do it. We also provide 
instructions for inserting files using File Manager. The latter takes a little 
more effort, but we think it’s worthwhile in the long run.
Inserting links using the 
Compose editor toolbar
Linking to other bloggers and sites is an important part of participating in 
the online community. Any time you want to share a link to a post (whether 
one of your own or from another site), a file, another blog, or somehow move 
your reader to another place (for example, to Amazon.com so they can see a 
product you’re discussing), you need to use a link. TypePad makes inserting 
links into your post a breeze:
 
1. Use the cursor to highlight the word(s) you want to use as your link.
 
 See our advice on choosing link words in Chapter 1.
 
2. Click the Link button on the Compose toolbar.
 
 The Link button looks like a piece of chain link.
 
3. Type the URL of your link in the Link URL text box.
 
 As a shortcut, open the page you’re linking to in another browser 
window or tab. Then you can copy (Ctrl+C for the PC; Command+C for 
the Mac) the URL from that window’s browser and paste it (Ctrl+V for 
the PC; Command+V for the Mac) into the Link URL text box.
the state of the U.S. tax code? Give your 
readers information, or call them to action. 
Be a blogger who readers can count on to 
provide something of value — however 
small — each time they visit you.
 ✓ Engage your readers in the conversation. 
Remember that blogging (unlike, for exam-
ple, book writing) is an immediate, real-time 
dialogue. At least occasionally, consider 
bringing your readers directly into your posts 
by asking for their opinion. For example, if 
you write a post about your best principles 
for leading an organization effectively, con-
sider ending with a question: “What leader-
ship principles have best worked for you?” 
This concrete invitation for dialogue draws 
your readers in and lets them know that their 
opinion matters. You may find that some of 
the best content on your blog occasionally 
appears in the comments section!

106
Part II: Getting Started with TypePad 
 
4. Click to select Open in a new window.
 
 When you insert a link into your post, you have the option of opening 
that link in a new browser window or tab when a reader clicks it. We like 
to choose this option because, although it opens a new browser tab for 
the link, it keeps the current browser tab open to your site.
 
5. (Optional) Type a brief description of your link, if you like.
 
 If you choose to include a link description, it does not appear in your 
article text. Instead, the description appears when a reader’s cursor 
hovers over the link.
 
6. Click OK.
 
Linking generously to great posts by other bloggers is not only acceptable, but 
also encouraged. It builds goodwill with your blogging peers and benefits your 
readers by pointing them toward excellent content you’ve found elsewhere. 
It is extremely important to remember, however, that you should never cut 
and paste an entire post from another blogger on your blog. It is rude and 
illegal — it’s a violation of copyright law. You can paste, at the very most, a 
few sentences of their post on your blog, but you must always be sure you 
make it clear that the words are someone else’s, not your own. Any time you 
quote from someone else’s post, link directly back to their blog, or (even 
better) directly to that particular post. For more on the topic of online copy-
right issues, visit Plagiarism Today (www.plagiarismtoday.com).
Inserting images using the 
Compose editor toolbar
Images add interest and depth to a post, underscoring your ideas with a 
visual punch. Also, remember that online reading is harder on the eyes than 
print reading. Using images to break up the text of your post offers readers’ 
eyes a brief moment of rest.
To insert an image into a post, follow these instructions:
 
1. Click inside the Body text box.
 
 If you’ve already written your post and know where you want to place 
your image, click to put the cursor where you want the image to appear.
 
2. Click the Insert Image button.
 
 (The button is on the Compose toolbar and looks like a picture.) An 
Insert Image pop-up box appears.

107
 Chapter 6: Writing and Editing Your Blog Posts
 
3. Get your image using one of these methods:
 
• Click the Browse button to search through your files for the image 
you’d like to use in your post.
 
• Insert the image’s URL, if you’re using one from the Web.
 
 If you plan to insert a thumbnail gallery of multiple images, go ahead and 
choose all of them now.
 
4. Click the Edit link in the Default box (listed under your images) to 
choose the image size and alignment.
 
 The pop-up window expands to give you these options:
 
• Choose whether to display one image or a thumbnail gallery of sev-
eral images.
 
• Use the drop-down arrow to choose how large the image is dis-
played within your post (image size).
 
• Choose whether the post’s text wraps around the image.
 
• Choose whether the image links to the original (possibly larger) 
version when a reader clicks the image.
 
• If you want, save these settings as your default image settings, by 
checking the appropriate box.
 
 The next time you insert an image, you can just click to select 
Default, and TypePad automatically applies those settings.
 
5. Click the Insert Image button.
 
 You see your image(s) in your post.
 
It’s mighty tempting to find a picture or image online and use it in your post. 
Unfortunately, unless that image is royalty-free (and it will be tagged as such 
at a reputable site), it’s a violation of copyright law for you to download it 
and use it without permission from the owner or artist. For more information 
about copyright, go to www.copyright.gov/help/faq. We explain how to 
find usable images on Flickr.com in Chapter 10.
Inserting documents using the 
Compose editor toolbar
Occasionally, you may want to offer your readers access to a document file 
(such as .pdf or .doc) that you’ve created on your computer. For example, 
if you’re writing a post about creating a budget for a small business, you may 
want to offer a link to a sample budget in Microsoft Excel.

108
Part II: Getting Started with TypePad 
To include a download link for a document, follow these instructions:
 
1. Click inside the Body text box where you’d like the link to appear.
 
2. Click the Insert File button on the Compose toolbar (the button looks 
like a document with a green arrow).
 
 A pop-up window appears.
 
3. Click the Browse button, and find the document you’d like to link to.
 
4. Click the Upload File button.
 
 A new link appears in your post that says Download [name of 
document] (where name of document is the name of the document 
you’re linking to).
 
Name the document you’re using something descriptive that references its 
contents, because TypePad uses the name of the document in the link it 
creates. For example, name your document that describes the differences 
among dog breeds dog_breeds.doc instead of dogs.doc; a link that 
says Download a list of dog breeds is better than a link that says 
Download dogs.
Inserting files using File Manager
Any time you insert a file using the TypePad Compose editor toolbar (as 
shown in Figure 6-2), TypePad stores those files rather arbitrarily. For exam-
ple, if you upload an image to your post via the Compose editor toolbar, that 
image is located at a URL similar to this one:
http://typepadfordummies.typepad.com/.a/6a0115706537f9970c0120a56a4254970b-500wi
Unfortunately, that kind of URL is hard to keep track of, and if you insert 
images into your posts frequently (we do!), it will be hard to find those files 
later if you need to reference them somewhere else on your blog or if you 
move your blog to another platform.
When you upload a file to File Manager (we explain how in Chapter 4), the 
item will have its own URL that reflects its placement in File Manager (instead 
of the arbitrary URL TypePad would assign it if you used the Insert button on 
the Compose toolbar). In the following examples, we’ve uploaded the same 
image two ways: using File Manager and using the Insert Image button.
File Manager URL: http://typepadfordummies.typepad.com/type
pad-for-dummies/images/castle.jpg
TypePad URL: http://typepadfordummies.typepad.com/.a/6a01157
06537f9970c0120a6c0802a970b-pi

109
 Chapter 6: Writing and Editing Your Blog Posts
In the first example, we created a folder in File Manager called images and 
uploaded a picture of Cinderella’s Castle from Walt Disney World. If we ever 
need to access that photo again, we know where it’s located and can easily 
find it and insert it into another blog post.
In the second example, we used the Insert Image button from the Compose 
toolbar. The resulting URL is not intuitive and is not housed in File Manager. 
If we ever want to use that image again, we’ll most likely have to reinsert it 
using the Insert Image button. This could be a problem if we no longer have 
the image on our hard drive or if we move our blog to another platform.
If you’d like more control of your filing structure so you can find your files 
easily, please review the topic of managing stored files in Chapter 4. Taking 
the time to upload your files into an intuitive filing system helps you find 
your stuff and makes it easier if you ever decide to migrate from TypePad 
(even if you’re just upgrading to Movable Type). Instead of renaming all your 
image links, you can simply re-create your filing system on the new server 
or platform and move your files accordingly. You’ll experience many fewer 
broken links or missing images. Uploading your files manually takes a few 
extra steps, but it’s worth it in the long run.
Creating a link to a file using File Manager
The instructions for linking to podcasts, videos, or even documents are the 
same when you are uploading them to File Manager:
 
1. Set up File Manager as suggested in the section on managing stored 
files in Chapter 4.
 
 We suggest that you establish separate folders for images, podcasts, 
videos, and documents.
 
2. Upload your file to the correct folder in File Manager.
 
 See Chapter 4 for detailed instructions on how to upload files.
 
3. Click the Link icon next to the file you want to reference.
 
 A pop-up window appears with the HTML you’ll need to make the 
link work.
 
4. Copy this HTML and paste it into the HTML tab of the Compose editor.
 
 Click back over to the Rich Text tab to preview how your link looks and 
make any changes. In particular, you may want to change the text of the 
link. You can do this by highlighting the text and typing the new text you 
want to use as the link text.
 
5. (Optional) Preview your post to ensure that it appears correctly.
 
6. Publish your post as necessary.
 
 You can save to draft, publish immediately, or set it to post at a 
future date.

Inserting an image using File Manager
Using File Manager to insert an image in your post instead of doing it using the 
Compose editor’s toolbar requires you to use a little HTML. Don’t worry — you 
use very little HTML, and the process is easy. These instructions explain how:
 
1. Set up File Manager as suggested in the section on managing stored 
files in Chapter 4.
 
 We suggest that you establish separate folders for images, podcasts, 
videos, and documents.
 
2. Upload your file to the correct folder in File Manager.
 
 See Chapter 4 for detailed instructions on how to upload files.
 
3. Right-click the file name of the image you’d like to include in your post.
 
 A menu appears.
 
4. Choose Copy Link Location.
 
 The URL for the image is saved to your clipboard.
 
5. Paste the URL into the HTML tab of the Compose editor.
 
 It should look something like this (but with your blog’s info):
http://yourblogname.typepad.com/blog_folder_name/images/image_name.jpg
 
6. Edit that line to look like this:
<img src=“http://yourblogname.typepad.com/blog_folder_name/images/image_
name.jpg”>
 
 You can read more about what that HTML code means and how it works in 
the section in Chapter 11 on how to include sidebar images on your blog.
 
7. (Optional) Preview your post to ensure that it displays correctly.
 
8. Publish your post as necessary.
 
 You can choose to save it as a draft, publish it immediately, or set it to 
post on a future date.
 
You can align your image to the left or right of your text (and the text will 
wrap around it), or you can center your image. Just use these modifications to 
your HTML code:
Image aligned left (text wraps around the image):
<img style=“float: left;” src= “http://yourblogname.typepad.com/blog_folder_
name/images/image_name.jpg”>

111
 Chapter 6: Writing and Editing Your Blog Posts
Image aligned right (text wraps around the image):
<img style=“float: right;” src= “http://yourblogname.typepad.com/blog_folder_
name/images/image_name.jpg”>
Image centered (no text wrap):
<div align=“center”><img src=“http://yourblogname.typepad.com/blog_folder_name/
images/image_name.jpg”></div>
Inserting video and audio files to your post
You can use the buttons on your Compose editor toolbar to easily share 
video or audio with your readers (see the buttons in Table 6-1). In Chapter 9, 
we fully address the subject of using multimedia in your blog.
Organizing Your Posts Using Categories
As we explain in Chapter 5, most bloggers use categories to organize content, 
making it easy for readers to browse your blog for related content. Also in 
Chapter 5, we show you how to use the links in the blog-level bar to edit or 
add to the default categories TypePad provides for all users. If you’ve already 
set up your categories the way you want them, it’s simple to apply a category 
to the post you’re writing. In the upper-right corner of the Compose editor, 
look for the box titled Categories, as shown in Figure 6-5.
After writing your post, click to select the boxes next to the names of the 
categories in which you’d like your post to appear (use the scroll bar to see 
them all). For your readers’ convenience, choose as many categories as appli-
cable. For example, if you were posting a review for a book about your favor-
ite knitting patterns, you might choose both Books and Crafting as relevant 
categories (as shown in Figure 6-5).
In writing your post, you may discover that it doesn’t fit it into any of 
your current categories. That’s okay; you can either leave off the category 
altogether or (and this is more advisable) create a new, relevant category. 
To do this, you can either follow the steps we gave you in Chapter 5 or, 
more simply, click the Add a New Category link below the category box. 
Enter the name of the new category in the pop-up box that appears, and 
click Create.

112
Part II: Getting Started with TypePad 
 
Figure 6-5:

Categories box
 
Be as specific as you can when naming categories, for your readers’ conve-
nience. Because there’s no limit on the number of categories TypePad allows 
you to have, you might as well include as many as you think would be helpful. 
On the other hand, you don’t want to be redundant. Having separate categories 
for, say, Food, Kitchen, and Recipes makes your category list less navigable.
Configuring Post Options
After you’ve written your post, you’ll need to make a few decisions about 
how (and when) you want to it to appear. In this section, we explain the other 
features in the Compose editor so that you can control the timing of your 
post and the kind of feedback you’ll allow on it.
Publishing, saving, or scheduling?
If you’ve written a post, you need to save it, of course. It’s advisable to 
save your work often as you write, even when the post isn’t yet finished. 
Fortunately, TypePad has an autosave feature that automatically saves your 
work. If you ever lose a post, try heading back to the Compose screen, where 
you will likely see a message (just below the blue blog-level bar) that you 
have an autosaved post. Click Recover, which should (we hope) restore your 
post from the last autosave.

113
 Chapter 6: Writing and Editing Your Blog Posts
The autosave feature is nice in an emergency, but you don’t want to depend 
on it. Save your work, and do it often! Before you save, you have a decision 
to make: Are you ready to publish your post on your blog, or do you simply 
want to save it as a draft copy? At the bottom of the right sidebar in the 
Compose editor is a box that shows the status of your post (see Figure 6-6).
 
Figure 6-6: 
The status 
box (set to 
Draft sta-
tus) in the 
Compose 
editor.
 
In Figure 6-6, the status is set to Draft, which means that when this user 
clicks the Save button, the post is visible only to him, in his list of posts (see 
Chapter 5). The draft is not published on his blog. Choose the Draft option 
any time you’re writing something that needs to be saved but is not ready for 
publication.
If you want to see how this post might look published on your blog, you can 
click the Preview button, below the status. Note that this option does not 
save or publish your work; it simply gives you a sneak peek of your work.
If you’re ready to publish your post, use the drop-down menu in the status 
bar to change the option to Publish Now, as shown in Figure 6-7.
 
Figure 6-7: 
The status 
box (set to 
Publish Now 
status) in the 
Compose 
editor.
 
When you change the status to Publish Now, the buttons change to Preview 
and Publish (refer to Figure 6-7). Again, you can use the Preview button to 
see how the post will look when you publish it. The Publish button saves 
your post to your list of posts in the Dashboard and publishes it on the front 
page of your blog, ready for your readers’ eyes.

114
Part II: Getting Started with TypePad 
Don’t click Publish until you’re sure your post is ready! You can always 
unpublish later by changing the status to Draft, but the change might not 
be reflected immediately, especially in feed readers. If you have any doubts 
about whether you’re ready to publish, always choose Draft.
 
Even after you’ve published a post, you can still reenter the post to edit typos 
or change wording, and your saved updates will be reflected.
There is one more status option for your post: You can schedule it to post on 
a future date by choosing Publish On. (Note that this option is not available 
to TypePad users who have joined under the Micro plan.) When you click 
Publish On in the Status box, a small calendar appears, like the one shown in 
Figure 6-8.
 
Figure 6-8: 
Calendar 
pop-up box 
for schedul-
ing future 
posts.
 
Calendar for scheduling posts
Use the arrow buttons to navigate through the calendar. Click the date (and 
double-check that the date you chose appears in the date field), set the time 
you want your post to publish, and then click OK. Your post is now saved 
and will publish on the date you requested. The post appears in the list of 
current posts (see Chapter 5) in sequential order, using the date you’ve 
scheduled it to appear, not the date on which you wrote it.

115
 Chapter 6: Writing and Editing Your Blog Posts
Changing the timestamp on your post
If you’ve written a post to be published in the future, and you’ve changed 
your mind about the date you want it to appear, simply reopen the post in 
the Compose screen (use the Posts tab to find it, as explained in Chapter 5). 
In the status bar, you’ll see the date the post is scheduled to publish — this 
is referred to as a timestamp. To change the timestamp, click the date, and 
the calendar appears (refer to Figure 6-8). Simply choose the new date and 
click OK, and your post is rescheduled. If you don’t want the article to post at 
all, you can change its status to Draft, as explained previously.
You can also change the timestamp to a currently published post in the same 
manner. It’s probably not something you’ll need to do very often, but if you 
do, simply click the date and change it to the date you’d prefer to have on the 
timestamp.
Displaying your comments
Occasionally, you may want to deviate from the usual way you allow your 
readers to interact with your post. If a post is generating an unusually high 
number of discourteous comments, for example, you may want to turn off or 
hide the comments for that post. Below the Body field in the Compose editor, 
look at the area titled Comments and TrackBacks. You may need to click the 
blue arrow next to the title Comments and TrackBacks to reveal this section, 
which looks like Figure 6-9.
 
Figure 6-9: 
Comments 
and 
TrackBacks 
box in the 
Compose 
editor.
 

116
Part II: Getting Started with TypePad 
In this portion of the Compose screen, you have the option to adjust the kind 
of feedback you receive for this post. To keep the comments open and acces-
sible (which is most likely your default setting), click to select the Open button.
To keep the comments section viewable but prevent further comments from 
being added (which you might do, for example, in the event of a contest 
or giveaway with a specific ending date), click to select the Closed option. 
TypePad shows a small message (it reads The comments to this entry 
are closed) at the bottom of your comment section.
If you do not want the comments section to appear at all, click to select the 
last option, Hidden. If you choose this option, there will be no Comments link 
at the bottom of your published post for readers to click and, therefore, no 
comment form for them to fill out.
Note that any changes you make in this section are applicable only to this 
particular post. If you want to change your default posting settings to apply 
to all your posts, you’ll need to do so in the Setting tab in the blue blog-level 
navigation bar — but we discuss all aspects of comment management more 
thoroughly in Chapter 7.
Using trackbacks
Trackbacks are a useful way to let another blog or Web site know that you’re 
linking to them or discussing them on your blog. You can send a trackback (if 
you’re writing about another blog), or you can receive a trackback (if another 
blog is writing about you). It’s a virtual heads-up, if you will. The trackback 
includes a link to the post discussing your blog so you can go see what the 
post says and maybe leave a comment.
We explain how to send trackbacks in Chapter 7, but for now, just know that 
if you open the Comments and TrackBacks section, you can choose to use 
trackbacks (click to select Open) or hide trackbacks (click to select Hide). 
If you’re receiving many trackbacks that appear to be spam-related, you 
can hide trackbacks for a while and then turn them back on. That’s usually 
enough to encourage the spammers to move on.
Setting keywords for your post
Below the Body field in the Compose editor, look at the area titled Keywords 
and Technorati Tags. You may need to click the blue arrow next to that title 
to reveal this section.

117
 Chapter 6: Writing and Editing Your Blog Posts
Assigning keywords and Technorati tags is a way to help search engines find 
your blog and determine whether its content is relevant to search queries. 
Technorati (www.technorati.com) is a blog search engine. If you’re inter-
ested in seeing what other bloggers are writing regarding a specific topic, 
you can use keywords to search Technorati, and the site will return a list of 
blogs with relevant content. The difference between Technorati and a search 
engine such as Google is that Technorati searches only blogs, but Google 
indexes, or includes, everything (blogs, Web sites, video, and so on). See 
Chapters 1 and 5 for advice on how to choose keywords for SEO.
Customizing a post excerpt
Below the Body field in the Compose editor, look at the area titled Excerpt. You 
may need to click the blue arrow next to that title to reveal this section. Any time 
one of your blog posts is referenced in a feed reader or search engine, that post is 
accompanied by an excerpt, or short summary, of the post. Usually, this excerpt 
is pulled automatically from the first few sentences of your post (if your RSS 
feeds are set to short excerpts; you can find out whether you offer short excerpts 
or full posts via RSS by choosing Settings➪Feeds from the blog-level bar).
If you’d rather have a say in how your blog’s excerpt reads, you can type 
a custom excerpt in the Excerpt text box. Be aware, however, that typing 
a custom excerpt does not guarantee that search engines will use it; some-
times, search engines still pull excerpts directly from the content. Feed read-
ers, though, use your custom excerpt, and what you write here may be more 
descriptive than a teaser from the actual post.
Featuring blog posts
Most bloggers have their blogs structured so that the most recent post is the 
one that appears at the top of their blog. Sometimes, though, especially in the 
case of an important announcement, bloggers need a post to remain at the 
top of their page for an extended time. A featured post (sometimes referred to 
as a sticky post) is one that remains at the top of the blog’s front page, with 
newer posts appearing below it.
It’s easy to turn a regular post into a featured post. In the Feature This Post 
section on the right side of the Compose screen, simply click to select the 
box. When you save the post, it is featured at the top of your blog until you 
deselect it as a featured post. (You can unfeature it by revisiting the post in 
the Compose screen, deselecting the Feature This Post box, and then saving. 
Featuring a different post also unfeatures any previously featured post.)

118
Part II: Getting Started with TypePad 
Featured posts are handy when you need them, but you’ll probably want to 
use this tool sparingly. Readers are accustomed to seeing the most recent 
post at the top of your screen, and if you deviate from this too often, it can 
be confusing. Save your featured posts for when you really need to use them, 
such as to explain a change in your format or to announce some big news.
Using the Share This Post option
Below your list of categories in the right sidebar, you’ll see an option to Share 
This Post. This is simply a way to let friends and peers on your social networks 
know that you’ve published a new blog post. If you’ve set up your TypePad 
account to include your other social media accounts (for example, Facebook 
or Twitter), you have the option to select which networks TypePad should 
send an alert to when you publish new content. After an account is selected, 
TypePad sends a link (via a Bit.ly link — discussed more thoroughly in Chapter 
10) to the account that points back to your most recent post. The Bit.ly link 
helps you track who is clicking over to your blog from which social networks. 
You can track these stats from your blog’s Overview tab. For help linking your 
TypePad account to your other social media accounts, see Chapter 4.
Editing Existing Posts
Most bloggers have several draft posts saved on their Dashboard. (Some of us 
have more drafts than published posts!) Any time you want to edit a post, visit 
the Posts tab in the blue blog-level bar. Your posts appear in the order in which 
they are published, scheduled to publish, or (if they’re still drafts) the date on 
which they were written. Click the title of the post you want to edit, and you’ll be 
taken directly back to the same Compose screen you used to write it in the first 
place. When you’re finished, save the post as a draft or publish it.
Understanding the Difference 
between Posts and Pages
A post is the meat and potatoes of your blog. A post contains the story or 
information you’re sharing with your readers. When you write a post, it 
shows up on the front page of your blog (usually at the top) and is pushed 
down the page as new posts are published. Posts are also listed in the 
Archives or Recent Posts link if you have those options in your sidebar.

119
 Chapter 6: Writing and Editing Your Blog Posts
A page is similar to a post in that
 
✓ You create a page in the TypePad Compose editor.
 
✓ Pages have the same design as posts (your TypePad theme is still in 
place, your blog’s banner still shows, and so on).
 
✓ You can include multimedia elements such as video, images, and audio 
as well as text and links in a page.
Just like a post, a page has its own permalink. To share a page with your 
readers, though, you have to link directly to the page with a sidebar or navi-
gation bar link or from within a post.
A page, although similar to a post, does have a few differences. A blog page 
does not publish to the front page of your blog, nor does it show up in a list 
of your archives or recent posts or in your RSS feed.
A page usually contains information that changes infrequently but needs to 
be readily available. For instance, you may use a page to display your About 
Me information (see Chapter 4). Or you may use a page to keep track of and 
share the list of books you’re reading this year. A page is essentially informa-
tion that you want to share with readers, but you don’t need it to appear in 
the list of current or past blog posts.
To compose a page for your blog, follow these instructions:
 
1. Click the down arrow next to the yellow Compose button, and select 
New Page.
 
 A new page appears in your Compose editor.
 
2. Compose your page as you would compose a regular blog post.
 
 Don’t forget, just like with a post, you can include text, images, video, 
and audio files (see Chapter 9 for instructions on how to use multimedia 
with your TypePad blog).
 
3. To publish your page, click Save.
 
 Unlike posts, pages can’t be scheduled for later posting, so you don’t see 
the Schedule button.
 
Be sure to make a note of your page’s permalink so you can link to this page in 
your sidebar or from within another post.
That’s it! You now know how to use the TypePad Compose editor to write a 
blog post. You can format your text, insert images into your post for interest, 
and create a page for extra information you want to share.

Remember, though, the important part is just starting. Trust us when we tell 
you that your posts improve the more you write — so get out there and get 
started! Also check out the sidebar information we include in this chapter for 
advice on what makes a great blog post.

Chapter 7
Interacting on Your Blog
In This Chapter
▶ Eliciting more comments from your readers
▶ Finding out about TypePad’s commenting options
▶ Managing your existing comments
▶ Understanding how to block commenters
▶ Using trackbacks
U
nlike other forms of writing, blogging is, at its core, a sort of dialogue 
between blogger and reader. No other venue offers writers such quick 
access to engaging a readership or puts such instant information and enter-
tainment at a reader’s disposal.
To many bloggers, receiving comments is an important part of the overall blog-
ging experience. It’s an instant dose of affirmation that what you’ve written has 
been read. Additionally, comments help build a community around your blog. 
The discussion generated in the comment section engages your readers and 
encourages them to come back. It stands to reason, then, that you’ll want to 
manage those comments efficiently to invite people to contribute their thoughts.
In this chapter, we examine TypePad’s commenting features, showing you 
how to manage existing comments and how to encourage your readers to 
leave even more. We tackle the not-altogether-pleasant subject of blocking 
commenters. And we discuss the topic of trackbacks — how to manage them 
at your own blog and how to leave them at others.
 
Don’t let the subject of blog commenting discourage you. As much as we all 
enjoy the affirming feedback, it will take consistent work and nurturing of your 
blog before regular comments begin rolling in. Give it time.
Inviting Users to Comment on Your Blog
Ask various bloggers, and they’ll probably tell you that they’ve experienced a 
curious phenomenon of blogging: A post that was an effortless, spontaneous 

122
Part II: Getting Started with TypePad 
afterthought will unexpectedly garner meaty and enthusiastic comments. 
Likewise, a painstaking, heartfelt post might sit completely ignored by com-
menters. If (or when!) it happens to you, shake your head and have a good 
laugh — chalk it up to being one of the great blogging mysteries!
Although it’s true that comment patterns may be somewhat unpredictable, 
you can do a few things to encourage readers to step out of the woodwork:
 
✓ Include a specific question in your post. Pointedly ask readers what 
they think about your topic — they may just tell you!
 
✓ Engage with readers in the comment section. Thanks to threaded com-
menting (more on that in a moment), you can set up a direct and easy-
to-follow dialogue with your commenters in the comment section. This 
may encourage them to comment more freely.
 
✓ Respond to your comments. If you choose not to respond to comments 
directly in the comment section, consider sending the commenter a pri-
vate e-mail (TypePad makes this easy to do; we tackle this later in the 
chapter). If you receive a large volume of comments, it’s unreasonable 
to expect that you could respond to every one. Respond to the ones 
you can — and it may eventually pan that every commenter receives a 
personal response from you.
 
✓ Keep it simple. If your readers have to jump through numerous hoops 
to leave a comment, they’re less likely to do so. It may be appealing to 
ward off spammers with CAPTCHA (randomly generated word codes), 
but readers tend not to like that extra step.
 
✓ Choose your topics wisely. Again, it’s not always easy to predict what 
topics will make your commenters speak up. But if a news story or an 
issue that’s especially relevant to your readers pops up, offer your 
take — and ask for theirs. Let your blog be a place where people feel like 
they can be heard.
 
Avoid the temptation to beg for comments. Just like with traffic, garner com-
ments because you’ve earned them with your good content, not because you 
tried to implement gimmicks. Occasionally doing a specific call-out for com-
ments is fine, but if you do it every time, you might come across as needy.
Standard Commenting versus 
TypePad Connect
TypePad offers users two commenting formats. The first is the standard 
commenting format — the one that is automatically installed on your blog 

123
 Chapter 7: Interacting on Your Blog
when you first sign up for a TypePad account. The second is a function called 
TypePad Connect — you have to manually select to apply it to your blog 
(more on that in a minute).
The basic functions of the two commenting formats are similar — both 
require that you make some decisions about the settings for the comment 
section. In this section, we explain the commenting features offered by both 
formats, as well as those that are unique to each one. This should help you 
determine which commenting format would work best for your blog.
 
For more information on TypePad Connect, visit www.typepad.com/connect. 
This commenting interface is available for installation by non-TypePad blog-
gers as well.
Options offered by both
First, let’s walk through the features you’ll find in both the standard com-
menting format and TypePad Connect.
Sign in
Either format lets you designate whether or not you will allow anonymous 
comments. If you do require that readers sign in, they’d be able to use their 
TypePad, Facebook, or Twitter account (if they don’t have any of those, 
they’d have to offer some other form of identification, such as an e-mail 
address). It’s a matter of preference — a few readers may bristle at this, but 
most would likely accept it as a standard blogging practice.
Comment moderation
Comment moderation means that new comments are not instantly published; 
instead, the blog owner must manually approve them first.
Autoclose
Autoclosing comments means that posts older than a designated length of 
time will automatically stop accepting new comments. You may want to do 
this to ward off spammers (who often seem inclined to leave their spam on 
older posts) and to keep the commenting energies focused on the freshest, 
most recent dialogues taking place at your blog.
CAPTCHA
CAPTCHA is a randomly generated verification code that keeps spammers 
from inundating you with junk comments. A CAPTCHA verification screen 
looks something like the one pictured in Figure 7-1.

124
Part II: Getting Started with TypePad 
 
Figure 7-1: 
A CAPTCHA 
comment-
verification 
module.
 
Both TypePad commenting formats give you access to this tool, but you 
would want to implement it only if you are completely overrun with spam. 
(If you are, you should immediately submit a help ticket to TypePad — it 
has a good track record with spam management and is serious about not let-
ting such comments through.) Most likely, any spam comments are going to 
be caught in TypePad’s AntiSpam service (see antispam.typepad.com), 
meaning this CAPTCHA comment-verification screen will likely serve only to 
give your readers a frustrating extra step.
Allow HTML
If you choose to allow HTML, it means that bloggers can include simple HTML 
tags to give their comment a little pizzazz. For example, if you allow HTML, a 
commenter who says “I <i>love</i> this post!” will have their comment trans-
lated to “I love this post!” It’s a good idea to give your readers this option.
Auto-link URL
With URL auto-links enabled, any commenter who leaves a full Web address 
in your comment will have that address automatically inserted as a hyper-
link. It’s an easy way to encourage the sharing of ideas among readers in the 
comment section.
Sort comment order
Both commenting formats let you decide in what order you’d like your com-
ments displayed. The most common format is to post the oldest first, giving 
readers a beginning-to-ending look at the dialogue.
Userpics
If you enable the display of userpics, it means commenters with a TypePad 
account will have their picture appear next to their comment. It gives the 
comment section a more personalized feel.
Number of comments per page
In either commenting format, you select how many comments to display. 
Choosing a lower number means your page might load a little faster 

125
 Chapter 7: Interacting on Your Blog
(especially for readers with slow connections). Choosing a higher number 
means your readers can follow the discussion with less clicking.
E-mail notification
One of the handiest commenting features (available in both formats) is the 
ability to have new comments e-mailed to you. This gives you instant access 
to your newest comments without having to sign in to the Dashboard. For 
many bloggers, enabling this option is a streamlined way to manage your 
community.
 
If you enable this option, your comments will be e-mailed to the e-mail address 
you have on file with your TypePad account.
Accepting or rejecting new comments
Although most bloggers encourage the leaving of comments, some bloggers 
prefer not to receive them. If you want to make it your standard setting not to 
allow comments on new posts or pages, both formats allow you to do so.
 
If you expect you’ll allow comments on some posts (but not all of them), use 
the Compose Editor (see Chapter 6) to make the choice about including com-
ments on each individual post or page.
How to leave a trackback
You manage your own incoming trackbacks 
from the Dashboard, but you may want to leave 
trackbacks for other bloggers as well. A track-
back, as you may recall from Chapter 6, is a 
little ping that let’s another blogger know you’ve 
written about him or her. To send a trackback, 
follow these steps:
 1. Grab the trackback URL you want to use 
(this is different from the URL of the post).
 
 For a TypePad blogger, you can find the 
trackback URL at the top of the blogger’s 
comment section, labeled Trackback URL 
for This Entry. Copy that URL, because you’ll 
need it in a second.
 2. Write your post, linking (in the traditional 
way) back to the other blogger.
 
 At the end of your post, look in the Compose 
editor at the section below your post. The 
section is titled Comments and Trackbacks.
 3. Click the down arrow to expand the 
Comments and Trackbacks section.
 4.  In the box labeled Send a Trackback to 
These URLs, paste the trackback URL you 
copied in Step 1.

 The other blogger will now receive notifica-
tion of your trackback.
Remember that not all bloggers accept track-
backs. If you’re looking around (unsuccess-
fully) for another blogger’s trackback URL, he or 
she may not have the feature enabled.

126
Part II: Getting Started with TypePad 
Accept or reject trackbacks
A trackback (also discussed in Chapter 6) is a virtual nudge to other blog-
gers, giving them notice that you’ve blogged about them at your site (see the 
sidebar in this chapter). It’s up to you if you want to accept them. They’re a 
handy tool, but they tend to be an easy spam target.
What makes them different
Now that you’ve seen the basic functionalities allowed by both TypePad’s 
standard commenting format and TypePad Connect, you need to know what 
makes them different.
Threaded comments
Threaded comments (a commenting setup that allows readers to respond directly 
to a comment, designated by a small indentation below the original comment) are 
available only in TypePad Connect. This is a helpful option, especially if you have 
a blog where robust conversation often takes place in the comment section.
An example of how threaded comments look is shown in Figure 7-2. You can 
see the indentation under the comment the reader is responding to. This 
threaded format makes it easier for others to reply to specific comments or 
follow a direct conversation (especially if you’ve enabled userpics).
 
Figure 7-2: 
Threaded 
comments.
 

127
 Chapter 7: Interacting on Your Blog
List (or unthreaded) comments have no indentations, as shown in Figure 7-3 — 
this can make it a little harder to follow the dialogue.
E-mailed responses posted in comment section
Although both commenting formats allow you to receive your comments 
via e-mail, TypePad Connect (not the default commenting format) gives you 
handy additional e-mail functionality. When bloggers receive a specific ques-
tion in their comment section, they are often left wondering whether it’s most 
efficient to reply to the commenter via e-mail or in the comment section. 
TypePad Connect allows you to do both at the same time. When a comment 
is e-mailed to you, replying to it will both send an e-mail directly to the com-
menter and post your answer in the comment section (visible to other read-
ers). This feature can be an efficient time-saver.
Replying from the comment section
Still one more feature offered only by TypePad Connect is the ability to 
respond directly from your comment section. If you’re scrolling through, 
reading your comments, and you see a comment that needs a response, click 
the small Reply link just below the comment (as shown in Figure 7-4).
When you click this link, your response is posted (in threaded format, if 
you’ve enabled it) directly on your blog, and it’s e-mailed to the commenter.

Comment sharing through social media
So far, we’ve told you about the options offered only in TypePad Connect, but 
there’s at least one significant function that may make TypePad’s standard 
commenting format appealing to you. Users of the standard commenting 
format can give readers the option to publish the comments they leave on 
your blog to their own Twitter and/or Facebook feeds.
If you enable this feature on the Settings tab (see next section), your readers 
will see the option shown in Figure 7-5 in the comment section.

Comment-sharing option

129
 Chapter 7: Interacting on Your Blog
To share his or her comments on another social media network, a com-
menter would simply select the appropriate box below your comment field 
(as shown in Figure 7-5) and then click the Post button. Her comment would 
then appear in her Facebook or Twitter feed or both (depending on which 
boxes she selected), along with a link to your original post.
Your readers do not need a TypePad account to participate in this social 
media comment sharing. If they sign in to your comment section using their 
Facebook or Twitter ID, they’ll see the same comment-sharing options avail-
able at the end of the post. (For more on integrating social media with your 
TypePad account, see Chapter 10.)
Weigh your options, and decide whether TypePad Connect or the standard 
commenting format works best for you. Both offer powerful features, so you 
really can’t go wrong.
Establishing Settings for Your 
Desired Commenting Option
After you’ve decided which of the two commenting formats suits you, you 
need to adjust your comment settings. To do this, you’ll need to get to the 
Settings tab in the blue blog-level navigation bar. From the Dashboard, click 
the name of the blog in question. When the blog-level bar appears, choose 
the Settings tab, shown in Figure 7-6.
(Note the tab called Comments, also shown in Figure 7-6. This is where you 
can see a listing of all the comments you’ve received. We get to that tab later 
in the chapter. For now, we’ll use the Settings tab.)
Look for the blue menu bar that appears on the left side of the screen. Click 
the Comments button, and you should see a screen that looks like the one in 
Figure 7-7.
Configuring settings for the standard 
commenting format
Unless you’ve already enabled TypePad Connect, the page shown in Figure 
7-7 is the settings page for the standard commenting format — it’s the one 
TypePad will use by default unless you specifically choose otherwise.

 Chapter 7: Interacting on Your Blog
If you’ve decided to keep the standard commenting format enabled on your 
blog, simply scroll down through the page shown in Figure 7-7. Refer to the 
previous section in this chapter for an explanation of each of the functions 
listed, and apply whatever settings will work best for you and your readers.
Configuring settings for TypePad Connect
If you’ve decided that TypePad Connect is the commenting format you prefer, 
you need to scroll down to the bottom of the page shown in Figure 7-7. At the 
bottom of the page, you have an option like the one shown in Figure 7-8.
Click the designated link, and TypePad Connect will be installed on your 
blog. If you change your mind and want to revert to the standard comment-
ing format, look for the link at the bottom of the settings page, which reads 
Disable TypePad Connect Comments.
With TypePad Connect installed, you’ll need to make your settings prefer-
ences by choosing Settings➪Comments Page. The page will look similar to 
the one in Figure 7-7, but your setting options will be worded a little differ-
ently and will be in a different order. Refer to the list of TypePad’s comment-
ing features explained earlier in this chapter.

Managing Existing Comments
Any time a new comment is left at your blog, it will join the list of comments 
in the Comments tab in the blue blog-level bar (refer to Figure 7-6). Click the 
Comments tab, and you should see a page that looks similar to Figure 7-9.
Taking action with your comments
When you click the drop-down button to the right of each comment (and des-
ignated in Figure 7-9), you have four actions you can take on that particular 
comment:
 
✓ Publish: If you’ve enabled comment moderation in the Settings tab, click 
this link to approve and publish each new comment. If you’ve previously 
unpublished a comment for some reason, you can click this option to 
republish it.
 
✓ Unpublish: If you’ve received a comment that you want to save in your 
account but make unviewable by other commenters, click the Unpublish 
button in the drop-down menu.
 
✓ Delete: If you want to delete a comment, click this button, but do so with 
caution — the action can’t be undone. Unless you are positive you want 
the comment wiped out, your best bet might be unpublishing instead of 
deleting.
 
✓ Mark as Spam: Clicking this option identifies the comment as junk mail, 
which helps “train” TypePad’s AntiSpam feature in how it filters spam 
at your blog. You’re doing yourself (and other TypePad users) a service 
when you mark spam — honing the spam filter benefits us all.
In addition to the drop-down menu to the right of each comment, you can 
click the links below a comment:
 
✓ Reply: Clicking Reply takes you directly to the comment section, where 
you can leave a reply comment.
 
✓ Edit: Want to edit an existing comment? Click the Edit link, and you are 
taken to a page where you can make edits to the comment in question. If 
you don’t have threaded comments, you might use this option to leave 
your own response directly on the comment needing a response.
 
✓ View: Clicking View takes you to the comment section, where you can 
see that particular comment in action.

Drop-down Action menu
Taking action with trackbacks
In the blue menu bar to the left of the Comments tab (refer to Figure 7-9), 
click the Trackbacks link. You’re taken to a page that looks nearly identical 
to Figure 7-7, except that it lists the trackbacks you’ve received instead of 
comments. You have the same options (via the same drop-down menu) to 
publish, unpublish, delete, or mark as spam.
Blocking comments
It’s a hard call for a blogger: choosing to block a particular commenter from 
leaving more comments at your site. It’s a step most bloggers do not take 
lightly, but you may encounter times when it’s necessary. If a commenter 
repeatedly stops by your blog for the sole purpose of personal attack or off-
topic rants, it’s your prerogative as the blog owner to block him or her.
To take this step, click the Block List link on the left side of the Comments 
tab (refer to Figure 7-9). The screen shown in Figure 7-10 appears.

134
Part II: Getting Started with TypePad 
 
Figure 7-10: 
The Block 
List screen.
 
In the appropriate field, enter the IP address for the commenter you want 
to block. (You can find the commenter’s IP address by clicking the Edit link 
under the commenter’s name. When the Edit Comment screen appears, look 
for the IP address on the right side of the page, under Additional Info.) When 
you’re finished, click the Block button.
You can also block comments containing certain words. TypePad’s AntiSpam 
feature automatically flags certain offensive words, sending them straight 
to spam. But if you find a troublesome word getting through, enter it in the 
appropriate field. When you’re finished, click Block.
Use the Note field, if you want, to leave yourself a reminder about why this 
word or IP address was blocked (such as “offensive word” or “commenter 
sends political hate mail”). This field is optional.
 
You can block only an IP address. This will not prevent a difficult commenter 
from leaving a comment using another computer at another location. Also 
remember that although you can block an IP address from leaving a comment, 
you cannot block the address from viewing your blog — this feature is not cur-
rently offered by TypePad.

135
 Chapter 7: Interacting on Your Blog
Replying to your readers’ comments
It’s a good blogging practice to respond to as many of your readers’ com-
ments as is reasonable (see Chapter 18). The easiest way to do this is to have 
your comments e-mailed to you.
If you have the Emailed Comments option enabled, simply respond to the 
comment e-mail when it arrives in your inbox. In TypePad’s standard com-
menting format, your response will go directly back to the commenter. In 
TypePad Connect, your response will go to the commenter and will be posted 
in your comment section — be sure you don’t forget about this and say 
something too personal!
If you do not have the Emailed Comments option enabled, replying takes an 
extra step or two. One way is to respond directly in the comment section, 
leaving a comment of your own. If you want to reply via e-mail, pull up the 
Comments tab (refer to Figure 7-9). For the comment needing a response, 
click the Edit link. Copy the commenter’s e-mail address, and paste it in a 
new e-mail.
Enjoy this communication with your commenters, whether it’s via e-mail, 
Twitter, or the comment section. Most bloggers will tell you that the interac-
tion with readers is a big part of the joy of blogging!

Adding Useful 
Elements to Your 
TypePad Blog

In this part . . .
R
eady to polish your blog? This part of the book 
points you toward some helpful tools to enhance 
your TypePad experience — tools such as multimedia, 
TypeLists, and social media integration. We also walk you 
through the fundamentals of TypePad blog design, show-
ing you how to get just the look you want.

Chapter 8
Using TypeLists and Widgets
In This Chapter
▶ Defining TypeLists
▶ Using TypeLists as navigation
▶ Understanding widget functions
M
ost blogs have sidebars (the vertical columns on the sides of your 
main content column), and you’ll display some important information 
there. What you choose to put in your sidebars has an effect on your blog’s 
readability and usefulness. Many bloggers use their sidebars as navigation — 
they include links to different parts of their own blog or to other Web sites 
or showcase extra information (maybe what they’re reading for next month’s 
book club). As you find out in this chapter, TypeLists and widgets are easy 
ways to populate your sidebar.
 
As you consider whether to use TypeLists or widgets on your sidebar, it’s impor-
tant to note that there is a key difference in how TypePad archives them. If you 
remove a TypeList from your sidebar, the TypeList is still in your Library, so you 
can republish it to your sidebar later. If you remove a widget, it is deleted. If you 
decide you want to republish that widget to your sidebar, you have to reinstall it 
from the host site (we show you how to do that later in this chapter).
This chapter is closely related to the information in Chapter 11, which is all 
about using TypePad themes. The way you organize and present information 
in your sidebars visually affects any design you ultimately choose to imple-
ment. As you find out how to apply TypeLists and widgets, keep in mind that 
their ultimate aim is to make your blog more user-friendly for both you and 
your readers. In other words, you don’t have to fill up your sidebars to the 
brim (and from a design standpoint, you really shouldn’t). Choose the tools 
that serve your purpose, and ignore the ones that don’t.
Understanding the Different TypeLists
Any time you want to add something to a TypePad sidebar, you’ll do it using a 
TypeList, a simple yet powerful tool that is a much-loved feature among TypePad 

140
Part III: Adding Useful Elements to Your TypePad Blog 
loyalists. A TypeList is TypePad’s way of organizing sidebar information without 
requiring you to mess with your blog’s template code. TypeLists allow you to 
display simple HTML (such as a text link to another blog) or complex coding 
(such as a search field) anywhere in your sidebar(s), all without ever having to 
alter your template code — everything happens behind the scenes.
TypePad uses four kinds of TypeLists. The kind of information you want to 
share with your readers determines which TypeList you use:
 
✓ Link TypeList: This TypeList allows you to post text links in your side-
bar. You might, for example, use a Link TypeList to display your blogroll 
(the list of blogs you most frequently visit). You might also use it to create 
a “Best Of” section in your sidebar, pointing your readers to the favorite 
posts you’ve written. This kind of TypeList has endless applications.
 
✓ Notes TypeList: This is the TypeList you’ll use when you’d like to 
include more complex code (whether written by you or a third party) 
in your sidebar (for example, a search field or an image). Any time you 
see a TypePad blog that has a graphic image in its sidebar (such as ad 
space), it has probably been placed there via a Notes TypeList.
 
 TypePad also has an Embed Your Own HTML widget in the Design 
portion of the Dashboard that does the same thing as a Notes TypeList. 
You can choose Design➪Content➪Categories (Widget)➪Modules 
(Embed Your Own HTML) to find that widget. See the section in this 
chapter titled “Using the Embed Your Own HTML widget.”
 
✓ Books TypeList: Are you an avid reader looking for an easy way to share 
what you’re reading, what you’ve read in the past, or just a list of your 
favorite books? You can use the Books TypeList for this. It’s similar to a 
Links TypeList, but it has the additional functionality of allowing you to 
include your personal book ratings.
 
✓ Album TypeList: Want to share your love of music with your readers? 
The Album TypeList (similar to the Books TypeList) allows you to share 
everything from individual songs to entire albums (including how you 
rate them) with your readers.
Creating New TypeLists for Your Blog
Your TypeLists are stored in the Library, which you can find by clicking the 
Library link in the green account-level bar. Choose TypeLists from the drop-
down menu, and you’ll see a screen that looks like Figure 8-1.

141
 Chapter 8: Using TypeLists and Widgets
 
Figure 8-1: 
The 
TypeLists 
Library 
page.
 
Add a TypeList link
On this page, you see a complete list of all the TypeLists you’ve ever 
created for your account. If you have more than one TypePad blog in your 
account, you’ll see all your TypeLists, from all your blogs, listed here. To 
create a new TypeList, simply click the Add a TypeList link, as designated 
in Figure 8-1.
This takes you to the Add a TypeList page, as shown in Figure 8-2.
The first item on this page asks you what kind of list you want to create. 
Using the drop-down menu, choose which of the four TypeLists suits your 
needs best. The specific steps for TypeList creation vary depending on which 
one you choose, so let’s walk through each one.
 
If you want to create a list but do not want the list’s title to be visible on 
your blog, name the list this way: <!--InsertNameHere-->, changing 
InsertNameHere to the name you want to use, of course. The characters on 
either side of the TypeList title ensure that the title is not visible to readers. 
This trick works with any TypeList.

Creating a Links TypeList
If you need a Links TypeList, follow these steps:
 
1. From the TypeLists Library (refer to Figure 8-1), click Add a TypeList.
 
 This takes you to the Add a TypeList page (refer to Figure 8-2).
 
2. Choose Links from the drop-down menu.
 
3. Name your TypeList in the List Name field.
 
 Note that the name you enter will appear on your blog, just above the 
list. See our tip in the preceding section if you’d like to hide the name of 
your list so that it doesn’t appear in your blog’s sidebar.
 
4. Click the Create New TypeList button.
 
 The Add Link page appears, as shown in Figure 8-3. Note that the name 
of the TypeList (in this example, My Favorite Soccer Sites) appears in 
the blue blog-level navigation bar.

143
 Chapter 8: Using TypeLists and Widgets

page.

5.  Add a link to your TypeList.
 
 You can add a link to your Links TypeList in two ways:
 
• Enter the URL in the Quick Add field (see Figure 8-3) and click Go. 
TypePad magically finds the title of the blog or Web site associated 
with the URL you type and populates the Title and URL fields in the 
Add Link page. (You can edit these fields later, if you like.)
 
• Fill in the Title and the URL fields yourself. Note that whatever you 
put in the Title field is what readers will see listed in your sidebar.
 
6. (Optional) Type a description of the link in the Notes field.
 
 Depending on the settings you determine for your TypeList (we discuss 
your options later in this chapter), whatever you type in the Notes field 
may appear in your sidebar. Allowing your notes to appear in the side-
bar is one way to offer a brief explanation of the link.

144
Part III: Adding Useful Elements to Your TypePad Blog 
 
7. Click Save Changes.
 
 A page appears that lists all the items you’ve added to this Links 
TypeList. To add another item, click the yellow Add button in the blue 
menu bar or use the Quick Add field.
To give you an idea of the finished product, Figure 8-4 shows a Links TypeList 
in a sidebar.
Creating a Notes TypeList
Need to add a graphic image, or any other piece of code, to your sidebar? Use 
the Notes TypeList. Here’s how:
 
1. From the TypeLists Library (refer to Figure 8-1), click Add a TypeList.
 
 The Add a TypeList page appears (refer to Figure 8-2).
 
2. Choose Notes from the drop-down menu.
 
3. Name your TypeList as you’d like it to appear on your sidebar.
 
 See the tip in “Creating New TypeLists for Your Blog” about hiding the 
names of TypeLists if you’d rather not have the TypeList title show.
 
Figure 8-4: 
A Links 
TypeList.
 
Links TypeList

145
 Chapter 8: Using TypeLists and Widgets
 
4. Click the Create New TypeList button.
 
 The Add Note page appears, as shown in Figure 8-5. Note that the name 
of the TypeList appears in the blue navigation bar.
 
5. (Optional) Give your note a label.
 
 Whatever you type in the Label field appears above this note in your 
sidebar. If you don’t want any text to appear above the note, leave the 
Label field blank, or see our tip in “Creating New TypeLists for Your 
Blog” about hiding the title of your TypeList.
 
6. In the Note field, enter the code you want to use in your sidebar.
 
 For example, let’s say you want to use a sidebar image that advertises 
the work of Compassion International. When you visit Compassion’s 
blog, it offers a page with several sidebar images you can choose to dis-
play on your own blog. Below each image, Compassion’s Web site lists 
the code you need to display the image (with a link back to Compassion 
International) on your sidebar. Highlight and copy that code (Ctrl+C on 
a PC; Command+C on a Mac). Paste (Ctrl+V on a PC; Command+V on a 
Mac) that code into the Note field.
 
 After you’ve pasted the code into the Note field, saved your changes, 
and published your TypeList (which you’ll do in a minute), your new 
TypeList would appear as shown in Figure 8-6.
 
Figure 8-5: 
Add Note 
page.

Figure 8-6:

TypeList.
 
Image added via Notes TypeList
 
 Want to add a sidebar image via a Notes TypeList, but you don’t have 
the code for referencing the image? You’ll need to generate it yourself. 
See Chapter 11 for instructions on including an image in your sidebar.
 
7. Click Save.
 
 A page appears that lists all the items you’ve added to this Notes 
TypeList. To add another item, click the yellow Add button in your blue 
menu bar.
 
Although it is most common to use the Notes TypeList for adding code (in par-
ticular, images) to your sidebar, it’s not the only thing you can use it for. If you 
ever need to add a simple blurb of text to your sidebar — no links, no images, 
just text — enter that text in the Note field, pictured in Figure 8-5. For example, 
perhaps you want a small section in the top of a sidebar to offer a brief intro-
duction: “Hi, I’m Rose. I’m a cancer survivor married to a dentist, and this blog 
is my story. Thanks for stopping by.” If so, enter that text (perhaps along with 
a link to your full About page) via a Notes TypeList, and place it where you 
want it to appear on your sidebar (see Chapter 11).

147
 Chapter 8: Using TypeLists and Widgets
Adding a Books TypeList
If you want to use your sidebar to recommend a list of books, use a Books 
TypeList. If you have connected your Amazon Associate ID, Amazon Wish 
List ID, or both with your TypePad account (see Chapter 4), any books you 
include in a Books TypeList are automatically linked to Amazon (sorry, 
it doesn’t link to any other store except Amazon). If you are an Amazon 
Associate, your Associate ID is included in the link, so you’ll be rewarded for 
any purchases your readers make via your link. You can read more about the 
Amazon Associate program in Chapter 12. If you have not connected your 
Amazon Associate or Wish List ID to your TypePad account, don’t worry! If 
you use Quick Add to include an item in your Books TypeList, that item is 
still linked to Amazon.com, but you won’t get any affiliate credit.
 
Books TypeLists are not just for books! You can list any product offered at 
Amazon.com (including videogames, camera equipment, DVDs, and cook-
ware) within a Books TypeList, and that product is treated just as a book is 
treated: TypePad generates a link to Amazon that includes your Amazon ID (if 
it’s linked to your TypePad account).
If you would like to list items and link them to another store Web site, we 
encourage you to make a new List TypeList and link items directly to the 
Web site you’d like to share. For instance, if you’re quite the cook and want 
to share cooking utensils and supplies from a local store, a List TypeList lets 
you do that.
When you’re ready to create a Books TypeList, use these instructions:
 
1. From the TypeLists Library (refer to Figure 8-1), click Add a TypeList.
 
 The Add a TypeList page appears (refer to Figure 8-2).
 
2. Choose Books from the drop-down menu.
 
3. Name your TypeList as you’d like it to appear on your sidebar.
 
 See the tip in “Creating New TypeLists for Your Blog” for informa-
tion about hiding the names of TypeLists if you’d rather not have the 
TypeList title show.
 
4. Click Create a New TypeList.
 
 The Add Book page appears, as shown in Figure 8-7. Note that the name 
of the TypeList appears in the blue navigation bar.

Part III: Adding Useful Elements to Your TypePad Blog 
 
Figure 8-7: 
Add Book 
page.
 
Name of TypeList
 
5. Type the book (or other product) information.
 
 You can enter the information in two ways:
 
• Use the Quick Add field to enter the title or ISBN (a ten-digit code 
by which books are uniformly identified — you can find it on the 
book’s bar code). When you use the Quick Add field to search 
using a book’s title, you are presented with a list of search results. 
Click to select the button next to the title that works best for you 
and then click the Choose Selected button.
 
• If you’d like to use specific information for your Books TypeList 
item, you can use the Title, Author, and Notes fields to type the 
book or product information you want to include in your TypeList.
 
 When you enter information this way instead of using the Quick Add 
field, the resulting item in your list is not linked to Amazon or any 
other store; the item is simply a text list item. If you want your book 
or product to link to Amazon, be sure to use the Quick Add field.
 
 The Edit Book page appears.
 
6. Confirm that the book title and author name(s) are correct.
 
 If you’d like to make a change, simply click inside the relevant field and 
make any necessary changes.

149
 Chapter 8: Using TypeLists and Widgets
 
 TypePad lists the author name(s) before the book title in your Books 
TypeList. If you’d like to have the book title appear first, leave the 
Author text field blank.
 
7. (Optional) Give the book a rating, if you like.
 
 If you give your item a rating, be sure to check the settings for this 
TypeList to ensure that you’ve chosen to share your ratings; otherwise 
your ratings won’t show up in your sidebar. See “Managing settings for a 
TypeList,” later in this chapter.
 
8. (Optional) Include your review or opinion of the book in the Notes field.
 
 Use the TypeLists Settings tab to determine whether the rating, notes, 
and book artwork are visible to your readers (see “Managing settings for 
a TypeList,” later in this chapter).
 
9. Click Save.
 
 A page appears that lists all the items you’ve added to this Books 
TypeList. To add another item, click the yellow Add button in the blue 
menu bar or use the Quick Add field.
When you’re finished, you can expect a completed Books TypeList to look 
similar to the one pictured in Figure 8-8.

Part III: Adding Useful Elements to Your TypePad Blog 
Adding an Album TypeList
An Album TypeList is similar in concept to a Books TypeList. Both types list 
your favorites, with your personal star rating, and both link to these favorites 
at Amazon.com. If you’ve connected your Amazon Associate or Wish List ID 
to your TypePad account (see Chapter 4), the links are automatically gener-
ated to point to your Amazon associates account, which means you could 
generate some affiliate revenue if your readers make a purchase from your 
recommendation. Keep in mind that the only Amazon product an Albums 
TypeList allows you to list is CDs.
 
If you do not use the Quick Add feature to include an item in your TypeList, 
that item is not linked to Amazon.com; the item shows up in your list as an 
unlinked text item.
Here’s how you set up an Albums TypeList:
 
1. From the TypeLists Library (refer to Figure 8-1), click Add a TypeList.
 
 The Add a TypeList page appears (refer to Figure 8-2).
 
2. Choose Albums from the drop-down menu.
 
3. Name your TypeList as you’d like it to appear on your sidebar.
 
 See the tip in “Creating New TypeLists for Your Blog” for informa-
tion about hiding the names of TypeLists if you’d rather not have the 
TypeList title show.
 
4. Click the Create a New TypeList button.
 
 The Add Album page appears, as shown in Figure 8-9. Note that the 
name of the TypeList appears in the blue navigation bar.
 
5. Type your album information.
 
 You can add the album information in two ways:
 
• Use the Quick Add field to enter the title of the album or the artist. 
When you use the Quick Add field to search for an album’s title, 
you are presented with a list of search results to choose among. 
Click to select the button next to the album that works best for you 
and then click the Choose Selected button.
 
• If you’d like to use specific information for your Albums TypeList 
item, you can use the Title, Author, and Notes fields to type the 
book or product information you want to include in your TypeList. 
Note that when you enter information this way, the resulting item 
in your list is not linked to Amazon or any other store; the item is 
simply a text list item. If you want your album to link to Amazon, 
be sure to use the Quick Add field.
 
 The Edit Album page appears.

6. Confirm that the album title is correct.
 
 If you’d like to make a change, simply click inside the Album field and 
make any necessary changes.
 
7. Confirm or include the artist’s name (if Quick Add didn’t do it for you).
 
 If you’d like to make a change, simply click inside the Artist field and 
make any necessary changes.
 
8. (Optional) Give the album a star rating.
 
 In a moment, we show you how to change your settings so that these 
notes and ratings are visible to your readers.
 
9. (Optional) Include the name of a song from the album.
 
 When you use the Quick Add field to search for an album, it’s possible 
that TypePad automatically puts the album’s title in the Song field. Click 
inside the Song field, highlight and delete the information, and then type 
the correct song title in the field (or leave it blank if you don’t want to 
call attention to a particular song).
 
10. Click Save.
 
 A page appears that lists all the items you’ve added to this Albums 
TypeList. To add another item, click the yellow Add button in the blue 
menu bar or use the Quick Add field.
When you’re finished, you can expect a completed Albums TypeList to look 
similar to the one in Figure 8-10.

Editing and Configuring 
an Existing TypeList
If you want to make any edits to an existing TypeList, or adjust the way 
you’ve set a TypeList to display, start by revisiting the TypeLists Library 
(refer to Figure 8-1). From there, you can decide which parts of your 
TypeLists appear (for example, the Notes you included), search or edit your 
TypeLists, and publish or unpublish a TypeList.
Managing settings for a TypeList
TypePad allows you to establish settings for individual TypeLists, including 
things such as whether book or album art is displayed with each item and 
how many list items appear within the TypeList.
You can get to the TypeList Settings page in a couple of ways. From the 
TypeList Library (refer to Figure 8-1), either click the Settings link below the 
TypeList’s name or click the TypeList’s name and then click the Settings tab. 
Both links point you to the same place: the Settings page for that particular 
TypeList.

153
 Chapter 8: Using TypeLists and Widgets
Depending on the kind of TypeList you’re editing, the Settings page contains 
different information, as follows:
Notes: The Settings page for a Notes TypeList simply lists the name of the 
TypeList (if you want to change the name, type the new name in the desig-
nated field). The Settings page also gives you a spot to add a description of 
the TypeList. This is purely for your own reference; TypeList descriptions 
are not visible to readers. The description appears under the TypeList name 
on the main TypeList Library (refer to Figure 8-1), so it can jog your memory 
about what you’ve included here. Click Save Changes when you’re finished.
Links: The Settings page for a Links TypeList allows you to change the name 
of the list or make notes to yourself in the Description field. Under the Display 
header, you can choose the number of list items you want visible on your side-
bar. You can edit the order in which the list items are arranged by clicking the 
pull-down menu below Order and selecting your preference. The Link Titles 
field does not currently affect your TypeList. You can ignore this menu.
Show Header: Choose how (or whether) you want your Notes displayed:
 
✓ Selecting the Notes as Text option causes anything in your Notes field to 
be visible directly under the link.
 
✓ Selecting the Notes As Tooltip option causes anything in the Notes field 
to be visible only when the reader’s mouse hovers over the link.
 
✓ Selecting the Do Not Show Notes option keeps your notes invisible to read-
ers, but they are still viewable to you within your TypePad Dashboard.
Books and Albums: On the Settings page for both Books and Albums TypeLists, 
you can change the name of the list or make notes to yourself via the Name and 
Description fields. Under Display, choose how many list items to display in your 
sidebar. Under Order, use the drop-down menu to select how you’d like to arrange 
your list items. Under Show, decide whether you want the book or album artwork, 
your star rating, and your notes to appear in the sidebar next to the list item.
Editing a TypeList
You’ll probably make changes to your TypeLists fairly often. For example, if 
you’re using a List TypeList to manage your blogroll, you’ll likely want to add 
and delete blogs from it as your blog-reading habits evolve over time.
 
✓ To make changes to the content of an existing TypeList, simply find that 
TypeList in your TypeList Library (refer to Figure 8-1). Click the TypeList you 
want to edit, and you’ll see what you currently have listed in that TypeList.
 
✓ To remove an item from a TypeList altogether, click to select the check box 
next to its name and then click the red Delete button. The item is gone.

154
Part III: Adding Useful Elements to Your TypePad Blog 
 
✓ To add an item, click the yellow Add button or use the Quick Add func-
tion (except for Notes TypeLists, which do not have Quick Add functions).
 
✓ To edit an existing list item, click its name, and you’ll be taken to a 
screen just like the one you used to add the item originally. Edit as 
needed.
Publishing a TypeList
After you’ve created and saved your TypeList, you’ll probably want to pub-
lish it on your blog. To publish it, head back to your main TypeList Library 
(refer to Figure 8-1) and click the Publish link below the TypeList’s name. 
This takes you to a master list of all your blogs under your TypePad account. 
Click to select the box next to the blog(s) you want to add your TypeList to 
and then click the Save Changes button at the bottom of the page.
If you decide to remove a TypeList from a page, simply click to deselect the 
box next to the blog from which you want the list removed and then click 
Save Changes. To add an existing TypeList to another of your TypePad blogs, 
click to select the box next to that blog’s name and then click Save Changes.
 
On the Publish page, note the Organize Content link below each blog’s name. 
That link takes you out of the TypeList module and into the Design module — 
that’s where all the TypeList arranging takes place. Because it’s a completely 
different portion of the Dashboard, we tackle it in our chapter on blog design 
(Chapter 11).
Searching a TypeList
Need to find a particular item in your TypeList? TypePad gives you a way to do 
a search within a particular TypeList — a feature you’re most likely to need if 
your TypeList is very long. Open the TypeList you want to search through, and 
you’ll see a search field on the line below the blue tabs. Enter the text you’re 
looking for (such as a blog title or an artist’s name) and then click Search. The 
search results are displayed, and you can click the item you need.
Deleting a TypeList
Want to delete the TypeList altogether? Do this by clicking the gray More 
Options button in the TypeList Library and then selecting Delete This 
TypeList.

155
 Chapter 8: Using TypeLists and Widgets
 
You don’t have to delete a TypeList to keep it from showing up on your blog. 
You can simply unpublish it from your blog; it will still exist in your account. 
This is advisable, because you never know when you may want to reapply that 
particular TypeList to one of your blogs.
Finding Creative Uses for TypeLists
You can apply TypeLists to your blog in endless ways, so be creative. 
Maximize your use of this tool to get a great deal of information to your read-
ers in a short space. To get you started in your inventive TypeList thinking, 
here are a few ideas to consider.
Product recommendations
You can use a Books TypeList or a Links TypeList to create a list of product 
recommendations. A fashion blogger, for example, might have a TypeList 
called Must-Have Fashion Pieces for Fall, whereas an outdoor-sports blogger 
might offer My Favorite Hiking Equipment. Use the Books TypeList to recom-
mend Amazon.com items to readers, and be sure you’ve listed your Amazon 
Associates ID with TypePad. To recommend products that aren’t sold at 
Amazon, consider using a Links TypeList so you can link the products manu-
ally to the store you plan to use.
Your favorite blogs
When you link to your favorite blogs, the list you make is referred to as a 
blogroll. It’s an excellent way to engage in the blogging community by pass-
ing around your traffic to other bloggers. You do not need to get someone’s 
permission to link to them, nor do you need their permission to remove 
their link from your list (though we can’t guarantee that their feelings won’t 
be hurt!). Consider calling your blogroll a Rotating Blogroll and then rotate 
new blogs through. Or offer a reciprocal blogroll, telling readers you’ll link 
to anyone who links to you. (Watch it, though: Reciprocal blogrolls can get 
unmanageable quickly, especially if you have a lot of readers.)
 
If you have your heart set on offering your readers an exceedingly long and 
comprehensive blogroll, but you don’t want to lose the valuable sidebar 
space, consider creating a page for your blogroll instead (see Chapter 6). Then 
you can link to that page from your sidebar via a graphic link, as discussed in 
Chapter 11.

156
Part III: Adding Useful Elements to Your TypePad Blog 
Your favorite Web sites
Use a sidebar to point readers toward your favorite nonblogging Web sites 
(you could call it My Favorite Links, or something along those lines). A brief 
list of your favorite links can actually tell your readers quite a bit about you. 
Let’s say, for example, that you list The Sound of Music Fan Club, Golf Digest, 
American Kennel Club, and This Old House. At a glance, a new reader now 
knows that you’re a musical-theater-loving, golf-playing, dog-owning DIY-er!
Places to go
Especially if you blog often about restaurants or travel, consider adding a 
TypeList that points your readers to specific geographical places you’ve trav-
eled to or those you recommend. You can even offer a brief explanation of 
each location in that link’s Notes section (for example, “The best cheesecake 
you’ll ever have!” or “Perfect spot for honeymooners”).
Share more about your blog
Create separate pages containing helpful information about your blog (for 
example, a page with all your contact information, a page containing cus-
tomer testimonials, or a page providing details for potential advertisers). 
Then create a Links or Notes TypeList, and list these items in one place — 
quick and easy information for your readers!
Other places readers can find you
These days, we all seem to have more than one spot online where readers 
can find us. We’ve shown you how you can aggregate all the locations on 
your TypePad Profile (see Chapter 3), but a quick list on your sidebar might 
be helpful for readers, too. For example, use a Links list (perhaps called 
“Where Else You Can Find Me” or “See Also”), and list all your social media 
accounts (Twitter, Facebook, Linked In, Flickr, and so on), as well as any 
other blogs or media outlets where you contribute.
As you can see, the possibilities for TypeLists go on and on. Always keep 
in mind that the point is to keep information clearly organized for your 
readers. Be descriptive in your TypeList titles, and keep them topical and 
frequently updated. For some examples of bloggers using TypeLists well, see 
Chapter 17.

157
 Chapter 8: Using TypeLists and Widgets
Adding Blog Functions with Widgets
If you think TypeLists are awesome, wait until we tell you about widgets. A 
widget is a piece of code that adds a specific function to your blog (such as 
posting your tweets in your blog sidebar as you submit them to Twitter or 
showcasing your latest photos uploaded to Flickr). You can organize your 
widgets and determine how they flow with your TypeLists by using the 
Design tab (we discuss this more in Chapter 11).
Understanding widgets
Widgets are generally produced by a third party and are placed in your side-
bar (not the main posting area). They are made up of JavaScript or HTML 
code that produces a specific function (such as providing a search engine for 
your blog). You can find a widget that pertains to just about any blog topic 
you can think of. For instance, you can find useful widgets that allow your 
users to add your blog to their feed reader with one click, or you can find 
less useful (but fun!) widgets for counting down the days until the next epi-
sode of Lost.
Most widgets are a point–click–install affair. By that, we mean that you find the 
widget you want to use and choose the TypePad option offered, and TypePad 
installs the widget for you. In most cases, you’ll have to provide some basic 
information (such as your blog’s URL) and work your way through a short 
setup process via an easy wizard. All in all, it’s a painless and easy process.
Sometimes, though, you’ll come across a widget that does not have auto-
matic installation, and you’ll have to do some work to get the widget on your 
blog. One example is the Etsy widget, which we mention in “Finding and acti-
vating new widgets.” An easy wizard helps you set up the content of the Etsy 
widget, but you have to copy the JavaScript code and paste it into an Embed 
Your Own HTML widget (discussed in a minute) or a Notes TypeList (dis-
cussed earlier in this chapter).
 
If you’re using Advanced Templates, you have to install all widgets by creat-
ing a new template module (see Chapter 14 for more information about using 
Advanced Templates).
 
Use widgets sparingly. It’s easy to get carried away with the fun stuff you find, 
but remember that widgets are also a distraction. The more clutter you have 
in your sidebar, the harder it is for visitors to find what they’re looking for. 
Depending on the number of widgets you use, they may also cause your blog 
to load slowly.

158
Part III: Adding Useful Elements to Your TypePad Blog 
Using the Embed Your Own HTML widget
The Embed Your Own HTML widget allows you to quickly create a sidebar 
module, place it in your blog design, and save the changes to publish immedi-
ately. The Embed Your Own HTML widget and a Notes TypeList are essentially 
the same; they’re just located in different places on your TypePad Dashboard.
You can find the Embed Your Own HTML widget by choosing 
Design➪Content➪Categories (Widget)➪Modules (Embed Your Own HTML). 
To use the module, follow these instructions:
 
1. Click the Add This Module button.
 
 The Custom HTML pop-up window appears.
 
2. Type a new name in the Label field.
 
 We suggest using a title that reflects the function of the widget. 
Remember, you can hide the title of the widget by using the following, 
changing widget name to the title you want:
<!-- widget name -->
 
3. In the HTML text field, type or paste the code you want to include.
 
4. Click OK.
 
 The widget is saved and placed at the top of your sidebar. You can drag 
and drop the widget to arrange its order on your sidebar.
 
If you decide to unpublish the widget, it will be deleted, and you will not be 
able to access it again. To republish the widget to your sidebar later, you will 
have to rebuild it from scratch.
Finding and activating new widgets
TypePad offers more functionality for your blog through its Widget Gallery 
at www.sixapart.com/typepad/widgets (see Figure 8-11). The widgets 
listed change often; we encourage you to visit frequently to see what’s new. 
Another place to find TypePad-friendly widgets is www.widgetbox.com.
After you’ve activated a widget by using the easy wizard, you’ll see 
TypePad’s Add a Sidebar Widget page (see Figure 8-12), which lists the blogs 
you have on your TypePad account and allows you to select which blogs you 
want to install the widget on. You can also customize the name of the widget.

Part III: Adding Useful Elements to Your TypePad Blog 
After you select the blogs where you’d like to install the widget, click Add 
Widget. A new page appears, with the following link choices:
 
✓ View Weblog: Click this option to see how your blog looks with the new 
widget. Note that because you haven’t ordered your content yet, the 
widget is probably at the bottom of your sidebar.
 
✓ Change Content Ordering: Click this option to visit the Content page in 
your blog’s Dashboard. From here, you can use drag-and-drop content 
ordering (discussed in Chapter 11) to determine the order of your side-
bar items, including your newly installed widget(s).
 
✓ Return to (Widget Site): The text replacing (Widget Site) depends on 
where you found your widget. For example, if you found your widget at 
TypePad, the link will say Return to TypePad Widget Gallery; 
if you found the widget at WidgetBox, the link will say Return to 
WidgetBox. You can click this option to return to the site and find more 
widgets to install.
 
✓ TypePad Home: Click this option to return to the main page of your 
blog’s Dashboard.
If you’re unsure what type of widgets you should include on your blog, we’ve 
come up with a short list to assist you. The following list explains how sev-
eral popular widgets can help you and your readers use your blog more effec-
tively by promoting your content to other social media sites, encouraging 
readers to subscribe to your RSS feed, and showcasing your affiliate market-
ing products (if you’re an affiliate marketer) or Etsy items:
 
✓ Share This (sharethis.com/publishers/getbutton): Readers can 
quickly and easily share your article with social media and social book-
marking sites such as Twitter, StumbleUpon, Digg, and Facebook. We 
explain social media sites and how they can enhance your community 
and blogging experience in Chapter 10.
 
✓ FeedBurner’s Subscribe Now (www.sixapart.com/typepad/
widgets/publishing-tools/feedburner_subs.html): If your 
blog uses FeedBurner for RSS, this widget gives your readers a one-click 
option for subscribing to your blog’s RSS feed.
 
✓ Search field (www.sixapart.com/typepad/widgets/search/): 
Readers will appreciate a way to search your archives for posts of yours 
they previously read and want to locate again. If you have an easy-to-find 
search field in your sidebar, you’ve made it that much easier for readers 
(and you) to find what they’re looking for. Using a search field is much 
better than browsing endlessly through random archives or categories. 
We suggest trying out a few different search fields to see which one 
works best for your blog.

161
 Chapter 8: Using TypeLists and Widgets
 
✓ Etsy Mini (www.etsy.com/mini_generator.php): Are you an Etsy 
vendor who wants to showcase your Etsy shop’s items on your blog? 
Or are you just an Etsy junkie who likes to show off the cool items you 
find on Etsy? This widget allows you to build your own widget (don’t 
worry — an easy wizard walks you through the steps) so you can dis-
play it on your sidebar. This widget doesn’t offer automatic installation, 
though, so you’ll have to copy the JavaScript code, paste it into a Notes 
TypeList, and then publish the TypeList on your blog’s sidebar. Good 
thing we tell you how to do all that in this chapter.
 
✓ LinkWithin (www.linkwithin.com/learn): This attractive widget 
automatically links to related archived posts at the bottom of newly pub-
lished posts. The idea is that if readers enjoyed one post, they may want 
to read more like it; this widget provides links to those related posts.
 
✓ PopShops widget (www.popshops.com/faq/typepad): If you are 
interested in affiliate marketing and have an account with PopShops, 
you can use its widget to earn commissions from Commission Junction, 
LinkShare, Google Affiliate Network, and ShareASale. (For more informa-
tion about making money with your blog, see Chapter 12.)
Turning widgets off and on
Over time, you may find that a widget is no longer useful to your evolving 
blog. To disable a widget, just choose Design➪Content to see your blog’s 
content modules. Find the widget you’d like to disable, and click the red X in 
the top-right corner of the widget module. A pop-up window asks you to con-
firm that you really want to remove the module; click OK. Then scroll down 
the page and click Save Changes. You’ve removed the widget from your side-
bar and have deleted it from your options. To reinstall it, you have to revisit 
the site where you found it and reinstall from scratch.
As you develop your blog and choose what information to share with your 
readers, we’re sure you’ll find this chapter, in particular, helpful. TypeLists 
and widgets are two of the easiest ways to enhance your blog quickly. The 
more you practice with TypeLists and widgets, the easier they become to 
create and manage — and the more you’ll come to depend on them.

Adding Multimedia to Your Blog
In This Chapter
▶ Setting up a new photo album
▶ Displaying a photo album in your blog
▶ Adding a podcast to your blog
▶ Using video on your blog
M
ultimedia includes all kinds of media, such as images, audio, anima-
tion, and video. Given the interactive nature of the Web and blogs in 
general, multimedia options are perfect for encouraging reader response on 
your own blog.
Each of the four TypePad pricing levels offers you the ability to post images, 
audio, and video, but remember that files such as these require considerably 
more server space than a simple text blog post. If you plan to frequently post 
multimedia, you should be sure you’re signed up with a TypePad pricing plan 
that suits your storage needs (see Chapter 2).
Keep in mind that a little multimedia goes a long way on a blog. Visiting a 
page that is heavily packed with video, sound, and moving graphics can 
be visually overwhelming, and it might drive viewers away. For example, a 
common pet peeve among blog readers is autoloading music (that is, blogs 
that automatically play music when you visit them)
If you’re ready to use multimedia with your own blog, read on! We explain how 
you can use TypePad’s photo album feature to showcase your personal images 
and how to use podcasting and video to make your blog more interesting.
Creating Photo Albums and Galleries
Photo albums are one way to showcase groups of photos without having to 
insert them individually into a single post. When you create a TypePad photo 

164
Part III: Adding Useful Elements to Your TypePad Blog 
album, you’re creating a virtual photo album similar to the tangible albums 
you may have at home. Virtual photo albums are particularly useful if
 
✓ You’re a photographer who would like to show your talents grouped 
by genre.
 
✓ You want to document a particular process or event (such as a vacation, 
a home renovation, or your child’s first year).
 
✓ You would like to share new items you’ve made (for instance, you’re a 
craft blogger who wants to show off your newest projects).
We’re sure you can think of a million other uses for incorporating photo albums — 
they’re an excellent tool for sharing snippets of your life with readers.
Follow these steps to get a TypePad photo album up and running:
 
1. Click the Library link on the green account-level bar.
 
2. Choose Photo Albums from the pull-down menu, as shown in Figure 9-1.
 
 The photo album page appears. If you have existing photo albums, 
they’re listed here.
 
3. Click the Add a Photo Album link in the top-right corner.
 
 The Add a Photo Album page appears (see Figure 9-2).

4. Click inside the Photo Album Name text box, and type the name of the 
photo album you’re creating.
 
 Note that as you type the name of your album, you’re also creating a file 
folder (to be housed in File Manager for easy reference) with the same 
name. The name you choose for these items should be descriptive but 
short. The file name is part of your photo album’s URL.
 
5. Click the Create New Photo Album button.
 
 The Upload New Photos page appears, showing a blog-level (blue) bar 
that reflects the name of the photo album you just made (as shown in 
Figure 9-3).
 
 This page has three tabs: Photos, Design, and Settings. We discuss each 
of these tabs shortly, right after we show you how to upload some pic-
tures into this new photo album.
 
6. Use the pull-down menu to select how many files you’d like to upload 
to this photo album.
 
7. Use the Browse button to find the files on your computer that you’d 
like to upload.
 
8. Click the Upload button.
 
 The Photos page appears (note that this is the Photos tab on the blog-
level bar). From here, you can delete photos (click to select the box next 
to each photo you want to delete and then click the red Delete button) 
or upload more photos to this album (click the Upload Photos link).

Choosing your photo album design
Now that you’ve created a TypePad photo album, you need to decide how 
you’d like that album to appear online. To do that, click the Design tab in 
your blue blog-level bar for the photo album you’re working with (choose 
Library➪Photo Albums➪Your Album➪Design tab).
The Design page appears with a list of four links in the left sidebar:
 
✓ Overview
 
✓ Layout
 
✓ Content
 
✓ Style
Let’s discuss each of these in order.
Overview
From the Overview tab, you can change the layout, content, or style of your 
photo album (just click the related link). You can also apply a style from an 

167

existing photo album to the current photo album. To do that, use the pull-
down menu to select the album whose design you’d like to use. Click the Use 
This Album’s Design button to apply the settings.
Layout
Clicking the Layout link takes you to a page that looks like to the one in 
Figure 9-4.
This page allows you to choose how your cover page (the main page of your 
album) and your photo pages are displayed within your blog. You have sev-
eral choices. Your cover page can display
 
✓ Thumbnails only (thumbnails are smaller versions of your original image; 
when clicked, a thumbnail usually links to the larger original image)
 
✓ Thumbnails with descriptions
 
✓ A photo with an explanatory paragraph (similar to an introduction to 
your album)
 
✓ No cover for your album (in which case your album just begins with 
your first photo)

You also have a few options for your photo pages:
 
✓ Thumbnails and Photo Page: This option shows a large photo with a 
thumbnail of the next (and previous, if applicable) photo in the left side-
bar. The page includes text links to the next/previous photo, the album 
cover page, and the permalink for the displayed image.
 
✓ Photo Page with One Column Layout: This option shows a single image 
on the page with small text links in the top-right corner to the next or 
previous images. Any descriptive text appears below the image. (You 
can set descriptive text in the Settings tab, which we cover in a bit.)
 
✓ Photo Page with Two Column Layout: This option is similar to the pre-
ceding option but offers two columns instead of one.
 
✓ No Photo Pages: Instead of having a design attributed to your photo 
pages, readers click a thumbnail on the photo album cover and are 
taken to a page with just that image. There are no thumbnails of next/
previous images or text links to next/previous images.
Content
Let’s go back to the list of links on the left side of your photo album’s Design 
tab. Click the Content link, and you see a page like the one in Figure 9-5.

The Content tab is where you’ll choose what content to include with each 
image as it’s displayed. Click to select the box next to the options that fit 
your needs. You can choose 
 
✓ Photo Title
 
✓ Photo Caption
 
✓ Location
 
✓ Date Taken
 
✓ EXIF Data
 
Don’t forget to click the Save Changes button so you don’t lose your changes.
Style
The last link under your photo album’s Design tab is Style. Click the Style link 
to choose the look and feel for your album. Figure 9-6 shows an example of a 
Style page.
A style is sort of like the theme for your blog, but this style is applied only to your 
photo album. Use the pull-down menu to see how different themes look with your 
album. When you’re happy with the look and feel, click the Save Changes button.

Choosing your photo album settings
As you can with each part of your TypePad blog, you can establish spe-
cific settings for your photo album(s). To do that, click the Settings tab 
in the blog-level bar for the photo album you’re working with (choose 
Library➪Photo Albums➪Your Album➪Settings tab). Figure 9-7 shows an 
example Photo Album Settings tab.
Basics
Within the Settings tab, you have the option of determining your album’s 
name, description, cover images, privacy, and other things:
 
✓ Name of Photo Album (required): This text box shows the name you 
gave the photo album when you created it. You can change the album’s 
name, but that change does not change the name of the folder where 
the album resides. This is a good thing, because even if you change the 
name of the album, any previous links to it still work.
 
✓ Description/Introduction (optional): If you’d like to include an overview 
explaining what an album includes (for example, vacation pictures or 
timeline of a kitchen remodeling), you can type that description here. 
We think it’s handy to provide a description or an introduction to your 
photo albums because it gives your audience context for the images.

 Chapter 9: Adding Multimedia to Your Blog
 
✓ Use a Cover Image/Photo (optional): If you’d like to choose a specific 
image to be the virtual cover of your photo album, click to select this 
option, and then click the Browse button to choose the file you want to 
use as the cover image from your computer.
 
✓ Make This Album Public: If you’d like to share the contents of a photo 
album with the public, click to select the box next to this option. If you’d 
rather keep an album private, you can deselect the box next to this option.
Advanced
Scroll down below the Basics section pictured in Figure 9-7 to the section titled 
Advanced. These settings are set to defaults that generally work best with all 
photo albums. However, if you want to edit these defaults, you can do so.
Your photo album cover page settings are as follows:
 
✓ Number of Columns to Display Thumbnails: This is pretty much what 
it says: TypePad displays the thumbnails from an album on the cover 
page, and you can choose how many columns show.
 
✓ Crop Thumbnails to Uniform Dimensions (Square): If you’d like all the 
thumbnails in an album to be uniform, click to select the box next to this 
option.
 
✓ Thumbnail Size: Click to select which size (small, medium, or large) 
you’d like your photo album thumbnails to be.
 
✓ Date Format: Use the pull-down menu to choose the date format you’d 
like to display with your photo album.
 
✓ Display Order: Use the pull-down menu to choose the order in which 
you’d like to your album images to appear.
Your photo page settings are as follows:
 
✓ Photo Size: When readers click a thumbnail of an image in your photo 
album, they see a larger version of that image. The choice you make in 
Photo Size determines the size of that larger photo. Use the pull-down 
menu to choose whether you’d like your image(s) to appear small (350 
pixels), medium (500 pixels), or large (640 pixels).
 
✓ Date Format: Use the pull-down menu to choose how you’d like the date 
to appear when someone views an image in your photo album.
 
✓ Password Protection: If you’d like to password-protect your images in 
an album, click to select this option. Then click inside the Username and 
Password text boxes, and type the information you want associated with 
this album’s photo pages.
Just as you can post to your blog remotely (see Chapter 5), you can post 
photos to your albums remotely. This option is handy because you never 

172
Part III: Adding Useful Elements to Your TypePad Blog 
know when you’ll capture the perfect shot and want to share it with your 
readers. TypePad assigns you a random e-mail address to which you can 
send photos. The e-mail address is lengthy enough that you most likely won’t 
be able to remember it off the top of your head (it’s about 15 characters long 
and made up of both numbers and letters in a random sequence). If you plan 
to use the remote posting feature, it may be helpful to send yourself an e-mail 
with your TypePad mobile e-mail address as the message. If you want to be 
sure your mobile upload was successful, click to select the Send Me an Email 
Notification option when an e-mail message has been successfully posted.
 
If you’ve made any changes on the Settings page, don’t forget to click the Save 
Changes buttons so your work isn’t lost.
Optimizing images for the Web
When you choose to use images in your blog, it’s worth noting that size mat-
ters. Both the physical pixel size and the digital size of your image have an 
effect on how quickly your blog’s pages load. If a page takes too long to load, 
readers move on. If you’d like to make your photos and images as attractive 
to readers as possible and still have those images load quickly, you need to 
optimize them for the Internet before you use them in your blog.
Optimizing an image for the Web simply means compressing its digital data 
so the image file is smaller and loads faster. When you take a digital picture, 
for instance, a lot of noise is included in the digital file that isn’t necessary for 
the picture to be viewed. You can clean out that noise, and thus make the file 
smaller, simply by choosing Save for Web in your graphic-editing software 
(such as Adobe Photoshop Elements or GIMP). If you don’t have that option in 
your software, save the file in the appropriate format — JPG, GIF, or PNG — 
and choose the smallest file size in that format.
Our advice is to keep your image file size to less than 50KB. Of course, some-
times that’s not possible. In some cases it may be worth it to post a larger 
file. One option would be to make a thumbnail of the image (perhaps 300 
pixels by 300 pixels or smaller) and link it to the larger image. By optimizing 
your images, you’ll be optimizing your site’s download time.
Should I use JPG, GIF, or PNG? 
And what’s the difference?
The three most common file formats for graphics are JPG, GIF, and PNG. Each 
of these file formats is best used for a specific kind of graphic: JPG is used 
for photographs, and PNG or GIF is used for everything else. Why? A JPG file 

173
 Chapter 9: Adding Multimedia to Your Blog
can contain millions of colors, but GIF files can be saved only with up to 256 
colors. PNG files were created to replace the GIF format and can be saved as 
8-, 24-, or 64-bit images and are about 20 percent smaller than GIF images.
 
If you are posting digital photos, save your file as .jpg; if you’re posting any 
other sort of image (such as line art, like a cartoon), save your file as .png.
Podcasting on TypePad
Podcasting is simply broadcasting audio files (for example, voice files, music 
files, or a combination) via the Internet. Sometimes people lump video in with 
podcasting, but in this section, we’re talking about only audio podcasts; we 
discuss video in the next section.
Podcasting equipment
Podcasting is a fairly easy way to incorporate 
multimedia into your blog. All you need are a 
computer, Internet access, a microphone, and 
audio-editing software. Because you’re reading 
this book, chances are high that you already 
have a computer and Internet access. The 
microphone you choose may cost anywhere 
from $20 to $200. Any time you’re just trying 
something out, and you have to buy something, 
we suggest that you go for the midrange item. 
Why spend hundreds of dollars on something 
you may not pursue? However, if you decide 
podcasting is an integral part of your blogging 
adventure, it’s a good idea to choose quality 
peripherals (such as your microphone). A good 
mic can make the difference between a so-so 
podcast and a phenomenal sensation that 
sweeps the land. Think about it: Do you want 
to listen to a grainy podcast with inconsistent 
sound levels? Neither does your audience.
If you’re wondering which audio-editing soft-
ware to use, we have a few suggestions for you:
 ✓ Audacity (audacity.sourceforge.
net) is an easy-to-use, popular podcasting 
software option, and it’s free. It’s available 
for Windows, Mac, and even Linux. It saves 
your podcast to MP3 (the most popular 
format for podcasts)
 ✓ Adobe Audition (www.adobe.com/
products/audition) is an option 
when you’re ready to take things to the 
professional level. Professional podcasting 
software comes with a professional price 
tag, though. Be prepared to shell out about 
$350 for Adobe Audition.
 ✓ GarageBand (www.apple.com/
ilife) is included with the Mac software 
iLife (Macs come with a 30-day trial of iLife). 
iLife is affordably priced and includes not 
only GarageBand, but also iPhoto, iMovie, 
iWeb, and iDVD.
When you’ve created and edited your podcast so 
that it’s just right, you’ll need to save it as an MP3 
file, which is still the most popular format for 
podcasts. However, as we’ve noted, multimedia 
files of all kinds can be quite large. You can make 
your podcast file smaller by using an audio rate 
of 128 Kbps. You may even be able to use a smaller 
bit rate, but be sure to listen to the podcast and 
make sure it’s not too lossy (that is, there’s a 
noticeable degradation in the end sound quality).

174
Part III: Adding Useful Elements to Your TypePad Blog 
You can link to podcasts from your blog and even upload them to iTunes. 
We assume that if you’re interested in podcasting, you’ve already researched 
how to start podcasting, but you need our help to show you how to integrate 
your podcast with your TypePad blog. You can do so in a few ways.
Sharing audio files in your blog post couldn’t be easier with TypePad. We 
explain how in the following instructions:
 
1. Click the Insert Audio button on the Dashboard (it looks like musical 
notes).
 
 The Upload an Audio File pop-up appears.
 
2. Click the Browse button, and find the file you want to upload.
 
3. Click Upload File.
 
 MP3 files appear as inline audio players, but other file formats (such as 
WAV) appear as links that ask the user to download the file so they can 
listen to it.
Linking from File Manager
When you include an audio file in your post by clicking the Insert Audio 
button, TypePad automatically places that file in the Files folder in File 
Manager. TypePad also places image and video files in the Files folder if you 
haven’t manually uploaded the files to another folder yourself.
Why podcast?
Podcasting can add a new dimension to your 
blog and draw in your readers. However, not 
every blog niche lends itself to podcasting, so 
consider whether your blog can benefit from a 
podcast. Here are some examples of how pod-
casting can benefit you and your readers:
 ✓ Your readers may enjoy downloading your 
podcast so they can listen to it at their lei-
sure. A podcast is sort of like a portable 
blog post that your readers can download 
to their MP3 player, smartphone, or other 
portable device and listen to when it’s con-
venient for them. If you upload your pod-
casts to iTunes, it’s especially easy for your 
readers to take advantage of this option. 
Read more about using iTunes for your pod-
casts at www.apple.com/itunes/
podcasts/specs.html.
 ✓ Interviewing other people in your niche 
is interesting, and doing it via podcasting 
allows your readers to hear the inflections 
they may miss by reading a transcript of the 
interview.
 ✓ Podcasts are one more way to bring your 
audience into your community. You are 
providing a voice to go with your writing, 
sharing a new part of yourself.

 Chapter 9: Adding Multimedia to Your Blog
Using File Manager instead of the Insert Audio button allows you to decide 
where your files are stored within File Manager, which in turn helps you 
locate files easily. If you’d like more control over how your individual files 
are managed, we suggest that you forgo the Insert Audio button and use File 
Manager instead. We explain how to do this in the following instructions:
  
1. Compose your blog post as usual, and save it as a draft.
 
2. Open File Manager (choose Library➪File Manager).
 
3. Find the folder to which you want to upload your audio file, and 
open it.
 
 See Chapter 4 for detailed advice on setting up an intuitive filing system.
 
4. Click inside the Upload a New File text box (as shown in Figure 9-8) or 
click the Browse button.
 
5. Choose the file you’d like to upload, and click the Upload button.
 
 The file is listed in File Manager.
 
6. Click the Link icon next to the file you uploaded (the icon looks like a 
piece of chain link).
 
 A pop-up window appears with the necessary code for inserting the link 
to this audio file within your blog post.
 
7. Click inside the pop-up window, and select and copy the code.

8. Click the Close button.
 
9. Return to your blog post, and click the HTML tab.
 
10. Paste the link code where you’d like it to appear within your blog post.
 
11. Preview your post, and make changes as necessary.
 
12. Publish your blog post.
 
 You now have a link to your audio file in your blog post. If you’d like the 
file to show as an inline audio player instead of a link, you need to use 
<embed> code (explained next).
Using <embed> code
To have your audio show up as an inline audio player instead of a link to 
download the file, you need to use <embed> code. Note that if you use the 
Insert Audio button on your Compose toolbar, TypePad automatically includes 
the <embed> code. But if you insert your audio file manually by using the 
File Manager method described previously, you have to manually insert the 
<embed> code into your post. The following instructions explain how to do that:
 
1. Compose your blog post as usual.
 
2. Upload the file to File Manager, and create a link to the audio file (see 
the preceding section).
 
3. Click the HTML tab in the post editor.
 
 Look for the following HTML code:
<a href=“http://blogname.typepad.com/weblog/files/podcastname.mp3”>Download 
Testpodcast</a>
 
4. Edit the code to look like this:
<embed src=“http://blogname.typepad.com/weblog/files/audio.mp3” 
controller=“true” autoplay=“false” autostart=“0” loop=“false” 
height=“50” width=“150”></embed>
 
 This HTML code tells the browser to display a controller within your 
blog post that allows your readers to play the podcast. You can change 
the values of the HTML code to change the appearance and action of the 
controller. For example, you can change the height and width values to 
change the size of the controller. Or you can change the autoplay value 
to “true” if you’d like to have the controller automatically play the 
audio file when someone arrives at your blog.
 
 We strongly suggest you do not use autoplay music on your blog. 
Autoplaying audio is not only annoying and surprising to your visitors, 
but it’s also a bandwidth hog and makes your blog load slowly.
 
5. Save or publish your post.

177
 Chapter 9: Adding Multimedia to Your Blog
If you decide to host a podcast, it’s up to you how you’ll structure your 
show. Will you find theme music? If so, keep copyright issues in mind. Will 
you read your content from a script or speak off the cuff? Either option can 
be a great success; it ultimately boils down to your own style and comfort 
level. However you set up your podcast, plan! Even a few basic notes or a 
simple outline go a long way toward keeping you on track. For more informa-
tion, check out Podcasting For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Tee Morris, Chuck 
Tomasi, Evo Terra, and Kreg Steppe.
Adding Video to Your Blog
Video is one more way to share content with your readers. You can share 
a video you’ve made yourself or a video you found on YouTube (or another 
video-hosting site). With so many people (bloggers and nonbloggers alike) 
uploading and sharing content via sites such as YouTube, the process for 
sharing video on a blog has become simple.
When should you use video in your blog? Well, video is ideal if you are 
providing a tutorial. Although written instructions are always appreciated, 
seeing how to do something allows your audience to connect visually with 
your instructions. This can be helpful whether you’re teaching your readers 
how to start a campfire, sew on a button, or insert video into a blog post! A 
video tutorial saves you from having to write lengthy step-by-step instruc-
tions, and it helps your readers understand better. All you need are a way 
to capture your video (a digital camcorder, a digital camera, or downloaded 
software) and the ability to upload your video to a video-sharing site.
Some bloggers offer their readers video posts in place of written text posts, 
addressing the camera (and, thus, their readers) on their topic of choice. 
Some readers love this, and others would prefer text — but you, we hope, 
know your readers best. If a video post would be well-received by your read-
ers, give it a try. We encourage you to make a plan, though — a long, disorga-
nized, rambling video is not putting your best foot forward.
Sharing video from a third-party site
Two of the most popular places to host shareable videos are YouTube (www.
youtube.com) and Vimeo (vimeo.com). These two sites (and many others) 
make sharing their videos easy. For ease of understanding, we’ll use sharing a 
video from YouTube in our instructions.
Visit YouTube, and find the video you’d like to share. On the page where 
you view the video, look at the bluish-gray square to the right of the video. 
That square contains information about the video, including two text boxes 
labeled URL and Embed, as shown in Figure 9-9.

178
Part III: Adding Useful Elements to Your TypePad Blog 
At this point, you have a choice about how to share this video. You can 
simply provide your readers a link to the video (they click the link and watch 
the video at YouTube, not your blog), or you can embed the video in your 
post so viewers can see it at your blog, with no clicking away from your site 
required. Depending on which option you choose, follow the appropriate 
instructions in the next sections.
Video-creation software and video-hosting sites
Video you share with your audience may be 
called different names: screencast, vlog, or 
video podcast. Each term essentially refers to 
the fact that it’s video on your blog. If you’re 
interested in trying your hand at a video blog, 
TechSmith has a few options that help you dip 
your toes in the video water:
 ✓ Camtasia (www.techsmith.com/
camtasia.asp): This site is available 
for both Windows and Mac. You can sign 
up for a 30-day, fully-functional trial of the 
software. If you’re happy with what you 
see, you can buy the software for $299.
 ✓ Jing (www.jingproject.com/
features): This site is a good option 
if you just want to make short videos or 
try out vlogging to see if it’s a fit. You can 
create screen captures or even create a 
short, five-minute video and share it imme-
diately. Jing offers a free version as well as 
an affordable Pro version for $14.95/year.
Here’s a handy tip: Save or convert your video 
to MP4 instead of using AVI. Making this con-
version shrinks your video files, which gives 
you faster download time.
After you start vlogging, you have several 
options for hosting those videos so they don’t 
take up room at your TypePad account. Here’s 
a list of some hosting sites to check out. You’ll 
want to read each site’s policies on copyright, 
file size, privacy, adult content, and publicity to 
determine if the site is a good fit:
 ✓ YouTube (www.youtube.com): This site 
is probably the most popular of the video-
hosting sites and allows you to make your 
own channel so all your videos are on a 
single page.
 ✓ Vimeo (www.vimeo.com): Vimeo allows 
you to post videos and create communi-
ties around them. You can also create a 
personal channel where you showcase all 
your videos.
 ✓ NewBaby (www.newbaby.com): This 
site is geared toward women sharing infor-
mation, but it’s not limited to women with 
new babies. In addition to videos with par-
enting tips, NewBaby hosts video on every-
thing from fitness and exercise to finance 
and product reviews.
 ✓ Blip (blip.tv): Blip.tv is different from 
other video-hosting sites because it 
focuses on helping independent creators 
of episodic videos showcase their content.
 ✓ Flickr (www.flickr.com): Flickr is best 
known as an image-hosting site, but it also 
hosts videos.

Linking to or embedding a video
Whether you want to include a video in your blog post or just want to link 
to the video (but not have the video appear in your blog), TypePad lets 
you do that with ease. To begin, copy either the <embed> code (to show 
the actual video in your blog post) or the URL information (to link to the 
video but not show it in your post) at YouTube to the clipboard, and follow 
these steps:
 
1. Compose your blog post as usual, using the TypePad editor.
 
 Include a description of the video you are linking to.
 
2. Highlight the sentence(s) you want to use as the link to the video.
 
3. Click the Insert Video icon (it looks like a piece of movie film) on the 
toolbar.
 
 The Insert Video pop-up window appears.

180
Part III: Adding Useful Elements to Your TypePad Blog 
 
4. Choose which option you want to use:
 
• To link to the video (without showing it in your post): Paste the 
URL of the video in the Link URL text box.
 
• To show the video in your post: Paste the <embed> code into the 
Embed text field.
 
5. Click Insert Video.
 
6. Save or publish your blog post as usual.
Sharing video from File Manager
If you take your own video and would like to share it with your audience, 
your best bet is to set up an account at a video-hosting site and embed your 
videos in your blog from there, using the previous instructions.
If you’d rather host your video in TypePad File Manager, however, you have a 
few options. You can
 
✓ Upload the video file to File Manager
 
✓ Insert the video as a file
 
✓ Use <embed> code
Instructions for each of these options follow.
Link from File Manager
Uploading your video to File Manager and linking to it in a blog post allows 
you to decide where your file is stored in File Manager.
 
When you upload video to File Manager, it may take a while for TypePad to 
receive the video, depending on the file’s size. Because of this delay, TypePad 
suggests hosting your video files on a video-sharing site. These third-party sites 
are optimized for serving video, so you’ll be able to access your video sooner.
The following instructions explain how to upload and link to a video file from 
File Manager:
 
1. Compose your blog post as usual, and save it as a draft.
 
2. Open File Manager (choose Library➪File Manager).
 
3. Find the folder to which you want to upload your audio file, and open it.
 
4. Click inside the Upload New File text box or click the Browse button.
 
5. Choose the file you’d like to upload and then click the Upload button.
 
 The file is listed in File Manager.

181
 Chapter 9: Adding Multimedia to Your Blog
 
6. Click the link icon next to the file you uploaded (the icon looks like a 
piece of chain link).
 
 A pop-up window appears with the necessary code for inserting the link 
to this audio file within your blog post.
 
7. Click inside the pop-up window, and select and copy the code.
 
8. Click the Close button.
 
9. Return to your blog post, and click the HTML tab.
 
10. Paste the link code where you’d like it to appear within your blog 
post.
 
 Notice that your post now shows a link that allows your readers to 
download your video. If you would rather have the video embedded 
within your post, please see the instructions below for using <embed> 
code.
 
11. Preview your post, make changes as necessary, and then publish 
your post.
Insert your video as a file
Inserting your video as a file automatically stores your uploaded file in 
a generic folder called Files in File Manager. Any files (video, audio, text, 
images, and so on) uploaded via the Insert File link on the Compose editor 
toolbar are stored in the same folder in File Manager. This could make it dif-
ficult for you to find your files efficiently.
To insert your video using the Insert File button from the Compose toolbar, 
follow these instructions:
 
1. Compose your blog post as usual in the Compose editor.
 
2. Place the cursor where you would like to insert your file.
 
3. Click the Insert File icon on the toolbar.
 
 The icon looks like a piece of paper with a green arrow on it (see Figure 
9-10). A pop-up window appears.

4. Click the Browse button, and find the audio file you want to include in 
your blog post.
 
5. Click the Upload File button.
 
 TypePad inserts a link to the file within your post. If you would rather 
have the video embedded within your post, see the following instruc-
tions for using <embed> code.
Use <embed> code
If you plan to use <embed> code to embed an audio controller in your post, 
be aware that this requires you to change some HTML code within your post. 
The following instructions explain how to insert your video into your post by 
using <embed> code:
 
1. Compose your blog post as usual.
 
2. Upload the file either to File Manager or via the Insert File button on 
the toolbar (see the preceding section).
 
3. Click the HTML tab in the top-right corner of the Compose editor.
 
 Look for HTML code similar to this:
<a href=“http://blogname.typepad.com/weblog/files/movie.wmv”>Download 
Testpodcast</a>
 
4. Edit the code to look like this:
<embed autostart=“0” src=“http://blogname.typepad.com/ weblog/files/movie.
wmv” height=“XXX” width=“XXX”>
 
 This code tells the browser to display a video window in your blog post 
that allows your readers to play the video.
 
 You must change the height and width values to match your video. If you 
don’t know these values, make your best guess and change the values as 
necessary. We usually start by using 300 for both the height and width.
 
5. Save or publish your post.
Experiment with the types of multimedia files that might be of interest to 
your readers. Whether you post video, audio, or photos, these additions can 
add an entirely new dimension to your blog community, giving you new and 
creative ways to connect with your readers.

f you’ve read a single technology headline in the last three years, you’ve 
surely heard the phrase social media — it’s the darling of the hour. As 
people look for more ways to connect to one another online, and as corpora-
tions enter the fray seeking to establish bonds with customers, social media 
is quickly becoming a cornerstone of the online experience.
In this chapter, we tell you what social media is, how it works, and how you 
can incorporate it on your TypePad blog. If you’re a small-business owner, you 
might like the tips on enhancing your marketing efforts through social media.
Understanding Key Social Media Sites
Social media refers to the information sharing and gathering that takes place 
in relational, online forums. Blogs are a big part of social media, of course, but 
social media also encompasses interactive sites such as Facebook, Twitter, 
FriendFeed, and others. Any Web site that allows people to connect with one 
another and share information qualifies to sit under the social media umbrella.
And it’s an umbrella that’s growing. Every day, new sites join countless exist-
ing ones to provide people a place to build online community. An entire 
industry has been created as social media consultants advise bloggers and 
corporations on the best ways to navigate the social media waters. The 
bottom line? You can’t be everywhere at once. Unless you plan to spend your 
every waking moment online (we don’t recommend it!), you’ll have to pick 
and choose which online communities are the best fit for you. In this chapter, 
we provide an overview of the key social media sites TypePad integrates into 
your blogging experience: Twitter, Facebook, FriendFeed, and Flickr.

Part III: Adding Useful Elements to Your TypePad Blog 
 
As with any community — online or not — the more involved you are, the 
more people accept you as part of their group. As you offer items and com-
ments to various social networking sites, you’re building your credibility (as 
well as your brand). It’s a good idea to promote others in your community 
more than you promote yourself. People tend to be put off if you’re constantly 
tooting your own horn.
Adding Your Social Networks 
to Your Blog
TypePad is committed to harnessing the power of social media and handing 
the reins to its users. The redesign of TypePad in 2009 was centered largely 
on the goal of turning your blog into the hub of your online community. 
From your TypePad blog, you can reach out to your other networks (Twitter, 
Facebook, and so on). The new software developments are geared toward full 
control for the user.
In Chapter 3, we explain your TypePad Profile, a handy tool for aggregat-
ing your online presences into one central hub. Likewise, in Chapter 6, we 
explain how you can share your posts with Twitter, Facebook, or FriendFeed 
as you publish them. TypePad also allows your readers to share comments 
they leave at your blog with their own Facebook or Twitter communities (see 
Chapter 7 for an overview of your comment options). Built-in features like 
these allow you to streamline the management of your online community.
One of TypePad’s goals is to make it easier to manage your online presence by 
integrating all your social media accounts. Although TypePad has always worked 
well with Flickr, now Six Apart has specifically integrated the most popular social 
media tools with your TypePad blogging account. TypePad allows you to
 
✓ Sign in using a third-party social media account such as Facebook or 
Twitter (your TypePad account recognizes it’s you; a commenter can 
also sign in with his or her social media account to leave a comment)
 
✓ Share your newest post with your Twitter, Facebook, and FriendFeed 
communities (see Chapter 6)
 
✓ Insert links at the end of each post so your readers can share your post 
with social media sites (see Chapter 11)
 
✓ Connect your other social media profiles to your TypePad Profile (see 
Chapter 3)

185
 Chapter 10: Exploring Social Media
Although your other social media accounts appear only as links in your 
TypePad Profile’s page, those links are a handy way to share your informa-
tion with readers who visit that page. Readers only have to click the relevant 
link to connect with you anywhere online.
The rest of this section defines and explains how some of the integrated 
social media communities (Twitter, Facebook, FriendFeed, and Flickr) work 
and how you can make the most of them as you build your social media 
community.
Twitter
Twitter (twitter.com) allows you to share your thoughts, ideas, and 
updates in 140 characters or fewer. It’s evolved from a tool that allowed 
people to give short updates about their lives to a microblog (a short update 
or snapshot of time) tool used by millions to exchange ideas, promote brands 
and links, and make connections across the globe.
Setting up a Twitter account is easy. Just visit twitter.com and click the 
Sign Up Now button. You’ll be asked for your full name, the username you 
would like, a password, and your e-mail address. Your Twitter username can 
be anything you like (as long as it’s not already taken), but we suggest that 
you consider a few things when choosing your Twitter handle:
 
✓ Shorter is better. You get only 140 characters per tweet, and your user-
name counts toward those 140 when someone addresses directly on 
Twitter (using the @ symbol directly in front of your username).
 
✓ Promote your brand. If readers and peers know you more through 
your brand than as your personal name, use the brand as your Twitter 
handle.
 
✓ Promote yourself. These days it’s not uncommon for your brand to be 
you. If that’s the case, see if you can secure your name as your Twitter 
ID. In fact, it’s always a good idea to secure your name in as many online 
venues as possible, even if you’re not active with that account. You just 
never know how things are going to work out, and it’s nice to have that 
base covered.
After you create your Twitter account, you can start finding and following 
your friends who also have Twitter accounts. When you follow someone, you 
see their tweets and can respond if you like. If they follow you, they’ll see 
your tweets as well. If you’re following each other, you can also send a DM 
(direct message) or private messages to each other.

186
Part III: Adding Useful Elements to Your TypePad Blog 
As you start using Twitter, here are a few words you’ll want to be familiar with:
 
✓ Tweet: A tweet is simply any message typed in Twitter. The message can 
be up to 140 characters long.
 
✓ Twitter stream: This is a list of the updates from other Twitter users. 
When you follow someone (that is, you keep track of their updates), any 
tweets they post show up in your twitter stream.
Twitter etiquette
Yes, even Twitter has best practices and 
accepted behavior. You’d be surprised at how 
much you can pack into 140 characters — and 
how you do it matters. Here’s a list of Twitter 
dos and don’ts:
 ✓ Do customize your Twitter Profile page. 
Upload an avatar, share your blog’s URL, 
write a bio. You can find advice about 
customizing your background by search-
ing customize Twitter profile in your favor-
ite search engine. A personalized profile 
shows that you’re part of the community. 
You know who doesn’t customize their 
profiles? Spammers. You don’t want to be 
mistaken for one of them.
 ✓ Do share ideas and thoughts. Bring some-
thing to the table. When you find your online 
community, you’ll soon see what interests 
them (and you). Add to that community 
by sharing links, re-tweeting interesting 
tweets, and commenting on what you’re 
seeing. As we mention in Chapter 18, link-
ing to items other than your own articles 
builds goodwill and community. Being a 
respected part of the community means 
sharing with the community and promoting 
others. If you’re linking only to your stuff, 
people notice and lose interest quickly. 
Also, when you share a link, make a brief 
comment about it. People are more likely to 
click a link if it has context.
 ✓ Do be interesting. Twitter gets a bad rap 
(often deservedly so) for offering users 
trivial, useless information. A well-written 
tweet, whether it’s funny, informative, or 
moving, is possible, though. Find clever 
ways to offer your followers something 
valuable or entertaining in a short space — 
it gets easier with practice.
 ✓ Don’t send an automatic DM thanking some-
one for following you. (DM stands for direct 
message; it’s essentially a private tweet.) 
Even if you are trying to be appreciative and 
are trying to let the person know you’re glad 
they’ve followed you, resist the urge to send 
an automated “thanks-for-following-me” 
DM. Many in the Twitter community look 
at these DMs as spam. Some people may 
ignore it; others unfollow you for it.
 ✓ Don’t use your public Twitter stream for a 
private conversation. Use the DM feature 
for conversations that go on for more than 
a tweet or two or that are private. Just as in 
blogging, your community doesn’t have to 
be privy to everything.
 ✓ Don’t use Twitter as your personal adver-
tising space. It’s okay to tweet your latest 
blog post, but just be sure it’s not all you’re 
tweeting. Twitter is a community, and it’s 
all about the give and take. If you’re always 
taking (promoting only yourself and your 
products), people start to ignore you.

187
 Chapter 10: Exploring Social Media
 
✓ Re-tweet: If someone likes what you’ve tweeted or wants to share a com-
ment about something you’ve tweeted, that user may re-tweet your mes-
sage with RT at the beginning. Here’s an example of a re-tweet:
 
RT @chilihead I’m co-authoring TypePad for 
Dummies with @rocksinmydryer! So excited!
The original Twitter page you see when you sign up doesn’t offer a lot of 
functionality. You can’t automatically shorten URLs (and those take up pre-
cious character count!), and you have to manually refresh your browser page 
to see if anything new has come up in your Twitter stream. Just about every-
one who Twitters uses a third-party program to keep track of their Twitter 
community because, among other things, those applications allow you to 
shorten URLs and have one-click direct messaging. Here are a few Twitter 
applications you may want to try:
 
✓ HootSuite (hootsuite.com)
 
✓ PowerTwitter (addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/9591)
 
✓ TweetDeck (tweetdeck.com)
 
✓ Twhirl (www.twhirl.org)
You can share pictures, video, and even music via Twitter if you have the 
right applications. These are the ones we’ve found to be popular:
 
✓ Share pictures via Twitpic (twitpic.com) or Flickr (www.flickr.com/
help/sharing/#953361)
 
✓ Share videos via Vidly (vidly.com/?twitvid) or Twiddeo (beta.
twiddeo.com)
 
✓ Share music clips via Blip.fm (blip.fm) or Twt.fm (twt.fm)

Facebook
Facebook (www.facebook.com) is a social network offering personal and 
business profile pages, fan pages, and group pages. You can share pictures, 
video, Web links, and personal updates via your profile or page.
Facebook is the largest social network going right now. Why is it 300 million 
strong? Like all good social media, it allows you to customize and filter the 
information you view based on your interests and the recommendations of 
your friends.

188
Part III: Adding Useful Elements to Your TypePad Blog 
To set up a Facebook account, go to www.facebook.com and complete the 
short sign-up form. Next, complete your profile information, which is one of 
the most important things you can do when you are using social media. At a 
minimum, you should include a picture of yourself and some basic informa-
tion (your interests, a link to your blog, and so on). Deciding whether you 
want your page to be primarily personal, business, or a combination of the 
two determines what information you share.
When your profile is complete, start looking for friends. Point your browser 
to www.facebook.com/find-friends to use your e-mail contacts to find 
potential Facebook friends, or use the search feature to find people you know 
or companies you’re familiar with.
As your Facebook community grows, you may find yourself overwhelmed 
with the amount of information streaming through your news feed. The key 
to managing any social media presence is knowing how to manage your infor-
mation. In the following sections, we tell you how to manage your news feed 
with lists and untag yourself in a photo.
Managing your news feed with lists
When you have several hundred friends, your news feed can be a jumble. You 
may miss useful news, links, or updates. One way to control what information 
you see and when is to create and assign lists to your friends. Depending on 
how you use your Facebook account, you may have both personal and pro-
fessional contacts. You may want to start by creating lists for family, friends, 
professional colleagues, and so on.
To create a new list, follow these instructions:
 
1. Sign in to Facebook, and go to your Home page.
 
 Note that your Home page is different from your Profile page. Look at 
the top of your page, and click the Home link to make sure you’re on the 
right page.
 
2. Click the More button under the left column to reveal more news feed 
options.
 
3. Click the Create New List link at the bottom of the expanded left column.
 
 A pop-up window appears.
 
4. In the text field, type the name of the list.
 
 You can name your list whatever you like (for example, family, friends, 
or professional contacts).
 
5. Click the name or profile picture of the people you want to include in 
this list.
 
 You can either scroll down the list and choose people or do a quick 
search for specific friends using the search field.

189
 Chapter 10: Exploring Social Media
 
6. Click Create List.
 
 A new Facebook List appears in the left column. Now, instead of sifting 
through your news feed, you can click a specific list to see what those 
people have shared recently.
You can repeat these instructions to create as many lists as you like.
Untagging unflattering or unprofessional photos
When you share photos with your Facebook community, you have the 
opportunity to tag photos with the names of others who are in the picture. 
Of course, this means others can also tag you in their photos. When you are 
tagged in someone else’s photo, that photo appears in your Photo tab, and 
your entire Facebook community can see it (as well as the communities of 
anyone else tagged in that picture). Sometimes, photos surface that you’d 
rather not be openly associated with. If you’d like to untag yourself in a 
photo, follow these instructions:
 
1. Open the picture in which you’re tagged.
 
 You can usually find it by going to the Photos tab in your Facebook pro-
file. The top of the Photos page shows all the photos in which you’ve 
been tagged. Click to open the photo you want to untag.
 
2. Click the Remove Tag link under the photo.
 
 You are no longer tagged in that photo, and no one can re-tag you later.
Of course, those photos are still out there, and people could search for a spe-
cific photo (especially if they know someone in the picture with you and that 
person’s tag is functional). To keep others from searching for photos of you, 
you’ll need to configure your Facebook preferences as follows:
 
1. Use your cursor to hover over the Settings link on your Facebook 
profile.
 
 A menu appears.
 
2. Choose Privacy from the menu.
 
 The privacy setting page appears.
 
3. Click the Profile link.
 
 Your profile settings page appears. Find the option labeled Photos 
Tagged of You.
 
4. Choose Customize from the Photos Tagged of You pull-down menu.
 
 The Photos Tagged of You pop-up window appears, asking “Who can see 
this?”
 
5. Click to select Only Me.
 
6. Click OK.

190
Part III: Adding Useful Elements to Your TypePad Blog 
Facebook can’t stop others from posting pictures of you and tagging you in 
those pictures. However, by setting your privacy options as just shown, the 
tag that shows up in the picture does not link to your Facebook profile.
FriendFeed
FriendFeed (friendfeed.com) allows you to track your many social net-
working accounts from a single place in real time. In addition, you can 
include items for your social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, 
Flickr, your blog, Delicious, Google Reader, YouTube, or even Amazon. 
Whatever you post on the networks you share with your FriendFeed account 
automatically shows up in your FriendFeed stream as well.
When an item appears in your FriendFeed stream (whether from you or a 
friend), you can “like” or “share” or “comment” on that item. You can even 
have a real-time conversation via chat about a topic.
FriendFeed has several applications you can use to streamline your 
FriendFeed use:
 
✓ BuddyFeed ($2.99) is available from the iTunes App Store. It allows you 
to track your FriendFeed stream by using your iPhone or iPod touch.
 
✓ FriendFeed offers several widgets you can include on your blog’s 
sidebar. You can find these at friendfeed.com/embed. Use a Notes 
TypeList or the Embed Your Own HTML widget (see Chapter 8) to 
include one in your blog.
 
✓ FriendFeed Notifier (friendfeed.com/settings/notifier) allows 
you to access your FriendFeed account directly from your computer’s 
desktop.
Publishing Flickr photos on your blog
Flickr.com is a photo and video-sharing Web site. Flickr is linked to your 
Yahoo! ID, if you have one, and it takes only a minute to register. After you’ve 
registered with Flickr, you can start uploading your photos and videos to 
your account and editing them if necessary (Flickr partners with Picnik for 
photo editing). Then you can start sharing those photos with friends and 
family or with everyone (you can set the level of privacy you want through 
your account page). You can also join groups related to your own interests.
Another feature Flickr offers is tagging your photos with Creative Commons 
(creativecommons.org) information to let others know how you’re willing 

191
 Chapter 10: Exploring Social Media
to share your photos. You can determine whether you want a photo to have 
all rights reserved or if you’re okay with people using your photo as long 
as they give the proper attribution. You can choose among several options 
when using Creative Commons.
 
If you are looking at Flickr to find images you can use on your site, you need to 
check the Creative Commons license of the image before you use it. It’s illegal 
to use images without the permission of the owner. If the image doesn’t have 
a Creative Commons license associated with it, you have to contact the owner 
directly to ask permission to use the image.
Flickr allows you to group your photos into sets or collections. Sets are indi-
vidual groups of photos (such as Trevor & Ewan’s Playground Adventure or 
Disney World 2004). A collection is a selection of sets (or other collections) 
that relate to a broader theme (such as family or travel).
If you already have your photos loaded to Flickr and prefer to use those for 
your blog instead of uploading them to TypePad File Manager, you can do 
that. Flickr simply requires that you post a link back to Flickr any time you 
link a photo from its site (www.flickr.com/guidelines.gne).
You can use Flickr photos on your blog in three ways:
 
✓ Cut and paste the HTML related to a specific photo into your TypePad 
blog post.
 
✓ Link your blog to your Flickr account and write a post in Flickr that 
posts to your TypePad account.
 
✓ Embed a Flickr slideshow in your post.
We tell you how to achieve each of those options next.
Post Flickr pictures via TypePad
Posting Flickr photos on your TypePad blog is a simple process. We think it’s 
easiest if you have two tabs open in your browser: one opened to your Flickr 
account and one opened to the TypePad post you’re working on. Then follow 
these steps:
 
1. Find the photo you want to use via Flickr.
 
 Remember that if the image is not yours, you must have permission to 
use it from the owner.
 
 You should see a page similar to the one in Figure 10-1. You know you’re 
on the correct page if you see the toolbar above the photo. If you don’t 
see the toolbar, click the photo until you do.

2. Click All Sizes on the toolbar.
 
 A new page appears with your picture and several size options above it 
(as shown in Figure 10-2).
 
3. Click the photo size that works with your blog.
 
 A new page appears that shows you how big the image will look.
 
 We prefer to use either Small or Thumbnail. We’ve found that anything 
larger sometimes doesn’t fit within the content column of our blogs.
 
 You have two HTML options:
 
• Complete HTML to embed the photo in your post. To use this 
option, continue to Step 4.
 
• A simple URL you can use to link a word to the photo. To use this 
option, continue to Step 5.
 
4. To use the HTML option to embed the photo in your post:
 
a. Copy the HTML <embed> code.
 
 Click inside the box to highlight the code and then press Ctrl+C 
(PC) or Command+C (Mac) to copy the code.

193

b. Return to your TypePad post, and click the HTML tab.
 
c. Paste the code into your post.
 
d. Click the Rich Text tab to see how your photo appears in 
your post.
 
e. Save and publish your post as usual.
 
 You’re finished; you don’t need to continue past this point.
 
5. To instead use a URL to link a word to the photo:
 
a.  Copy the URL, and return to your TypePad post.
 
b. Highlight the word(s) you want to link to the photo.
 
c. Click the link icon in your post toolbar (it looks like a piece of 
chain link).
 
d. Paste the URL you copied at Flickr into the URL field in the 
pop-up Link Options box.
 
e. Click OK.
 
f. Save and publish your post as usual.

Post Flickr pictures through Flickr
It’s easy to upload a photo to Flickr and blog about it immediately without 
having to open your TypePad account. You just need to associate your 
TypePad blog with your Flickr account. To do that, follow these instructions:
 
1. Sign in to your Flickr.com account.
 
2. Click the arrow next to You in the Flickr navigation bar.
 
 A larger pull-down menu appears.
 
3. Choose Your Account from the menu options.
 
 Your account page appears. You see four navigation tabs: Personal 
Information, Privacy & Permissions, Email, and Extending Flickr.
 
4. Click the Extending Flickr tab.
 
 Find the Your Blogs section of the Extending Flickr page.
 
5. Click Configure your Flickr-to-blog settings.
 
 The Your Account/Blogs page appears, with information on linking your 
blog to Flickr.
 
6. Click Set Up Your Blog.
 
7. Choose TypePad from the pull-down menu.
 
8. Enter your TypePad username and password.
 
 Flickr must have this information to link your TypePad and Flickr 
accounts.
 
9. Use the pull-down menu to choose which blog you want to associate 
with your Flickr account.
 
10. Click Next.
 
 The Confirm Your Details page appears.
 
11. Type your blog’s URL in the text box labeled URL.
 
 You can use the TypePad address (for example, http://typepad
fordummies.typepad.com) or your own domain (for example, www.
myblog.com) if you’ve mapped it to your TypePad blog (see Appendix 
A for instructions on how to map your domain).
 
12. Click All Done.
 
 Your blog is now linked to your Flickr account, and you can include 
photos on your blog quickly and easily.
Now you’re ready to write a blog post, insert your picture, and post it to your 
TypePad account. The following instructions tell you how.

195
 Chapter 10: Exploring Social Media
 
If you’ve set the Creative Commons license of your photo to None (which 
means all rights reserved), your photo will not show up in your post. You 
need to change the Creative Commons license to something more flexible to 
use the Blog This Photo options. You can find out which Creative Commons 
license is right for you at www.flickr.com/account/prefs/license 
(we like the Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs option).
 
1. Find the photo you want to use via Flickr.
 
 You should see a page similar to the one in Figure 10-1. You know you’re 
on the correct page if you see the toolbar above the photo. If you don’t 
see the toolbar, click the photo until you do.
 
2. Click Blog This on the toolbar.
 
 A pull-down menu appears.
 
3. Choose the name of the blog you want to post the picture to.
 
 The Blog This Photo page appears, as shown in Figure 10-3.
 
4. Type the title of the post in the Title text box.
 
 If you’ve titled your photo, that title may automatically appear in the 
Title box. You can simply replace it with the title you’d like to use. The 
text in this box is the title of your post.

5. Click inside the Your Post text box, and begin typing your post.
 
6. Click Post Entry.
 
7. Visit your blog to see your post.
 
 If you visit your TypePad Dashboard, you’ll see that this post is listed in 
the Posts tab.
Display a Flickr slideshow within a post
If you have several photos you’d like to share in your blog post, it may be 
easier to share a slideshow with your audience. It’s an easy process; just 
follow these instructions:
 
1. Choose the set, collection, or photo group you want to share.
 
2. Click the Slideshow button.
 
 (The slideshow button is labeled in Figure 10-1.) A slideshow of your pic-
tures starts, as shown in Figure 10-4.
 
3. Click the Share link in the top-right corner.
 
 Two HTML options appear:
 
• Grab the URL allows you to link to the slideshow. 
 
 You can do this by copying the URL, returning to your TypePad 
post, and highlighting the words to link. Then click the link icon in 
your post toolbar (it looks like a piece of chain link), and paste the 
slideshow URL in the URL box. Click OK.
 
• Grab the embed HTML allows you to embed the entire slideshow 
directly in your blog post. 
 
 Just copy the embed code, return to your TypePad post, and click 
the HTML tab. Paste the <embed> code, and publish as usual.
Use Flickr applications
Sometimes, of course, you don’t need to embed a photo in a post. You just 
want to show off what you’re sharing on Flickr. In those instances, a simple 
widget can help you out. Here are two you may like:
 
✓ The Flickr widget by Roy Tanck (www.roytanck.com/get-my-flickr-
widget) displays a rotating selection of your Flickr photos based on 
your Flickr RSS feed.
 
✓ With the Flickr Badge generator (www.flickr.com/badge.gne), you 
can choose an HTML badge or an Adobe Flash badge.

Using Bit.ly Links to Track 
Social Media Traffic
As we explain in Chapter 6, when you publish a new blog post, you have 
the option of sharing that post immediately with your Twitter, Facebook, 
and FriendFeed communities. When you do so, TypePad uses bit.ly (a third-
party URL shortening company) to track the links sent to Twitter, Facebook, 
and FriendFeed. Bit.ly keeps track of each time one of those links is clicked and 
provides some basic statistics on those clicks. Understanding which social media 
community is clicking your links consistently can help you determine which 
audience(s) you should focus on when disseminating certain information. For 
instance, if you notice that each time you post about volunteering at the veteri-
narian’s office, you receive more clicks from your Facebook community, you may 
want to consider posting even more information regarding volunteering, animal 
rescue, animal training, or general pet ownership tips on your Facebook fan page.
Although TypePad can tell you how many people have clicked your bit.ly link, 
you’ll need to click over to the bit.ly Web site to see a true representation of 

198
Part III: Adding Useful Elements to Your TypePad Blog 
how your communities are using your links. To see an overview of your bit.ly 
statistics, follow these instructions:
 
1. In TypePad, click the name of the blog whose stats you want to view.
 
 The blog navigation bar for that blog appears. The Overview tab is open 
by default. On the Overview tab, you see a graph of your blog’s traffic. 
Below that graph, you’ll see a link that says Social Media Optimization: 
Bit.ly Traffic. Figure 10-5 shows you exactly where that link is.
 
2. Click the Bit.ly Traffic link.
 
 The Real Time Bit.ly Traffic page appears and looks similar to Figure 10-6. 
This page lists all the posts you’ve shared (the titles link back to the posts 
at your blog), via bit.ly links, with your social media communities.
 
3. Click the URL under Bit.ly Info to see your bit.ly statistics.
 
 Note that when you click this link, you leave the TypePad site and move

the post you chose. Figure 10-7 shows an example of a bit.ly statistics

Understanding and Using 
Social Bookmarking
Social media, as you can well imagine, is vast. It includes more than tools 
that push information out to others (for example, sharing your newest post 
URL with your Twitter community). Social media includes tools that pull 
media to you based on your interests and keep track of the things you like. 
Those types of sites are called social bookmarking sites. Although there 
are many, we’d like to draw your attention to a few that we have found most 
valuable.
 
Any time your blog is included in a social bookmarking site, you’re bound to 
benefit from a spike in traffic. However, be aware that this traffic is what’s 
known as drive-by traffic. The people visiting your site are temporary read-
ers and may or may not subscribe to your RSS feed or return to read your 
updates. It’s your job (and not an easy one) to engage them enough to sub-
scribe to your feed and become regular readers. How? At the risk of repeating 
ourselves: Produce great content; have an engaging, clean design; and make 
your RSS subscription button easy to find.
StumbleUpon
As you surf the ’net, it’s easy to get into a rut and return to the same sites 
over and over. StumbleUpon (www.stumbleupon.com) strives to make 
finding relevant information not only easy, but also interesting. The premise 
of StumbleUpon is simple: It finds sites you like based on the interests you 
share in your StumbleUpon profile.
The interesting thing about StumbleUpon is that it learns from your behavior 
and adjusts the kinds of sites it offers you accordingly. StumbleUpon uses 
an algorithm to keep track of the Web sites or blogs you like and don’t like. 
Then, based on your preferences (both from your profile and your votes), 
you see more sites that are relevant to your interests.
To use StumbleUpon, you sign up for an account and choose your interests 
(such as technology, books, crafts, and writing — don’t worry; you can 
add or delete interests if they change). Then you install the StumbleUpon 
toolbar (www.stumbleupon.com/download.php) in your Web browser. 
The StumbleUpon toolbar (shown in Figure 10-8) allows you to do two 
main things:

201
 Chapter 10: Exploring Social Media
 
✓ Browse random sites based on your interests. Just click the Stumble 
link on the toolbar, and you’re surfing.
 
✓ Vote on the sites that you like best or are relevant to your interests. 
Just click the thumbs-up icon in the toolbar to show that you like a site.
You can also use the StumbleUpon toolbar to share links with your friends or 
bookmark your favorite sites in your StumbleUpon account.
If one of your articles is stumbled (that is, someone gave it a thumbs up), the 
result can be a spike in traffic. You may see hundreds of visitors over the 
course of 24 hours after the initial stumble. We haven’t met a blogger yet who 
doesn’t appreciate the increase in readers (even if the increase is temporary).
 
It may be tempting to stumble your own posts frequently to enjoy that boost 
in traffic as often as possible. In a word, don’t. StumbleUpon notices if your 
blog is constantly being stumbled and assumes you’re trying to game the 
system, either by stumbling your own articles or asking people to stumble 
them for you. The result is that you’ll be penalized, and your link won’t show 
up as often. As with everything online, moderation is key. If you’re particu-
larly proud of an article, don’t be afraid to ask a friend to stumble it for you. 
Just save that favor for the really good articles.

Kirtsy
Kirtsy was born out of the need for a social bookmarking site that caters to 
women. The women who created Kirtsy.com were aiming to create the female 
version of Digg (described next). Kirtsy’s four founders work with a team of 
about 20 editors to find the most interesting stories online as they relate to 
women. Those stories are listed on the Kirtsy site and then readers have the 
option of voting stories up or down. The more votes a story gets, the longer 
it stays on the front page.
If you’re interested in a specific topic, you can search the top stories (submit-
ted by both the editors and readers just like you) in several categories: arts 
and entertainment; design and crafts; family and parenting; fashion and style; 
food and home; Internet and technology; mind, body, and spirit; travel and 
leisure; and politics, world, and business.
To use Kirtsy, just create an account by clicking the Join Kirtsy! link at the 
top of the page and following the wizard’s instructions. After you’re a regis-
tered member, you can submit a story to Kirtsy (and then invite your online 
community to vote it up), find an interesting story to read (look at Kirtsy’s 
home page or search one of the categories), or vote a story up or down. To 
vote for a story, just click the title of the article. You’ll be taken to the article’s 
site so you can read it. If you like it, great. If you don’t, and you want to take 
back your vote, just return to Kirtsy and click the Un-Vote link by that article.
 
You can vote on several articles a day at Kirtsy, but you can vote on only a 
single article once per day. For example, you may choose to vote up (and read) 
several articles on the Kirtsy home page. You can’t vote for a story more than 
once a day, though, so even if you click over to an article a second time, your 
vote still counts only once. But you can always return tomorrow and vote again!
Digg
Digg.com may be the most well-known social bookmarking site going these 
days. Like the other social media or social bookmarking sites we’ve dis-
cussed in this chapter, Digg.com is a place to find news, blog posts, images, 
and even video from anywhere on the Web. All the content featured at Digg is 
submitted by the Digg community.
After something is submitted, the rest of the community determines its value: 
They either vote it up (digg it) or vote it down (bury it). If something receives 
enough votes, it makes it to the front page of Digg.com. It’s notoriously difficult 

203
 Chapter 10: Exploring Social Media
to make it to the front page of Digg, but if you do, your blog will enjoy the cra-
ziness of tens of thousands of hits in a single day. You’ll definitely be on the 
map if you make it to the front page of Digg. If you want to be part of the Digg 
community, register an account with Digg and jump into the conversation. 
Then, just like at the other social bookmarking sites, you can start building 
your Digg community. Look for people you’ve connected with on Twitter or 
Facebook or via your Gmail account. You can even choose the topics you’re 
most interested in reading about.
 
Those in the Digg community don’t like to see others promoting only their 
own stuff. If you want to be a part of the community, make sure you’re offering 
interesting items from other people as well. And don’t forget to join the dis-
cussion! Offer your comments about a particular item.
Delicious
Delicious allows you to tag, save, and share articles you find useful or inter-
esting, or just want easy access to. Sure, you could bookmark an item in your 
browser, but sites like Delicious allow you to share your favorites with your 
community and see what your friends are sharing as well.
To start using Delicious, register for an account by visiting delicious.com 
and clicking the Join Now! link in the top-right corner of the page. After you 
have your account established, install the Delicious toolbar so you can easily 
tag and save links as you find them. You can find links to the toolbar within 
Delicious help: delicious.com/help. The Delicious toolbar installs three 
small buttons on your browser toolbar. Table 10-1 provides an overview of 
each button.

If you’d like to share your links with your blog readers, it’s easy. Just follow 
these instructions to install the Delicious widget on your sidebar:
 
1. Sign in to your Delicious account.
 
2. Click the Settings link in the top-right corner of the page.
 
 The Settings page appears. Scroll down until you see the Blogging header.
 
3. Click Linkrolls.
 
 The Linkrolls page appears. Scroll down until you see Display options.
 
4. Set your display options as you see fit.
 
 Some of the options include editing the title of the Delicious widget, 
sorting links by date or alphabetically, and determining how many links 
to display.
 
5. Click the link under the code text box: If You Use TypePad You Can 
Add This Linkroll to Your TypePad blog.
 
 The TypePad widget page appears.
 
6. Click to select the box next to the blog(s) on which you want to install 
the widget.
 
7. Click Add Widget.
 
 The widget is now on your blog’s sidebar. You may want to visit your 
blog’s Content area in your Dashboard to arrange the order of your side-
bar content.
We’ve touched on some of the most important social media and bookmarking 
tools available to you right now. You may not want to use all of them imme-
diately or even at the same time. In fact, we suggest that you don’t use them 
all at once. Our advice is to try out your options and see what works best for 
you. In the end, you may decide that social media tools just add noise to your 
blogging endeavors. Or you may find that integrating Twitter and Facebook 
add a new dimension to your community. Remember that you have time to 
try things out and make changes as necessary.

▶ Choosing and ordering your blog’s layout and content
▶ Inserting a custom banner at the top of your blog
▶ Editing your saved designs
T
he appearance of your blog makes an instant and important impres-
sion on your readers. Ideally, your overall design should be a reflection 
of your content, complementing and highlighting what you’re offering your 
readers. If you have impeccable content and a brilliant overall blogging con-
cept, but your design is difficult to navigate or hard on a reader’s eyes, that 
reader may be hesitant to stick around.
In this chapter, we tackle the fundamentals of TypePad blog design. We talk 
about the general rules to consider as you make decisions about your blog’s 
appearance. We also show you how to apply any one of TypePad’s numerous 
themes. Within each theme, you have the freedom to change a wide variety of 
settings and preferences, including the order and setup of your sidebars and 
whether you’ll use a text or a custom graphic header — we show you how to 
do both.
After you have a working understanding of these simple design functions, 
you may be interested to find out how you can tweak your design using CSS 
(Cascading Style Sheets), a subject we explain more fully in Chapter 14.

Part III: Adding Useful Elements to Your TypePad Blog 
Grasping Basic Design Principles
Before we explain how to apply and adjust your TypePad design, it would be 
helpful to understand a few basic design principles that help you put your 
best visual foot forward. Of course, your own preferences are a big factor — 
it’s your blog, after all, and you can design it how you choose. But if your aim 
is to attract new readers, sticking to some time-tested design principles will 
serve you well. Refer to the design principles in this section as you use the 
rest of this chapter (and Chapter 14) to make decisions about your blog’s 
appearance.
Consider your voice
As you blog, you are surely developing a distinct voice and tone. Let your 
design be a visual reflection of your content’s voice. A blog on global finance, 
for example, should communicate refinement and professionalism, whereas 
a highly creative craft blog might communicate whimsy and lighthearted-
ness. See Chapter 17 for some good examples of blogs that have implemented 
designs that reflect their content well.
Be consistent
Have one visual cue that makes people think of your blog — a logo, perhaps, 
or a specific color scheme. Find ways to keep that design element recurring 
throughout your blog — it helps solidify your brand identity and is pleas-
ing to a reader’s eye. For example, do you use overlapping squares in your 
custom header design? Find a way to incorporate overlapping squares into 
your sidebar images or in other graphics you use throughout your site.
Use color well
Color is always a powerful visual tool, of course. Most often, designers rec-
ommend that bloggers stick to a specific color palette, using two or three 
foundation colors to keep your look unified. Other colors may appear in your 
site, of course, especially if you use photos or graphics frequently in your 
posts. But consistent use of the same color scheme will give your blog profes-
sional polish. When choosing a color scheme, consider using a color wheel 
to help you choose colors that complement one another. You can find a great 
color wheel tool at www.sessions.edu/ilu/ilu_1.asp.

207
 Chapter 11: Finding and Using a TypePad Theme
Incorporate change wisely
When you spend a lot of time at your own blog, you naturally will want to 
freshen things up sometimes. Be careful, however, that you don’t tweak your 
design so often that your readers never know where to find things or are 
never able to form a mental picture of your blog’s voice. If you’re itching for 
a fresh look, find subtle ways to implement change (a slightly modified color 
scheme, perhaps). If you do need a complete design overhaul (and occasion-
ally you will), walk your readers through the redesign in a post, and do what 
you can to make them feel at home.
Make your posts easy on the eyes
The format of the text within your posts is very important. Be sure you’ve 
set your fonts to a size that is large enough to be readable. (Not sure if yours 
is? Find a friend who requires reading glasses, and ask him to test it for you!) 
Also, keep in mind that a light-colored font (such as white) on a dark-colored 
background (such as dark blue or black) tires out a reader’s eyes more 
quickly than the more traditional dark font on a light background. Last, keep 
your paragraphs short (ideally, no more than five to seven sentences), and 
use a blank double space between paragraphs — that blank space gives the 
eyes a brief moment of rest.
Minimize the clutter
When you configure your sidebars, keep in mind that less is more. Sidebars 
that are overly cluttered with graphic images and text will draw the eyes 
away from the most important part of your blog: your main content column. 
When you do post graphics (such as ads) in your sidebar, try to keep their 
sizes uniform. Consider rounding up as many of your sidebar items as pos-
sible and placing them on a separate page (see Chapter 6). For example, if 
your blog has won multiple awards, you don’t have to post all those award 
images on your sidebar — instead, create an Awards page containing all 
those images, and link to the page from your sidebar.
Keep things moving left to right
Remember, especially in Western cultures, our eyes are naturally inclined to 
move from left to right. For this reason, consider placing the most important 
information on the left side of your blog — together with your header design, 

208
Part III: Adding Useful Elements to Your TypePad Blog 
it’s probably what people will notice first. Additionally, we recommend that 
you keep the body of your posts aligned left. TypePad gives you the option to 
center your entire post, and it may work occasionally for short, poetic works 
or lists of links. Overall, though, our eyes aren’t fond of reading chunks of 
centered text for extended periods of time.
Locating and Navigating the Design Tab
Anything related to the creating, editing, or managing of your blog design 
takes place in the Design tab. To get there, sign in to your TypePad account; 
from the main Dashboard, click your blog’s name in the list of blogs on the 
right (as a shortcut, you can click the Design link under your blog’s name). In 
the blue blog-level bar, click the Design tab. The page that opens looks like 
the one in Figure 11-1.
The page shown in Figure 11-1 will be our home base for the rest of this chap-
ter, so let’s start with an overview of its primary elements. Throughout the 
chapter, we examine each one further.
 
Figure 11-1: 
The Design 
tab.
 
Overview

209
 Chapter 11: Finding and Using a TypePad Theme
 
In the top-left corner of the Design tab, note the small button called Overview. 
This button will be very helpful to you as you navigate the Design tab. Any 
time you want to go back to the main Design tab, click that Overview button to 
be returned there instantly. Be sure you save your work first, though!
 
If you are signed up under the Micro pricing level, most of this chapter will not 
be relevant to you — your design customization options are limited.
Your current design
The design you have currently applied to your TypePad blog is clearly dis-
played at the top of the Design tab — in two places, actually. As shown in 
Figure 11-1, you can see which theme you have currently applied by looking 
in the vertical menu bar on the left side of the page, as well as the Current 
Design box at the top of the page. Using whichever of the two you’d prefer 
(both offer identical information), you can click the links to view and edit the 
following elements of your design:
 
✓ Theme Builder: This button is visible only if you are using the Theme 
Builder, TypePad’s tool for generating a more custom look without 
delving into code (see the corresponding section later in this chapter). 
Clicking this button takes you directly to the Theme Builder.
 
✓ Colors: This button is visible only if you’re not using the Theme Builder 
and if you’re using a theme with editable colors (not all themes have them). 
Click this button to change the color scheme of your TypePad theme.
 
✓ Layouts: A Layout refers to the “bone structure” of the content on your 
page — how many columns your blog will have and where each one will 
be. To edit your current layout, simply click the Layouts button.
 
✓ Content: This button takes you to the page where you determine which 
content will appear in each section of your blog. Clicking here will allow 
you to rearrange and edit to your heart’s content (see the correspond-
ing section later in this chapter).
 
✓ Custom CSS: For TypePad users with the Pro Unlimited level or above, 
you can click this button for access to the field where you can customize 
your CSS. We explain custom CSS further in Chapter 14.
Create a new design
Below the Current Design box is a box labeled Create a New Design. This is 
the starting point any time you want you start a new design, whether you’re 

210
Part III: Adding Useful Elements to Your TypePad Blog 
using a TypePad theme, the Theme Builder, or Advanced Templates (see 
Chapter 14). We come back to this box shortly.
Your designs
Moving farther down the page, you’ll see a box titled Your Designs. This is 
a list of all the designs you’ve created for all your TypePad blogs, and it’s 
the starting point for going back to make edits to these designs. For more 
information, see the last section in this chapter, where we explain this box 
further.
Finding and Applying a TypePad Theme
Now that we’ve established the lay of the land for the Design tab, it’s time to 
move on to the fun part: playing around with the dozens of TypePad themes 
available to users. With only a few simple clicks, you can easily change the 
entire look of your blog, using the professionally designed themes offered by 
TypePad.
 
As we work our way through the rest of the design process in this chapter, 
it’s important to note the difference between applying a design and saving 
a design. Applying a design means that you are choosing it as your current 
design, making it instantly viewable to your readers. Saving a design does not 
apply it to your blog — it simply means that the design will appear in your 
list of designs (the Your Designs box in the Design tab), making it available 
to you in the future to edit and apply later (should you choose). With this in 
mind, browse, experiment, and save confidently in TypePad’s design interface, 
making sure that you apply a new design only when you’re absolutely ready.
Browsing the available TypePad themes
To get started with a new theme, look at the front page of the Design tab 
(refer to Figure 11-1). In the box titled Create a New Design, click the green 
Choose a Theme button. You are taken to a page that allows you to browse 
through available themes. It’s a page that looks similar to the one in 
Figure 11-2.
Listed in the main column, you’ll notice several themes to choose among. 
To test-drive a theme, click it and then click the Preview button on the right 
(see Figure 11-2). This gives you a sneak peek of how your own content will 
look with the chosen theme, as shown in Figure 11-3. In this example, we’ve 
chosen to preview the Magnetic theme.

Click any theme option to see it applied. If you want to save the design, click 
the Use This button. To go back to the list of themes, click Go Back.
TypePad offers so many theme choices that it’s sorted them in the vertical 
menu bar on the left (refer to Figure 11-2). Clicking each item in this menu 
gives you a wide variety of theme choices in the page’s main column, broken 
down this way:
 
✓ Featured: These themes rotate regularly, giving TypePad a chance to 
showcase its current featured design options.
 
✓ New: These themes are the ones most recently added to TypePad’s 
theme collection; click this menu button often if you want to see your 
newest design options.
 
✓ Customizable: If you want to step out on your own, you don’t have to 
choose one of TypePad’s standard themes. Clicking the Customizable 
link gives you two options: Theme Builder and Advanced Templates. 
The Theme Builder option gives you a chance to build your own theme 
without muddying your hands in code. (We explain the Theme Builder 
option more fully later in this chapter; for now, we’ll just address the 
predesigned themes.) Clicking Advanced Templates will allow you full 
control over your TypePad design, but extensive coding knowledge is 
required. We explain Advanced Templates in Chapter 14.
 
✓ All: As you might expect, clicking this menu option will cause every 
available TypePad theme to appear, making this the easiest way to com-
pare all your options at once.
Next in the menu, TypePad offers you a different way to sort your design 
choices, letting you see the choices grouped by style, such as Personal and 
Professional. It’s simply another way to sort your options, but you’d still 
most likely be best served by browsing using the All button.
Some of the themes have special customization options worth noting. In the 
Mosaic theme, for example, you can insert your own image into the header 
design. And the Cityscape theme lets you choose among 20 city skylines 
around the world to feature in your header design.
 
Click a theme and then look in the right column, under Features. Here, you’ll 
see listed how many layouts and color schemes this particular theme supports.
Applying your chosen theme
After you’ve browsed the TypePad themes thoroughly and have chosen the 
theme that suits you best, click the Use This button on the right side of your 
screen (refer to Figure 11-2).

213
 Chapter 11: Finding and Using a TypePad Theme
 
Clicking Use This does not apply your design to your blog; it only saves the 
design to your account, making it editable later.
The screen that appears next will vary, depending on the theme you choose. 
If you’ve chosen a theme with customizable colors, you may first be asked 
to choose the color scheme you’d like to use. Other customizable themes 
(such as Cityscape and Mosaic — see the preceding section) will ask you for 
your customization preferences. The Chroma theme (the only one available 
to Micro users) will ask you to select the photo you’d like to include in the 
banner. Still other themes will ask you to choose your design’s layout (see 
next section). Whichever screen appears for you next, make your selections.
Before moving on to the next screen, be sure to take note of the options at 
the bottom of your screen, pictured in Figure 11-4:
 
✓ To apply your new design to your blog (remember, this makes it 
instantly viewable by your readers), scroll down the page, select Apply 
This Design to [Your Blog’s Name], and then click Save Changes. Your 
new design is applied to your blog, and your readers can see it.
 
✓ If you’re not ready to apply your design but want the option of playing 
around with it later, simply click Save Changes, and the design will be 
saved and listed on the front page of your Design tab using the name of 
the theme and the name of your blog (for example, Magnetic for Don’s 
Cycling Blog). You can rename this specific design later; for instructions 
on renaming a design, see the last section in this chapter.

and apply-
ing a design.
 

214
Part III: Adding Useful Elements to Your TypePad Blog 
 
As you experiment with applying new themes, always look for a Save Changes 
button at the bottom of the screen. Click this before you proceed to keep from 
losing your work.
Selecting the Layout of Your Theme
With your theme in place, you need to decide what kind of layout you’d like 
to use. As we explained, your layout refers to the quantity and positioning of 
your columns. Ten layouts are available, though not every TypePad theme 
supports each one. The Brighten theme, for example, supports five layouts, 
whereas the Curves theme supports all ten. Be sure you’ve chosen a theme 
that supports the layout you prefer.
To see your layout options, click the Layouts button (shown in Figure 11-1) 
in the left menu bar. You’ll be taken to a page that shows you all the layouts 
supportable in your chosen theme. In Table 11-1, we describe each of the ten 
TypePad layouts.

Two Column 
Right
The content column is on the left, and the 
sidebar (containing the TypeLists, widgets,

Two Column 
Left
The content column is on the right, and the 
sidebar is on the left. Both of the two-
column options offer pleasing, simple 
designs, but keep in mind that our eyes 
tend to start on the left side of the page and 
move right. In light of this, this layout may 
not place quite as much focus on the main 
content column as the preceding design.
Three Column 
Right
The content column is on the left, with two 
sidebars to the right. This layout is quite 
visually pleasing, especially if you can 
manage to keep the sidebars clutter-free, 
because it keeps the sidebar information 
grouped on one side of the page.
Three Column
The content column is in the center, with a 
sidebar on each side. Both this layout and 
the next one provide the most sidebar real 
estate if you have a large quantity of side-
bar information to share with your readers.

Layout Description 
One Column
The simplest of all the blog layouts, this one 
has no sidebars (typical sidebar informa-
tion is listed at the bottom of the page). 
This type of format keeps the focus on your 
content, but it might not be quite as navi-
gable for your readers as the traditional 
blog design, which usually contains at least 
one sidebar. The typical sidebar content is 
placed below your posts.
Artistic
This layout (and all the others that follow) 
is a mixed media layout, meaning that it’s 
used by bloggers who want to highlight 
their photos. The artistic layout places the 
main content column to the left, and the 
most recent photo has a high-profile spot to 
the right. The other recent photos are listed 
horizontally below the most recent photo.
Calendar
In this layout, the photos are published in a 
calendar format, with the images appear-
ing in the calendar date on which you 
posted them. Any additional sidebar con-
tent appears below the calendar.
Three Column 
Mixed Media
The main content column is in the center, 
the sidebar is on the left, and the most 
recent photographs appear on the right.
Four Column 
Mixed Media
The most recent photos appear on the 
left, the main content column appears in 
the center, and the two sidebars appear 
together on the right. This layout lets you 
present a significant amount of informa-
tion to your readers at first glance. If you 
choose this layout, you may want to be 
particularly mindful of keeping the sidebars 
and header design tidy and streamlined so 
your readers aren’t visually overwhelmed.

Similar to the calendar, in this layout the 
main content column is on the left, but 
readers have easy access to the most 
recent photos on the right.
 
If you’re a photo blogger interested in using one of the mixed media layouts, you 
should know that your photo album images (see Chapter 9) do not automatically 
appear in your layout. The layout photos appear only when a blogger inserts a 
photo into an actual post. If you want a photo to appear in both your photo album 
and in your mixed media layout, you’ll need to publish them in both places.

Part III: Adding Useful Elements to Your TypePad Blog 
Choosing and Ordering the Content 
Modules on Your Blog
With the structure of your blog in place, you’ll need to decide which ele-
ments you’d like to have appear on your blog and where you’d like them to 
go. TypePad refers to these page elements as modules, or page components, 
each with a specific function. For example, your list of blog categories is a 
module, as are your post title and an Amazon.com widget.
TypePad’s drag-and-drop content layout editor makes the choosing and 
ordering of page modules an intuitive process. To get to this helpful tool, 
choose the design you want to edit and then click the Content button in the 
menu bar on the left side of the Design tab. You’ll be taken to the drag-and-
drop editor, which looks like Figure 11-5.
Selecting the modules to include
Let’s start with the top half of the drag-and-drop editor, just below the bar 
labeled Content in Figure 11-5. You use this portion of the drag-and-drop 
editor to select which modules you want to include on your page.
 
Figure 11-5: 
Drag-and-
drop editor.
 

217
 Chapter 11: Finding and Using a TypePad Theme
The box labeled Categories contains a long list of (not surprisingly) cat-
egories. Note that these are categories of page modules, as opposed to the 
blog post categories discussed in Chapter 6. Every page module offered by 
TypePad falls under one of the listed categories. When you click a category, 
a new list of modules related to that category appears in the Modules box, 
immediately to the right. Click any of the modules, and you’ll see, in the 
Details box, an option to Add This Module, as shown in Figure 11-6.
Click the Add This Module button, and that particular module appears in the 
bottom portion of the drag-and-drop editor. In the next section, we show you 
how to rearrange these modules to your preferences. Before we get to that 
point, though, let’s examine what type of modules you can expect to find in 
each category:
 
✓ All: Clicking the All category, as you might expect, causes every avail-
able module to appear in the Modules box, making it the simplest way to 
see what all of your module options are.
 
✓ About You: The modules that appear in the About You category are the 
most personal ones — they’re the modules readers can best use to find 
out about and interact with you. For example, the Follow Me module is 
a sidebar button that allows other TypePad users to track your activ-
ity within their own Dashboard (see Chapter 4). The TypePad Profile 
module will insert a sidebar link directly to your TypePad Profile.

and-drop 
editor.
 
Click to add module

Part III: Adding Useful Elements to Your TypePad Blog 
 
✓ Ads by Six Apart Media: As we explain in Chapter 12, Six Apart Media is 
TypePad’s ad network, and using this module gives you a quick way to 
insert your Six Apart Media ads. (Note that you still have to go through 
the signup and approval process described in Chapter 12.)
 
✓ Links to Your Archives: These modules will help your readers browse 
through your older posts in a wide variety of ways. Category lists and 
clouds, for example, give readers access to your categories, and the 
daily, weekly, and monthly archives arrange your content by its publish 
date. The most common format for presenting your archives is monthly; 
you probably shouldn’t choose daily or weekly unless you are posting 
several times a day.
 
✓ Links to Your Blog’s Content: This category offers still another way 
for readers to interact with your content. Modules such as Recent 
Comments and Recent Posts keep readers current with the topics 
addressed at your blog in the past few days or weeks.
 
✓ TypePad: This category has only a couple of options: It allows you to 
add a module telling readers you’re a TypePad user, and it allows you to 
point your readers to posts being written on other TypePad blogs.
 
✓ Widgets: Widgets are third-party tools that you and your readers may 
find handy. See Chapter 8 for more information on widgets, and browse 
through all the ones available to you by clicking in the Modules box.
 
✓ Your Feeds: If you enjoy aggregating content for your readers from 
other valuable resources, you may find the Your Feeds category espe-
cially helpful. Clicking Add This Module will take you a pop-up screen 
where you can enter the URL of any site with an RSS feed. Then you’ll be 
asked to choose how many of the site’s most recent updates you’d like 
to list in this particular sidebar module (choose between five and ten). 
Click OK, and that site’s most recent updates will appear in this module 
on your sidebar.
 
✓ Your Photo Albums: When you click this category, you’ll see all your photo 
albums listed in the Modules box. Sharing your photo albums in your side-
bar is an easy and organized way to share your photos with your readers; 
it’s also an alternative to using the mixed media layouts explained earlier in 
this chapter. For more about TypePad photo albums, see Chapter 9.
 
✓ Your TypeLists: Click this category to see a list of all the TypeLists 
you’ve created. Select which ones you’d like on your sidebars — see 
Chapter 8 for more on TypeLists.
Arranging the modules on the page
Now that you’ve chosen which modules will appear on your blog, you need 
to arrange their positions on the page. You’ll do this in the bottom half of 
the drag-and-drop editor, which will look something like the one pictured in 
Figure 11-7.

Click to edit module
 
If you have chosen a mixed media layout, you will not be able to use the drag-
and-drop feature. You can still choose which modules appear on your blog (as 
described in the previous section), but you cannot rearrange the modules’ order.
You arrange four primary page elements via the drag-and-drop editor:
 
✓ Sidebar(s)
 
✓ Horizontal navigation bar (if you choose to use one)
 
✓ Main content column (where your posts appear)
 
✓ Blog footer
Your blog header is a significant page element, of course, but it’s not 
addressed in this screen. (If you have a custom header, it’s managed in the 
Theme Builder, which is described addressed later in this chapter.)
In the remainder of this section, we break down each of those four primary 
page elements and show you how to arrange and edit each one.
Sidebars
To rearrange the order of the modules currently placed in your sidebar, 
simply click and drag the module to its desired position. If you’ve changed 

220
Part III: Adding Useful Elements to Your TypePad Blog 
your mind about including a particular module, click the red X in the mod-
ule’s top-right corner. Clicking this X only removes the module from your 
page; it doesn’t delete it from your account (for example, clicking the X in 
a photo album in your sidebar simply means that photo album is no longer 
displayed, but it’s still safe and sound in your Photo Album Library). The 
exception to this is if you’ve added any widgets to your sidebar — they’re not 
saved anywhere in your account, so deleting them from your sidebar means 
you’ll have to rebuild them from scratch if you ever want to reinsert them.
Some of the sidebar modules have a yellow pencil on the right side. When 
you see that little pencil (refer to Figure 11-7), it means that the module can 
be edited. Click the pencil, and a pop-up screen appears, letting you make 
edits as you’d like. For example, the Powered by TypePad Link module is edit-
able — when you click the pencil, the screen shown in Figure 11-8 appears.
 
Figure 11-8: 
Pop-up 
screen for 
editing a 
page 
module.
 
In this example, you can choose whether or not you’d like to display Member 
Since [date you joined TypePad] with your TypePad link.
 
Keep your eye out for these little yellow pencils. Not all modules have them, 
but if one does, feel free to experiment with the formatting for that particular 
module, getting it set up in a way that’s most convenient for you and your 
readers.
Navigation bar
A horizontal navigation bar is a powerful tool for a blogger. By default, the 
navigation bar appears below the header and gives a prominent spot to what-
ever information you choose to include there. Applied to a blog, a horizontal 
navigation bar looks like the one pictured in Figure 11-9.
If you want to include this navigation bar on your blog, simply click to select 
the Navigation Bar module. Just selecting the module isn’t enough, though; 
you need to fill it in with the information you’d like to have in your blog’s 
navigation bar. To do this, click the yellow pencil on the far right side of the 
module. This takes you to a screen containing a list of ten blank fields, like 
the one shown in Figure 11-10.

221
 Chapter 11: Finding and Using a TypePad Theme

Navigation bar
You have two options for the way you want to set up the navigation bar. You 
can use simple text links, or you can use graphic images as the links for a 
more custom look. We give you both sets of instructions.

222
Part III: Adding Useful Elements to Your TypePad Blog 
To insert text links into the navigation bar, follow these steps:
 
1. In the pop-up window shown in Figure 11-10, enter in the Title field 
the title for the link you want to create.
 
 Whatever you type here will appear on your blog exactly as you enter it, 
including capitalization. Consider keeping the titles as short as possible; 
if you don’t, they may drop down onto a second line.
 
2. In the right field, enter the complete URL to which the text or image 
should link.
 
3. Click OK.
 
 The navigation bar is now saved using text links.
To insert image files into the navigation bar, follow these steps:
 
1. Save the image file(s) you want to use in the navigation bar to 
TypePad File Manager.
 
 You may need to experiment with image widths to get the navigation bar 
looking just the way you want. The correct image width depends largely on 
how many links you want the navigation bar to include (they can be wider 
if you have only a few or shorter if you have several). We recommend that 
you begin with a 100-pixel-wide image and adjust up or down as needed.
 
2. In File Manager, right-click the name of the image you just uploaded, 
and choose Copy Link Location from the menu.
 
3. Navigate to your blog’s Design tab.
 
4. Click the Content tab in the left sidebar.
 
5. Find the Navigation bar module, and click the yellow pencil.
 
 When you click the yellow pencil on the right side of the navigation bar 
module, a pop-up window like the one in Figure 11-10 appears.
 
6. In one of the Title text fields, type the following HTML:
<img src=“http://blogname.typepad.com/images/navicon1.jpg”>
 
 Be sure to change the URL to match the one you noted in Step 2.
 
7. Type the URL you want the image to link to in the URL text field.
 
8. Repeat Steps 1–7 as necessary until you have the navigation bar the 
way you want it.
 
9. Click OK.
 
 The navigation bar is saved using text links.
If you choose to use the navigation bar, consider using it to highlight the 
most important information on your site. Some good uses for this bar include 
the following links:

223
 Chapter 11: Finding and Using a TypePad Theme
 
✓ About Me: Include a link to your About Me page (see Chapter 4 for sev-
eral About Me page options).
 
✓ Contact: Include a link to the page containing your contact information and 
e-mail policies (see the section on managing e-mail issues in Chapter 18).
 
✓ Blogroll or other links: If you’ve listed your blogroll (or a list of other 
favorite links), include a link to that page here. If you want to introduce a 
charity or other cause to your readers, you can include a link here.
 
✓ Other business(es): If you own another business (an Etsy shop, for 
example) you’re highlighting through your blog, place a link front and 
center in your navigation bar for quick access.
 
✓ Facebook, Twitter, and so on: If you don’t want to clutter your side-
bar with modules pointing to your other social media accounts, you 
can offer a direct link to your Facebook page, Twitter feed, and so on 
directly in your navigation bar.
 
✓ Greatest hits: Many bloggers like to keep a page listing the favorite posts 
they’ve written (Greatest Hits, Best Of, My Favorite Posts — name it 
however you like). This is a great way to quickly acquaint new readers 
with your writing. If you’ve composed such a page, consider including a 
link in the navigation bar.
Be creative as you decide which pages to link to, and use this high-profile 
navigation bar as a tool to point your readers toward valuable information.
 
You can make some edits to the appearance of the navigation bar by making 
some simple tweaks to your CSS code — see Chapter 14 for instructions.
Main content column
This important column contains the meat of your blog. You can’t rearrange 
the order of the modules in this column, but you can select which ones you’d 
like to use and (on some of them) edit the formatting via the yellow pencil 
button. Here’s an explanation for each of these modules:
 
✓ Archive headers: When your readers look through your sidebar and 
click a month in your archives or a category name, an archive header 
appears at the top of their page to remind them which date or category 
they’re viewing. You can edit the format of these archive headers by click-
ing the yellow pencil and choosing your desired format from the drop-
down menu. If you deselect the option, no archive header will appear.
 
✓ Post date header: This option simply means that the date your post 
is published will appear at the top of your post. Deselect this option if 
you don’t want a date to appear. If you use the Theme Builder (see the 
upcoming “Using the Theme Builder” section), you can format the size, 
font, and alignment of the post date header.
 
✓ Post title: Selecting this option means that the title of your post will be 
visible at the beginning of each post. Because it’s standard blogging 

224
Part III: Adding Useful Elements to Your TypePad Blog 
practice to include a title, we recommend that you select this option. If 
you ever want to omit a title from a post for some reason, simply leave 
the title field blank in the Compose editor when you write the post.
 
✓ Post footer: TypePad allows you to put an automatic footer at the end 
of each post — click the yellow pencil to see your editing options in 
the pop-up window. Select the details (such as time, date, and author’s 
name) you’d like to include in each footer.
 
 The post footer pop-up window also allows you to place buttons or links 
at the bottom of each post, making it easy for your readers to submit the 
post to various social networking sites. (For more on how TypePad inte-
grates with social media sites, see Chapter 10.) You can list the prompts 
as text or as graphic buttons. Applied to a blog, the page footers should 
appear similar to the one in Figure 11-11.
 
✓ Page footer: Similar to the post footer, this is the footer for your blog’s 
pages (to understand the difference between posts and pages, see 
Chapter 6). Unlike the post footer, you do not have the option to add 
footer details such as author’s name and time. You can, however, add 
the same social networking options as those in the post footer.

 Chapter 11: Finding and Using a TypePad Theme
Blog footer
The blog footer is the information that appears at the bottom of the screen. 
Unless you’ve set up your blog to be short (having only one post at a time on 
the first page), the footer may not be noticed by that many people. You might 
want to include really important information elsewhere. But if you do want to 
include something on the footer, click the yellow pencil and edit similarly to 
the way you edited the navigation bar, earlier in this chapter. You can select 
the Advanced button if you know HTML coding and want to insert informa-
tion this way.
Using the Theme Builder
Thus far in this chapter, we’ve largely addressed the use of TypePad’s stan-
dard themes. Some of them have customizable color schemes, and of course, 
you can customize the layouts of any of them. But what if you want a more 
customized design? You can use Advanced Templates and Custom CSS (see 
Chapter 14) to make as many changes as you want, but both options require 
that you deal with HTML and CSS coding, and that’s not a route all bloggers 
want to take. Enter the Theme Builder, a powerful tool for customizing your 
blog without delving into your code.
To walk through the Theme Builder functions, let’s start at the beginning 
and create a new design. From the Design tab, click the Choose a Theme 
button. On the menu of theme choices in the left column, choose Customiz-
able. Select the Theme Builder and then click the Use This button on the 
right. This takes you directly into the Theme Builder, which is shown in 
Figure 11-12.
The Theme Builder addresses your customized design in four distinct parts 
(Banner, General, Posts, and Sidebar Modules), giving each one its own sec-
tion. Under each of these sections, you see a specific part of your design 
broken down even further (under the Banner section, for example, are the 
Text or Image subsection and the Background and Border subsection). Next 
to each subsection, click the up-and-down arrow button (refer to Figure 
11-12) to expand the section fully. Be sure you expand each section as you 
work your way down the page.

Drop-down arrows
Banner
The page banner (or header — the words are used interchangeably, but they 
mean the same thing) is integral to your overall design — it’s likely the first 
thing a reader notices about your blog. Using the Theme Builder, you can 
fully customize the way the blog header appears or even replace it with a 
custom-designed banner that’s representative of your blog’s brand and voice.
Text or Image subsection
The Banner section’s first subsection lets you customize the appearance of the 
font in the blog’s banner. To customize a simple text header, follow these steps:
 
1. Expand the Text or Image subsection, using the up-and-down arrow 
button.
 
2. For the Text/Image option, click to select the button next to Text.
 
3. In the Text Color field, enter the hexadecimal (hex) code for the color 
you’d like to use, or click the color tool to browse through your choices.
 
 For more on hex colors, see the related sidebar in this chapter.

227
 Chapter 11: Finding and Using a TypePad Theme
 
4. In the remaining four sections, specify which alignment, style, font, 
and size you’d like to use for the text.
 
5. Click Preview at the bottom of the page to see if these changes suit you.
 
6. Click Save Changes to save these changes to your blog.
If you’re looking for a little more personalization than just a tweaked font, 
consider using a custom banner at the top of your blog page. A custom 
banner involves more work, but it’s worth it because it can speak volumes 
about your blog.
When you (or your designer) create your custom banner, be sure you make 
it the appropriate width. To do this, calculate the total pixel width of your 
layout. It involves a little math, but it’s nothing too hard: Simply add the 
column widths of the main content column, right column, and left column (if 
applicable) as you set them up in the General section of the Theme Builder 
page. That number is your total layout width. From this number, subtract 
30 (TypePad automatically inserts a 15-pixel border around your image, so 
you’ll need to allow for 15 pixels on the both the left and right). The resulting 
number is the correct pixel width for your banner image. Here’s an example 
of this formula in action:
 
 
400 pixels for the center column
 
 
200 pixels for the right column
 
 
200 pixels for the left column
 
= 
800 pixels layout width
 
− 
  30 pixels (15 for each side)
 
= 
770 pixels, the appropriate banner width
Creating your own graphics
Looking for a custom header or sidebar but-
tons, but don’t want to pay a designer? Finding 
out that the fundamentals of graphic design 
might not be as hard as you think. Many begin-
ning designers (and many experienced ones, 
too!) use desktop software such as Adobe 
Photoshop (or its simpler sister product, 
Photoshop Elements) or Corel Paint Shop Pro. 
You can even use some online services such as 
Picnik (www.picnik.com) and GIMP (www.
gimp.org). Sites such as these allow you to 
generate JPG, GIF, or PNG graphic images, 
which are the building blocks for customizing 
your site to look the way you want. For addi-
tional information, do a Google search on your 
chosen graphics program to find out what 
books or online tutorials are available.

228
Part III: Adding Useful Elements to Your TypePad Blog 
You can choose any height for the banner image — it automatically adapts 
to your layout. (Keep in mind, however, that a tall banner pushes your con-
tent farther down the page. For this reason, you probably shouldn’t choose a 
height much taller than 300 pixels, and less is even better.)
 
If you use TypePad’s default About Me page (see Chapter 4), you’ll notice that 
it’s a one-column page (regardless of whether you’re using a two- or three-
column theme for your regular blog). This makes a difference if you want to 
apply your blog’s theme to TypePad’s default About Me page, because your 
banner may be too large to fit in the main column. To get around this issue, 
we suggest duplicating your design, making a second banner that’s 30 pixels 
smaller than your original banner and inserting it into your About Me page. 
However, you can save yourself the hassle by simply avoiding the default About 
Me page and either using your Profile (see Chapter 3) or creating a custom blog 
page (see Chapter 4).
Here’s how to insert a custom banner:
 
1. Create an image file (JPG, PNG, or GIF), and save it on your hard drive.
 
 See the sidebar titled “Creating your own graphics” in this chapter if you 
need help creating an image from scratch. Also, be sure you follow the 
instructions earlier in this section to generate a banner that’s the cor-
rect width.
 
2. Return to the Design tab.
 
 Click the name of the saved design you want to add the banner to.
 
3. Click Text or Image to show options.
 
4. Next to Text/Image, select the button next to Image.
 
 A different set of options appears.
 
5. Click the Browse button to search your hard drive files for the image 
you created in Step 1.
 
6. Scroll to the bottom of the page, and click the Save Changes button.
 
 You must save your changes before you can preview your new banner in 
your blog design. Note that clicking Save Changes doesn’t apply the new 
design to your blog; it just saves the theme for you.
 
7. Click the Preview button to see how your banner will look in your 
blog’s new design.
 
8. If you’re ready for your design to go live and your readers to see the 
changes you’re made, select the Apply This Design to [your blog’s 
name] option.
 
 If you aren’t ready for the changes to be live yet, you can access this 
new design from your list of designs on the main Design tab.

229
 Chapter 11: Finding and Using a TypePad Theme
 
Hiring a professional designer to create an overall blog design might be cost-
prohibitive, especially if you’re a hobbyist blogger. But hiring a designer 
simply to create a custom header is generally much less expensive — you’d 
simply need to communicate to him the exact dimensions you want to use, 
using the formula just described. See Chapter 14 for more advice about hiring 
a designer.
Background and Border subsection
Let’s move to the next portion of your Banner section in the Theme Builder: 
Background and Border. Click the up-and-down arrow button to expand this 
section and reveal your options. You are first asked to customize the back-
ground color for the header. This background color refers to the 15-pixels-
wide border that TypePad automatically inserts around your banner image 
or (if you’re simply using a text header) the background color that appears 
behind the header text. In the designated field, choose the hex code you’d 
like to use or click the color wheel button to view all the color options. For 
best results if you’re using a custom banner, try using the identical back-
ground color of your banner image.
The next field asks you what type of border you’d like to use. We know this 
is a little confusing, because the previous field referred to the 15-pixels-width 
border around your custom banner. This border, however, refers to a dif-
ferent one — it’s the small, hairline-width border you can insert in a variety 
of formats (solid, dashed, or dotted) around the banner. The most common 
use for this border is to insert only a bottom border or to omit the border 
(choose None). Use the drop-down menus to format the banner border, and 
click the Preview button at the bottom of the page — experiment until you 
get the look you want.
In the last field, you simply designate the color of the border (if you’ve 
chosen to use one). Choose one that complements your overall color 
scheme, and again, experiment until it suits you.
Understanding hex codes
A hex code is a six-digit code the Internet 
“reads” to understand exactly which color 
you want to use. The hex code for black, for 
example, is #000000, a bright seafoam green is 
#a7f7cb, and a bold purple is # 9107f2. There are 
other codes for communicating colors to your 
computer, but the hex code system is the one 
used by TypePad. Search for hex color scheme 
to find several free tools to help you generate 
your own hex codes for your design.

Part III: Adding Useful Elements to Your TypePad Blog 
General
Moving down the Theme Builder page, we come to the General section, 
where you format column widths, background colors, and link colors for your 
entire blog. Use the up-and-down arrows to expand each subsection, and let’s 
walk through them one at a time.
General Settings subsection
Using the first field under General Settings, select the background color for 
the area that borders your entire blog. To see this in action, see the sample 
TypePad blog in Figure 11-13. In this example, the background color is set to 
black, and the backgrounds of all the columns are set to white.
In the second two fields under General Settings, you can choose if you want 
to have a border around your entire page, and if so, what style and color 
you want that border to be. Be advised that any border you put around your 
entire page will not be especially visible — you might simply want to choose 
None from the drop-down menu and move on.

 Chapter 11: Finding and Using a TypePad Theme
Main Content Column subsection
In the fields under Main Content Column, choose first which pixel width you 
want this column to be (if you’ve inserted a custom banner using the steps 
earlier in this chapter, you should already have a number in mind). You can 
choose one of the pixel-width options listed in the drop-down menu, or you can 
choose the fluid-pixels option. Fluid means that your page width will adapt to the 
browser and screen size of each individual reader. Each column-width setup pro-
vides a different look for your blog; experiment and click the Preview button at 
the bottom of the page to see which column-width setup suits your preferences.
Next, determine what background color you’d like to use for this column 
(remember, a light background is much easier on the eyes). You can also 
specify whether you’d like a border around this column and what color and 
format you’d like that border to take. In the sample shown in Figure 11-13, the 
background color for the column is white, and the border is solid left.
Right Column and/or Left Column subsection
If you’ve selected a multiple-column layout for your blog, you’ll have a subsec-
tion under General for each sidebar. Within this subsection, you need to deter-
mine the width of the column (again, keeping in mind the width of your custom 
banner, if you’ve used one), the background color, and the border format for 
each of these sidebar columns. In the sample shown in Figure 11-13, the back-
ground color for the left column is white, and no border has been applied.
Links subsection
In the Links subsection, you choose how you want to display the links that appear 
within your posts (though not within your sidebars — we get to those in a minute). 
Four kinds of links are listed, and you need to make a decision about the appear-
ance of each. Not sure what the different link types are? Here’s a quick rundown:
 
✓ Normal link: This is any link that has not been recently clicked.
 
✓ Visited link: If a reader clicks a link in your post, visits the new Web site, 
and then returns to your page, the visited link appears in the color you 
assign it here.
 
✓ Hover link: If a reader hovers his or her cursor over a link on your page 
but doesn’t click, that link switches to the color you assign here.
 
✓ Active link: When a reader clicks a link, it’s active. The act of clicking 
the link changes the color of the link to the color you specify here. After 
the link has been clicked, though, it’s considered a visited link and will 
change to the color you specified in the Visited Link field.

Part III: Adding Useful Elements to Your TypePad Blog 
If you want outgoing links to appear in a different color from your primary 
font color (and this is advisable), insert the hex code you want to use (click 
the color wheel button if you need some ideas).
Last in this subsection, decide if you want your links to be bold, underlined, 
both, or neither. It’s entirely a matter of personal preference, but it’s highly 
advisable that you have at least one way to set apart your links from normal 
text, whether you use a different color, an underline, or a bold font (or some 
combination of the three).
Posts
The Posts section in the Theme Builder is where you make decisions about 
the font, color, and appearance of the text in and around your blog posts. 
Under each subsection (Date Header, Post Title, Post Body, Post Footer), the 
options are identical — they’re pictured in Figure 11-14. Once again, we walk 
you through each of the four subsections.
 
Figure 11-14: 
Options in 
the Theme 
Builder’s 
Posts 
section.
 
Date Header subsection
If you’ve chosen to display a date header on your blog (a decision you make 
in the Content portion of the Design tab), use the drop-down menus shown in 
Figure 11-14 to select the font, text size, and color of the date header. As you 
experiment with your options, you’ll see the sample text in the box change, 
giving you a quick preview.
In addition, you must decide how you want the date header aligned. 
Experiment and see which way is most pleasing to you. Also decide if you 
want the date header bold, italic, and written in all caps. Again, use your best 
judgment to decide which look is best for blog.
You may want to use a border to set apart the date, and you can choose 
among a variety of options in the drop-down menu.

233
 Chapter 11: Finding and Using a TypePad Theme
Post Title subsection
Make your selections for the appearance of your post title. Generally, the 
post title is the most noticeable and prominent element of a blog post, and 
it’s standard to set it apart with a different alignment, color, size, or some 
combination of the three.
Use a border, if you like, to further set the title apart, but be careful about the 
overuse of borders in your main content column. Generally, one or two bor-
ders in the post area of a blog is all that’s advisable; if you use more, it starts 
to get visually cluttered.
Post Body subsection
Again, choose how you’d like your text to appear, this time for the body of 
your post. The post body is the heart of your content, and you want it to look 
its best — select a size and color that are easily readable. In the post body, 
you might want to steer clear of centered text, which works well in date head-
ers and post titles but can make the post body hard to read.
Post Footer subsection
If you’ve chosen to display a footer, you’ll format it in the Post Footer subsec-
tion. Generally, the post footer is given a lower profile than the rest of the 
items in your main content column. You might want to make the font smaller 
and lighter than the other elements — just be sure it’s still readable.
 
As you set up the Posts section of the Theme Builder, you will notice that you 
have the option to set each element to a different font. You can do it, but you 
probably shouldn’t do it — using the same font for all the items in your posts 
is visually pleasing. To set apart elements such as footers and titles, consider 
using other methods, such as color and alignment.
Sidebar modules
The last section of the Theme Builder is titled Sidebar Modules; as you might 
guess, you use this section to format the text, images, and links that appear 
in your sidebar(s). If you have multiple sidebars, the choices you make in this 
section apply to all of them.
Before we go further, see Figure 11-15 for a close look at a sample TypePad 
sidebar — this will make it easier to understand what sidebar element each 
of these subsections addresses.

Sidebar links
Sidebar Title subsection
A sidebar title, as designated in Figure 11-15, refers to the titles of your 
TypeLists (see Chapter 8). Using the fields and drop-down menus, decide 
what font, colors, alignments, and borders you want to use in your sidebar 
titles. In the sample shown in Figure 11-15, a bottom border is applied, and 
the text is aligned left, with a bold, all-caps font.
It’s common for bloggers to make the font in their sidebars smaller than the 
font in their main content column — if you do this, be sure the text is still 
easy to read!
Sidebar Items subsection
The Sidebar Items subsection deals with the text in your sidebar that is not 
a title. If, for example, you have a Notes TypeList that serves as a welcome 
statement (such as the one in Figure 11-15), that text would be formatted in 
this subsection.
Use the fields and drop-down menus to make your style selections just as 
you’ve done throughout the Theme Builder.
Echoing our advice in the preceding section, consider making your font 
choice uniform throughout your blog. It’s advisable (though certainly not 

235
 Chapter 11: Finding and Using a TypePad Theme
required) for the titles and text in your sidebar to be the same font that you 
used in your main content column.
Sidebar Images subsection
You will likely place some images in your sidebar — perhaps you’ll use a per-
sonal photo or a graphic banner. If you want a border to appear around these 
images, you’d use the fields and drop-down menus in the Sidebar Images sub-
section to edit the format of your border.
Depending on the types of images in your sidebar, keep in mind that applying 
a border may interfere with the appearance of your images. Play around with 
your options in this subsection, and do several previews, making sure you’ve 
selected an option that highlights your sidebar images best.
Sidebar Links subsection
You use the Sidebar Links subsection to customize the appearance of your 
sidebar links, just as you did with your post links in the General section of 
the Theme Builder. Insert the hex codes into the fields next to each of the 
four types of links (refer to the “Links” section, if you need a refresher).
 
Your sidebar will likely contain many more links than your posts contain. Be 
sure you’ve selected hex codes that complement your design — you may even 
want to use the identical hex codes you used for your post links.
Inserting an Image into Your Sidebar
Including a sidebar image on your blog is an excellent way to promote 
another Web site, blog, or product. Sidebar images are usually fairly small 
(a common size is 125 pixels by 125 pixels, but the size ultimately depends 
on your own blog’s theme and design), and you can set them up to link to 
another Web site or blog.
You upload a graphic or an image to your TypePad account and use simple 
HTML to reference (or show) the image and link it to the other site. TypePad 
offers two ways to insert a sidebar image: You can use a Notes TypeList or 
an Embed Your Own HTML widget (both are addressed in Chapter 8). Both 
options offer identical results. The only real difference (and it’s a notable 
one!) is that the TypeLists can be saved in your Library even when they’re 
not in place on your blog. This gives you the freedom to publish and unpub-
lish your TypeLists freely without having to re-create them from scratch. The 
Embed Your Own HTML widget, on the other hand, cannot be stored if it’s 
not in use. As long as it’s installed on your sidebar, your code is in place. If 
you remove the widget from your sidebar (using the drag-and-drop content 
editor), the widget is deleted, along with the code it contains.

236
Part III: Adding Useful Elements to Your TypePad Blog 
 
Keeping the storage difference in mind, our best recommendation is to use the 
Notes TypeList to insert sidebar images. If you still want to proceed with the 
Embed Your Own HTML widget, however, we give instructions for it (and the 
Notes TypeList) in the next two sections.
Inserting a sidebar image 
using a Notes TypeList
To insert a sidebar image using a Notes TypeList, follow these steps:
 
1. Upload your graphic or image to File Manager.
 
2. Click the image file name.
 
 A new browser tab opens and displays the image.
 
3. Copy the URL in the address bar.
 
 This is the URL where your image resides on the TypePad server. You’ll 
need it for your HTML code in a minute.
 
4. Go to your TypeLists Library, and add a new Notes TypeList.
 
 (For detailed instructions, see “Creating a Notes TypeList” in Chapter 8.)
 
5. Add the following HTML in the Notes field:
<a href=“http://www.blogname.com”><img src=“http:// URL_you_copied_in_
step_3.jpg”></a>
 
 Referring to the sample code in this step, change the first URL (http://
www.blogname.com) to the address of the site you want the image to 
link to; change the second URL (in the <img src> code) to reflect the 
address you copied in Step 3.
 
 In a moment, we explain exactly what that HTML code is doing. For now, 
proceed to Step 6.
 
6. Click Save.
 
7. Publish your new TypeList to your blog.
Inserting an image using the Embed 
Your Own HTML widget
Using the Embed Your Own HTML widget is the other method for inserting an 
image in your sidebar. The following instructions explain how to do it:

237
 Chapter 11: Finding and Using a TypePad Theme
 
1. Upload your graphic or image to File Manager.
 
2. Click the image file name.
 
 A new browser tab opens and displays the image.
 
3. Copy the URL in the address bar.
 
 This is the URL where your image resides on the TypePad server. You’ll 
need it for your HTML code in a minute.
 
4. Go to your blog’s Content area (located under the Design tab).
 
5. Choose Widgets from the Categories menu.
 
6. Choose Embed Your Own HTML from the Modules menu.
 
7. Click Add this Module in the Details box.
 
 The Custom HTML pop-up window appears.
 
8. Type the following HTML in the HTML field:
<a href=“http://www.blogname.com”><img src=“http:// URL_you_copied_in_
step_3.jpg”></a>
 
 Referring to the sample code in this step, change the first URL (http://
www.blogname.com) to the address of the site you want the image to 
link to; change the second URL (in the <img src> code) to reflect the 
address you copied in Step 3.
 
 Change the first URL (in the <a href> code) to the address of the site 
you want the image to link to; change the second URL (in the <img 
src> code) to reflect the address you copied in Step 3.
 
 In a moment, we explain exactly what that HTML code is doing. For now, 
proceed to Step 9.
 
9. Change the Label name, if you like.
 
10. Click OK.
 
 Your new widget module appears at the top of your sidebar. You can 
reorder it as necessary.
Understanding the sidebar image HTML
As you know, computers don’t just know what to do; humans have to tell 
them what to do. We convey those instructions by using computer code to 
speak their language. Now, we realize that people assume you have to be 
crazy smart and super nerdy to know how to code. Well, some coding is 
involved and takes years to learn, but other coding, such as simple HTML, is 
easy and can be learned quickly. To start you on your way, we will explain 
the HTML you just used in your Notes TypeList.

238
Part III: Adding Useful Elements to Your TypePad Blog 
The Notes TypeList you just created needs to tell the browser to show an 
image in your sidebar and link it to another Web site or blog. We did all that 
with two sets of HTML parameters: <a href> and <img src>.
In the example
<a href=“http://www.bloggingbasics101.com”><img src=“http://”URL_of_image.
jpg”></a>
we start with <a href=“URL”> and end with </a>. Those two tags — 
<a href=“URL”> and </a> — go together. The first one opens the com-
mand (it tells the browser to pay attention because we’re giving it instruc-
tions to link somewhere). The </a> ends the command and tells the 
computer we are finished with those instructions. In this case, the command 
is that we want to link to another blog, so we replace the URL between the 
quotes with the URL of the blog we want to link to (we use Melanie’s blog, 
Blogging Basics 101, as an example):
<a href=“http://www.bloggingbasics101.com”>
Note that the URL is within quotes. This is important. The quotes are another 
part of the instructions for the browser. If you leave out the quotes or use 
smart quotes (curly quotes) in HTML, it won’t work because the browser 
software won’t recognize the command.
Now, because <a href=“URL”> </a> is the code for a link, you want to 
make sure you have text or an image that is a link. We need to put something 
(in this case, an image) between the two pieces of code so the reader has some-
thing to click for the link to work. To use an image, we have to tell the browser 
which image to use and where to find it. That HTML code looks like this:
<img src=“URL_of_image.jpg”>
You can tell that img src is shorthand for image source (or where the image is 
located). To call the correct image, you tell the browser which image you want 
to use. We did that in Step 3 (in the “Inserting an image using the Embed Your 
Own HTML widget” section) when we clicked the image and copied the URL.
So now you understand a little bit of HTML code. You know that this code
<a href=“http://www.bloggingbasics101.com”><img src=“http://”URL_you_copied_in_
step_3.jpg”></a>
is telling the browser to pull a specific image (<img src=“http:// 
URL_you_copied_in_step_3.jpg”>), link it to Blogging Basics 101 
(<a href=“http://www.bloggingbasics101.com”>) and then stop 
the command after the image is pulled and linked (</a>).

 Chapter 11: Finding and Using a TypePad Theme
Managing Existing Designs
There is no limit to the number of designs you can save in your TypePad 
account, so feel free to add and experiment with new looks, saving them for 
editing or applying later. When you are ready to go back and take a look at 
a design you’ve saved, visit the Design tab, and scroll to the bottom of the 
page. You’ll see a box that looks similar to the one in Figure 11-16.
Every TypePad design you’ve created (for this particular blog or any other 
blog under the same account) is listed in this box, saved under the name of 
the theme, unless you’ve renamed it.
Customizing a saved design
To make change to an existing design, click the Customize button to the right 
of the design’s name (refer to Figure 11-16). A drop-down menu appears, 
giving you the option to choose the Theme Builder (only if it’s a Theme 
Builder design), Colors (only if it’s a theme with editable colors), Layouts, 
Content, and Custom CSS. Choose any one of these options, and you’ll be 
taken to the corresponding page; simply follow this chapter’s editing instruc-
tions for that particular function.

box in the 
Design tab.
 

240
Part III: Adding Useful Elements to Your TypePad Blog 
Taking other actions on a saved design
You may need to take a broader action on a particular design, and clicking the 
Actions button to the right of your design’s title (refer to Figure 11-16) gives you 
a drop-down menu of available actions. The menu contains four or five options, 
depending on whether it’s a currently applied design. Let’s walk through each one.
Apply
Selecting the Apply option instantly applies the design to your blog. Choose 
this option only when you’re sure it’s the design you want to use!
Preview
The Preview option is just what it sounds like; when you click here, a new 
window opens, offering you a peek at how the design will look on your blog. 
It’s always a good idea to preview a design before you apply it. When you’re 
finished with the preview, simply close out the preview window, and you’ll 
still be at the Design tab.
Rename
By default, TypePad names your saved designs by the name of the theme. 
If you’re managing multiple designs, this might make it hard to keep them 
straight. Click Rename to give the design a name that makes sense to you. 
When you choose this option, you’ll see the design name change to two blank 
boxes, like the ones pictured in Figure 11-17.
The top box is where your design’s name should go. To change the existing 
one, delete what is currently in the box, and add the new name. Whatever 
you type in the bottom box will appear below the design’s title in your design 
list. You can leave the bottom box blank, or you can use it to leave yourself a 
note regarding the design (such as “apply in August” or “designed by John”).
Duplicate
The Duplicate option is a useful feature. Click this option, and TypePad will 
make an identical copy of the selected design, saved under the name Copy of 
[original design name]. This lets you duplicate a design you like, tweak-
ing only the small elements that may need work. It prevents you from having 
to rebuild another version of the design from the ground up. This may be espe-
cially helpful for bloggers who like to change out their header design (perhaps 
seasonally) but want to keep their sidebar information in the same spot.

241
 Chapter 11: Finding and Using a TypePad Theme
 
Figure 11-17: 
Renaming a 
design.
 
After you’ve duplicated a design, you can rename or edit it using the steps 
previously given in this chapter.
Delete
The Delete option allows you to delete one of your saved designs. Note 
that it does not delete the blog, only the design. You will see this option in 
the Actions drop-down menu only if the design is not currently applied to 
a design in your account. This handy safety measure keeps you from acci-
dentally deleting a design you’re using! If you don’t see the Delete option, it 
means that you’ve applied the design (perhaps to a different blog under your 
same account). If you still want to delete the design, you’ll need to find where 
it’s applied and apply a different theme, and only then can you delete it.
Because TypePad lets you store as many saved designs as you like, you don’t 
have to do a lot of deleting. But if you find that your old designs are cluttering 
up the Design tab, and you’re positive that you’ll never use them again, delet-
ing them might be a good way to simplify.

242
Part III: Adding Useful Elements to Your TypePad Blog 
This chapter has given you a ton of information to chew on — the subject of 
blog design is a big one! The bottom line is that you shouldn’t be afraid to 
experiment, especially on the designs that aren’t currently applied to your 
blog. Jump in and learn the ropes by trying out the features in the Design tab. 
Refer to the resources in Chapter 16 for additional help.

t’s the million-dollar question (no pun intended): “How can a blogger turn 
his blog from a hobby into a business?” If you’ve invested a lot of time and 
creative energy in churning out a top-notch blog, it’s understandable that 
you’d want to see some return on that investment. Do a Google search on 
making money with my blog, and you’ll likely encounter sites that tell you how 
you can make many thousands of dollars monthly with blogging. You’ll prob-
ably encounter others who bemoan how hard it is to earn even a hundred 
bucks a month. You’d be wise to enter the world of professional blogging 
with your eyes open and your expectations realistic, realizing that many suc-
cessful bloggers don’t earn enough to consider it a full-time primary income. 
But it’s not a bad part-time job, especially if it’s something you’d be doing 
anyway, for free!
Entire books have been written on the subject of blog monetization, or earn-
ing income on your blog, so one chapter won’t be enough to cover every 
angle of the subject. We can, however, give you an overview of how many 
bloggers are accomplishing this, especially as it relates to TypePad blogging. 
Professional blogging is a lot of work, whether you use an outside ad service, 
sell ads yourself, or use TypePad’s in-house ad network. But TypePad has 
several tools in place to make things simpler.

246
Part IV: Taking Your Blog to the Next Level 
Understanding How You Can Make 
Money with Your Blog
When it comes to blog monetization, you need to keep in mind one important 
(if slightly harsh) truth: Earning income requires traffic. If your content is 
stellar and your concept is marketable, but no one is reading you, you’ll be 
hard-pressed to find advertisers willing to pay you for advertising. The most 
important first step in monetizing your blog is to manage a blog that invites a 
readership. You can do this by regularly offering valuable content (see Chapter 6)
 and participating robustly in the online community (see Chapter 1). After 
you have a solid traffic base, you’ll begin to attract advertising interest.
 
Keep in mind, too, that blogging for income is a business. You’ll need to keep 
good records and talk with your tax professional about what your tax impli-
cations might be. (While you’re at it, ask that same professional what blog-
related expenses, such as a computer and monthly Internet access, you can 
deduct — you might be surprised!)
If you’re new to blogging, you may be wondering how it’s even possible for 
a blog to generate income. Entrepreneurial bloggers are finding ever more 
creative ways to earn money, but their efforts usually fall under these four 
categories: selling ad space, participating in an affiliate ad program, getting 
paid for posts, and using their blogs as a springboard for other paying jobs. 
We describe each of these in this section.
The rules for making money with your blog
If you choose to work with marketers and adver-
tisers, you must understand that you have an 
ethical and legal responsibility to your readers 
to disclose all relationships related to compen-
sation (including product reviews). This isn’t just 
our opinion; the FTC (Federal Trade Commission) 
has handed down specific guidelines for how 
bloggers and advertisers disclose their rela-
tionships (www.ftc.gov/multimedia/
video/business/endorsement-
guides.shtm). If you are accepting products 
for review or being paid in any way for a post, 
you must disclose that to your audience. Don’t 
be overwhelmed by this, because the solution 
is simple: Be entirely transparent, and disclose 
anything that might be construed as compen-
sation. Transparency is your friend; it will help 
keep your blogging integrity intact and may save 
you a legal headache or two.

247
 Chapter 12: Making Money with Your Blog
Sidebar advertisements
Magazines, as you well know, include with their content plenty of advertise-
ments to generate revenue. You can do the same by selling ad space on your 
blog, placing ads wherever your design and personal inclination allow.
 
Install advertisements the same way you’d install any other image on your 
sidebar: by using either a Notes TypeList or an Embed Your Own HTML 
widget. See detailed instructions for both methods in Chapter 11.
Figure 12-1 shows how a blog might look with an advertisement in the sidebar 
(in this example, the advertisement reads Sample Ad).
You can use an outside ad network — a service that sells the ads for you, 
keeping a percentage of earnings (usually between 40 and 60 percent) in 
exchange for selling your ads. The ad network gives you a snippet of code to 
place on your blog’s sidebar. Then the ad network rotates the ads through 
the designated space, using the code you placed there.

Part IV: Taking Your Blog to the Next Level 
You are paid based on the number of impressions (or page visits) you receive. 
This advertising model is referred to as CPM, which stands for Cost Per Mille 
(that’s mille as in thousand). Do a Google search for CPM ad networks, and 
you’ll find plenty of networks you can contact for more information about 
the services they can offer. Some ad networks are highly selective, offering 
spots only to bloggers of a specific niche or traffic range; others are open to 
anyone. Each network’s terms vary widely, so be sure to read the fine print 
about what percentage of revenue you’ll receive.
Some other outside ad services (Google AdSense is a well-known example) 
follow a CPC, or Cost Per Click, model, which means you are paid only when 
the ad on your blog is actually clicked, not just viewed. Again, try a Google 
search for CPC ad networks to begin your comparison.
 
Usually (but not always), CPM advertising is more profitable for bloggers than 
CPC advertising.
Affiliate advertising
An affiliate advertising model is one in which you sign up with a company as 
someone who refers readers to that company or its products, either through 
a graphic ad in your sidebar or a link somewhere on your blog. That com-
pany then assigns you a specific identification code that you include in your 
links for tracking purposes. Under this system, when one of your readers 
clicks your link to that company and buys something, you receive a small 
commission on that purchase. This model tends to work best for people who 
are frequently blogging about products related to their niche.
Probably the most well-known example of affiliate advertising online is 
Amazon.com. In fact, TypePad offers an Amazon widget (www.sixapart.
com/typepad/widgets/commerce) that helps you post your Amazon 
favorites on your blog and earn income if one of your readers makes a pur-
chase from your link (note that you have to have your Amazon Associate or 
Wish List ID connected to your TypePad account to be paid for reader pur-
chases; see Chapter 4 to make sure your accounts are linked). For an exam-
ple of how this widget might look on a sidebar, see Figure 12-2.
Here’s an example of how affiliate advertising might work. Suppose you’re a 
food blogger, and you establish affiliate accounts with several online stores 
that sell high-end cooking products. If you post a tutorial on the right way 
to cook a roast, you can include links to several roasting pans through your 
affiliate accounts, earning income if a reader purchases something.

249

In affiliate advertising (as in all advertising), your integrity is important. If 
you want your readers to be able to trust you, don’t use your posts as a 
clearinghouse for every imaginable link to every conceivable product, on the 
slight chance that you might earn a small commission. Instead, link only to 
products you’d actually recommend (with or without the commission). Let 
your readers know that they can count on you to link only to products and 
companies you trust.
Paid blog posts
Some bloggers generate revenue by charging companies a fee to blog about 
their product. Bloggers do this either through a direct arrangement with the 
company or by signing up with an outside service that makes such arrange-
ments. PayPerPost (payperpost.com) is one well-known example; Izea 
(izea.com) is another. This topic has become a contentious one in the 
blogosphere: Should bloggers consider themselves objective journalists who 
would never put their opinion up for sale? On the other hand, aren’t bloggers 
entitled to charge a fee to generate a post and earn some income for their 
hard work?

250
Part IV: Taking Your Blog to the Next Level 
The issue is surrounded by some murky ethical waters, so tread carefully as 
you determine what would suit your own conscience best. Especially if you’re 
new to blogging, you might want to spend a little time observing and learning 
within the blogging community before making a firm decision on the issue.
It is also common for companies to approach a blogger with an offer of a free 
product in exchange for a review of that product (and the company may or 
may not offer a fee for the blogger’s time). Especially once you’ve established 
a solid record of traffic on your blog, you can be certain these offers will 
begin rolling in. As we said earlier in this chapter, you’d be wise to make deci-
sions about the direction of your blog with the best interests of your readers 
in mind. Don’t agree to review a product just because it’s free; on the other 
hand, if it’s a product your readers may legitimately find interesting, your 
honest opinion may be of real value to them.
Whatever path you choose, remember that readers want to be able to trust 
the bloggers they read.
 
If you do accept payment for a particular post, or if you receive a free product, 
the new FTC guidelines require you to disclose this fully to your readers. It’s 
a good idea to set firm standards for yourself in this area, and you can post 
those standards clearly on your About Me page or a separate page devoted to 
your disclosure policies (see Chapter 6 for instructions on creating a page).
Other projects
You may never be a blogger who earns thousands each month in advertising 
revenue, but you might be surprised what other doors blogging can open 
for you. A top-notch blog with good traffic can lead to endless opportunities, 
particularly if you’re an expert in a particular area. If you have aspirations of 
developing a freelance writing or photography career, think of your blog as 
a portfolio to show to potential clients. Do you want to be an interior deco-
rator? Write a great blog on home décor, develop a following, and use your 
blog as a launching pad for your design business. Let your blog be the online 
place where you hone skills that you can market in the real world.
Making Your Blog Attractive 
to Advertisers
No matter what approach you take with blog advertising (such as using an ad 
network or selling ads yourself), you can do several things to encourage com-
panies to advertise with you:

251
 Chapter 12: Making Money with Your Blog
 
✓ Establish good traffic. We’ve said it once, but it’s worth saying again: 
Advertisers are most interested in blogs that have a lot of readers. 
Companies want to maximize their ad revenue by getting their ads in 
front of as many eyeballs as possible. Work hard at establishing a repu-
table, interesting, entertaining, well-read blog, and the advertising dol-
lars are more likely to follow.
 
✓ Place ads in prime spots. Companies are less inclined to spend money 
on ads buried far down on your page. The closer an ad is to the top of 
your page, the more desirable it is, and the more you can reasonably 
charge for it. Most companies prefer ads that are above the fold, which 
is ad-speak for the part of your blog design that is viewable without any 
scrolling down required. (Above the fold is a holdover term from news-
paper days when articles or advertisements were identified as either 
above or below the fold of the newspaper.)
 
✓ Keep it clean (at least mostly). There are exceptions, of course, but 
most companies are hesitant to buy ad space on blogs that use exces-
sive profanity or post adult content.
 
✓ Write often. Companies prefer to buy ads on blogs that are updated 
regularly. In fact, many ad networks accept only bloggers who commit to 
updating their blogs at least twice a week (or some other set minimum). 
Especially if you sell your own ad space, consider planning, when possi-
ble, for extended posting absences — you can either charge lower rates 
or remove the ads.
 
✓ Be professional. If you’re serious about blogging professionally, treat 
it as you would any other small business. That means you should cor-
respond promptly, keep good records, and follow through on your com-
mitments. If you sell an ad and then forget to run it, you’re disrespecting 
the advertiser and harming your professional reputation.
 
✓ Be honest. Don’t inflate your own statistics to sell an ad. Companies are 
making decisions based on what you tell them, so be a good steward of 
their trust (and their advertising dollars!). For more on this, see the sec-
tion in this chapter about creating your own media kit.
Using TypePad’s Own 
Advertising Program
In the spring of 2008, Six Apart (TypePad’s parent company) decided to use 
its large existing network of bloggers to enter the arena of blog advertising, 
and Six Apart Media was born. Partnering with Adify (a service that serves 
as the engine, technologically speaking, of the ad network), Six Apart Media 

252
Part IV: Taking Your Blog to the Next Level 
may be especially appealing to TypePad bloggers who like the idea of staying 
under the Six Apart umbrella with access to the Six Apart technical support 
they’ve grown to count on.
Six Apart is growing its ad network by using an in-house sales team. 
Participation in the network is open to bloggers on all blogging platforms 
(not just TypePad). One interesting feature offered is the ability of participat-
ing bloggers to set their own CPM rates, an option not all CPM-based ad net-
works offer.
Any blogger can join Six Apart Media by visiting www.sixapart.com/
advertising. Click the Bloggers and Publishers link; this takes you to the 
page that allows you to get started. There are currently no minimum traffic 
requirements, but this page lists a few basic requirements that are in place, 
including updating weekly and not posting any adult content. Click the Apply 
Now button, and type your information in the appropriate text boxes. After 
your application is approved, Six Apart contacts you with further instruc-
tions, usually within a matter of days.
You should note that participating in the Six Apart Media ad network 
requires you to have an account set up with Adify, a step that Six Apart 
explains more fully in the e-mail informing you of your acceptance to the 
program.
For more information, visit the Six Apart Media blog (vip.typepad.com), 
which offers many helpful posts and webinars explaining how you can maxi-
mize your blog revenue with Six Apart Media. In particular, check out its help 
page (vip.typepad.com/help) for assistance with the application process, 
ad placement, and ad tags. You can also contact Six Apart Media’s support 
team directly at VIP@sixapart.com.
 
When you have your Adify account in place, click the Help link in the top-right 
corner of the Adify Dashboard (not the TypePad Dashboard) for more help 
navigating and managing your account.
Running Your Own Advertising 
Campaign
As companies grow more eager to advertise in the blogosphere, many blog-
gers are selling their own ad space, eliminating the middleman ad network 
and thus keeping 100 percent of their revenue. This option works best for 
bloggers who have already established a solid track record of good blog 

253
 Chapter 12: Making Money with Your Blog
statistics. Selling your own ads is not a difficult thing to manage, though it 
does require a willingness to keep good business records of the ads you 
have scheduled to run and the payment you’ve received. You’ll need to have 
a strong familiarity with managing how and where to put graphic images or 
links on your sidebar using TypeLists.
You can wait until businesses approach you to ask about buying an ad on 
your blog (and if your traffic is significant, they probably will). But if you’re 
a go-getter, don’t hesitate to knock on some doors and try to sell your ad 
space to companies. Small to midsize businesses are probably more likely 
to respond than large corporations, which generally funnel their advertis-
ing dollars through ad networks. Keep in mind that you’ll want to approach 
companies that are especially relevant to your target audience. If you’re writ-
ing a blog that covers U.S. men’s soccer, for example, a sporting-goods store 
might be interested in an ad. A company that sells handmade diaper bags? 
Probably not.
Create a media kit
If you decide you want to try to sell your own advertising, you must have 
a media kit, or a list of details that tells potential advertisers everything 
they need to know about your blog. Prepare a document containing those 
details and e-mail it to advertisers upon request. Or, on a TypePad blog, it 
is even more efficient to accumulate this information on a permanent page 
(see Chapter 6). When you approach an advertiser (or it approaches you), 
you can give the advertiser the permalink to your media-kit page. A distinct 
advantage of hosting your media kit on a page is that you can update it as 
needed, knowing that advertisers always have access to the most current 
information.
Be specific, thorough, and professional in your media kit, and include the 
following information:
 
✓ Branding: Visually, your media kit and your blog should have a similar 
look and feel (logo, colors, tone, and so on). This is another distinct 
advantage to hosting your media kit on a page — the header at the top is 
actually your blog header.
 
✓ Elevator pitch: Imagine that you have 60 seconds to explain to a 
stranger what your blog is about. You’d want your answer to be catchy, 
descriptive, and accurate (for example, “Bringing you the latest and 
greatest information about U.S. men’s soccer”). Include your elevator 
pitch at the beginning of your media kit.

254
Part IV: Taking Your Blog to the Next Level 
 
✓ Explanation of your blog’s topic or niche: Expand a little more on what 
you write about, why it’s an important part of the online dialogue among 
others in the same niche (or blog topic), and why you are a good candi-
date for an ad buy.
 
✓ Traffic statistics: Being entirely honest, give an accurate report of your 
blog traffic. Potential advertisers have the right to expect full disclosure 
from you in this department, and communicating accurately may end 
up leading to a long-standing business relationship. Some of the figures 
you might want to include are the monthly unique visitors or page 
views and the total number of feed subscribers. You can also share your 
Google PageRank, Technorati rank, and Alexa page rankings, if you’re so 
inclined.
 
 Providing plenty of meaty statistics requires that you have access to 
more than just the statistics provided in the TypePad Dashboard; con-
sider using a third-party statistics service (discussed in Appendix B).
 
✓ Traffic interpretation: This is especially important if you write a 
blog that’s targeted to a geographical area. For example, if you live 
in Chicago, and you’re trying to sell a blog ad to the deli down the 
street, the deli owner may not be especially impressed that you have 
thousands of daily visitors from around the globe. But if the statistics 
counter tells you that you have substantial viewers in your Chicago 
community, the deli might see great value in an ad.
 
✓ Demographics: Consider taking a confidential survey of your readership, 
using an online survey service (free and paid options are available — 
do a Google search for blog survey to find options that may work for 
you). Marketers may want to know more specifics about your readership 
(gender, income, marital status). Proceed carefully, though — some read-
ers may (understandably) see this as an intrusion. Be clear about your 
reasons for the survey and how you plan to use the data you collect.
 
✓ Advertising sizes/options, rates, and guidelines: What size(s) of adver-
tising do you offer (for example, 125×125, 120×600)? Are your rates 
weekly, monthly, or both? Will you give clients a discount if they book 
longer ad times? Explain all these policies in your media kit. Also let 
advertisers know if you accept animated advertising, whether you issue 
refunds, and under what circumstances refunds are granted.
 
✓ Payment: Be clear about how and when you expect payment. Using 
PayPal (www.paypal.com) or another online payment system is espe-
cially helpful, because those companies generally offer easy-to-use 
invoices that make recordkeeping much simpler.

255
 Chapter 12: Making Money with Your Blog
Set your prices, terms, and conditions
Determining the amount you’ll charge for an ad is tricky. No universally 
accepted formula exists for generating this rate; most bloggers base it on a 
comparison with what other bloggers in their niche are charging, combined 
with a good, old-fashioned gut instinct. It will likely take you a few months to 
settle on an ad rate that is profitable for you and reasonable to advertisers, 
so expect some trial and error.
Because you have to start somewhere, here’s a suggestion: Investigate an 
ad network that interests you or one that is widely used by other bloggers 
in your niche. Find out what CPM range it offers — it can vary widely from a 
few pennies to $20 per thousand page views. Use that number to calculate a 
beginning price point for your own ads. For example, let’s say you settle on 
a CPM rate of $3. If you receive ten thousand page views per month, that’s 
ten separate thousand-click increments. Ten times a $3 CPM equals $30, so 
you could charge $30 per month for a moderately-sized sidebar ad (less for 
a smaller ad, more for a larger one). Your best bet is to start on the more 
modest end of the pricing spectrum; then, if your ad space sells like hot 
cakes, you’ll know you can gradually move your prices up.
Again, it would be valuable to install third-party traffic-interpretation soft-
ware such as Google Analytics (www.google.com/analytics) on your 
TypePad blog. Google Analytics allows you to track click-throughs (the 
number of times readers click a particular link or ad you put in front of 
them). Tracking click-throughs allows you to show value in advertising and 
help yourself sell more ads down the road. We discuss using third-party sta-
tistics software more fully in Appendix B.
Advertising on your blog is a personal decision. Many bloggers want to focus 
on writing and their community without the worry of making money. On the 
other hand, if you can make a few bucks doing something you love, why not? 
The key is to disclose your policies and be transparent with your readers. Let 
them know what they can expect from you right up front.
If you decide that advertising is something you’d like to try, we’ve given you 
several options to choose among. Take a few months to try out those options 
to see which one is a fit with you and your blog. If you’re serious about blog-
ging professionally, treat it as you would any other small business: Do it well, 
and do it with the best interest of your customer (reader) in mind.

Chapter 13
Importing, Exporting, and 
Archiving
In This Chapter
▶ Importing an existing blog to TypePad
▶ Backing up your TypePad blog
Just about every blogger contemplates migrating his or her blog at some 
point. It’s not uncommon for bloggers to start a blog on one platform and 
then, after they’re comfortable with the nuances of blogging, decide that a 
different platform better suits their needs. It may be that they would like to 
have more control over their blog and template code, or would like to have 
advertisements on their blog and their current platform doesn’t allow those. 
This chapter walks you through the steps of importing content from an exist-
ing blog to your TypePad blog and shows you how to export and archive 
your TypePad blog.
 
We encourage you to refer to Chapter 4 and our discussion about setting up 
an intuitive filing system. Taking the time to set up a filing system that makes 
sense to you helps you find files as easily and quickly as possible.
Understanding TypePad’s Import 
and Export Options
Importing or exporting a blog simply means you’re moving existing blog 
content from one blogging platform (exporting) to another blogging platform 
(importing). When you export blog content, you create a file that contains 
all of your blog’s post content and comments. You use that file to import the 
content to your new blog platform.

258
Part IV: Taking Your Blog to the Next Level 
 
Note that neither your blog’s template code nor your actual images are included 
in this export file. The export file you create is a stripped version of your blog 
that includes only basic HTML markup and content, image links, and reader com-
ments. You must move any images, podcasts, and video files manually.
Exporting and importing a blog is rarely painless: You’ll most likely experi-
ence broken permalinks, missing images, and possibly missing comments 
(among other issues). To make this process less of a headache, it might be 
a good idea to consider from the start how you’ll set up your file structure 
for uploaded images, documents, video, podcasts, and the like. After your 
new file structure is in place, you’ll be able to import or export your blog to 
a new platform (such as TypePad, Movable Type, or WordPress) more easily 
because you can set up a version of that filing system on your new blog plat-
form or server and move your files (for example, images, videos, or podcasts) 
directly into their relevant folders. A little planning on the front end may save 
you some headaches down the road.
Importing an Existing Blog to TypePad
Before you import an existing blog from another blogging platform to 
TypePad, you need to export the content of that blog. Each blog platform 
has its own method of exporting content, but it’s usually as simple as finding 
the export option and then saving a file to your computer. Then you upload 
or import that file to the TypePad blogging platform. The instructions in this 
section assume that you have already exported your blog’s existing content 
and have saved the export file (or you have the URL for the file).
TypePad allows you to import blog content to its platform from another 
TypePad blog, Movable Type, WordPress.com, or WordPress WXR file (gener-
ated from your WordPress.org blog). If you would like to import your Blogger 
blog to TypePad, you can find specific instructions for that migration at 
help.sixapart.com/tp/us/blogger_import.html.
To import blog content to a TypePad blog, you have to set up an initial 
TypePad blog (see Chapter 5). After you’ve established your new blog, you can 
find TypePad’s import/export options by clicking Settings➪ Import/Export on 
the blog-level bar. This takes you to a screen like the one in Figure 13-1.

259
 Chapter 13: Importing, Exporting, and Archiving
 
Figure 13-1:

page, on 
your blog’s 
Settings tab.
 
Importing a TypePad or 
Movable Type blog
If you have a TypePad or Movable Type blog that you want to merge with 
your current TypePad account, you can definitely do that. Remember that 
you still need to create an export file of the blog (which we discuss later in 
this chapter) before you can import it into your current account. These are 
the instructions for importing an existing TypePad or Movable Type blog:
 
1. Click to select the TypePad, Movable Type, or Other MTIF File option.
 
2. If you want to upload the file from your computer:
 
a. Click to select Upload File from Your Computer.
 
b. Click the browse button to find the file.
 
c. Click the Import button.

260
Part IV: Taking Your Blog to the Next Level 
 
3. If you want to import from a Web address:
 
a. Click to select Import from a Web Address.
 
b. Click inside the Import URL text box, and type the necessary URL.
 
c. Click the Import button.
Importing a WordPress.com blog
When you are ready to move your WordPress.com blog to TypePad, you can 
follow these instructions:
 
1. Click to select the WordPress.com option.
 
2. Type your WordPress.com information in the text boxes provided.
 
 You’ll need your URL, username, and password.
 
3. Click the Import button.
Importing a WordPress.org blog
If you’d like to import your WordPress.org blog to TypePad, you can use 
these instructions:
 
1. Click to select the WordPress WXR file option.
 
2. If you want to upload the file from your computer:
 
a. Click to select Upload File from Your Computer.
 
b. Click the Browse button to find the file.
 
c. Click the Import button.
 
3. If you want to import from a Web address:
 
a. Click to select Import from a Web Address.
 
b. Click inside the Import URL text box, and type the necessary URL.
 
c. Click the Import button.
Now that you’ve transferred your existing blog to your TypePad account, you 
can view the blog by clicking the View Your Blog link. Your blog probably 
won’t look the same as it did on your previous blog platform. You’ll need to 
do some tweaking.

261
 Chapter 13: Importing, Exporting, and Archiving
 
Many bloggers choose to keep their previous blog up and running (allowing 
readers to leave comments, and so on) while they work on perfecting their 
blog’s new look. You can choose a new template or re-create your previous 
template, tweak the category or tag lists, ensure that your images are still 
showing up, check your permalinks to make sure they still work, and set up a 
new RSS feed. Then, when you have everything just the way you like it, tell 
your readers your new blog URL, and give them your new RSS feed so they can 
subscribe to your new blog’s updates.
Creating an Export of Your TypePad Blog
People export a blog not only because they want to move their existing blog 
from one blog platform to another, but also to archive their blog’s content. 
That way, they can restore the content if it’s ever lost or compromised.
Archiving your blog content is a crucial, if mundane, part of blogging. 
Archiving your blog refers to the simple process of exporting your content 
and saving it in a place different from your TypePad account (for example, 
on your computer or an external hard drive). Although server failures and 
hacking attacks are a rare occurrence with TypePad-hosted blogs, it’s always 
wise to make a backup, just as you should for anything you produce on your 
computer. In the unlikely event of a system failure or hacking attack, your 
exported file can be retrieved and imported back to TypePad to restore the 
missing information.
When you export your TypePad blog, you create a file that houses your 
blog’s post content, image links (not the images themselves) and permalinks, 
and reader comments. You can use this file for two purposes: to export your 
TypePad blog to another blog platform or to restore your blog if anything 
happens to it. To export or archive your TypePad blog posts, follow these 
steps (from the same Import/Export page pictured in Figure 13-1):
 
1. Scroll down the page, and click the Export button.
 
 Depending on the size of your blog, it may take several minutes for the 
export to complete.
 
2. When prompted, save the export file to your computer or external 
hard drive.
 
To save yourself time when looking for blog-related files, you may want to 
make a specific folder on your home computer where you keep ideas, graph-
ics, or export files related to your blog.

Tweaking Your TypePad Theme 
with Custom CSS or Advanced 
Templates
In This Chapter
▶ Discovering the difference between custom CSS and Advanced Templates
▶ Using simple CSS to customize your blog template
▶ Changing the fundamental design of your blog with Advanced Templates
I
f you have a TypePad Pro Unlimited account, TypePad offers you two 
ways to customize the look and feel of your blog beyond what is offered 
in regular templates: custom CSS and Advanced Templates. Both options 
allow you to change aspects of your blog (often referred to as page elements 
or modules) with CSS. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and is similar to 
HTML in that it defines how a browser reads your Web pages (or, in this case, 
your blog’s pages). You can use the custom CSS or Advanced Templates 
option to change everything from the color scheme of your template (includ-
ing your background and link colors) to the font of your entire blog to using a 
custom banner. You can even build a new template on your personal tastes.
 
Any time you’d like to change the look of your blog, we strongly suggest that 
you make a test blog first so you can tweak everything and get it just right 
before you show it to your readers. After you have everything just the way 
you like it, you can apply the new template to your main blog.
To use custom CSS or Advanced Templates, you need a basic understanding 
of CSS and how to use it. Although we point you to a few CSS resources later 
in the chapter, we assume that you already have that basic understanding or 
are willing to make some mistakes and get your hands dirty in your CSS. We 
are not providing a complete CSS tutorial here. The instructions we provide 
in this chapter are basic tweaks; if you try them and understand how they 
work, you can work your way up to more advanced changes.

264
Part IV: Taking Your Blog to the Next Level 
 
This chapter includes instructions for using customized colors in your blog 
design. To choose a customized color, check out ColorPicker.com. You 
select a color that suits your design, and the Web site tells you the hexadeci-
mal value for the color so you can insert it in your CSS. (The hexadecimal 
value is the #number used by your browser to determine what color to dis-
play; for example, #2485C5 is the hexadecimal value for a specific shade of 
blue.) Using the same hexadecimal value in any custom design images (such 
as your banner) and for your post header and links ensures a more cohesive 
look. Two basic hex codes you’ll want to know are white (#ffffff) and black 
(#000000). For a further explanation of hex codes, see the related sidebar in 
Chapter 11.
Choosing Custom CSS or 
Advanced Templates
TypePad’s custom CSS option allows you to change elements of your blog 
design (for example, your blog’s background color) without having to find 
and change specific codes. You can simply insert a snippet of CSS into the 
custom CSS text box and click Save to see the fruits of your labor. By using 
custom CSS instead of Advanced Templates, you are able to continue to take 
advantage of the drag-and-drop features in your blog’s Content area, choose 
specific layouts, and so on.
 
If you choose to enable Advanced Templates, you lose the ability to organize 
your content via the drag-and-drop method offered on the main Design tab 
for your blog. You can only add sidebar content, change style elements, and 
change your design/layout by manually opening the relevant template in your 
Advanced Templates and inserting the appropriate code yourself.
You should use Advanced Templates when you want to do more than a little 
tweak. If you want to truly change the fundamental actions and design of a 
basic template, Advanced Templates allows you to do that.
 
Any CSS you include (either via custom CSS or Advanced Templates) over-
rides your blog’s existing default stylesheet. Additionally, if you change the 
base template for your blog, you’ll have to reenter your custom CSS informa-
tion. For example, if you switch from the Asterisk theme (after you’ve tweaked 
your custom CSS or Advanced Templates) to the Curves theme, you’ll find 
that your custom CSS isn’t automatically transferred to the new theme. You 
have to do that manually.

265
 Chapter 14: Tweaking Your TypePad Theme 
Using Custom CSS
The custom CSS option allows you to control how your blog looks without 
having to work with the actual CSS, HTML, or XML files. Instead of working 
directly in those documents, you can quickly add simple CSS commands via 
the custom CSS option under the Design tab in your blog-level navigation bar. 
In this section, we provide instructions on how to make some basic changes 
to your current blog template with the custom CSS option.
To use the custom CSS feature, click your blog’s Design tab and then click 
the Custom CSS tab in the left sidebar. The Custom CSS page appears, and 
you see a large, blank text area like the one in Figure 14-1. That blank field is 
where you type your custom CSS commands.
Your blog is made up of page elements and modules. Each element contains 
a part of your blog. For instance, your posts are an entry element, your com-
ments are a comment element, and so on. Modules are parts of an element. 
For example, your sidebar element may have several modules in the form of 
TypeLists or widgets.

CSS text

266
Part IV: Taking Your Blog to the Next Level 
As you use your custom CSS option to enhance your blog’s design, you’ll 
need to know how TypePad references each of these elements via CSS. For 
a complete overview of TypePad’s default CSS page structure, please go to 
help.sixapart.com/tp/us/custom_css.html. That Web page provides
 
✓ A page structure overview
 
✓ An explanation of page elements (for example, containers, banner, and 
columns)
 
✓ CSS examples for manipulating content modules (such as TypeLists and 
archives)
After you’re familiar with how your TypePad theme works with CSS, we want 
to show you how to do a few things to customize your blog. In this section, 
we explain how to
 
✓ Use a custom banner instead of the default template banner
 
✓ Add a background image to your blog (or just change the background 
color)
 
✓ Remove the default border around your banner
 
✓ Tweak your navigation bar (if you’re using one)
 
✓ Change the post header font, size, and color so it better matches your 
design
 
✓ Change the width of your columns
Using your own banner
Most bloggers like to customize the look and feel of their blog to represent 
themselves or their brand. An easy way to do that is to use a custom banner 
instead of the default banner from your blog’s template. A banner is simply 
your header image, picture, or title at the top of your blog’s page. As you 
can see in Figures 14-2 (before) and 14-3 (after), a custom banner can be an 
important element of your blog’s brand. Your banner is one of the strongest 
elements people associate with you and your brand.

For best results, choose a template with the same background color as your 
custom banner, or make your banner the same color as your blog template’s 
background. That way, if your banner doesn’t quite fit, it’s less noticeable.
The simplest way to insert a custom banner is to do it via the Theme Builder, 
using the steps we offer in Chapter 11. But the custom banner can be inserted 
using custom CSS as well. If you want to do it this way, follow these steps:
 
1. Save the image file you want to use as your banner to TypePad File 
Manager.
 
 See Chapter 4 for advice on setting up an intuitive filing system.
 
2. In File Manager, click the name of the image you just uploaded.
 
 A new browser window opens to show the image. Make a note of the 
URL in the address bar of this tab or window, because you’ll need 
this URL in Step 5.
 
3. Click your blog’s Design tab.
 
4. Click the Custom CSS tab in the left sidebar.
 
5. Type the upcoming CSS in the text field.
 
 Note that you need to make two changes to the following code:
 
a. Change the background URL to reflect the URL you noted in 
Step 2.
 
b. Change the height value to reflect your banner’s height in pixels. 
You can use a free graphics program such as GIMP to check this 
value (see Chapter 11 for more information on photo-editing 
software).
 
 In the following code, we’ve inserted explanations about what the code 
does, but that’s just to help you understand how it works. You’ll need to 
type the entire code block (without our explanations) in the CSS field.
 
 The following code tells the browser what image file to use as your 
banner. Note that the banner does not repeat:
#banner
{
background: url(http://sampleurl.com/image.jpg) no-repeat;
height: 200px;
}
#banner-inner { overflow: visible; padding: 0; }
 
 This part of the code tells the browser to put the banner flush with the 
top-left corner:

269
 Chapter 14: Tweaking Your TypePad Theme 
#banner-header
{
position: absolute;
left: 0;
top: 0;
width: 100%;
height: 100%;
margin: 0;
padding: 0;
}
 
 The following code tells the browser not to let the default blog title and 
description show up over your banner.
#banner-header a
{
display: block;
left: 0;
top: 0;
height: 199px;
text-indent: -1000em;
}
#banner-description
{
overflow: hidden;
width: 0;
height: 0;
margin: 0;
padding: 0;
text-indent: -1000em;
}

Changing your blog’s background
If you’d like your blog’s background color to reflect your personality or brand 
a bit more, you can either change the color or add a background image.
If you would just like to change the color of your blog’s background, you can 
do that by typing the CSS below in the custom CSS text box. Remember to 
change the hexadecimal value (#000000) to the color you want to use.
body {
background: #000000;
}

270
Part IV: Taking Your Blog to the Next Level 
To make the background even more interesting, you may choose to use an 
actual image. Figure 14-4 shows how you might use an image as your blog’s 
background.
 
When choosing a background image, be sure it’s not too busy. Your goal here 
is to add interest but not distract from your content. A good choice is a light 
crosshatch pattern or a subtle color gradient that gradually flows from dark to 
light as a reader scrolls down the page.
Follow these instructions to add a background image behind your content 
areas:
 
1. Save the image file you want to use as your blog’s background to 
TypePad File Manager.
 
2. In File Manager, right-click the name of the image you just uploaded, 
and choose Copy Link Location from the menu.
 
 You’ll need this URL in Step 5.
 
3. Click your blog’s Design tab.
 
4. Click the Custom CSS tab in the left sidebar.

5. Type the following CSS in the text field, changing the URL to reflect 
the URL you noted in Step 2:
body {
background: url(http://sampleurl.com/image.jpg);
}
 
6. Click Save Changes.
You may want the background image to repeat. If that’s the case, choose one 
of the following repeat options, and change your custom CSS to reflect the 
relevant code.
Repeat horizontally and vertically
body {
background: url(http://sampleurl.com/image.jpg);
background-repeat: repeat
}
Repeat horizontally
body {
background: url(http://sampleurl.com/image.jpg);

background-repeat: repeat-y
}
No repeat
body {

background-repeat: no-repeat
}
Removing the border around 
your custom banner
When you insert a custom banner (using custom CSS or the Theme Builder 
as described in Chapter 11), TypePad automatically inserts a 15-pixel border 
around your banner image. (Refer to Figure 14-3; because the background is 
set to white, you can clearly see the white border in the example.)

272
Part IV: Taking Your Blog to the Next Level 
If you want to remove that default border, you can make the adjustment in 
your custom CSS by following these steps:
 
1. Create a resized banner image.
 
 In Chapter 11, we explain that you should subtract 30 pixels from your 
layout width to use a custom banner (for example, an 800-pixels-wide 
layout should use a 770-pixels-wide banner to allow for the border). If 
you’re going to eliminate the border, however, you’ll need to resize the 
banner without that 30-pixels allowance (for example, an 800-pixels-wide 
layout would use an 800-pixels-wide image).
 
 While you’re using your graphics editor (such as Adobe Photoshop or 
GIMP), make a note of the exact pixel height of your banner, because 
you’ll need it in a few steps.
 
2. Insert the newly resized banner image, using either custom CSS (as 
described earlier in this chapter) or the Theme Builder (described in 
Chapter 11).
 
3. Click your blog’s Design tab.
 
4. Click the Custom CSS tab in the left sidebar.
 
5. In the custom CSS field, insert the following code, replacing 225 with 
the exact pixel height of your banner image that you noted in Step 1:
#banner {
   background-position: 0px 0px;
   height: 225px;
   }
 
6. Preview the changes.
 
 If you’ve correctly sized your new banner, you should see an adjusted 
design with the 15-pixel banner border removed, as shown in the sample 
blog in Figure 14-5.
 
7. Save your changes.
Fine-tuning your navigation bar
In Chapter 11, we tell you how you can insert (or omit) a horizontal navi-
gation bar in your TypePad blog by using the drag-and-drop editor in the 
Content portion of your design. If you’ve decided to use a navigation bar, 
your default navigation bar looks like the one in Figure 14-6.

274
Part IV: Taking Your Blog to the Next Level 
To make the navigation bar fit better with your blog’s look and feel, you can 
change the colors, add borders, change the font, and more. CSS uses some-
thing called classes to define these changes. A class defines the style of a 
page element — in this case, the navigation bar. The CSS classes you’ll want 
to know are
 
✓ nav-list: This is the container for the entire navigation bar.
 
✓ nav-list-item: This class addresses individual navigation items.
 
✓ nav-list-item a: This is the class for navigation links.
To show you how you can change your nav-list CSS to blend better with 
your theme design, we’ll change our navigation bar from the default (refer to 
Figure 14-6) to the one shown in Figure 14-7.
To change your navigation bar modules, follow these instructions:
 
1. Click your blog’s Design tab.
 
2. Click the Custom CSS tab in the left sidebar.

3. Type the following CSS code in the text box:
.nav-list
{
background-color: #FABC07;
border-top: 1.5px solid #000000;
border-bottom: 1.5px solid #000000;
}
.nav-list-item
{
background-color: #FAEB07;
border-right: 1.5px solid #000000;
}
.nav-list-item a
{
text-decoration: none;
color: #000000;
font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
font-size: medium;
font-weight: bold;
letter-spacing: 3px;
}
 
4. Click Save Changes.
We encourage you to play with this code and change the colors, spacing, 
font, and so on. If you’re not fluent in CSS, the best way to learn is to change 
small things and see what happens. Pretty soon, you’ll know exactly how to 
change the things you want to change!
Changing the font, style, and 
color of the post heading
It’s possible to define the size, font, and color of several page elements via 
the custom CSS option. Doing so can help reinforce your brand as it meshes 
with the look and feel of your blog. For instance, if the primary color of your 
design (including your logo, which is part of your brand) is green, you may 
want to make your post heading that color instead of the default black. A 
little custom CSS can help you achieve that.
The individual post heading (or title) of a blog article is defined by three CSS 
classes. The first class, .entry-header, tells the browser how to display 
the post heading. In the following code (which we took from one of our own 
test blogs), the .entry-header class tells the browser to display the post 

276
Part IV: Taking Your Blog to the Next Level 
title in a 22-pixel, black (#000), Georgia, Times New Roman, serif font. When 
an individual post is displayed (that is, when someone uses a permalink to 
find a post), that is how the post title appears.
.entry-header {
 
color: #000;
 
font-family: georgia, ‘times new roman’, serif;
 
font-size: 22px;
}
The next class, .entry-header a, tells the browser how to display a linked 
title. In the following sample CSS, we are telling the browser to display a 
linked post header as dark green (#08AB2F). Because the font family and font 
size values are not included in this CSS, the browser defaults to the preced-
ing CSS, which is a serif font at 22 pixels. Because post titles on the main page 
of a blog are automatically linked to the post’s permalink, this is how the 
post header displays on your front page.
.entry-header a {
 
color: #08AB2F;
 
text-decoration: none;
}
The final class, .entry-header a:hover, tells the browser how to display 
the text if a reader mouses over the title. The following sample CSS tells the 
browser to underline the post header when a reader mouses over the title:
.entry-header a:hover {
 
text-decoration: underline;
}
To change how the post header appears, simply change the necessary 
values. For instance, if the default font for your post header is a 22-pixel, 
black, serif font, but you’d like it to be a 30-pixel, blue, sans-serif font, type 
this CSS in your custom CSS text box:
.entry-header {
 
color: #2485C5;
 
font-family: arial, helvetica;
 
font-size: 30px;
}
.entry-header a {
 
color: #2485C5;
 
text-decoration: none;
}
.entry-header a:hover {
 
text-decoration: underline;
}

277
 Chapter 14: Tweaking Your TypePad Theme 
Changing column widths
You may find that your dream design doesn’t have quite the same dimen-
sions as the TypePad theme you’ve chosen. One way to get around that issue 
is to change the width of your columns with custom CSS.
Following are some examples of the basic CSS you might use to change the 
width of your columns. To start, find a layout in this section similar to what 
you are currently using. The CSS under the relevant layout is what you will 
use in Step 4 of the instructions later in this section.
Two-column, sidebar on the right
.layout-two-column-right #container { width: 800px; }
.layout-two-column-right #alpha { width: 550px; }
.layout-two-column-right #beta { width: 250px; }
Two-column, sidebar on the left
.layout-two-column-left #container { width: 800px; }
.layout-two-column-left #alpha { width: 550px; }
.layout-two-column-left #beta { width: 250px; }
Three-column, main content in the middle of two sidebars
.layout-three-column #container { width: 800px; }
.layout-three-column #alpha { width: 140px; }
.layout-three-column #beta { width: 520px; }
.layout-three-column #gamma { width: 140px; }
Three-column, with both sidebars on the right
.layout-three-column #container { width: 800px; }
.layout-three-column #alpha { width: 520px; }
.layout-three-column #beta { width: 140px; }
.layout-three-column #gamma { width: 140px; }
Figure 14-8 and the following list explain how the columns in your design 
reflect the code:
 
✓ #container is the total width of the content area. It includes all col-
umns. The width of the container is the sum of the column widths: 
#alpha + #beta + #gamma = #container.
 
✓ #alpha is the farthest-left column in the content area.
 
✓ #beta is the next column to the right of #alpha.
 
✓ #gamma is the next column to the right of #beta.

tainer and

Container
You can change the width of the columns by changing the width value in the 
CSS code. Because all TypePad themes are different, it’s impossible to give 
one solution that fits all blogs. We can provide only an overview of what to 
try; then you’ll have to play around with values until you figure out what 
works for your theme. For instance, one theme may have padding included 
in its stylesheet. Padding is white space around the page element (in this 
case, possibly a sidebar) so it doesn’t bump into the next element. When you 
change the values of the columns, you may discover that they don’t look as 
you thought they would. This is most likely because the theme has padding.
To change the width of your columns with custom CSS, follow these 
instructions:
 
1. Click your blog’s Design tab.
 
2. Click the Layout in the left sidebar.
 
 Determine which layout you are using (two-column right or left, three-
column, one-column, and so on).

279
 Chapter 14: Tweaking Your TypePad Theme 
 
3. Click the custom CSS link in the left sidebar.
 
 You see the custom CSS page.
 
4. Type the relevant CSS code (listed earlier in this section) in the text 
box.
 
 For instance, if you were using a three-column layout with the content 
between two sidebars, you would type the following in the text box:
.layout-three-column #container { width: 800px; }
.layout-three-column #alpha { width: 140px; }
.layout-three-column #beta { width: 520px; }
.layout-three-column #gamma { width: 140px; }
 
 Change the width values to reflect your needs.
 
5. Click Save Changes, and preview your blog.
 
 If you aren’t happy with how the changes appear, change the width 
values until you like the way the layout looks.
CSS and Advanced Templates resources
This chapter offers instructions for changing 
your blog’s basic style elements using custom 
CSS or Advanced Templates. If you’re inter-
ested in finding out even more about coding, 
we can point you in the right direction.
There’s plenty more to know about CSS — it’s 
a huge topic that’s been written about at length 
elsewhere. For some additional information, 
consult the following:
 ✓ TypePad Knowledge Base: Add custom 
CSS (help.sixapart.com/tp/us/
custom_css.html)
 ✓ CSS For Dummies, by Richard Mansfield
 ✓ HTML, XHTML, & CSS For Dummies, by Ed 
Tittle and Jeff Noble
 ✓ Do a Google search for CSS tutorial
TypePad’s Knowledge Base offers several 
pages for you to use as references as you learn 
how to apply Advanced Templates to your blog:
 ✓ Tag documentation (developer.type
pad.com/tags): This page gives you 
the correct reference name for each of 
your blog’s page elements (for example, 
MTBlogName references your blog’s name 
as it is in your blog’s Settings tab).
 ✓ Template Tag Syntax (help.sixa
part.com/tp/us/template_tag_
syntax.html): This page explains how 
TypePad uses tags and how to tell if a tag in 
your template is an HTML tag or at TypePad 
tag.
 ✓ TypePad One (www.typepad.com/
one): This page offers tips, tricks, and 
video to help you make the most of your 
TypePad blog.

280
Part IV: Taking Your Blog to the Next Level 
 
We suggest choosing a base theme that has few graphic elements. As you 
change the column widths on graphic-heavy themes, sometimes the graphics 
disappear because the content fields are now larger than the area allotted to 
the graphics. Using a theme with fewer graphic elements may limit your frus-
tration as you define your template with custom CSS tweaks.
Using Advanced Templates
The Advanced Templates option, like the custom CSS option, is available to 
TypePad users with accounts at the Pro Unlimited or Business Class level. The 
Advanced Templates option allows you to edit your blog’s template code 
directly in the relevant CSS, HTML, or XML file. You can control every part of 
your blog’s structure (for example, design, HTML, and layout) via these files.
The Advanced Templates feature is desirable if one of the following is true of you:
 
✓ You like to have control of your own templates.
 
✓ You want to try to build a custom blog template from scratch.
 
✓ You are importing an existing blog from another platform to your 
TypePad account.
Installing Advanced Templates
To enable Advanced Templates, click the name of the blog you want to work 
with and then follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Design tab.
 
2. Click Choose a Theme.
 
3. In the left sidebar, click the Customizable link.
 
4. Click the Advanced Templates option.
 
5. In the right sidebar, click the Use This button.
 
It’s important to note that although you’ve chosen the Advanced Templates 
option, it’s not yet applied to your blog. After you’ve finished creating your 
design with Advanced Templates, and you’re ready to display it to your read-
ers, you finish applying it as follows:
 
1. Return to the Design page.
 
2. Scroll down to the list of Your Designs, and find Advanced Template 
Designs.

281
 Chapter 14: Tweaking Your TypePad Theme 
 
3. Choose Apply from the Actions pull-down menu.
The Asterisk template is the default template for Advanced Templates. Now 
that you’ve applied Advanced Templates, your blog looks like the design 
shown in Figure 14-9.
Hiring and working with a designer
If you like the idea of customizing your blog’s 
design but don’t feel you have the necessary 
design or coding skills needed to do that, you 
may want to consider hiring a designer. But will 
you hire a graphic artist or a programmer? You 
may need both. Or, if you’re just doing some 
simple image insertion, your graphic artist may 
be able to do that for you. Before you hire either, 
we’d like to give you some advice on hiring and 
working with designers and programmers so 
you’re both happy with the outcome.
Check his work. Your first step in choosing a 
designer is looking carefully through his port-
folio — does he regularly produce designs for 
others that suit your own tastes? Be sure to ask 
for references, especially if you’re investing a 
significant amount of money in the process.
Know what you want. The “I’ll know it when 
I see it” or “You’re the expert; I’ll go with 
whatever you say” approach rarely works. 
The designer isn’t familiar with your tastes or 
needs, and it’s a pretty good bet that whatever 
she comes back with won’t be what you had in 
mind. Instead, have a clear idea of the goals you 
want to meet with your site and the brand you 
want to convey to your audience.
Be sure the person has experience with 
TypePad. Whether your designer will be install-
ing a simpler design (using the Theme Builder) 
or a more complicated one (with Advanced 
Templates), you may want to be sure he has 
experience installing designs in TypePad blogs.
Share examples. When you discuss your needs 
with your designer, help her share your vision by 
showing her examples of what you do and don’t 
like. Be specific about the elements you’d like 
to see in your own design. After the designer 
understands your tastes, she can offer advice 
about what may or may not work together.
Understand the value of Web design services. 
Whether a designer is coding your design, cre-
ating custom images for your design, or both, 
you should be aware that the designer is using 
specific skills and spending time on your design. 
Be prepared to pay for that special skill set. As 
with everything else, you get what you pay for.
Be clear about what you expect the designer or 
programmer to do. Some designers will create 
and install your custom images in your blog; 
others only create the images. Programmers, 
on the other hand, don’t always create the 
highest-quality graphics, but they can install 
anything you give them. When you’re talking 
with your designer or programmer, be sure you 
explain exactly what you need. After you’ve 
both agreed on the scope of the project, any 
changes later will cost you money. Being clear 
about expectations at the beginning of the pro-
cess will help you avoid unexpected costs later.
You can find a list of TypePad-savvy designers 
at www.typepad.com/one/typepad-
services.html.

To begin editing your blog’s templates, click the Templates link. The 
Templates page appears and lists all the individual files for your blog’s Index 
Templates, Archive Templates, and Template Modules.
Understanding your templates
Although we assume that if you’re ready to use Advanced Templates, you 
probably have an understanding of CSS, HTML, and XML, we think it’s a good 
idea to know how your templates are organized. Here, we give you a brief 
overview of the index templates and the template modules; we don’t discuss 
the archive templates because those are fairly self-explanatory (for example, 
Category Archives is the template for your archives arranged by category). 
Most of the work you’ll do in Advanced Templates will occur in an index tem-
plate or one of the template modules.
Index templates
 
✓ Archive Index template (archives.html): This template determines 
how your archives page looks. It calls each archive module and displays 
it in the correct order and within the established design parameters.
 
✓ Atom template (atom.xml): This template contains the XML informa-
tion needed for your Atom RSS feed.

283
 Chapter 14: Tweaking Your TypePad Theme 
 
✓ Main Index template (index.html): As its name states, this is the main 
template file for your blog. It references the other templates and mod-
ules, and ensures that those items are shown in the correct order (and 
with the correct design elements) when your blog is displayed.
 
✓ RSS 2.0 template (rss.xml): This template contains the information 
needed for your RSS 2.0 feed.
 
✓ RSS template (index.rdf): This template contains the information 
needed for an RSS 1.0 feed.
 
✓ StyleSheet (style.css): This template contains the information needed 
for your overall styles.
 
✓ Theme stylesheet (asterisk-style.css): This stylesheet assigns spe-
cific values to your banner, background, link color, headings, and so on. 
If you just want to tweak the Asterisk theme to showcase your style, this 
is the file you’ll want to start with.
 
✓ Create new index template (link): You can tweak the existing index.
html to customize your blog page elements, or you can create a new 
index.html with your own coding and parameters.
If you choose to make a new index.html file, we encourage you to do the 
following:
 
✓ Create a test blog. This way, you can tweak your code without bothering 
your readers. It’s always better to make mistakes in private. Also, you’ll 
have the freedom to test ideas and play with code. A test blog simply 
ensures that your testing and tweaking are private until you’re ready to 
take them public.
 
✓ Copy the original index.html file. Save the copy somewhere else, 
such as a text document on your hard drive. Then if things don’t work as 
you planned, you will have that code as a backup.
 
✓ Rename index.html. We suggest you save your work-in-progress 
index.html as something other than index.html until you’re ready 
to test it — that way, you won’t overwrite your original index.html 
file.
 
✓ Double-check your copies. When you’re ready to test your index.
html, double-check that you have the original index.html copied and 
saved somewhere else so you can go back to it if necessary.
Template modules
Modules are the items you’ll use when you want to add sidebar items to your 
blog, because you can’t do that via the drag-and-drop Content option under 
Design. Modules are referenced in the Main Index Template (index.html) 
like this:

284
Part IV: Taking Your Blog to the Next Level 
<$MTInclude module=“module-name”$>
Where “module-name” reflects the actual module name, such as “user-photo”.
By default, the Asterisk theme calls the following modules in this order:
<$MTInclude module=“user-photo”$>
<$MTInclude module=“about-page”$>
<$MTInclude module=“category-cloud”$>
<$MTInclude module=“monthly-archives”$>
<$MTInclude module=“elsewhere-grid”$>
<$MTInclude module=“subscribe-to-feed”$>
<$MTInclude module=“powered-by-typepad”$>
You can change the order of these modules (which changes the order in 
which they appear on your sidebar), or you can delete modules (you can 
include them again later, if you change your mind). You can also include 
other modules simply by creating a new line referencing the module you 
want to include on your sidebar.
Here is a short explanation of each sidebar module:
 
✓ about-page: This module provides a text link (it says simply About) that 
links to your About Me page (see Chapter 4).
 
✓ calendar: This module shows a calendar with dates linked to the posts 
published on that day. If a reader clicks a linked date, he or she sees a 
page listing all posts published on that date.
 
✓ category-cloud: This module lists each category you assign to your 
posts. Frequently used categories appear with a larger and heavier font.
 
✓ category-list: This module provides a simple alphabetical list of the catego-
ries you use for your posts. Unlike in the category-cloud module, no weight 
is associated with frequently used categories in the category-list module.
 
✓ elsewhere-grid: This module shows clickable icons linked to the other 
social media accounts you have associated with your TypePad account. 
See Figure 14-10 for a comparison of the elsewhere-grid and elsewhere-
list modules.
 
✓ elsewhere-list: This module is similar to the elsewhere-grid module, but 
it not only shows clickable icons, but also includes your associated ID 
for the other social media accounts you’ve shared with your TypePad 
account. See Figure 14-10 for a comparison of the elsewhere-grid and 
elsewhere-list modules.

✓ monthly-archives: This module simply provides a clickable list of the 
last few months. When a reader clicks a month, he or she sees a page 
listing all the posts published in that month.
 
✓ navigation-bar: This module creates the navigation bar for your blog. 
Later in this chapter, we explain how to include specific page links in 
your navigation bar and where to place the navigation-bar module in the 
Main Index Template (index.html).
 
✓ powered-by-typepad: This module shows a box in your sidebar that 
says (name of your blog) powered by TypePad on one line and 
Member since (date you signed up) on the next line.
 
✓ recent-comments: This module provides a list of the most recent com-
ments posted to your blog.
 
✓ subscribe-to-feed: This module provides a link for subscribing to your 
blog’s feed.
 
✓ create new template module: If you would like to customize your blog 
even further, you can create a new template module here and reference 
it as needed in your index template. You use this option to add a widget 
or TypeList to your blog’s sidebar.

Installing a custom banner image
Although the Asterisk template is nice, you’re probably using Advanced 
Templates because you want to make your blog’s design personal. As we 
state in the section on custom CSS, using a custom banner is an important 
step toward that autonomy. To include a custom banner in your advanced 
template design, follow these instructions:
 
1. Upload your custom image to File Manager, and make a note of 
its URL.
 
2. Click your blog’s Design tab.
 
3. Click the Templates tab in the left sidebar.
 
4. Open the Theme Stylesheet (asterisk-style.css).
 
5. Find the banner code.
 
 The banner code will start with a line that looks like this:
/* banner styling */
 
6. Replace the existing banner code with the upcoming code.
 
 In the following code, you need to replace background: url 
(http://url.com/image.jpg) with the URL you noted in Step 1. You 
also need to change height: 200px; to reflect the pixel height of your 
custom image.
#banner
{
background: url(http://url.com/image.jpg) no-repeat;
height: 200px;
}
#banner-inner { overflow: visible; padding: 0; }
#banner-header
{
position: absolute;
left: 0;
top: 0;
width: 100%;
height: 100%;
margin: 0;
padding: 0;
}
#banner-header a
{
display: block;
left: 0;
top: 0;

}
#banner-description
{
overflow: hidden;
width: 0;
height: 0;
margin: 0;
padding: 0;
text-indent: -1000em;
}
 
7. Click Save Changes.
Changing the navigation bar
To make changes to your navigation bar, go to the Templates page, scroll 
down to the Template Modules list, and click the navigation-bar link. This 
opens the navigation-bar template code so you can edit it. The navigation-bar 
module code looks like this:
<div id=“nav”>
<div id=“nav-inner”>
<ul class=“nav-list pkg”>
  <li class=“nav-list-item”><a href=“<$MTBlogURL$>“><$MTTrans phrase=“Home”$></
a></li>
  <li class=“nav-list-item”><a href=“<$MTUserSiteURL$>about.html”><$MTTrans 
phrase=“About”$></a></li>
  <li class=“nav-list-item”><a href=“<$MTBlogURL$>archives.html”><$MTTrans 
phrase=“Archives”$></a></li>
  <li class=“nav-list-item”><a href=“<$MTBlogURL$>atom.xml”><$MTTrans 
phrase=“Subscribe”$></a></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
Following are instructions for some popular navigation-bar tweaks: including 
deleting links and using icons instead of text as navigation links.
Including additional links in your navigation bar
The default links in the navigation bar are
 
✓ Home (links to the main page of your blog)
 
✓ About (links to your About page; see Chapter 4)

288
Part IV: Taking Your Blog to the Next Level 
 
✓ Archives (links to your Archive page)
 
✓ Subscribe (allows readers to subscribe to your blog’s RSS feed)
To include additional links in your navigation bar, open the navigation-bar 
module, and insert a new list item (<li>) that looks like this:
 <li class=“nav-list-item”><a href=“http://sampleurl.com”>Sample Text</a></li>
Change http://sampleurl.com to the URL you want to link to, and change 
Sample Text to the link text you want to display in the navigation bar.
You can include as many list items as you deem functional. Just remember 
that your navigation bar shouldn’t be so cluttered or confusing that readers 
can’t find their way around your blog.
Using icons as your navigation bar links
Text links are fine and dandy for many blogs, but if you’d like to integrate 
your navigation bar into your overall design, you may want to have custom 
icons appear as your navigation links.
To use custom icons, you’ll need to create them yourself or commission 
them from a designer. If you’re very lucky, you may have a friend who has 
GIMP or Photoshop and is willing to help you with this task. After you have 
created your custom icons, upload them to File Manager (see Chapter 4 for 
more advice on setting up an intuitive and useful file structure). Make a note 
of the URL of each image, because you’ll need those URLs in the upcoming 
Step 2.
To have your custom icons appear in your navigation bar as links, follow 
these instructions:
 
1. From your blog’s Templates page, scroll down to the Template 
Modules list, and click the navigation-bar link.
 
2. Replace the <$MTTrans phrase> items with the following image 
reference:
<img src=“http://sampleurl.com/imagename.jpg”>
 
 Remember to replace http://sampleurl.com/imagename.jpg with 
the URL of the image you want to use.
 
3. Repeat as necessary for each navigation icon and link.

 Chapter 14: Tweaking Your TypePad Theme 
Adding widgets and TypeLists 
in Advanced Templates
When you choose to use Advanced Templates to control your blog’s design, 
you give up the option to use the drag-and-drop function in the Content area 
of the Design tab. Because that’s the place you’d normally go to include a 
widget or TypeList in your blog’s sidebar, you have to add those items manu-
ally in the correct template file. We explain how to do that in this section.
 
In the following instructions (both for widgets and TypeLists), you’ll need to 
create and name a new template module. If you give your module a title with 
more than one word, you must hyphenate the title. For example, use my-favorite-
books instead of my favorite books.
Adding a widget
As you might remember from Chapter 8, a widget is simply a piece of third-party 
code that performs a specific function (for example, showing your latest tweets 
from Twitter or providing a search engine for your blog). If you weren’t using 
Advanced Templates, you’d be able to insert the widget into your sidebar via a 
simple wizard. Because you want the control of using Advanced Templates, how-
ever, to insert a widget into your sidebar, you have to do two things:
 
✓ Get the actual code for the widget.
 
✓ Create a new module for the widget.
 
You can include a widget in your sidebar by using Advanced Templates in 
two ways. The first method is to create a new sidebar module with the code 
embedded directly in the module template (instructions next). The second 
method is to create a Notes TypeList for the widget and then create a new 
sidebar module (instructions are shown later in this section).
Follow these instructions to create a new template module with the code 
embedded directly inside:
 
1. Click the Create New Template module link.
 
 The Create Template Module page appears.
 
2. Type a name for your new module in the Template Name text field.
 
3. Paste the widget code in the Template Body text field.
 
4. Click Save Changes, and return to the Templates page.
 
 Your widget is now saved as a module, but you need to include it in your 
Main Index Template so it shows up in your sidebar.

290
Part IV: Taking Your Blog to the Next Level 
 
5. Click to open the Main Index Template.
 
6. Look for this notation:
<!-- include sidebar module content here -->
 
 The modules listed under that notation vary, depending on what you are 
currently displaying in your sidebar. The order in which the modules 
appear in this list is the order in which they will appear on your sidebar. 
See the “Template modules” section of this chapter for further explanation.
 
7. Insert a new line of code for the module you just created.
 
 Your new line of code should look similar to this (but with “name-of-
new-module” replaced the name of the module you created):
<$MTInclude module=“name-of-new-module”$>
 
 The code doesn’t have to go at the end of the sidebar list. You can 
place it in the order in which you want it to appear in your sidebar. For 
instance, if you want it to appear after your About page link but before 
your category cloud, you would insert your new sidebar module after 
the about-page module and before the category-cloud module so it looks 
like this:
<$MTInclude module=“user-photo”$>
<$MTInclude module=“about-page”$>
<$MTInclude module=“name-of-new-module”$>
<$MTInclude module=“category-cloud”$>
 
8. Click Save Changes.
Adding a TypeList
If you’re using Advanced Templates, you can easily include a TypeList in 
your sidebar. Just follow these instructions:
 
1. Click the Create New Template Module link.
 
 The Create Template Module page appears.
 
2. Type a name for your new module in the Template Name text field.
 
3. In the Template Body text field, type the appropriate code for the kind 
of TypeList you want to use.
 
 You must change “TypeList Name” to reflect the name of the TypeList 
you want to use. For example, if you’ve created a TypeList called My 
Favorite Drive Shaft Songs, replace “TypeList Name” with that title. 
You don’t need hyphens between the words in the new title.

291
 Chapter 14: Tweaking Your TypePad Theme 
 
 Links TypeList code
<h2>Links</h2>
<ul>
<MTList name=“TypeList Name”>
<li>
<a href=“<$MTListItem field=“url”$>“ target=“_new”>
<$MTListItem field=“title”$></a>
</li>
</MTList>
</ul>
 
 Notes TypeList code
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<MTList name=“TypeList Name”>
<li>
<$MTListItem field=“note”$>
</li>
</MTList>
</ul>
 
 Books TypeList code
<h2>Books</h2>
<ul>
<MTList name=“TypeList Name”>
<li>
<a href=“<$MTListItemURL$>“><$MTListItemImage$></a> 
<br />
<$MTListItem field=“title”$> <br />
<$MTListItemRating$>
</li>
</MTList>
</ul>
 
 Albums TypeList code
<h2>Albums</h2>
<ul>
<MTList name=“TypeList Name”>
<li>
<a href=“<$MTListItemURL$>“ title=“<$MTListItem 
field=“artist”$>“>
<$MTListItem field=“album”$> </a> <br />
<$MTListItem field=“notes”$>
</li>
</MTList>
</ul>
 
 By default, the TypeList code tells the browser to use a bulleted list for 
each list item in a TypeList and looks similar to this (this example is for 
a Book List):

292
Part IV: Taking Your Blog to the Next Level 
<h2>Books</h2>
<ul>
<MTList name=“TypeList Name”>
<li>
<a href=“<$MTListItemURL$>“><$MTListItemImage$></a>
<br />
<$MTListItem field=“title”$> <br />
<$MTListItemRating$>
</li>
</MTList>
</ul>
 
 If you would like the list to appear without bullets, modify the code to 
look like this:
<h2>Books</h2>
<MTList name=“My Favorite Books”>
<p>
<a href=“<$MTListItemURL$>“><$MTListItemImage$></a>
<br />
<$MTListItem field=“title”$> <br />
<$MTListItemRating$>
</MTList>
 
 Notice in the preceding code, we simply removed the <ul> and 
</ul> tags and the <li> and </li> tags. We left the <MTList> 
and </MTList> tags. We added a <p> tag after <MTList name=“My 
Favorite Books”>.
 
4. Click Save Changes, and return to the Template page.
 
 You’ve created your new module. Now you need to include it in your 
Main Index Template so it appears in your sidebar.
 
5. Click to open the Main Index Template.
 
6. Look for this notation:
<!-- include sidebar module content here -->
 
 The modules listed under that notation vary depending on what you are 
currently displaying in your sidebar. The order in which the modules 
appear in this list is the order in which they appear on your sidebar. See 
the “Template modules” section of this chapter for further explanation.
 
7. Insert a new line of code for the module you just created.
 
 Your new line of code should look similar to this (but with “name-of-
new-module” replaced by the name of the module you created):
<$MTInclude module=“name-of-new-module”$>

293
 Chapter 14: Tweaking Your TypePad Theme 
 
 The code doesn’t have to go at the end of the sidebar list. You can place 
it in the order in which you want it to appear in your sidebar. For 
instance, if you want it to appear after your About page link but before 
your category cloud, using the code example from Step 6, you would 
insert your new sidebar module after the about-page module and before 
the category-cloud module so that it looks like this:
<$MTInclude module=“user-photo”$>
<$MTInclude module=“about-page”$>
<$MTInclude module=“name-of-new-module”$>
<$MTInclude module=“category-cloud”$>
 
8. Click Save Changes.
Changing your picture
By default, the user-photo module references the photo from your TypePad 
Profile (discussed in Chapter 3). If you’d like to make the image on your blog 
different from the one on your TypePad Profile, you can do so by changing 
the code in the user-photo module as follows:
 
1. Upload the photo or image you’d like to use to File Manager.
 
2. In the File Manager list, click the name of the file you want to use.
 
 A new browser window or tab appears, showing the photo or image.
 
3. Make a note of the URL in the address bar.
 
 You will need this URL in Step 6.
 
4. Go to the Templates page, and scroll down to Template Modules.
 
5. Click user-photo.
 
 You see this code:
<!-- user photo -->
<MTUserIfPhoto>
<div class=“module-photo module”>
  <div class=“module-content”>
   <img src=“<$MTUserPhoto$>“ alt=“<$MTTrans 
phrase=“My Photo”$>“ />
 
</div><!-- .module-content -->
</div><!-- .module-photo .module -->
</MTUserIfPhoto>

294
Part IV: Taking Your Blog to the Next Level 
 
6. Change the code to look like this:
<!-- user photo -->
<MTUserIfPhoto>
<div class=“module-photo module”>
  <div class=“module-content”>
   <img src=“http://sampleURL.com/photo.jpg” />
 
</div><!-- .module-content -->
</div><!-- .module-photo .module -->
</MTUserIfPhoto>
 
 Remember to change http://sampleURL.com/photo.jpg to reflect 
the URL for your image (see Step 3).
 
7. Click Save Changes.
Deleting or replacing the 
post-title asterisk
The default template for Advanced Templates is the Asterisk theme. You may 
want to get rid of the default asterisk icon that appears by each of your post 
titles, or you may want to replace it with a customized icon you’ve made. This 
is a fairly easy change. Just look for the following code in the asterisk-
style.css file:
.entry {
background-image: url(/.shared-typepad/themes/walt/theme-asterisk_white_wide/
post-ornament.png);
Then change that code to look like this to remove the asterisk icon:
.entry {
background-image: url(none);
If you’d like to make your own icon and upload it to File Manager, you can 
replace the asterisk icon with your custom one. To do that, change the origi-
nal code (as mentioned) to look like this (changing the URL to reflect the URL 
for your icon):
.entry {
background-image: url(http://url.com/image.jpg);
 
If you choose to make a custom icon, we suggest starting with a 20-pixels-by-
20-pixels image. If it’s too big or too small for your needs, you can change the 
size as necessary.

L
ooking for some quick ways to add a professional polish to your 
blogging experience? In this chapter, we give you ten tricks of the trade 
for blogging. A few are technological in nature, pointing you to some specific 
tools you can integrate with your blog. Others are more general pieces of 
advice that should move you further down the road toward professional 
success. But all are worth considering to help you blog your best!
Set Reasonable, Measurable Goals
Although suggesting that you set reasonable and measurable goals may seem 
like an elementary piece of advice, it’s a principle that’s easily overlooked. 
Many people begin blogging as a hobby, only to see their blogs gradually 
evolve into a business. Others plan to blog professionally from the start, but 
they set such ambitious goals that they’re quickly frustrated. Whether you’re 
a hobby blogger or aspire to be a professional blogger, sit down and make 
some realistic goals regarding traffic, income, and your personal blogging 
habits. Keep your goals incremental enough that you don’t lose heart!

298
Part V: The Part of Tens 
As you set your blogging goals, consider the following:
 
✓ Concentrate on subscribers, not page views. Increasingly, readers are 
following their favorite blogs in feed readers. Your number of subscribers 
is probably a much more stable and accurate picture of your blog’s 
following than your actual traffic. Consider that your blog’s traffic can be 
drastically affected by even the smallest factor, such as taking a week off 
or a big news event (for example, an election) that grabs readers’ focus. 
These same events, however, are not likely to change your number of 
subscribers, making your number of subscribers a more reliable bench-
mark. In addition, many of your subscribers opt to read your articles 
within their feed readers rather than click over to your site. It’s quite 
likely that the number of people reading your articles is higher than 
what your stats indicate. (Of course, this depends on whether you’ve 
enabled full or partial feeds in your blog’s settings; see Chapter 5.)
 
 You still need to be aware of your page views — advertisers, especially, 
want to know those numbers, because they more accurately represent 
how many eyeballs are seeing your ad space (see more on third-party 
tracking software in Appendix B). But for your purposes — gauging what 
is, we hope, a steadily growing influence — that subscriber number is 
the one to watch.
 
✓ Keep in mind general blogging trends. Certain traffic and income 
trends seem to hold true for most bloggers, so figure them into your 
goals. For example, traffic tends to slow down in late December and late 
summer. Conversely, corporate interest in buying ad space tends to 
ramp up before gift-buying holidays (such as Christmas and Mother’s 
Day). Don’t be discouraged by a traffic dip that everyone else is 
experiencing too!
 
✓ Consider internal, not external goals. Ultimately, you can’t control 
others’ reading habits. Instead of constantly gauging your own 
subscribers, income, or page counts, gauge what you can control. Set a 
goal to blog once a day for 60 days, for example, or aim to write for an 
hour a day. Your good discipline will be reflected in the quality of what 
you publish, which will, with any luck, translate into increased traffic 
over the long haul.
 
✓ Consider what motivates you. We’ve met several bloggers who choose 
a niche based on how much money they thought it would make instead 
of how much they loved the topic. If you’re setting goals for a niche 
that doesn’t interest you, it’s likely you’ll lose interest quickly. Not only 
will your blogging experience be less enjoyable, but also, you definitely 
won’t be achieving your goals.

299
 Chapter 15: Ten Tips and Tricks
 
✓ Be explicit about how you’ll know you’ve achieved each goal. If one 
of your goals is to make money with your blog, try to refine that or even 
set tiered goals. Perhaps your first goal can be to sell two $25 ads on 
your sidebar, a second-tier goal can be to have enough monthly income 
to take your significant other to a fancy restaurant for dinner once a 
month, and a third-tier goal could be to save enough income from your 
blog to buy an original Salvador Dali painting. Each goal is tangible, and 
you can recognize it when you achieve it. At the same time, the goals are 
broad enough that you have to consider how you’ll meet them. The goal 
is a challenge, but then, most goals are, aren’t they?
Use an Editorial Calendar
Many bloggers write their posts on a whim, posting and publishing in one fell 
swoop whenever inspiration hits. That’s fine, of course — some of our own 
best posts are the ones we wrote on the spur of the moment.
As your blog grows in scope, though, you may find you need some help 
planning what to write about and when. This is especially true if you write for 
multiple blogs (either your own or others for which you’re a contributor). Enter 
the editorial calendar: a plan that lays out where you’re writing, what you’re 
covering, and when it all takes place. The calendar can help you remember 
weekly writing assignments (such as regular features at your own blog or 
regular contributions you’ve committed to at another one). You can look 
ahead and make sure your editorial calendar makes allowances for events in 
your personal calendar, too, which can help you keep your sanity in check! 
Additionally, an editorial calendar keeps you from duplicating your efforts, 
which is especially important if you’re generating content for which you’re 
being paid — advertisers or employers need to know they’re getting the best 
and freshest you have to offer.
Your editorial calendar doesn’t have to be elaborate — it may simply be 
some scrawled notes in your personal day planner. If you plan better with 
pen and paper in hand, consider keeping your editorial calendar on a wall 
calendar or a pocket calendar (the latter has the benefit of being portable, 
so you can jot down post ideas when you’re on the go). Plenty of online 
resources allow you to print calendar pages as well, such as WhichTime 
(www.whichtime.com) and ePrintableCalendars (/www.eprintable
calendars.com).

300
Part V: The Part of Tens 
If online calendars are more your style, you have numerous options to 
choose among, such as Google Calendar (google.com/calendar). Or you 
can use offline calendar software (iCal for Mac users or Microsoft Outlook ) 
that comes bundled with your computer. A bonus is that Google Calendar, 
Microsoft Outlook, and iCal can all sync with your smartphone so you can 
add ideas on the fly. Other options (not all of them free) include 30 Boxes 
(30boxes.com), Annomate (www.annomate.com), and BraveNet Calendars 
(www.bravenet.com/webtools/calendar).
Keep Solid Records
Because most of us don’t make vast sums of cash from blogging, it would be 
entirely too easy to assume that the small dollar amounts don’t matter in 
the eyes of the Internal Revenue Service. That’s a foolish mistake — earning 
income from your blog makes you a business, no matter how small (see more 
on monetizing your blog in Chapter 12).
Treat your blogging revenue as legitimate small-business income. Keep a file 
folder or three-ring binder that holds all your receipts for business-related 
purchases. You’ll want to talk more with a tax professional about this, but 
do realize that many of your blogging-related expenses (computer, Internet 
access, business cards, and so on) might be tax deductible, at least in part. 
You’ll never know until you ask your accountant! (You might also check out 
Taxes 2010 For Dummies, by Eric Tyson, MBA; Margaret A. Munro, EA; and 
David J. Silverman, EA.)
You might also set up a separate bank account for your blogging income, just 
to keep it separate from your primary personal account. We suggest that you 
keep a running spreadsheet of your income and save your receipts. As with 
all tax-related issues, it’s best to err on the side of keeping too much, not too 
little. You can always toss later.
 
The more you take yourself seriously as a professional blogger, the more your 
readers will too!
Submit Your Site to Directories
As the blogosphere grows, more and more directories are popping up to 
serve as clearinghouses, pointing readers toward blogs they might find 
interesting. If you do a Google search on blog directories, you’ll see just 
how many you have to choose among. Some of the most well-known blog 
directories are

301
 Chapter 15: Ten Tips and Tricks
 
✓ Alltop (alltop.com)
 
✓ Blog Catalog (www.blogcatalog.com)
 
✓ Blogarama (www.blogarama.com)
 
✓ Blogged (www.blogged.com)
 
✓ BlogTopsites (www.blogtopsites.com)
 
✓ MyBlogLog (www.mybloglog.com)
You certainly don’t need to list your site with every online directory. You 
could spin your wheels indefinitely looking for the latest and greatest new 
directories, and many of them may not even offer you that much traffic. Do 
a little poking around and find the ones that seem most reputable to you. In 
particular, which ones are listing blogs you trust and enjoy?
If you’re writing a niche blog geared at a specific audience, one possibility is 
to do a Google search for a directory in that particular niche (for example, 
sports blog directory). Listing your blog in a directory aimed at a more specific 
audience might yield better results.
 
Technorati , pictured in Figure 15-1, was one of the first search engines 
dedicated to searching blogs as opposed to searching the entire Web.

302
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Technorati is a directory that not only lists your blog, but also measures 
your blog’s authority (the number of blogs that link to you). To get started at 
Technorati, you need to claim your blog, which simply means you need to let 
Technorati that know your blog is out there and that you’re the owner 
(you can do this by visiting technorati.com.). You can find the steps for 
claiming your blog by clicking the Support link at the top of Technorati’s 
home page (refer to Figure 15-1).
Use the Blog It Widget
If you’re the type of blogger who frequently likes to post about news stories, 
videos, or other current events, you are going to love TypePad’s Blog It 
widget. This simple little tool is a button that can be installed on your 
browser’s toolbar. Whenever you see a story you’d like to blog about, the 
button helps you instantly compose a post, right on the spot. Here’s how you 
install it:
 
1. Visit TypePad’s Blog It page at www.typepad.com/features/
blogit.html.
 
 The page looks similar to the one in Figure 15-2 — look for the blue Blog 
It button.

2. Place the cursor over the Blog It button, and then click and drag it up 
to the browser’s toolbar.
 
 The Blog It button is now installed on your browser toolbar or menu 
bar, and you’re ready to see it in action!
After you have the Blog It widget installed in your browser, use the following 
instructions to use the widget to quickly and easily compose a post. These 
instructions assume that you are currently looking at a page in your browser 
that you’d like to share with your blog readers:
 
1. Use your cursor to highlight the part of the article that you want to 
share with your readers.
 
 If you do not highlight a specific portion of the article, Blog It automatically 
assumes that you would like to use the first paragraph of the article.
 
2. Click the Blog it link on your browser’s toolbar.
 
 The Blog It editor appears as a pop-up window, as shown in Figure 15-3.

3. Change the fields in the Blog It window as necessary.
 
• Post Title: By default, Blog It uses the title of the original article 
you are referencing. You can change the title, if you want.
 
• Blog: Use the pull-down menu to choose which of your TypePad 
blogs you want to post this article to.
 
• Clipping: This text field shows you which part of the original article 
will appear on your blog. If you’d like to edit this text, click inside 
the Clipping text box, and it immediately switches to HTML view. 
When you’ve finished editing, click OK.

Blog Offline with Windows Live Writer
Windows Live Writer (available to Windows users only — sorry, Mac owners) 
is a free, downloadable tool you can use to write your blog posts offline. It’s 
always handy to compose your blog posts in your platform’s Dashboard, but 
when you’re working somewhere without Internet access, you may need a 
backup tool. Figure 15-5 shows a sample blog post being composed offline in 
Windows Live Writer.

You may be interested in this tool especially if you have multiple blogs on 
different platforms (such as TypePad and Google Blogger). Because Live 
Writer is compatible with a variety of blogging platforms, you can post to 
more than one blog (on multiple platforms) from only one Dashboard. You 
can also use Live Writer to easily tweak photos with special effects.
Download this tool at download.live.com/writer. For a helpful 
tutorial on Live Writer, see www.viddler.com/explore/remarkablogger/

Post via Your Phone
There may be times when it makes sense to blog on the fly. You can’t always 
be at your computer to blog — sometimes you’re out there living life, and 
bloggable stuff happens! To make sure you’re ready when the spontaneous 
blogging urge strikes, e-mail your post from your phone (if your phone has 
e-mail capability). You can also download one of the following TypePad 
applications that’s compatible with your smartphone:
 
✓ Blog It for iPhone (http://everything.typepad.com/blog/2008/
06/back-in-april-w.html): Free. If you love your Blog It widget 
(discussed earlier in this chapter), you’ll be happy to know you can use 
that same widget with your iPhone. Just open Safari on your phone, 
go to the Blog It page (blogit.typepad.com), and choose Add to 
Homescreen (which installs the Blog It icon on your iPhone). Now 
you can use the Blog It widget directly from your phone for those 
gotta-blog-it-now moments.
 
✓ E-mail: Free. TypePad assigns each account a unique e-mail address so 
you can send a post via e-mail to your account. Chapter 5 explains how 
to find your unique TypePad e-mail address and use it to post to your 
blog from your phone.
 
✓ Shozu for BlackBerry (www.shozu.com/portal/tour.do?refid=
typepad): $4.99. Shozu allows you to upload photos and video to your 
TypePad blog as well as to other social media sites, such as Facebook, 
Twitter, YouTube, and Picasa.
 
✓ TypePad for iPhone (www.apple.com/webapps/productivity/
typepadforiphone.html): Free. Upload blog posts and photos just as 
easily as if you were sitting at your computer at home. This app also lets 
your friends know you’ve posted by automatically updating your Twitter 
account.
 
✓ TypePad Mobile (www.sixapart.com/typepad/tmdownload.html): 
Free. If you have a Palm OS, Windows Mobile 5, or Symbian Series 60 
smartphone, you can download TypePad Mobile and update your blog 
or photo albums directly from your phone.
Protect Your Writing
The issue of copyright is a serious one in the blogosphere. The things you 
write on your blog are your intellectual property, and they are automatically 
protected under copyright law whether or not you explicitly display a 
copyright symbol and notice.

307
 Chapter 15: Ten Tips and Tricks
Unfortunately, being a published writer (whether in print or digitally) means 
that you run the risk of someone stealing your words. It’s frustrating, and it’s 
happened to most experienced bloggers. Be aware of your rights and legal 
status (a good starting point is www.copyright.gov/help/faq).
One common copyright infringement that takes place in the blogosphere is 
the practice of scraping. Scraping is when other bloggers place all or part of 
your post at their blog (often, but not always, via automated methods) with 
the hope of drumming up some revenue via the ads on their blogs. It’s illegal, 
and it’s unpleasant, especially if you find your content scraped at a site that 
hosts objectionable material. You can try contacting the site’s owner to ask 
him or her to remove your content. If that doesn’t work, try contacting the 
company that hosts the blog (such as Google Blogger or TypePad). If you still 
can’t make any headway, you can seek legal counsel.
 
To help curb scraping, some bloggers issue a partial feed, meaning that they 
send out only an excerpt to readers via feed readers. Because scrapers often 
use feed readers to cull their content illegally, this might offer you some 
protection. Be aware, however, that there are some significant disadvantages 
to offering a partial feed; most notably, readers tend to find full feeds more 
convenient.
Your best bet is to make it clear to readers that you’re serious about your 
copyright. You can include a copyright blurb in your blog footer (see 
Chapter 11) or in your sidebar (by using a Notes TypeList, explained in 
Chapter 8) like the one pictured in Figure 15-6.
 
Figure 15-6: 
A copyright 
notice in a 
TypePad 
sidebar.
 
Include the copyright symbol, of course, and be sure to add the years in 
which you’ve been producing content on your blog. You can even spell it out 
further, if you like (that is, “No material on this site may be reproduced in 
written or digital form without the author’s consent”). It’s no magic bullet, 
but there’s some value in making yourself clear. If you ever do find yourself 
having to enforce your copyright, at least you’ll be able to point the offender 
to your up-front expectations.

308
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Still another option is to participate at Creative Commons (creative
commons.org), a nonprofit organization that provides legal tools to content 
producers. It allows you to spell out conditions under which you are willing 
to share content, as well as the conditions under which you aren’t. Visit the 
Creative Commons FAQ link for more details.
For other valuable information on copyright protection, visit CopyScape 
(www.copyscape.com (it’s a site that allows you to search and see if 
your page has been copied by someone else) and Plagiarism Today 
(www.plagiarismtoday.com (a helpful source of information for many 
Web-based copyright issues).
 
Ultimately, copyright issues are legal issues. If someone has infringed on your 
copyright, your best and surest course of action is to consult an attorney 
experienced in copyright enforcement.
Protect Your Images
Just as it’s frustrating to see your content at someone else’s blog, it’s 
frustrating to see your images at another Web site. Whether your images are 
your livelihood or something you simply share with your readers as a record 
of your life, it’s never pleasant to discover that people are using your content 
for their own gain. This is especially true if they aren’t attributing the work to 
you or didn’t ask your permission. Unfortunately, you can’t stop this online 
theft from happening completely, but we can offer a few solutions to help 
deter it.
Use a watermark
A traditional watermark is an image, a pattern, or text that appears on your 
image to show ownership. Figure 15-7 shows a TypePad post containing an 
image without a watermark (the image on the left) and one with a watermark 
(the image on the right).
A watermark is an easy way to mark your images with your copyright, 
trademark, or brand so anyone viewing them knows they belong to you. You 
can use your own image-editing software to create a customized watermark, 
or you can use an online tool (such as Water Mark Tool, www.watermark
tool.com) to help you. If you choose the latter, you’ll upload your image to 
the Web site (the image must be less than 200KB), generate a watermark with 
their tools, and then save the altered file to your computer so you can upload 
it to File Manager.

309
 Chapter 15: Ten Tips and Tricks
 
If you don’t have Adobe Photoshop, you may want to check out GIMP 
(www.gimp.org or www.picnik.com).
A digital watermark includes digital information within the image’s original 
digital file. You can include information such as author, copyright, or date. 
Whereas a traditional watermark is a clearly visible part of an image, a 
digital watermark is not. A digital watermark converts the information to 
digital noise that is read by digital-watermark software. To use a digital 
watermark, you need to have the necessary software. Digimarc (www.
digimarc.com) is one option that works with Photoshop as a plug-in. 
Digimarc embeds the watermark noise in your files and then tracks the 
watermark so you can see how your images are being used. Because a 
digital watermark is invisible to human eyes, this is not so much a deterrent 
to people who are using your images without permission as a way to track 
those images and claim your ownership if they are taken.
 
There is no foolproof method for avoiding content theft. If someone is deter-
mined to use your content, they’ll find a way. Even if you’re using a digital 
watermark, someone can take a screen shot of your image, crop it, and use it; 
the digital watermark will no longer be associated with that file. If you don’t 
want to risk someone using your content, don’t put it online.

Shrink-wrap your images
Shrink-wrapping your images is sort of like putting your images under glass 
so that if visitors right-click an image to save it to their computer, they’re 
saving just the glass (in this case, a transparent image file).
To shrink-wrap your image, you’ll need to make a transparent image file. 
After you have your transparent image and the image you want to show 
(which we refer to in these instructions as your viewable image), you can 
build a simple table with HTML code (see the following instructions) to 
shrink-wrap the viewable image. What you’re doing with the table is making 
the viewable image the background and then placing a transparent image on 
top of it. If people try to right-click to view, copy, or save the viewable image, 
they get only the transparent image (because it’s on top).
Any professional image-editing software (such as Photoshop) has the ability 
to create a transparent image. However, that software is pricey. We suggest 
downloading GIMP (www.gimp.org), which is free and fairly robust — and 
allows you to make transparent images.
The following instructions show you how to make a transparent image with 
GIMP:
 
1. Open GIMP, and create a new file.
 
 The Create New Image pop-up window appears.
 
2. Set the width and height to 10 pixels each.
 
 The size is not important, because you’ll be changing it to match the size 
of the visible image when you make your HTML table (which we’ll get to 
after we show you how to make the transparent image).
 
3. Click the + next to Advanced Option.
 
 A submenu appears.
 
4. From the Fill With pull-down menu, choose Transparency.
 
 You can ignore the rest of the choices. You don’t need them for this 
image.
 
5. Click OK.
 
 The main window appears, showing your new image. Don’t worry if it 
doesn’t look transparent right now.
 
6. Choose File➪Save As, and name your image.
 
 We usually name our images something like dot or clear.

311
 Chapter 15: Ten Tips and Tricks
 
7. Choose where you want to save the image on your computer.
 
8. Click the + next to Select File_Type (By Extension).
 
 A submenu appears.
 
9. Scroll down the menu, and choose PNG Image.
 
10. Click Save.
Now that you have a transparent image, it’s time to make a table in your 
TypePad blog post and shrink-wrap your viewable image. Go ahead and sign 
in to TypePad, and then upload your transparent image and your viewable 
image to File Manager. Make a note of the URL of each image, because you’ll 
need those URLs for your HTML table.
To make your HTML table, follow these instructions:
 
1. Create a new post.
 
2. Click the HTML tab so you are in HTML view instead of Rich Text 
view.
 
3. Carefully type the following HTML code in your post, with the 
appropriate changes:
<table><tbody><tr><td background=“http://URL_for_viewable_image”><img 
src=“http://URL_for_transparent_image” height=“---” width=“---” 
/> </td></tr></tbody></table>
 
 Change “http://URL_for_viewable_image” to the appropriate URL 
from File Manager for the image you want your readers to see.
 
 Change “http://URL_for_transparent_image” to the appropriate 
URL from File Manager for your transparent image.
 
 Change height=“---” width=“---” to reflect the height and width 
of your viewable image. For example, you may size your viewable image 
to 380 pixels by 500 pixels. Your code would reflect that: height=“380” 
width=“500”.
 
 By assigning height and width values to the transparent image that 
match the viewable image, you are essentially hiding the viewable image 
behind the shrink-wrap (or transparent image).
 
 If you aren’t sure what pixel dimensions you need, open the image you 
want to show your readers in GIMP (or other image-editing software), 
and view the image size. Make sure that the dimensions are in pixels, 
and make a note of the height and width so you can insert those values 
into your table.
 
4. Finish writing your post, if necessary.

312
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
5. Save your post as a draft.
 
6. Click the Preview button.
 
 A new window appears, with your post and your picture.
 
7. Right-click your image, and choose View Image.
 
 You should see a blank page. If you do, your table is working, and your 
image is shrink-wrapped. If you don’t, look carefully at your HTML table, 
and ensure that it is exactly like the code in Step 3.
 
8. Save and Publish your post when you’re satisfied that your image is 
shrink-wrapped.
Shrink-wrapping your image is time-intensive when you first try it, but the 
process becomes more efficient as you gain experience.
 
Many visual artists protect themselves further by not including high-resolution 
images of their work, making them less worth stealing. But as we state earlier, 
if you’re worried about people stealing your content, don’t put it online. Even 
shrink-wrapping your images isn’t 100 percent effective — a determined thief 
will just take a screen shot of the image and use it anyway. However, precau-
tions such as watermarking and shrink-wrapping are enough of a deterrent for 
most people.
Offer E-Mail Subscriptions
In Chapter 5, we tell you more about your RSS feed and how readers who 
subscribe to your blog can receive regular updates in their feed readers each 
time you publish new content.
Not all blog readers use feed readers, though, and you have another option 
for delivering your content quickly and conveniently to your readers: e-mail 
subscriptions. Offering an e-mail subscription simply means that readers who 
choose this option receive your most recent post in an e-mail format, directly 
in their inbox, every time you publish. Many blog readers find this to be a 
convenient tool, so it’s a common courtesy to offer them the option — 
especially because it’s so easy to set up!
You may have already burned an RSS feed through FeedBurner (and if you 
haven’t, it’s easy to do — just follow the steps in Chapter 5). After you’ve 
burned a feed (which simply means that you’ve connected your feed to 
FeedBurner), you can easily offer the option of an e-mail subscription by 
following these steps:

1. Sign in to your FeedBurner account.
 
 A list of your currently burned feeds appears.
 
2. Click the name of the blog you want to add an e-mail subscription 
option to.
 
3. Click the Publicize tab at the top of your screen.
 
 A list of several services appears on the left side of your screen.
 
4. Click Email Subscriptions (it’s in the list of links in the left sidebar).

 A new browser tab or window opens, with the Add a Sidebar Widget 
page in TypePad.
 
7. Click to select the name of the blog you want to add the widget to.
 
 You should add the widget only to the blog whose feed you’re offering in 
e-mail format. If you’d like to include e-mail subscriptions to your other 
blogs under your TypePad account, you’ll need to repeat these steps 
separately for each blog.
 
8. (Optional) Change the widget name.
 
 The default name for your widget (visible in your TypeLists) is Subscribe 
via email. You can change this name, if you want.
 
9. Click Add Widget.
 
 The widget is installed on your blog. To arrange the widget in your 
sidebar, visit the Design tab on the Dashboard. For instructions on 
rearranging your sidebar contents, see Chapter 11.
 
Always subscribe to your own feed (both through e-mail and through a feed 
reader) so you can see how it looks!

In This Chapter
▶ Finding more information resources offered by TypePad
▶ Locating TypePad’s Twitter feed
▶ Engaging with other TypePad users in the Get Satisfaction forums
▶ Reading what other bloggers have to say about TypePad
W
e hope that this book is giving you plenty of solid information for 
maximizing your TypePad experience. But we all know that tech-
nologies can change rapidly, and TypePad, in particular, is going through a 
season of frequent updates. You’ll want to have access to sources beyond 
this book for finding the latest and greatest about TypePad. This chapter 
gives you ten helpful online resources. Visit all these sites often (many 
offer RSS feeds) to stay abreast of the offerings by TypePad. Especially with 
TypePad’s frequent rollout of new features, having access to these sites will 
help you keep your blog on the cutting edge.
In Chapter 2, we explain that TypePad is not developed by an open-source 
community. This means that most new TypePad features are developed 
not by the community of users but by Six Apart, at the corporate level. This 
isn’t necessarily a bad thing. It’s what puts TypePad in a position to offer 
such stellar technical support: All the features are created and managed by 
Six Apart staff, so they’re the ones who are in the best position to do the 
instructing. As a result, huge numbers of TypePad resources don’t exist 
outside the Six Apart umbrella — most of the resources we list in this 
chapter have some affiliation with TypePad.
 
Here’s an extra resource for you: visit TypePad One (www.typepad.com/

the support network, including many of the sites listed in this chapter.

✓ The Tips and Tricks category offers you suggestions for fine-tuning your 
use of TypePad features. In particular, you’ll find helpful CSS shortcuts 
for tweaking your design, including detailed and plain-English coding 
instructions.
Six Apart Status Blog
status.sixapart.com
The Six Apart Status blog is a simple blog with an important purpose: letting 
you know whether any systemwide glitches or failures affect your ability 
to publish posts, receive comments, and so on. During times of technical 
difficulties (which don’t occur very often), Six Apart uses this blog to publish 
real-time updates to users, keeping you updated on how long outages might 
last.
Any time you’re experiencing unusual glitches in your TypePad service (such 
as posts failing to show up after they’re published or reports from readers 
that they can’t leave comments), visit the Six Apart Status blog to find out if 
there’s a bigger issue than just the one at your own blog.
If there are no reports of system abnormalities (in other words, if the post for 
the day looks like the one in Figure 16-2, reporting that TypePad is up), you 
know that your technical issues are smaller in scope and can likely be solved 
if you submit a help ticket.
If there are reports of systemwide issues, however, these issues are clearly 
addressed in the posts at the Six Apart Status blog. Even though outages like 
these are frustrating, there’s at least some assurance in knowing that the 
problem is out of your hands. Check back in at the status blog until the prob-
lem is resolved.

up their sleeves and dig deeply into coding (for both TypePad and — even 
more heavily — for its sister product, Movable Type).
Subscribing to this e-mail list (which can be consolidated into a once-daily

about the most intricate, behind-the-scenes coding taking place on Six Apart 
blogs. At the very least, joining this list provides you access to people who 
already have these skills in place and might hire out their services, should 
advanced blog design and implementation be services that you need.
 
The Six Apart Professional Network generally does not provide tutorials to

optimization [SEO], community management, and so on), and then helps you 
implement the proposed changes. Services begin at around $250 — a pretty 
penny, to be sure, especially if you blog only as a hobby. It might be a more 
reasonable expense for a professional or corporate blogger, considering that 
this amount is comparable to what you might expect an outside consultant

of blogging issues from the most simple (“How do I start a blog?”) to the 
more involved (“How do I make a scroll box for HTML code?”). Answers are 
heavy on practical, numbered steps and light on confusing technical jargon. 
TypePad-related questions are frequently addressed (as are those related to 
Blogger and WordPress), and there is much coverage of TypePad’s recent 
systemwide overhaul.

Build a Better Blog (shown in Figure 16-7) is a treasure trove of general 
blogging advice, especially if you’re aiming to earn income at your blog 
(either by selling ad space or by using your blog to market an existing 
business).

The author, Denise Wakeman, is an online marketing advisor who uses Build 
a Better Blog to coach business bloggers on social media strategies. Although 
it’s helpful to bloggers at all platforms, TypePad bloggers may find it especially 
interesting. Build a Better Blog is itself a TypePad blog, and there are often 
posts on TypePad features, especially as they relate to business bloggers 
(see the TypePad Tips category in the blog’s sidebar).

t’s helpful to read all the Web sites and books you can about how to make 
a great TypePad blog (for a list of some good resources, visit Chapter 16), 
but at the end of the day, some of your best tips will come from watching 
others do it successfully. Whether you’re a new or an experienced blogger, 
stay engaged in others’ blogs, and pay attention to what technologies and 
concepts are working well for your blogging peers.
In this chapter, we point you to ten TypePad bloggers who are representative 
of the best TypePad has to offer. They provide their readers with the whole 
package — a readable design, excellent content, an interesting title, and 
successful implementation of other great TypePad features. Most of the 
bloggers we’ve highlighted are using designs and blogging concepts that the 
average TypePad user can apply. These designs are workable, streamlined, 
and (most importantly) lead you directly into the content. As you look at 
what these TypePad bloggers are doing well, see what you can glean from 
them as you polish your own TypePad blog.
 
We’ve listed some good blogs for you, but it’s easy to find more:
 
✓ TypePad regularly highlights great bloggers at their Everything TypePad 
blog (http://everything.typepad.com); click the Browse the 
Archives link, and then choose the Best of the Bloggers.
 
✓ Do a Google search on *typepad.com. This pulls up all searchable Web 
sites that end in the typepad.com prefix, which means most of the sites 
listed will be TypePad blogs. Also search *blogs.com (the suffix used by 
the earliest TypePad bloggers).

326
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
✓ Visit Blogs.com (http://blogs.com), a Six Apart–owned site that 
aggregates great bloggers from around the blogosphere (both TypePad 
and non-TypePad bloggers).
Allsorts
http://allsorts.typepad.com
There’s no mistaking the tone of Jennifer Harris’s blog Allsorts — it’s visually 
communicated the instant you visit. Harris, a children’s book illustrator, uses 
Allsorts as a gathering place for her love of crafts and art, and her blog design 
is as fun-loving and whimsical as her posts. In her right sidebar, she has 
made her blog supremely browseable by including a graphic link to each 
category. You can do this using a Notes TypeList or the Embed Your Own 
HTML widget (see Chapter 8).
Although it’s a personal blog, Harris has been effective in allowing it to 
showcase the best of her work, encouraging visitors to click to her main site, 
her Twitter feed, her Etsy store, and her photo blog.
Harris is an accomplished seamstress, frequently posting tutorials for her 
projects on her blog. In the lower-right corner, she has included links to each 
of those tutorials, a valuable service to her faithful readers. If you regularly 
write highly informative posts like these (and they’re popular with readers), 
consider following Harris’s model of keeping the posts right at your readers’ 
fingertips.
Career Hub
http://www.careerhubblog.com
Career Hub (shown in Figure 17-1) is managed by Louise Fletcher, president 
of Blue Sky Resumes (http://www.blueskyresumes.com). Career Hub 
aims to coach people through the job hunting process, offering concrete 
advice from a wide variety of expert guest authors.
Fletcher says she specifically chose TypePad for its ease of use and its 
accessibility to multiple guest authors, many of whom have never blogged 
before but have found TypePad to be quite user-friendly. Also, she appreciates 
how easy it is to tweak a design in TypePad (see Chapter 11): “We don’t have 
a programmer, so we need something we can do ourselves,” she says.

327
 Chapter 17: Ten Bloggers Using TypePad Well
 
Figure 17-1: 
Career Hub.
 
In the middle of the right sidebar of Career Hub (you may have to scroll 
down), note the graphic link to their free e-books. E-books are simply books 
(often PDF documents) written in digital form, and they’re a smart tool for 
giving your readers solid value from your site. Bloggers sometimes use 
e-books as a free gift to readers, to establish their own value as an expert, 
and to encourage loyalty among their readers. Other bloggers sell their 
e-books and the e-book becomes a tool for blog monetization. “Free e-books 
are a great way to get your name out there. We have offered four of them now 
and each one has brought us additional PR and traffic from other bloggers 
and Web sites. The key to success is writing a book that adds real value for 
your readers,” Fletcher advises. “Don’t make the book overtly promotional 
because no one cares about you — they care about their own needs. Write 
a book that addresses key issues faced by your target audience. That’s what 
will draw attention and traffic.”
As a professional networker, Fletcher has solid advice for people wanting to 
harness the power of social media: “Social networking is just like in-person 
networking — you have to give to get. Building relationships takes time and 
effort but it’s well worth it, so I think the most important advice I could give 
job seekers about using social media is to look for ways to help others. Don’t 
just throw up a new blog or a Twitter page and expect everyone to be thrilled 
about it! They won’t care until they see you adding value.”

328
Part V: The Part of Tens 
The professional-looking layout of Career Hub, designed by Fletcher’s 
husband, Phil, is proof that even something as simple as the consistent use 
of a single main color (in this case, gold) adds a pleasant visual effect to a 
blog’s presentation.
Eat Local Challenge
http://www.eatlocalchallenge.com
Eat Local Challenge (shown in Figure 17-2) is managed by blogger Jennifer 
Maiser and is an excellent example of how the blogosphere can be harnessed 
to promote social causes. In this case, Maiser’s site encourages people to 
explore the health, environmental, and economic benefits of eating locally-
produced food.
TypePad was a natural choice for Maiser, who had been writing a personal 
blog at TypePad since its earliest days (2003). She had always been drawn to 
its simplicity, saying that “the brilliance of using TypePad for the platform for 
this site is that the software and the hosting never got in my way. Rather, it 
supported everything that I needed the Eat Local Challenge to represent.”

 Chapter 17: Ten Bloggers Using TypePad Well
The front page of the Eat Local Challenge is clear in its mission. The right 
sidebar (under “About This Site”), constructed via a Notes TypeList, tells 
new readers at first glance everything they need to know about the cause. 
Maiser has cleverly provided links to several significant posts, helping 
readers instantly gather the information they need. Included is a link to the 
post “Read Our 10 Reasons to Eat Local.” Maiser points to that post as a 
significant turning point in promoting the cause: “It was attention-getting, 
concise, and something that the press could easily reprint and point to,” she 
says. “It’s been reprinted in over 100 publications, including online, tradi-
tional print, and industry publications. I was able to concisely summarize a 
concept that, at the time, was not talked about very much — and the public 
came to read it.”
Maiser has also wisely placed a high-profile widget in the upper-left sidebar 
that helps people find a local farmer’s market. This demonstrates how a 
well-placed, highly relevant widget is a powerful, albeit simple, tool.
Maiser has advice for bloggers seeking to use the blogosphere to highlight a 
social cause: “You have to have a complete passion for the cause that you’re 
promoting,” she advises. “Along the way, you’ll be asking a lot of people to do 
a lot of different tasks to support your cause. Asking people to go out of their 
way for you is super simple if you are passionate about what you’re doing 
and have a conviction about your cause. It will show, and people will organically 
gravitate to you.”
Economist’s View
http://economistsview.typepad.com
Mark Thoma, Ph.D. is an economist at the University of Oregon, and he writes 
the blog Economist’s View, shown in Figure 17-3.
As an academic, Thoma has found TypePad blogging to be a valuable tool 
in his teaching. He videotapes his class lectures and uploads the video to 
TypePad. Also, Thoma says, “I use blogs for my classes, so the ability to 
only show certain posts (by tag) and the ability to organize material into 
categories has been beneficial.”
In addition to writing his own economic commentary, Thoma uses his blog to 
point readers to valuable information elsewhere, a feature readers appreciate. 
“It’s become a place that people use to find other material, a home base or 
hub,” he says. He accomplishes this by organizing his sidebars efficiently, 
sharing various blogrolls via Link TypeLists (see Chapter 8).

One of Thoma’s favorite TypePad features is located in the standard template 
tools within TypePad’s Design tab (see Chapter 11). He chooses the Your 
Feeds module to aggregate content from several of his favorite sites.
Thoma’s design is simple, befitting the academic, professional tone of his 
site. “The idea is to focus on the content,” he explains.
Finslippy
http://www.finslippy.com
Finslippy, shown in Figure 17-4, is the personal blog of Alice Bradley, an 
accomplished diarist — her blog reads like a honed and polished memoir. 
Blogging since 2004, Bradley has established her voice in the blogosphere by 
publishing posts that follow a distinct narrative thread — a clear beginning, 
middle, and end (see more on the subject of polishing your posts in Chapter 6).
Bradley’s blogging voice is consistent throughout her site. Even the About 
page (see the link in the upper-right corner) is entertaining, while still 
communicating important facts about her site: She humorously warns 
readers that she might not be able to answer all her e-mail and that she 
doesn’t participate in product reviews.

331
 Chapter 17: Ten Bloggers Using TypePad Well
 
Figure 17-4: 
Finslippy.
 
Finslippy’s understated design allows her writing to be the true focus. Her 
header is a nod to the unusual name of her blog, a story you’ll find via a link 
on her About page. (We show you how to insert a custom header on your 
own blog in Chapter 11.)
Bradley has managed to use her blog as a starting point for a successful 
writing career. “I’m at this amazing stage now where I don’t pitch stories; 
typically, editors come to me, or already know me through my blog,” she 
says. “Many of my happiest writing assignments have come from editors 
who discovered my blog and then contacted me. It really helps establish 
expectations on both ends. I can say, essentially, this is who I am, and this is 
how I write.”
For other bloggers hoping to launch a writing career via their blogs, her 
advice is to keep expectations realistic. “I will say that this took a while,” 
she explains. “I wouldn’t say that anyone should create a blog and expect 
editors to flock to them. It was a few years. Still, before that started happening, 
I could still pitch stories and direct editors to my blog, and it did help quite 
a bit.”
Your high school English teacher probably told you that the best way to 
become a good writer is to read good writers, and the same principle holds 
true in blogging. Like most readers, you’ll probably seek out informative, 
topical blogs about your hobbies or political leanings, but keep an eye out for 
bloggers producing literary-quality content as well.

Hey There’s a Dead Guy 
In the Living Room
http://heydeadguy.typepad.com
Admit it: That title caught your attention, didn’t it? Ours too! This is a perfect 
example of a how a noticeable, catchy title pulls a reader in from the very 
start. This group blog, shown in Figure 17-5 (and often dubbed “Hey Dead 
Guy” by readers) is administrated by mystery writer Jeff Cohen.
Hey Dead Guy is aimed at a specific niche: those interested in crime fiction. 
Regular contributors to the blog include authors, an agent, a publisher, and a 
publicist, and they cover the crime-writing process from the birth of an idea 
all the way through publication and marketing. This is a perfect example 
of niche blogging, which is a blog that is specific to a particular market or 
audience.
Jeff Cohen explains TypePad’s appeal: “Simplicity is key for us — we’re not 
technological wizards, and we’re a diverse group from two different coun-
tries. So the ability to navigate and create easily is absolutely essential for us, 
and TypePad does that nicely.”
 
Figure 17-5: 
Hey There’s 
a Dead Guy 
In the Living 
Room.
 

333
 Chapter 17: Ten Bloggers Using TypePad Well
Notably, Hey Dead Guy is making excellent use of TypePad’s multiple authors 
feature. The right sidebar lists all the blog’s contributors, and Cohen says 
that each blogger commits to write regularly on a predetermined day. Cohen, 
as the administrator, has given each blogger Junior Author status (see 
Chapter 5), though he reports that the process is much more “democratic” 
than that. All their decisions are made as a group, and, he says, “The other 
authors simply put their posts up either to publish on their designated date 
or as a draft, and I schedule them to publish on time. I don’t “edit” or change 
their copy in any way.”
Cohen acknowledges that writing a group blog is a true commitment, not to 
be entered into lightly. The key, he says, “is to find people who really do want 
to participate every week (or every day, or whatever your schedule might 
be). Make sure they understand what’s involved, and hash out any questions 
ahead of time.”
Note, too, that they’ve incorporated a simple but descriptive graphic header 
(refer to Figure 17-5) — the body outline visually (and humorously) reinforces 
the blog’s title. Any user with at least a Plus account can insert a custom 
header like this one to a TypePad theme (see Chapter 11 for instructions).
Money Saving Mom
http://www.moneysavingmom.com
Money Saving Mom, managed by Crystal Paine, is one of the leading frugality 
blogs on the Web(see Figure 17-6). Blogs on frugal living are wildly popular, as 
people look for creative ways to save money at home. As a frugality expert, 
Paine was understandably drawn to TypePad’s pricing at first. “The biggest 
selling point for me is that you do not need to purchase additional hosting,” 
she says. “I’ve talked to many bloggers who are paying quite a large sum 
of money each month for their hosting services. Me? I just pay the $15.95 
monthly Typepad fee. Aside from paying my yearly fee for my domain name, I 
have no other Web site fees incurred.”
Paine’s site has seen such success because of the frequent and valuable 
updates she offers readers, posting coupon codes, sales, and other offers 
for the frugal-minded shopper. She runs her blog with a high degree of 
professionalism — it’s her business, not just her hobby.
Also a homeschooling mother of three, Paine acknowledges that balancing
 the demands of a successful, time-sensitive blog requires setting some 
boundaries. “There are a thousand opportunities out there in the blogosphere 

334
Part V: The Part of Tens 
and it’s easy to feel as if we must capitalize on every one lest we miss out on 
something. Stop, take a deep breath, and remind yourself again that you can’t 
do it all,” she cautions. “You can’t read every blog, respond to every comment, 
answer every question, blog on every topic you want to, participate in every 
blogging meme...but you can sure wear yourself out trying!”
Instead, Paine has balanced these demands by staying organized. “Over 
time, I’ve learned that what works best for me is to blog in blocks. I have two 
three-hour blocks of time in my weekly schedule which are reserved for 
blogging,” she explains. “I try to write at least a few posts during these times, 
in addition to working on other blogging-related projects and answering 
e-mails. I’m a busy stay-at-home homeschooling mom with three little children, 
so I’ve found it is a huge help to have posts prewritten and scheduled to run 
throughout the week — especially on those days when I’m feeling quite 
brain-fried!”

Raisin Toast
http://raisintoast.typepad.com
Raisin Toast is the blog of artist Susan Vaughn, who uses her blog to document 
her family’s personal life and promote her artwork. Raisin Toast, shown in 
Figure 17-7 uses Advanced Templates (see Chapter 14), a skill Vaughn taught 
herself through trial and error.
“It took me a year to get up enough nerve to switch to Advanced Templates,” 
she says. “As soon as I realized I could have a test blog with Advanced 
Templates, I thought I would try to figure it out. I did a lot of reading in their 
Knowledge Base, sent the customer support lots of questions, and little by 
little learned a lot about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I was determined to 
learn and build a better blog — one that I was proud of and a reflection of 
me — but I couldn’t afford to pay someone to help me. I am a perpetual 
student, and when I get determined to do something, I usually don’t let up 
until I’ve got it under my belt.”
 
Figure 17-7: 
Raisin 
Toast.
 

336
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Take note of the way Vaughn uses graphic images in her sidebars (such as 
Homepage and My Opus) to make readers want to click and discover more 
of her site. After many years of hosting her online gallery at an expensive 
artist portfolio platform, she was pleased that her newfound confidence with 
Advanced Templates allowed her to move the gallery (http://raisin
toast.typepad.com/vaughn_fine_art) to her TypePad blog (and for no 
additional fee, because it’s hosted under her main Raisin Toast account). She 
has sold pieces and had others commissioned as a result of tying in her 
artwork with her personal blog.
Vaughn urges other bloggers not to shy away from rolling up their sleeves 
and gaining the necessary skills to take their blog to the next level: “It really 
is limitless what you can do. It just takes a little time and a desire to learn if 
you want to figure it out on your own.”
Smart Dog
http://smartdog.typepad.com
Smart Dog, pictured in Figure 17-8 is the blog of dog trainer and small 
business owner Laurie Luck, CPDT. Luck owns Smart Dog University 
(http://www.smartdoguniversity.com), and she uses Smart Dog to 
give her instant connections with potential clients. “Blogging has been an 
essential and integral part of my marketing efforts,” Luck says. “No one wants 
to work with someone without knowing what they’ll get. The Smart Dog blog 
has brought Smart Dog University into the homes and offices of potential 
clients. With the blog, I’m able to show people who I am, what kind of work 
I do, how I can help them, and let them into the world of a dog trainer and 
service dog raiser. Before people call me, they have an idea of what they’ll be 
getting. We’re starting off as acquaintances — friends even! — not strangers.”
Wisely harnessing relatively simple technology, Luck frequently incorporates 
regular video (hosted at YouTube), into her blog posts. This gives potential 
clients an upfront view of her dog-training skills and techniques, and it’s a 
valuable selling point. She advises video bloggers to keep video posts short 
(a minute or two, ideally), and says they don’t have to invest in expensive 
equipment. “I’m using a $160 video camera and a point-and-shoot camera 
with video,” Luck explains. “Super easy, super affordable.”
Luck explains that her experience has shown that video blogging is not only 
affordable but simple: “You don’t have to be a video editor to post good 
videos. With the free software that came with the cameras, I’m able to do 
everything I need. And the feedback I get from people — along with the 
increase in visitors when I post video — indicates that [readers] really like 
my posts that include video.”

HELLO My Name Is Heather
http://HELLOmynameisheather.com
You’d be hard-pressed to find a blog with a stronger visual punch than 
designer Heather Bailey’s blog, HELLO My Name Is Heather, shown in Figure 
17-9. A fabric designer and entrepreneur, Bailey successfully runs her blog as 
a hub for her other online ventures, including a site selling hair accessories 
and an online fabric shop.
Although it’s a personal blog, HELLO My Name Is Heather offers readers 
glimpses into the creative lifestyle that fuels Bailey’s business — an effective 
marketing tool for any small business seeking to establish connections with 
customers. Another great tool employed at Bailey’s blog (you’ll need to 
scroll down to see it) is the lower-right sidebar titled “Your H.B. Creations.” 
Readers use Flickr to submit their own items produced from Bailey’s tutorials 
and products — they simply insert their uploaded photos into the photo 
streams Bailey has already set up. This wise use of social media has helped

Chapter 18
Ten Blogging Etiquette Tips
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding the right and wrong ways to link to bloggers
▶ Trying not to take things personally
▶ Leaving comments freely at other blogs
▶ Protecting others’ privacy
▶ Looking out for your readers
I
n the first chapter, we discuss the importance of participating in the 
blogosphere with courtesy and respect. In the strange world of cyberspace, 
we usually don’t have the benefit of interpreting one another’s facial 
expressions or other nonverbal communication. We have to determine 
others’ intent based on what they say and how they conduct themselves. It’s 
an interesting dynamic, and this makes it an exciting time to be a blogger — 
we’re all out there learning as we go, doing our best to represent ourselves 
well based entirely on a cyberimpression!
The issue of blogging etiquette frequently comes up when bloggers get 
together to talk about tools of the trade. This can be especially frustrating to 
a new blogger, who may wonder how to decipher what the ground rules are. 
In truth, no firm ground rules exist. Most of us just do our best and exhibit 
the same commonsense courtesy we’d exhibit (and expect from others) in 
the real world. Additionally, you beginners shouldn’t worry — there’s a 
learning curve to this, and nearly all of us made some mistakes along the way.
However, you can follow a few widely accepted practices to be a well-mannered 
blogger, and this chapter shares ten of those practices with you. We’re not 
so bold as to consider ourselves the final arbiters of what is and isn’t socially 
appropriate in the blogosphere, but we think that these ten tips are surefire 
ways to let the blogging world know you intend to play nice.

340
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Link Frequently and Accurately
Linking often to other good posts around the blogosphere (we tell you how 
to do it in Chapter 6) is a good blogging practice for many reasons. For 
starters, it spreads around traffic to your blogging peers; as in most cases, 
benefiting others has a way of benefiting you. Giving your readers links to 
good posts elsewhere is a valuable service to them as well. The blogosphere 
is a big place, and none of us can possibly see it all — sharing the best of it 
with your readers establishes you as a valuable resource.
As we explain in Chapter 6, you should never cut and paste a blogger’s entire 
post in your blog — that’s copyright infringement (for more on this, visit 
www.copyright.gov). But you can link to other posts freely, and when you 
do, consider these things:
 
✓ Use brief excerpts when quoting. It’s fine to quote other bloggers, as 
long as you use only brief excerpts of their words and give full credit to 
them (including a link to the posts being quoted).
 
✓ Whenever possible, use permalinks. A permalink is a link to a specific 
blog post, as opposed to the more generic front page of a blog. To give 
you an example, a link to the front page of a blog might look like this: 
http://typepadfordummies.typepad.com. A permalink to a 
specific post on the blog, however, would look like this: http://
typepadfordummies.typepad.com/typepad-for-dummies
/2009/08/understanding-the-basics-of-html.html.
 
 Permalinks are helpful to your readers, especially, because frequently 
updated blogs have content regularly moving off the front page. A 
permalink helps a reader go directly to the post in question. To find the 
permalink of an article so you can link to it, just click the title of the post 
you want to include. Then look in the address bar of the browser to see 
the permalink. You can copy that URL and use it as a link within your 
post.
 
✓ Avoid hotlinking. Hotlinking is linking directly to the graphics, documents, 
video, and so on belonging to another site. Hotlinking is easier to explain 
with an example. Let’s say you’d like to help tell people about a specific 
blog (Blog A). You contact the blog owner and ask her for a sidebar 
button that you can display on your blog with a link to her site. She 
responds with the URL for the button: http://blogA.com/images/
button.png. Note that the image is housed on her server (that just 
means she uploaded it to her blog platform provider). If you use this 
URL as your image source, you’ll be pulling bandwidth from her server 
each time someone views a page on your blog that shows the image. 
Why? Each time a blog page is viewed, the server keeps track of what 
files are being pulled (or shown) to the reader. Each time a file is shown, 
it uses bandwidth. Depending on the size of the file and how much 
traffic a blog experiences, you could be pulling a lot of bandwidth, and 

341
 Chapter 18: Ten Blogging Etiquette Tips
that can cost the original blog owner money (because many server 
providers require you to stay within a certain bandwidth limit or be 
charged for the overage).
 
 To avoid the hotlinking issue, save the button to your own computer, 
and upload it to your own server (in this case, TypePad File Manager). 
Then follow the instructions in Chapter 9 for using an image as a sidebar 
item.
 
✓ Communicate when you link. Technically, you don’t need another 
blogger’s permission to link to her in a post or in your sidebar, but 
it’s still a nice courtesy to let her know you did it. Who knows — a 
well-placed link might make the person’s day! If you want to let another 
blogger know you’ve linked to her, you can send a quick e-mail or use 
trackbacks (we show you how in Chapter 7).
 
Many bloggers successfully host link round-ups at their sites regularly, either 
as a feature in their main column or on their sidebar. This is an easy way to 
share the best of the blogosphere with your readers, and it’s a feature they’ll 
likely appreciate and depend on. Figure 18-1 is an example of a link round-up 
hosted at Shannon’s blog, Rocks in My Dryer.
In Chapter 10, we tell you more about how to integrate some social book-
marking services (such as delicious.com) at your blog and why doing so is 
an excellent way to share good links with your readers.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
Don’t Overly Promote Yourself in 
Someone Else’s Comment Section
Be careful about overly hyping yourself, especially in the comment section 
of someone else’s blog. Not all bloggers may agree on this point, but it’s 
generally not advisable to use a comment section to give a sales pitch about 
yourself. The blog where you are commenting is someone else’s space, after 
all, and a misplaced sales pitch can come across as traffic poaching or (even 
worse!) spam. When you leave a comment at someone else’s blog, you are 
likely leaving a link to your blog in the comment form. If another reader 
wants to click over to your blog, he’ll click your name — it’s not necessary 
for you to invite him. Figure 18-2 shows you how it looks when you leave a 
comment on a TypePad blog — if you sign in to leave a comment (always 
advisable), you’re automatically leaving a link.

Commenter’s name, linked to blog
If you’re reading a post on a subject about which you’ve written, it is 
considered appropriate to offer the writer a link back to your original, 
on-topic post.
Here’s an example of the kind of comment most bloggers are happy to 
receive: “Good luck with your bathroom remodel — it looks like you’re 
making good choices so far. I went through the same thing a couple of 
months ago and learned some surprising stuff about grout; if you want to 
read more about it, you can see my post at http://url.com.”

 Chapter 18: Ten Blogging Etiquette Tips
Here’s an example of a comment that doesn’t work as well: “Funny post about 
your gall bladder. Hey, stop by my blog and see how I’ve lost 50 pounds while 
running marathons, and while you’re at it, check out my giveaway for my free 
book that I’m also selling. Signed, Joe from Joe’s Blog, The Blog about Running 
Marathons” (with links scattered throughout the comment).
The second comment may seem like an extreme example, but you’d be 
surprised how often comments like these crop up. We know you get the 
general idea: Be discreet and respectful. If your link is relevant, include it; if 
you have a hint of doubt, leave it out.
Don’t Ask for Reciprocal Links
A reciprocal link agreement involves two or more bloggers agreeing to link to 
each other. Sometimes reciprocal link agreements work, but often, they 
don’t — bloggers who host reciprocal blogrolls often find that the list is so 
long and unwieldy it’s rarely used by readers. Unless a blogger specifically 
publishes a reciprocal blogroll, avoid the temptation to contact him and 
ask him for a link. It puts the blogger in an awkward position, and it has the 
added consequence of making the requester sound a little desperate.
Instead of concerning yourself with reciprocal links, focus your energy on 
writing excellent content. Because most bloggers are eager and willing to link 
to good posts (see the first item in this list), a well-written post has a way 
of getting noticed. Build community and traffic based on your own quality 
work — it’s not the fastest and easiest route, but it’s the surest.
Give Others the Benefit of the Doubt
You know what the hardest (and most rewarding) part of blogging is? 
The relationships and community you build online. On one hand, you’re 
constantly “meeting” new people when they comment at your blog or you 
comment at theirs. You start to feel as if you know them. On the other hand, 
you haven’t actually met that other blogger, and she has a separate life 
outside her blog. The result is that sometimes, the lines of the relationship 
are blurred. You may start to expect a certain level of response or camaraderie 
from bloggers (or they from you).
The place this usually shows up is when a blogger is tagged for a meme. A 
meme (it rhymes with dream) is basically a quiz, survey, or list that a blog-
ger completes and posts on her blog. When you first start blogging, memes 

344
Part V: The Part of Tens 
are an easy way to generate content for your site and share a bit about your-
self. The way a meme stays alive is that the blogger who participates in the 
meme then tags (or invites) several other bloggers to also answer the meme 
(usually asking for a link back to her blog). The problem occurs because 
many seasoned bloggers (and some new ones) are not interested in memes, 
but not responding to a tag appears rude. And that’s where the relationship 
thing comes into play. If you feel like you’re good friends with this blogger 
who has never actually met you (or vice versa), you can feel awkward.
We can offer a few solutions to this dilemma:
 
✓ When you post your meme and tag other bloggers, be clear in your tag 
that you will not be offended if the bloggers don’t want to play along.
 
✓ Don’t expect a response, and don’t be upset if you don’t receive one. 
You should know that some bloggers would rather ignore a request than 
have to confront the request with a “No, thank you.”
 
✓ Participate in as many memes as you like and then either don’t tag 
anyone or, alternatively, invite everyone who reads to play along and let 
you know how to find their posts by leaving a comment on your original 
meme post. This option allows you to invite everyone and invites them 
to post a link to their blog if they play.
It’s possible that you may never encounter a meme or the awkward social 
dance that goes along with declining one. However, these virtual relationships 
show up in other instances as well. For example, if you are always commenting 
on someone’s blog, but that person never return the favor, don’t be offended. 
The blogger may not be as engaged as you are or may not have time to 
comment, or some other unknown factor may be in play. That’s the key right 
there: You just don’t know. Most bloggers are doing the best they can to 
engage in the blogosphere in a way that is meaningful to them, so it’s a good 
idea to cut one another a little slack.
In short, try not to take things too personally or read too much into what you 
see. We know it’s a tempting thing to do in the blogosphere, where we don’t 
always have as much context for interpreting other people’s actions. Instead, 
shrug it off, and preserve your sanity in the process.

345
 Chapter 18: Ten Blogging Etiquette Tips
Leave Comments Freely at Other Blogs
Lurking isn’t quite as ominous as it sounds; it simply means that you read a 
blog without letting the blogger know you’re there. It’s not inherently rude to 
lurk at a blog. Most of us lurk at blogs from time to time — maybe we don’t 
feel we have much to contribute to the conversation, or we think the bloggers 
already get so many comments they’d never notice ours, or maybe we’re just 
plain busy. That’s all understandable, so don’t feel guilty about lurking from 
time to time.
There’s another side to that coin, though. You are likely well aware of how 
encouraging a good comment is at your own blog, so don’t hesitate to leave 
comments (at least occasionally) at the blogs you most enjoy. Those blogs 
are, after all, providing you something valuable enough that you keep going 
back to read. Even a quick “This post was just what I needed today” or “You 
always crack me up” might make the day of the person on the other side of 
that computer screen.
Similarly, consider responding to the comments you receive on your blog, 
a subject we discuss more in Chapter 7. You simply may not be able to 
respond to them all, but you can probably respond to some.
Be Up Front Where Products 
Are Concerned
If you’re blogging about a product, a trip, or another service you received for 
free, you should fully disclose this to your readers (see Chapter 12 for more 
on this topic). Failing to disclose a corporate relationship is more than just 
bad manners — it’s also bad business and harms your credibility. Especially 
if your blog is a personal one, readers may assume that the products you 
write about are a personal preference, not a paid endorsement, so be honest 
with them either way. Always be up front with your readers in this department. 
If you accepted payment for a post or received a product for free, let them 
know.

346
Part V: The Part of Tens 
It’s wise to have a policy in place on the subject of product-related blogging. 
Use the steps in Chapter 6 to compose a page with your product policy, and 
keep it easily accessible to readers (for example, provide a direct link to 
the policy from your home page). At the very least, include a brief statement 
of disclosure in your post (for example, “Wiley Publishing sent me a 
complimentary copy of the new book TypePad For Dummies, and I’ve been 
eager to tell you about it.”) They’ll appreciate your honesty. Figure 18-2 
shows an example of a disclosure page on a TypePad blog.
For more tips on generating a disclosure policy, or to have one prepared for 
you, visit www.disclosurepolicy.org.

Consider the Privacy of the 
People You Blog About
Remember that your blog is your story — be careful if you start making it 
someone else’s. If your neighbor tells you a funny story about the night he 
got locked out of his house in his underwear, think twice before telling that 
story to the rest of the world on your blog.

347
 Chapter 18: Ten Blogging Etiquette Tips
Before you write anything substantial about someone else, get his or her 
permission. Or, at the very least, consider concealing the person’s name and 
other identifying features. It would certainly be a shame to harm a real-life 
relationship because of a momentary lapse in online judgment.
In particular, be especially sensitive where children are concerned — both 
your own and others’. If you blog about your son’s birthday party, for 
example, be aware that the other parents might not be comfortable having 
their kids’ photos on your blog. And remember that the adorable little 
two-year-old in your house will someday be an eighteen-year-old who may 
not want his prom date Googling stories about his potty training.
Consider Your Readers’ Best Interest
Your blog is likely governed by your preferences and love of blogging. This 
is natural, but it’s still polite to consider your readers’ preferences too. They 
are, presumably, visiting your blog for a specific purpose (to be entertained, 
inspired, educated). Just as most of us tend to clean up the living room and 
wipe down the sinks for company, there’s nothing wrong with putting a good 
face forward to the readers who stop by your home on the Web. Here are a 
few things you can do to give consideration to your readers:
 
✓ Give their eyes a rest. Are you inundating readers with tons of visually 
distracting, blinking graphics? Are you using a font size that causes 
squinting? People might stop coming by if your design isn’t visually 
welcoming. Go easy on their eyes!
 
✓ Don’t autoload music. As we mention in Chapter 9, it’s generally not 
advisable to have music automatically streaming when someone visits 
your blog. If you’d like to share your current playlist with your readers, 
offer a widget on your sidebar that they can operate. Let it be their 
choice. If your readers are listening to their own music on their computer, 
and a click to your blog brings your tunes also blaring through their 
speakers, they won’t be pleased.
 
✓ Install a search widget. Consider installing a search bar in your blog 
so that readers can find your old posts easily. They’ll appreciate that 
you’re trying to save them time. See more on this in Chapter 8.
 
✓ Be discerning with product reviews. As companies approach you about 
doing product reviews (and they surely will if your traffic is steadily 
growing), accept only the products that are of true interest and value to 
you and your readers. It’s okay to tell a corporation that you don’t want 
to try its free toilet-bowl cleaner, especially if you think that a post on 
the subject would waste your readers’ time. Use your own time — and 
your readers’ time — well.

348
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Manage the E-Mail Issue Well
Blogging can generate lots of e-mail for a blogger — we understand this all 
too well! Readers write to you, and they likely hope for a response — you 
should find a polite and professional way to handle this issue. Of course, 
we’d never advise that you sacrifice all your personal time by answering 
e-mails in the name of politeness; like everyone else, bloggers need to find 
ways to set healthy boundaries.
Taming the e-mail beast is a struggle for many of us, but you’ll be saving 
your own sanity and enhancing your professional reputation if you have a 
streamlined way to manage it. Here are a few ways to do it:
 
✓ Make your e-mail address easy to find. E-mail can be overwhelming, 
but the solution is not to bury your e-mail address! Keep a link to your 
e-mail address front and center at your blog so readers have an easy 
way to reach you. You can include it in a TypeList that references other 
details about your blog (see Chapter 8), or list your e-mail clearly on 
your About Me page (Chapter 4). It’s bad manners to waste your 
readers’ time by forcing them to dig around for a way to reach you.
 
✓ Explain your e-mail ground rules. You know how we like policies, 
and e-mail is no exception. If you and your readers both know what to 
expect, feelings are less likely to be hurt. An e-mail policy may be 
especially helpful if you are increasingly inundated with e-mail as your 
blog’s traffic grows. Consider setting up a separate page (called Contact 
or E-Mail), and give it a high-profile position on your sidebar. This 
contact page gives you a place to politely explain how much you 
appreciate receiving e-mails from readers, but you’re not able to 
respond to each one. That’s rarely a boundary bloggers are thrilled 
to set, but it’s sometimes necessary, and readers usually understand. 
Figure 18-4 shows an example of a well-implemented contact page that 
includes a simple explanation of the blogger’s policy.
 
✓ Consider an autoreply e-mail. Many Web-based e-mail services such as 
Gmail offer an autoreply (sometimes called a vacation response). You 
could have an autoresponse sent to people who contact you, offering a 
brief and polite thanks and an explanation of your e-mail policy. Opinion 
is split on this subject — some bloggers think the autoreply e-mail is a 
lifesaver, but others are concerned that it’s intrusive. That’s ultimately a 
matter of your own inclination.

349

page at a

 If you’re having a hard time keeping up with e-mail, your readers may 
be having that same issue. Consider whether you want to add to their 
e-mail box with an automated message for every comment they leave 
you or whether you’d like to save the autoresponses for readers who 
send you private e-mail. Of course, we think it’s perfectly okay to skip 
the automated e-mails, too.
 
✓ Offer a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page. Especially if you blog 
on a subject that offers frequent and specific information to people (for 
example, on blogging advice, frugality, or home improvement tutorials), 
you may find that you receive the same e-mail questions over and over. 
If you find this to be the case, consider setting up a Frequently Asked 
Questions page (instructions for page setup can be found in Chapter 6). 
You can offer readers answers to commonly asked questions — it’s 
helpful to the reader, and it might cut down on your e-mail! Figure 18-5 
shows how TypePad blog Money Saving Mom (www.moneysavingmom.
com) has implemented a FAQ page.

Think Before You Post
It’s what your mom told you, and we’ll tell you too: Keep your cool, and think 
before you speak (or, in this case, post). Blogs feel fairly anonymous, and 
it’s entirely too easy to pop off an angry reply, post, or comment from the 
safety of your solitary computer screen. Avoid that temptation by saying only 
things online that you’d say in person. Remember, too, that spoken words 
are more easily forgotten; the things you say online are in writing, preserved 
indefinitely.
If you find yourself on the receiving end of some online nastiness, know that 
blogging shouting matches are seldom productive or resolved. Engaging with 
people who are bent on stirring up trouble (especially if they’re remaining 
anonymous) may backfire. Move on as best you can, and focus that frustrated 
energy into a creative blogging burst!
Participating in the blogosphere is an exciting social dynamic, and like the 
rest of us, you’ll learn the social rhythm better as you move along. Keep your 
eyes peeled, and watch how experienced bloggers engage in the community. 
When you look for ways to extend courtesy, you’ll likely find your own 
blogging experience enriched.

Appendix A
Domain Mapping
In This Appendix
▶ Finding a domain name that suits your blog
▶ Buying a domain name
▶ Connecting your domain name with your TypePad blog
W
hen you decide it’s time to take your blog to the next level — 
meaning that you’re serious about blogging, and you want it to 
show — purchasing your own domain name is an important step toward 
that goal. And after you secure your domain name, you’ll need to map the 
domain to your TypePad account.
We just threw some serious phrases at you: domain name (which is the .com, 
.net, .org URL you purchase) and map the domain (which simply means 
that you want one URL to point to another; for example, you want your
blog.com to point to yourblog.typepad.com so your readers don’t see 
the TypePad reference in the URL). We know it sounds intimidating, and 
truth be told, this isn’t a task for a blogging newbie who isn’t comfortable 
with servers.
However, if you’ve been blogging for a while, are comfortable with your 
experience, and are eager to discover something new, we encourage you to 
buy your own domain name and map it to your TypePad account. Before you 
buy your domain name, though, we think it’s prudent to consider how that 
domain name fits in with your blog’s branding and your overall goals for your 
blog. Next, you need to know if the domain name is available for purchase 
and, if it’s not, consider how that affects your blog’s brand. If everything falls 
into place nicely, and you’ve purchased your domain name, the final step is 
connecting it to your TypePad account so the domain name, not the default 
URL, shows up in the address bar.
Many companies exist to help you buy your domain name. We include those 
that TypePad links to via the Account➪Domain Mapping link:

✓ GoDaddy (www.godaddy.com)
 
✓ Network Solutions (www.networksolutions.com)

✓ Yahoo! (smallbusiness.yahoo.com)
Understanding Domain Names
A domain name is the unique address, owned by you (not a third party), for 
your blog or Web site. When you own a domain name, that address does not 
include the name of the blogging platform you’re using. For example, when 
you start blogging with TypePad, the URL for your blog is http://your
blogname.typepad.com. Notice that you have .typepad.com at the 
end of your blog’s URL. That tells everyone you’re using TypePad as your 
blogging platform. The actual domain name for your blog is typepad.com, 
and the domain is not owned by you; it’s owned by Six Apart (but Six Apart 
doesn’t own your content).
When you buy your own domain name (which should match the name of 
your blog; see Chapters 1 and 3) and map it to your TypePad account, your 
URL will be www.yourdomainname.com, where yourdomainname is the 
name of your domain.
Why is having your own domain name important? Like it or not, your domain 
name says a lot about you and your blog. The main reasons for owning your 
domain name are validation, branding, and marketing.
Validation
The blogging community as a whole views using .com (or .net, .us, .me, 
.org, and so on) instead of the generic yourblogname.typepad.com as 
more professional. If your blog has the name of your blog platform in 
it (yourblogname.typepad.com), it’s a sure tipoff that you’re not as 
serious as some others out there or that you’re a beginner. Owning your own 
domain name validates you as a serious or professional blogger. After you’re 
perceived as professional, you’ll have better luck with your peers and with 
advertisers. Having said that, there is always an exception to the rule, and 
many bloggers are perfectly happy with their default platform URLs.

353
 Appendix A: Domain Mapping 
Branding
Owning your domain name is one more way to reinforce your personal blog 
brand. If you don’t own the domain for your brand, it’s possible that someone 
else can buy it and use it. If a potential reader or vendor finds your competition 
instead of you, it could cost you a subscription or a sale. Or, worse, how will 
you manage it if the person who owns the domain that people associate with 
you is hosting content you don’t want associated with you or your brand? 
Finding and buying the domain name early in your blogging career (even if 
you haven’t mapped it to your TypePad account) leaves you in control of 
your brand.
Marketing
For us, the most reasonable argument for owning your own domain name is 
marketing. In other words, owning your domain name helps readers find you. 
If people know the name of your blog but not the actual URL, they can make 
an educated guess that your URL is your blog’s name with .com or .net at 
the end. If they type that in their browser’s address bar and find you, you’ve 
saved them a Google search and some guesswork. If they type it and see an 
error, will they think to type blogname.typepad.com? Probably not. They 
may not even be aware of that option. Save your readers (and yourself) the 
hassle, and make your blog easy to find with a domain name.
Choosing a Domain Name
It’s a good idea to consider your domain name when you’re naming your 
blog. When you’re thinking of names for your blog, do a domain-name search 
for that name and, if it’s available, buy it (you can map it later, but at least 
you’ll own it). If the name is not available, consider how important it is for 
your blog’s name and URL to match. Can you get a version of your name that 
makes sense? One of our personal blogs, Don’t Try This at Home, has a URL of 
www.donttryit.com. It’s not the best match but it was the closest available 
option. Ideally, you should name your blog from the very start based on the 
URLs that are available. (In reality, most bloggers — including us, when we 
started out — aren’t thinking that far ahead!)

354
Part V: The Part of Tens 
The most popular suffix is .com, followed by .net. Although .com is most 
desirable, both are fine. It’s not a bad idea to buy both, if they are available, 
to protect your brand. Should you buy .net if .com isn’t available? Opinions 
are varied on this one. One of our personal blogs, Rocks in My Dryer, is 
housed at rocksinmydryer.net, and that’s always been sufficient. If you 
are purchasing the URL for a blog and have serious aims at turning it into a 
recognizable brand and business, you might want to settle for nothing less 
than .com. If it’s not available, you can try to buy it later — though you might 
have to shell out big bucks. If that’s not an option, you may simply have to 
head back to the drawing board for a new name.
Searching For and Buying 
Your Domain Name
You’ll want to start the domain-buying process by finding out if the domain 
name you want is even available. To do this, simply visit any of the companies 
listed in this section; all of them allow you to search for your domain without 
making a commitment to buy anything. At the very least, this gives you an 
idea of what is available. When you’ve nailed down the URL you want to 
purchase, and you’re ready to commit, choose the service that suits you 
best. This section helps you do just that.
When choosing where to register and purchase your domain name, keep in 
mind that TypePad requires that your registrar (the company you buy your 
domain from) supports custom DNS services, which means that you have 
access to and control over the DNS records for the domain(s) you purchase. 
(DNS stands for domain name server.) You must also be able to create and 
change your A, MX, and CNAME records. Check the FAQ or support page of 
the registrar you’d like to use to see if it supports those TypePad requirements. 
Alternatively, you can contact TypePad’s support team, and they’ll be happy 
to help you figure this out.
So many companies exist from which to buy your domain that pricing is 
competitive. Some companies offer domains as low as $5 per year, but the 
standard price is about $10 per year for each domain name. If you’re paying 
more than that, definitely start shopping around!
 
If you buy your domain name via one registrar but find a better deal with 
another registrar, you can switch your registrar and still maintain ownership 
of your domain name. Make sure to read your registrar’s terms of service to 
see if you’re required to stay with that registrar for a minimum number of 
months.

355
 Appendix A: Domain Mapping 
 
Before you choose a domain name registrar, read the fine print for each 
option. For instance, at the time this book was printed, Yahoo! charged only 
$1.99 for the first year of your registration, but that price can be as high as 
$34.95 per year after your initial term expires!
GoDaddy
GoDaddy and TypePad are tightly integrated and have worked together to 
make buying and mapping your domain to TypePad as painless as 
possible. In fact, TypePad even has a page on the GoDaddy Web site (www.
securepaynet.net/default.aspx?prog_id=447133; see Figure A-1) 
where you can search for a domain name, manage your GoDaddy purchases

PairNIC
PairNIC is the final registrar we discuss. Figure A-7 shows the PairNIC home 
page, where you can start your search for your domain name.
To search for domain name availability at PairNIC, visit its site (www.pairnic.
com) and then follow these instructions:
 
1. Click inside the search bar, and type the name of the domain you 
want to purchase.
 
 Do not type the extension (such as .com).
 
2. From the pull-down menu, choose the extension (for example, .com or 
.net) that you’d like to search for.
 
3. Click to select the Register This Domain Name Now option.
 
4. Click the blue Continue button.
 
 A page appears that tells you whether your domain is available, as 
shown in Figure A-8. If the domain is not available, PairNIC provides a 
list of similar domain names that you may be happy with.

Mapping Your Domain Name 
to Your TypePad Account
After you register (that is, buy) your domain, you need to map it to your 
existing TypePad blog. Domain mapping is simply pointing a domain name 
(that is, URL) to your current blog. To do that, you have to change a few 
items at your domain’s registrar site. This section explains how to map your 
domain by using any of the four registrars we’ve discussed.
Begin the domain-mapping process
Regardless of your registrar, before you begin, you need to go to the Domain 
Mapping page in your TypePad account by choosing Account➪Domain 
Mapping. Then follow these initial instructions before you look at the 
instructions for your particular registrar. These instructions tell TypePad 
how you want to use your domain name in relation to your TypePad blog(s); 
later in this chapter, the instructions for a particular registrar explain how to 
map your domain to TypePad.
 
1. Click the gray Begin Here: Map a Domain Name button.
 
 A page appears, asking for some basic information about how you’d like 
to use your domain name with your TypePad blog(s). You may want to 
refer to Figure A-9, which shows the Domain Mapping page.
 
2. Type your domain name in the first text box (be sure to include www).

363
 Appendix A: Domain Mapping 
 
Figure A-9:

how you 
want to use 
your domain 
name 
with your 
TypePad 
blog(s).
 
 
3. Click to select the blog(s) or parts of your site that you want to 
associate with this domain name.
 
 Your options are
 
• My Entire Site: If you map the domain to the entire site, all blogs 
associated with your TypePad account are included.
 
• My Blog: You can choose a specific blog to map your domain to. 
If you have multiple blogs and want a different domain associated 
with each one, this is the option to choose.
 
• My Photo Album: You can opt to have a photo album, instead of 
your blog, associated with your domain.
 
4. Click Add Domain Mapping.
 
 A page appears, asking you to configure your domain’s DNS record. At 
this point, you need to go to your registrar (the Web site where you 
bought your domain) and change the necessary information (such as 
the CNAME record; we provide instructions in the next section, “Change 
your domain’s DNS record”); then return to this page to complete your 
domain mapping.
 
We strongly suggest that you open a new browser tab or window when 
visiting your registrar’s site to change your DNS. Having both tabs or both 

364
Part V: The Part of Tens 
windows open (one with your TypePad account and one with your registrar) 
makes it easier to move from one site to the other and check setting information 
if necessary.
Change your domain’s DNS record
As you’ve probably noticed as you’ve become more familiar with your 
TypePad account, Six Apart (and, therefore, TypePad) has a close 
relationship with certain companies, including GoDaddy. You can search 
for, buy, and access your GoDaddy account right from the TypePad 
Knowledge Base. Because Six Apart and TypePad have integrated GoDaddy, 
and GoDaddy appears to be the easiest way to map a domain with TypePad, 
we provide specific instructions for using GoDaddy and more generic 
instructions for the other registrar sites.
At this point, we suggest that you find your registrar in this section and 
follow the instructions for changing your DNS so that you can complete the 
domain-mapping task for your TypePad account.
 
You must change your DNS settings (specifically, CNAME) to map your 
domain to your TypePad blog. If you aren’t comfortable doing this yourself, 
we suggest opening a help ticket with your registrar to request assistance.
GoDaddy
Visit the GoDaddy site (godaddy.com) and then follow these instructions to 
change your DNS settings:
 
1. Sign in to your GoDaddy account.
 
2. Use the mouse to point to, but not click, the word Domains on the 
green toolbar.
 
 A menu appears.
 
3. Click My Domains.
 
 A page appears with a list of the domains you’ve registered with 
GoDaddy.
 
4. Click the domain name you want to map to your TypePad account.
 
 A page appears that lists the information related to the domain name 
you chose. See Figure A-10.
 
5. Make sure that your nameservers are set to the default.
 
6. Ensure that all Forwarding is off.

PairNIC
PairNIC specifically suggests using Domain Name Parking if you’d like to map 
your domain to your TypePad blog. To do this, follow these instructions:
 
1. Sign in to your PairNIC account.
 
 Your account page appears.

368
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
2. Click the Manage Domain Names link.
 
 A page is returned with a list of your domain names.
 
3. Click the domain name you want to use with your TypePad blog.
 
4. Click the E-Mail Forwarding and Web Site Forwarding and Parking 
link.
 
5. Click the Domain Name Parking option.
 
 A warning appears, alerting you that you are choosing Domain Name 
Parking.
 
6. Click Continue.
 
7. Click inside the box marked Destination Domain Name, and type 
blogname.typepad.com.
 
 Note that blogname.typepad.com should reflect your TypePad blog’s URL.
 
8. Click the Add Domain Parking button.
 
9. Complete the domain-mapping process as instructed “Finish the 
domain-mapping process.”
 
 Using Domain Name Parking with PairNIC changes your nameservers. 
After the nameservers are changed, it can take up to two days for the 
changes to resolve.
Finish the domain-mapping process
Now that you’ve initiated the domain-mapping process in your TypePad 
account and have changed the CNAME at your domain name registrar, you’re 
ready to finish the process:
 
1. Return to the Domain Mapping section on the TypePad Dashboard.
 
2. Click the Activate link in the Domain Mappings box at the bottom of 
the page, as pictured in Figure A-12.
 
 The Domain Mapping page appears with a note highlighted in yellow 
at the top of the screen: You have successfully activated the 
selected domain.
 
It can take up to 48 hours for the CNAME changes to resolve, so you may not 
see your changes immediately when you type your domain name in a browser.

Deactivating Domain Mapping
If you no longer want to map a specific domain to your TypePad blog, you 
can deactivate it. To do that, go to your Account page, and choose the 
Domain Mapping tab. Scroll down to the Domain Mappings box at the bottom 
of the page. Click the Deactivate or Remove link. The Deactivate link simply 
deactivates domain mapping from your blog; if you ever want to reactivate 
domain mapping, simply click the Activate link. The Remove link removes 
the mapping completely — if you ever wanted to reactivate domain mapping, 
you’d have to go through the entire process again.
 
If you deactivate domain mapping, any images you uploaded while the domain 
map was active will no longer appear. When you deactivate domain mapping, 
the links that call the images are broken. You have to fix those links by hand.

Third-Party Stat Counters
In This Appendix
▶ Speaking the basic lingo of blog traffic
▶ Understanding how to use FeedBurner
▶ Using Google Analytics to track more than basic stats
B
eing aware of your statistics is a significant part of the blogging gig. 
Particularly for bloggers who seek to blog professionally or want to 
establish credibility as experts in their field, it’s impressive to colleagues 
and marketers when you can show measurable results of your blog’s 
performance. When you deal with advertisers, they have every right to ask 
you about your blog’s traffic — you’ll need to be able to show your blog’s 
reach and audience.
TypePad tracks your statistics for you; in Chapter 5, we explain how you 
can see your most recent page views and referrals on the front page of the 
blue blog-level navigation bar. These numbers may be helpful as a quick 
reference, but TypePad’s Dashboard statistics don’t provide the in-depth 
information most professional bloggers may require from their statistics-
tracking software. As a result, we recommend that you install a third-party 
statistics tracker (also referred to as a stat counter) on your site.
In this appendix, we give you an overview of the subject of blog traffic, 
defining the terminology and helping you understand more advanced tools 
such as FeedBurner and Google Analytics. Entire books have been written on 
how you can use sites like these to track and interpret your blog’s data, but if 
you’re a beginner to blog traffic, this appendix gives you a nudge in the right 
direction.
 
If you want to really understand how to leverage your statistics, we suggest 
checking out Web Analytics For Dummies, by Pedro Sostre.

372
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Understanding Basic Traffic Terminology
 If you’re new to the subject of blog traffic, it’s helpful to have a firm 
understanding of some basic concepts. Not every traffic counter uses exactly 
the same technology and algorithms to assess your numbers, but you need to 
know and understand fundamental information to use your data effectively:
 
✓ Pageviews: Each time someone visits your site, it counts as a pageview 
(different traffic counters may call it by a different name, such as total 
visits). If, for example, readers click around in your archives, visiting 
four different posts or pages, your statistics counter most likely records 
four different pageviews. Pageviews are based on how many times a 
page is loaded into a browser, not on how many different users are 
loading the page. In other words, the same person may come to your 
site five times in a day, and each visit is included in your pageview 
count.
 
✓ Unique users: The number of unique users reflects the individual 
people who have visited your site. The data collected here is based on 
a computer’s IP address (which is basically the computer’s identifying 
information that all Web sites collect). Whereas pageviews include how 
many times a page as has been loaded (regardless of whether it was the 
same user visiting over and over), unique users (or uniques, as they’re 
often referred to) is a record of individual IP addresses — no computer 
is counted twice. Advertisers in particular are interested in your number 
of monthly unique visitors because it’s considered the most accurate 
measure of your blog’s actual traffic.
Keeping it all in perspective
If you’re blogging to build your business, tracking 
and understanding your blog statistics are 
important because you’ll use these numbers to 
stay aware of what’s working and what’s not.
Remember, however, that keeping a close eye 
on your stats is optional, especially if you blog 
as a hobby. It’s tempting to let the concrete 
measurements of page views, referrals, 
subscribers, and so on entirely define your 
blog’s success. Instead, make your measure 
of success your own personal sense of 
satisfaction from producing good content 
and the valuable relationships that will likely 
spring up from your blogging. To keep a healthy 
perspective, many hobbyist bloggers check 
their statistics at only designated times (for 
example, on the same day each week or month). 
Still others don’t check them at all!
Watch your stats if you need to, for the sake 
of your business, or if it’s the kind of thing that 
suits your competitive or curious personality. 
If you blog just for the love of it, though, don’t 
let your stats become a source of stress. They 
should inform you, not define you.

373
 Appendix B: Third-Party Stat Counters
 
✓ Keyword analysis: You’ll want to know what search terms people are 
using to locate your blog, and keyword analysis does just that. Most 
statistics sites tell you which search engine results are directing people 
to your blog, which helps you solidify your search engine optimization 
(SEO) strategies (see Chapter 1). If you find that a post of yours is a 
popular entry point for Google searchers, you know that this is a popular 
topic, and you might want to tackle it further, and maybe you should 
include the post in a “Best Of” TypeList in your sidebar (see Chapter 8).
 
 Even if SEO isn’t your cup of tea, understanding your search engine 
traffic is interesting and sometimes highly amusing. For example, 
Figure B-1 shows an afternoon of keyword analysis at one of our per-
sonal blogs (using www.statcounter.com).

analysis at 
StatCounter.
 
A very bad day!
 
✓ Referrals: Your referrals let you know which blogs or other Web sites are 
sending traffic your way by linking to you. If a blogger with a significant 
amount of traffic links to you, you can usually expect to see a pleasant 
spike in your traffic. Any time you notice someone sending traffic your 
way, it’s a nice, professional gesture to send them a comment or e-mail 
of thanks!
Plenty of additional, more advanced metrics are available to bloggers, and we 
discuss those further along in this appendix.

374
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Choosing a Stat Counter
No shortage of sites track and interpret your traffic, and many even do it 
for free. When you sign up for the service, the site gives you a snippet of 
code you can place in your sidebar by using a Notes TypeList or the Embed 
Your Own HTML widget (see Chapter 8 for instructions on how to use both 
options). Then you sign in to your account on the statistics site to gain 
access to your traffic reports.
 
If you install multiple statistics trackers, you may be surprised to see that 
each one produces a different number. This is because sites may not use iden-
tical methods to estimate traffic. If you notice discrepancies, don’t sweat it — 
unless the discrepancies are large. If this happens, check your stat counter’s 
help page for assistance or contact the site directly with your questions.
Following are a few tried-and-true statistics counters that are popular with 
many bloggers. All offer free versions of their service, and the first three offer 
access to upgraded, more advanced metrics for a fee. Most hobby bloggers 
(and many professional ones) find that the free version of these services is 
usually sufficient:
 
✓ Site Meter (sitemeter.com)
 
✓ StatCounter (statcounter.com)
 
✓ ShinyStat (www.shinystat.com)
 
✓ BlogTracker (tracker.icerocket.com)
 
✓ My BlogLog (www.mybloglog.com)
 
This list is a good start, but if you’re looking for other options, type blog 
statistics tracker in a search engine, and browse the numerous results until 
you find the stat counter that best suits your needs.
Implementing FeedBurner
In both Chapters 5 and 15, we tell you a little more about FeedBurner 
(feedburner.com), a site for managing your RSS feed. You can easily burn 
your RSS feed through FeedBurner (Chapter 5 shows you how), and we 
highly recommend that you do so. Having a feed tracked via FeedBurner 
gives you access to some powerful subscription-tracking software — you’ll 
likely find it most helpful as a benchmark for your blog’s performance. 
We could fill an entire book with pointers on maximizing your FeedBurner 
account, but in this section, we hit on just a few of the most important 
elements. For more expansive instructions, click the Help link in the top-right 
corner of your FeedBurner page.

375
 Appendix B: Third-Party Stat Counters
 
FeedBurner is owned by Google. Because it sits under the Google umbrella 
with Google Analytics (see the next section), FeedBurner concentrates more 
heavily on interpreting your subscriber data (how many people subscribe to 
your blog’s feed) than on your traffic data (how many people visit your blog). 
Some information on page views and clicks is available via FeedBurner, but 
not in the same depth that you’ll find in its Google partner, Google Analytics.
Getting started
If you haven’t already burned your feed through FeedBurner, that’s your 
important first step. Follow the steps in Chapter 5, or visit feedburner.com 
and sign in with your Google account. On FeedBurner’s front page, click the 
Claim Your Feeds Now button, and FeedBurner walks you through the steps 
of getting your feed up and running.
After your FeedBurner RSS feed is established, you’ll see, after signing in, a 
page titled My Feeds. It looks similar to the one in Figure B-2 — we’re using 
one of our own FeedBurner accounts to demonstrate.

376
Part V: The Part of Tens 
In the example in Figure B-2, five feeds are burned under one account. To 
burn another feed under this same account (a good idea if you’re managing 
multiple blogs), simply enter the URL in the text box below Burn a Feed Right 
This Instant, and click Next. FeedBurner walks you through the steps of 
burning additional feeds.
No additional feeds to burn? Now you’re ready to look at your blog’s 
FeedBurner stats.
Understanding your FeedBurner stats
From your My Feeds page (refer to Figure B-2), click the name of the feed
you want to work with. Your Feed Stats Dashboard appears, as shown in 
Figure B-3.
Across the top of the screen, note the navigation tabs titled Analyze, 
Optimize, Publicize, Monetize, and (so cleverly) Troubleshootize. You can 
find a ton of information under each of those tabs, but here’s a general 
rundown of what each one offers you:
 
Figure B-3: 
Feed Stats 
Dashboard 
page on 
FeedBurner.
 

377
 Appendix B: Third-Party Stat Counters
 
✓ Analyze: This tab gives you a snapshot of information about your blog’s 
subscribers. In the bar graph, the green line tracks your number of 
subscribers (hover the mouse over the line for more information). The 
blue line tracks your reach, FeedBurner’s word to describe the number 
of times readers have interacted with the content on your site (such as a 
click). Clicking the Subscribers link under Feed Stats (on the left) shows 
you which feed readers are being used to follow your blog. Don’t be 
afraid to click around and explore the Analyze tab — you’ll find several 
helpful tools to help you interpret your traffic.
 
✓ Optimize: Want to add a podcast feed to your blog? Or maybe share 
your Bloglines or Delicious links with readers? The Optimize tab allows 
you to make the most of your RSS feed with just a few clicks.
 
✓ Publicize: Use this tab to generate a chicklet, or graphic, showing readers 
how to subscribe to your site easily. You can also generate a button 
displaying how many subscribers you have. As we explain in Chapter 15, 
you can also use this tab to offer your readers the e-mail subscription 
option. Click around this tab for more tools to promote your feed.
 
✓ Monetize: This tab allows you to use your Google AdSense account to 
insert ads directly into your feed. Your readers see these ads without 
ever having to click over to your site. This tool assumes that you 
already have some working familiarity with Google AdSense — for more 
information, see Google AdSense For Dummies, by Jerri L. Ledford.
 
✓ Troubleshootize: Use this tab for a quick-and-easy list of solutions to 
common FeedBurner problems, such as a feed that won’t update. At the 
bottom of the page, don’t miss the link to Open the FeedBurner Help 
Group in a New Window. This takes you to a forum where FeedBurner 
troubleshooters can share tricks of the trade.
Incorporating Google Analytics
Google Analytics is the blogging-industry standard for tracking your site’s 
statistics. This powerful, comprehensive tool allows you to see who is visiting 
your site, where they came from, how long they stayed, and which pages 
they visited. In addition, you can track how many times a specific link was 
clicked, which keywords are performing well for your blog, what your most 
popular content is, and much more. The best part? Google Analytics is free. 
With the high performance of Google Analytics, however, comes a higher 
degree of complexity.

378
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
You need to have a Gmail account (www.google.com/accounts/New
Account) to set up your Google Analytics account. If you already have a 
Gmail account, you can go directly to Google Analytics (www.google.com/
analytics) to set up your account.
TypePad allows you to integrate your Google Analytics account with your 
blog by sharing your UA number (this is your User Account number, and is 
assigned when you establish an account with Google Analytics). To link your 
Google Analytics account with your TypePad blog, click your blog’s Settings 
tab and then click the Stats link. Type your UA number and then click Save 
Changes.
Using Google Analytics tools
As we’ve stated, Google Analytics is the industry standard and the most 
robust option for tracking your blog’s statistics. If you have a third party 
relying on you for accurate information (for example, an advertiser who 
wants to know how many people clicked his or her link), that third party is 
more likely to trust the Google Analytics information than a less well-known 
or trusted statistics program.
In addition, Google Analytics allows you to track many elements of your blog. 
This section explains some of the main tools of Google Analytics and how 
you can use them with your TypePad blog.
 
Keep in mind that you use your Google Analytics UA number to link your 
Google Analytics account with your TypePad account, but you will continue 
to view all your statistic information at the Google Analytics site, not on your 
TypePad blog’s Overview page.
The first thing you see when you sign in to your Google Analytics account 
is your My Analytics Accounts page, which looks similar to Figure B-4. This 
page lists the Web site Profiles you’ve established. (If you have several blogs, 
you can establish a Profile for each and manage them all from this page — 
you can have up to 50 Profiles.)
Navigating your Google 
Analytics Dashboard
When you click the name of the Profile you want to work with, the first thing 
you see is the Dashboard for that Profile. Your Dashboard, as seen in Figure 
B-5, is the hub of your blog’s statistical data.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
The Dashboard gives you an overview of the activity on your site for a 
specific period of time. Refer to Figure B-5 as we explain each module:
 
✓ Graph: This graph is a visual representation of your basic site statistics. 
You can choose to view visits, pageviews, pages/visits, average time on 
the site, bounce rate, or percentage of new visits. You can also choose 
whether you want the graph to show daily, weekly, or monthly trends. A 
bonus is the ability to compare two metrics. For instance, if you choose 
to compare visits and pageviews, you’ll have an idea of how many 
visitors surfed through your site and saw different pages or posts and 
how many just clicked away after reading what they came for.
 
 The bounce rate is how long visitors stayed at your site; the higher the 
bounce rate, the shorter they stayed — aim for a bounce rate of about 
50 percent.
 
✓ Site Usage: This section of the Dashboard gives you information at a 
glance. You can easily see how many visits and pageviews your site has 
enjoyed, the average pages readers browsed per visit, the bounce rate, 
the average time a visitor spent at your site (this correlates to your 
bounce rate), and the percentage of your visitors that were new.
 
✓ Menu of Links: This menu lets you discover specific information about 
your statistical data. For instance, if you click Visitor, you can see 
information on visitor trending, benchmarks, loyalty, which browsers 
visitors use, and network properties. You can add any of these links to 
your Dashboard as a module by clicking the link in the menu and then 
clicking the Add to Dashboard link.
 
✓ Modules: Below the Graph and Site Usage information are several 
modules. These modules can be deleted or moved around to suit your 
interests and needs. The default modules are as follows:
 
• Visitor Overview: This module shows pretty much the same 
information that the default graph shows. You can see the number 
of visitors to your site over the last month.
 
• Map Overlay: This module shows a map of the world and 
highlights the areas where your visitors are coming from. Dark 
green indicates the highest concentration of visitors; light green 
indicates fewer visitors.
 
• Traffic Sources Overview: This module shows you how your 
traffic found you. The pie chart is segmented according to those 
who found you via search engines, referring sites (other sites 
that have linked to you), direct traffic (those who typed your URL 
directly), and other.
 
• Content Overview: This module is extremely useful because it 
shows you at a glance which pages of your blog are most popular. 
You can quickly see the top five pages your readers are interested 
in and how many pageviews each had over the past month.

381
 Appendix B: Third-Party Stat Counters
 
 Each module has a View Report link so you can see even more detailed 
information about the data.
 
 You can change the order of the modules by clicking and dragging 
a module to a new place on the Dashboard. If you’d like to delete a 
module, just click the X in the top-right corner of the module. If you’d 
like to add a module to the Dashboard, click the link from the menu 
of links for the topic you want to include and click the Add to Dashboard 
link at the top of the module.
Doing more with Google Analytics
As you can see, Google Analytics offers the same options other stat counters 
provide. However, Google Analytics offers many options beyond just basic 
visitor statistics. Your Google Analytics account allows you to track your 
readers’ specific behavior and report on how your site is helping or hindering 
your goals. For instance, if you’d like to track how many people are signing 
up for your newsletter, you can do that. Or if you’d like to track how many 
people are clicking a specific link or advertisement on your site, you can 
do that. The best part? The features are free and included in your Google 
Analytics account. If you want that sort of functionality from another 
program, you’d likely pay for it.
Google Analytics is so robust, we could write an entire book on it. 
Unfortunately, we don’t have that kind of room, so we’re going to show you 
how to do the two most-asked-for tasks: setting and tracking goals, and 
tracking click-throughs.
Setting and tracking goals
A Google Analytics goal refers to a specific task that measures how well your 
site fulfills a business need. When you think of a goal as it relates to your Web 
site, you most likely consider the goal as an idea — something to achieve. 
Obviously, Google Analytics can’t track ideas, but it can track Web pages. 
When you’re working with Google Analytics, your goal is a Web page. If your 
“idea” goal is to have readers sign up for a newsletter or make a purchase, 
your Google Analytics goal is related to a Web page that confirms that 
behavior is completed.
Here’s an example. Let’s say your goal is to increase newsletter subscribers. 
To encourage your readers to sign up for your newsletter (and thus increase 
your subscriber number), you provide a link inviting readers to subscribe to 
your newsletter. That link takes readers to a subscription page with a sign-up 
form (though you don’t have to have a form to set a goal). After readers have 
completed the form and clicked the button to submit that information, they 
are taken to a Thank You page. This Thank You page is your Google Analytics 
goal, because if readers have made it to this page, you are sure they have 

382
Part V: The Part of Tens 
subscribed to your newsletter. Tracking how many times readers make it to 
the Thank You page allows you to see how your readers are using your site 
and whether you’re successful with your goal of increasing newsletter sub-
scriptions.
To set up a goal, follow these instructions:
 
1. Sign in to your Google Analytics account.
 
2. Click the View Report link next to the Profile you want to work with.
 
3. Click Goals on the menu of links in the left sidebar.
 
 The Goals Overview page appears.
 
4. Click Set Up Goals and Funnels.
 
 A new browser window opens, with your Profile Setting page. This page 
also allows you to set up your goal(s). Scroll down until you see the 
table named Conversion Goals and Funnel. Let’s set up your first goal.
 
5. Click Edit in the first row of the Conversion Goals and Funnel table.
 
 The Goal Settings page appears.
 
6. Complete the Goals Settings page as follows:
 
• Active Goal: Click to select On so you can activate your goal. If you 
ever decide to deactivate this goal, simply return to this page and 
click to select Off.
 
• Match Type: Choose Exact Match if you want the URL you enter as 
your goal URL to match the URL shown in the report. Choose Head 
Match if your site has dynamically generated content (for example, 
users have dynamically generated IDs, and those are part of the 
URL). Choose Regular Expression Match if you are using regular 
expressions.
 
 If you’re just starting out with Goals, choose Exact Match if 
you’re unfamiliar with dynamically generated content or regular 
expressions.
 
• Goal URL: Type the URL of your goal page (for example, the Thank 
You for Subscribing page we used in the earlier example).
 
• Goal Name: Type the name you want this goal to have (for example, 
newsletter subscriptions).
 
• Case Sensitive: Click to select this box if capitalization is important 
within the URL you entered in the Goal URL box.
 
• Goal Value: Assign a numeric value to your goal.

Tracking click-throughs
Being able to track which links your readers are clicking is an extremely 
useful tool. In particular, tracking whether your readers are clicking an 
advertiser’s link allows you to see which advertisements and products are of 
interest to your readers and which are not (or, if you’re not selling anything, 
which links to further information are working). In turn, if you’re selling your 
own ads (and aren’t part of an advertising network), you’ll know which 
advertisements to accept and which to decline based on your user’s interest 
and behavior. Or you’ll be able to tell what information your readers are 
most interested in finding based on which articles they’re clicking to. To 
track links, you need to insert specific Google Analytics code into your link 
HTML. The following instructions explain how.
 
Tracking click-throughs for a link requires that you insert HTML code. If the 
code is not inserted correctly, Google Analytics will not track click-throughs 
for the link. You won’t break your blog, but you won’t be tracking your link, 
either.
 
1. Create your link in the TypePad Compose editor.
 
 (See Chapter 5 for instructions on making a link.. The original link looks 
something like this, but with your information:
<a href=“http://www.blogname.com”>your link text</a>
 
2. Change your link to look like this:
<a href=“http://www.blogname.com/” onclick=“pageTracker._
trackEvent(‘category’, ‘action’, ‘label’, ‘value’);”>your link 
text</a>
 
• Category: This field is required. Type a simple name for the 
category you are tracking. For instance, if you’re tracking click-
throughs for links, you might name the category links. If you’re 
tracking video downloads, you might name your category video. 
You can reuse the category name for items that are the same (that 
is, use links for all links being tracked).
 
• Action: This field is required. Type the action you are tracking. 
If you’re tracking click-throughs for a link, you might name your 
action click. If you’re tracking how many people play a video at 
your site, you might name the action play. Again, you can reuse 
the action name as necessary.
 
• Label: This field is optional. Use this item to determine which 
link is being tracked, and name it something that reflects the link. 
For instance, if you’re tracking how many people click the link for 

384
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Blogging Basics 101, you can name the label bb101. When you view 
your Google Analytics stats for your events (instructions follow), 
you can clearly see which links are being clicked more than others.
 
• Value: This field is optional. You can assign a numeric value, if you 
like.
 
 Here, we’ve made a link that sends the reader to Blogging Basics 101. 
We’ve assigned the category as links, the action as click, and the 
label as bb101:
<a href=“http://www.bloggingbasics101.com” onclick=“pageTracker._
trackEvent(‘links’, ‘click’, ‘bb101’);”>Blogging Basics 101</a>
 
 If you choose a name with more than one word for your category, 
action, label, or value, use hyphens between the words. For example, if 
you want to name your category test links, type test-links as your 
category.
 
3. Save and publish your post.
 
 You can track your click-throughs via Google Analytics.
 
 Google Analytics won’t show your statistics until 24 hours later.
 
4. Sign in to your Google Analytics account.
 
5. Click the View Report link next to the Profile you want to work with.
 
6. On the menu of links in the left sidebar, click Content and then click 
Event Tracking.
 
7. Click the metric you want to view.
Finding out more about Google Analytics
Are you interested in learning to use Google Analytics to its full potential? 
Google has a blog at analytics.blogspot.com and a YouTube channel 
that contains many video tutorials for using Google Analytics with your blog. 
To find out more, follow these steps:
 
1. Type www.youtube.com/user/Google in your browser’s address bar 
and press Enter.
 
2. Click the Playlist link.
 
 A new page appears with a list of Google’s video playlists.
 
3. Scroll down the page until you find Google Conversion University, 
and click that title.
 
 A new page appears that lists the video tutorials for Google Analytics.
 
4. Click the title of the video you want to view.
