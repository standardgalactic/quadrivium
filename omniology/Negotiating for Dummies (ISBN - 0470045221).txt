Author’s Acknowledgments
I gratefully acknowledge the contribution of so many beloved people whose
talent and willingness to help were indispensable: 
 My daughters, Michelle (and Ray) Rapko, Amy Donaldson (and Eddie),
and Wendy (and John) Friess, who have taught me more than I ever
wanted to know about negotiating with children.
 My partner, Tim Kittleson, for his sharp eye and wise counsel. 
 Betty White, whose genuine enthusiasm encouraged me from the earli-
est stages of the first edition all the way through this sequel edition.
 An army of typists, proofers, and commenters led by Gus Avila,
Katheleen Ebora, and Ryann Gooden. 
 The dozens and dozens of people who provided quotes, quips, informa-
tion, and insights that enrich the book, including such professional writ-
ers as Howard Rodman, Melinda Peterson, and Phil Proctor. James
Greenwood, your donated time is particularly appreciated.
 My clients, with whom and for whom I hone my skills every single day.
 Mimi Schwied Donaldson, who aggressively supported me to write the
book that would eventually become Negotiating For Dummies and to find
a publishing home for the book. When I decided to join the For Dummies
team, Mimi became coauthor of the first edition by making substantial
contributions to what is now Chapter 2 and Chapter 9. She also con-
tributed virtually all the material that is gathered into Chapter 17 on
negotiating between men and women.
 And, from beginning to end, the wonderful, supportive, and flexible staff
at Wiley Publishing, Inc.: Kathy Cox, who commissioned the second edi-
tion; Tim Gallan, my fabulous editor, who shaped the book; Vicki Adang,
the world’s best copy editor; and all the wonderful people in Production,
Marketing, and Sales who delivered this book from the press to you.

Foreword
I have known Michael Donaldson since our days in law school together. We
share fundamental values about our human community, and I agree about
how honest negotiation can help us realize those values.
Now that I’ve reviewed the final text, it is gratifyingly obvious that this is not
merely a book about techniques. It is not a book about cheap tricks. As far as
I know, it is the only book on negotiating that begins with creating a personal
or business mission statement that explores and then incorporates your
values and beliefs. I strongly agree that people must always negotiate from 
an informed, deeply held belief system.
This is also the only book on negotiating I have seen that has an entire chap-
ter on listening to one’s inner voice. You must hear what your heart and your
gut tell you before you can best use the other insights of this book. No practi-
cal guide can overrule your inner sense of what is right and wrong.
I am no stranger to high-stakes, complicated negotiations. My own back-
ground as the Attorney General of the State of Oregon includes some hefty
negotiations. I was one of the three chief negotiators representing all 50
states in a case involving some extraordinarily complicated issues of oil pric-
ing. The case resulted in a settlement exceeding 4 billion dollars. At the time,
it was the largest settlement in American legal history. That negotiation took
place in some 15 different locations over a period of four years and involved
dozens of parties.
From this and other experiences, I know that superficial technique can be 
no substitute for beginning with an informed, deeply held belief system. 
The reason I like this book is that it makes clear how every negotiation is
premised on alignments of fundamental values. We must understand our-
selves and what we wish to accomplish and then develop these values and
feeling with those who might seem, on the surface, to be our adversaries. In
this book, you will discover how we all may be more effective in resolving the
big and little negotiations that our turbulent existence shows us every day.
Dave Frohnmayer,
President, University of Oregon
Attorney General, emeritus — State of Oregon (1981–1991)
David Frohnmayer was President of the National Association of Attorneys
General (1987–1988). He received that association’s Wyman award in 1987
saluting the nation’s most outstanding attorney general. He was one of three
chief state negotiators in the Stripper Well litigation that led to what was then
the largest civil settlement in the history of American law. He was the lead 
counsel for the states when the settlement was argued in court.

Introduction
W
elcome to Negotiating For Dummies, 2nd Edition — a new and
improved way to get what you want in life.
You negotiate all day long, not just on the job but in every situation you
encounter — with your boss or your employees, with your vendors or your
clients, with your spouse or your kids, even with the serviceperson who
comes to your house but doesn’t repair the refrigerator after all. All of these
relationships call for constant negotiation.
A negotiation is any communication in which you are attempting to achieve
the approval, acquiescence, or action of someone else. Most people tend to
think of negotiation in the business context or in connection with major 
purchases, such as a home or a car. But you probably spend more of your
energy in one-minute life negotiations such as, “Dad, can I borrow the car?”
or “Honey, will you please put the seat down?” The lessons in this book apply
to both the once-in-a-lifetime, million-dollar deals and the everyday, one-minute
life negotiations.
Who Needs to Read This Book?
Everyone.
Face it, you negotiate all day long, and you can do a much better job of it. No
matter how you perceive your skills today, they can be stronger tomorrow.
And your progress can start with this book.
Many people assume that they know a great deal about negotiating because
they have done it so often, but these same people have never given a moment’s
thought to the fundamentals of successful negotiating. Worse, many people
believe that their lawyers are knowledgeable about negotiating simply because
they are lawyers! The sad truth is that most people who negotiate for a living
are untrained for that part of their endeavor.
Those people who want to understand more about the mechanics of negotiat-
ing often decide to take a course, buy a book, or read an article. But all too
often, the course, the book, or the article assumes that the reader already
knows the fundamentals. This book does not assume anything. I discuss each
of the six basic skills that you will use in every negotiation. If it relates to
negotiating, it’s in here somewhere.

The mission of this book is to help you to negotiate from strength.
Understanding the six basic skills used in every negotiation in which you
are involved transforms you into a confident and successful negotiator.
After you have mastered the six basic skills of negotiating and achieved this
position of strength, every tough situation you encounter becomes easier to
analyze and conquer.
Students who have attended my seminars tell me that they use my material
to get raises, to get promotions, and to close deals. They tell me how they use
the course materials to improve the quality of their office life by approaching
co-workers using negotiating techniques. One student wrote: “I don’t have to
yell anymore.”
Foolish Assumptions
This book is for you whether you are
 Beginning a career, or just looking to brush up your skills
 A pushover who never seems to get your way, or a master negotiator —
widely admired but constantly striving to improve
 Unemployed and want a job, or employed and want a raise
 A teacher searching for a way to get your students to do what you want
them to do, or a parent wanting to talk more convincingly with your 
children
 A team player who wants to have more input during negotiating sessions,
or a team leader going for a specific win in your next negotiation
About This Book
This book is not about tricks or one-upmanship. This book answers your
questions and gives you guidance by breaking negotiations down into their
basic elements. Call these elements skills, steps, basics, or whatever you like —
each has the potential to become your personal negotiating power tool.
I follow the theories of a championship sports camp. Think of the greatest
tennis player you have seen in your life. The strokes that this player uses are
the same strokes every beginning player learns: the serve, forehand, backhand,
overhand, and volley. The difference between the expert and the novice is
2
Negotiating For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

that the expert has used the basic strokes over and over — at the net, the
midcourt, and the baseline — with a friend or coach providing guidance.
Think of this book as your friend and coach, someone to go to when you have
a question about negotiating. Just like a tennis lesson, this book identifies
each basic skill and then demonstrates its use in every situation. If you prac-
tice these skills enough, you can become a world-class negotiator, turning the
basic strokes of a negotiation into winning power strokes.
Enjoy the books and movies mentioned throughout the book. In the seminars
that I teach, these materials generate genuine fun and lots of progress. And
don’t think you can only work on your negotiation skills in the workplace.
Involve your entire family in your growth as you develop the practical skills
that are at the core of every master negotiator’s success.
How This Book Is Organized
This book tackles two different negotiating skills in each part. I analyze and
evaluate each skill and provide many different ways to use it. A separate part
deals with the special challenges of cross-cultural and complex negotiations.
The final part includes top-ten lists to improve your overall negotiating style.
Part I: Preparing to Negotiate
Long before a negotiation begins, one of life’s most important questions faces
you: Why am I here? Do I really want to enter this negotiation? What are my
choices? Too many people let themselves be tossed around by life itself.
Take control. Your first negotiation is with yourself. Part I shows you how to
prepare yourself for a negotiation, figure out the other side, and put the nego-
tiation in context within the marketplace. All this preparation sounds like a
lot of work, but it’s the key to real power in any negotiation.
This part is also about drawing lines and setting goals. You need to set your
goals and define your limits before the actual negotiation begins. After you
know your goals and limits, you can decide on your opening offer. Your goals
and limits carry you right to the end of the negotiation, enabling you to
decide when to close a deal and when to walk away. The very process of set-
ting limits gives you power in a negotiation, because the process forces you
to focus on what else you will do if you fail to reach an agreement. I call that
your or else.
3
Introduction

Part II: Getting Your Point Across
This part covers the most underrated skill of all — listening. Most beginners
want to rush by this essential skill. They seriously underestimate its impor-
tance and submit to the many barriers to productive listening. Nonverbal
cues are also an important part of negotiating. Body language can be just as
expressive as the spoken word. In this part, I also examine what our bodies
say. The next time you walk into a meeting, pay close attention to a gesture, a
handshake, or a hug. They’re just as important as listening to what the other
party has to say.
The other side of the communication coin is speaking clearly. Because every-
body talks so much each day, becoming sloppy with this essential skill is
easy. Turn to Part II if you want to make each word count and make sure that
people hear you every time you speak.
Part III: Getting Past the 
Glitches to Close It Up
Ever notice how world-class negotiators always appear calm and focused?
This part tells you how to remain dispassionate throughout even the most
heated negotiation. Turn here to find out how emotions can influence and
upset a negotiation; then discover how to curtail your emotions using your
pause button. Like the pause button on your DVD player, this essential skill
enables you to freeze-frame the negotiation and take a break — a great way to
keep your emotional distance. Discover how to push the pause button at
every critical juncture during the negotiation to prevent emotional upset,
evaluate your progress, and decide whether to make the deal or to walk
away.
Closing the deal is the glory moment when everything comes together and
you bring closure to the negotiation. You either close the deal or choose to
end the discussion. Either way, a successful closure is the ultimate goal in
every negotiation. Just before you bring closure, step back and be sure that
you have a win-win situation. Closure is also a separate skill that you must
develop if you are to become successful in every negotiation you undertake.
Of course, all kinds of mishaps can keep a deal from closing. This part dis-
cusses those situations in which you feel you have done everything right, and
yet the deal still won’t close. First you must identify the glitch, and then you
can get past it.

Negotiating For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

Part IV: Conducting Cross-Cultural 
and Complex Negotiations
Preparing to negotiate in another country adds another dimension to your
preparation. In this part, I examine the tools you need to negotiate in foreign
lands. Study the language, culture, and modes of listening in other parts of
the world and you’ll be one step ahead of the game.
The differences between men and women continue to make negotiating
between the sexes a unique situation. This part has a separate chapter that
covers strategies to improve communication between men and women, thus
making us better negotiators.
What makes a negotiation complex? Flip to this section to understand the fac-
tors that convolute the negotiation process. Sometimes you’ll think the deal
is closed, but then the media wants to inform the public about the deal, or
the deal requires a vote of approval before closing. What happens if something
isn’t working and you need to renegotiate? Turn to this part to find out about
the intricacies of the renegotiation process.
The telephone and Internet have changed the way we communicate. The last
chapter in this part contains a lot of helpful hints and tips to follow when
negotiating over the telephone and Internet.
Part V: The Part of Tens
The parts leading up to The Part of Tens burrow into the individual skills you
need in every negotiation. The short chapters in this part cover ways to
strengthen your overall negotiation skills and put your negotiating skills to
work in daily life.
Icons Used in This Book
Check out the margins of this book and you find lots of little pictures. Cute,
aren’t they? These are icons to guide you to the information you crave.
Looking for a film that’s a good example of the negotiating process? In need
of a reminder before you walk into your next board meeting? Just scan the
pages for the appropriate icons.
5
Introduction

This icon points out a film that deals with some aspect of negotiating. You
can go online to buy all the films noted throughout the book, or you can rent
them at your local video store. Gather your friends, family, or co-workers to
watch the film and improve your negotiating skills.
This icon marks the dirty tricks sharks try to play on you. Don’t fall prey to
these pitfalls — and avoid using these nasty tactics yourself.
Just looking for the bottom line? This icon emphasizes information that you
should absolutely, positively keep in mind at all times if you want to be a suc-
cessful negotiator.
This icon denotes honest tricks of the trade, shortcuts, and loopholes. I’ve
stumbled across plenty of tips that you may want to have at your fingertips.
Look for these icons to save time, money, and face in your next negotiation.
Where to Go from Here
Look through the book to get an overview of the six essential skills you need
in every negotiation. Then find which part or chapter turns you on. That’s
the best place to begin.
Most people won’t start in the area in which they need the most help. They
usually choose their favorite area — the area about which they are confident.
That’s okay. Even your strongest area can get stronger. Then, as you shift
your focus to your weaker areas, you enjoy the greatest amount of progress.
The most important point to consider right now is that you’re already headed
toward the winner’s circle. The most successful people in life are those who
continue to grow. The fact that you have this book in your hand now puts you
into that realm. It’s not how much you know that counts, but how much you
are willing to add after you “know it all.”

Part I
Preparing to
Negotiate

In this part . . .
I
f you want to negotiate successfully, you must be 
prepared. Preparation doesn’t just mean reading up 
on your subject matter; it includes understanding the
person with whom you’ll be negotiating and being in
touch with your own strengths and limitations. You have
to do some soul-searching to determine your goals and
make your opening offer. Setting limits is a life skill that
comes into play in this process and puts you in charge 
of the negotiation. How to make all of these critical deci-
sions is the topic of this part.

Chapter 1
Negotiating for Life
In This Chapter
 Applying the six basic skills of negotiating
 Handling unique negotiations
N
egotiating is not a skill to take out once in a while when you have to make
a deal. Negotiating is a way to get what you want out of life. You negoti-
ate all day long, whether it’s with your co-workers, your spouse, or your kids.
No matter how large or small, how important or minor, how near or far, a
negotiation involves six basic skills. I explain these six skills in the first three
parts of this book. After you understand how you can use these skills in a
negotiation, you will use them every time you sit down at the negotiating
table.
If you think of negotiating as a sport, you can use this book as a manual to
improve your game. I briefly explain the necessary skills in this chapter and
then give you detailed instructions on how to improve each one of these
skills in subsequent chapters. So when you come across a skill you need to
or want to work on, just skip to the corresponding chapter or chapters.
For example, if you are a good listener, but need help in setting limits, read
Chapter 6. Maybe you want to be able to keep your emotional distance in a
negotiation. Chapter 12 can give you some pointers. Of course, you can
always read the book from cover to cover. Some people do that. But most
people read this chapter for an overview and then skip around the book.
As you read these chapters, you will see that you can take several steps,
large and small, to help you improve at these six skills. As your skills grow,
you will take charge of all the negotiations you face in your life. Even if your
dreams or your paycheck seem to hinge on forces beyond your control, you
can create a master plan for your life and achieve your dreams — one negoti-
ation at a time.

When Am I Negotiating?
Any time you ask someone to say yes or to do something for you or to get out
of the way so you can do it, you are negotiating. You negotiate all day long,
whether you realize it or not. You are negotiating when you
 Ask your boss for a salary increase
 Ask the cable guy for a more-specific time to show up at your house
 Try to hurry up the cable guy when he is late
 Decide to marry (This is a lifelong negotiation.)
 Try to enforce a curfew with your kids
Negotiating occurs in all aspects of life. It happens in your personal life 
(marriage, divorce, and parenting), in business, in government, and among
nations. For example, at the time of this writing, the United States is in heated
negotiations with the Untied Nations council to revise a U.N. resolution on
North Korea for conducting a nuclear test. The resolution may result in strict
sanctions against the North Koreans. So a negotiation can be on a global
scale or on a personal scale, such as “Honey, please put the seat down.”
If you’re attempting to resolve a dispute, agree on a course of action, or 
bargain for individual advantage, you are in a negotiation, like it or not.
The goal is to reach a resolution that is acceptable to you and that will work
for both parties. If that’s not possible, try to find such an agreement elsewhere.
The Six Basic Skills of Negotiating
The skills you need to be a successful negotiator in your everyday life are the
same skills powerful businesspeople use during major international and indus-
trial negotiations. Sure, you can refine these skills with additional techniques
and strategies, and you enhance them with your own style and personality.
But only these six skills are essential:
 Thorough preparation
 The ability to set limits and goals
 Good listening skills
 Clarity of communication
 Knowing how and when to push your pause button
 Knowing how to close a deal
10
Part I: Preparing to Negotiate 

These six skills are so important that everyone should have them on a chart
on their walls, just as every chemistry lab has the Periodic Table of the
Elements hanging on the wall. In fact, the six skills are listed on the tear-out
Cheat Sheet in the front of this book, so you can grab some tape and begin
the trend right now.
The six basic negotiating skills apply to all areas of life. They can empower
you to be happier and more successful in your life by helping you gain more
respect, reach better agreements with your business partners and family, and
maintain more control in your negotiations.
Prepare
Preparation is the bedrock of negotiation success. You cannot be overpre-
pared for a negotiation. Whether you are involved in a business or personal
negotiation, you must be thoroughly prepared to achieve your goals. Heck,
you have to be well prepared just to know what your goals are.
In any negotiation, you must prepare in three areas:
 Yourself
 The other person
 The market
Each one of these aspects deserves your attention. Pay special attention
to the first point because you are the most important person in the room.
The second item will change as your negotiations change. The third point
deserves your lifelong attention.
Prepare yourself
Preparing yourself for a negotiation means knowing yourself and what you
want out of life. This step takes some reflection and some planning. With ade-
quate preparation, you boost your confidence and your performance during
a negotiation. Know your strengths and weaknesses. For example, are you a
good listener, or do you ignore what other people have to say?
What is your life plan? In a perfect world, what will you be doing in three
years? This long-range thinking about your own life provides a context for
every negotiation you have. After you create a vision of your future, create a
plan that includes specific steps to turn your vision into reality. Your negotia-
tions are likely to go astray if you don’t prepare your personal, long-range
game plan before entering the negotiating room. Chapter 2 helps you figure
out your vision and develop steps to achieve what you want in life.
11
Chapter 1: Negotiating for Life

You also have to prepare yourself for specific negotiating situations. The better
you know your own needs, the more easily you can do this. For example, if
you’re not a morning person, don’t let someone schedule a conference call
for 7:30 in the morning. For more strategies on making the most of time and
places in a negotiation, check out Chapter 2.
Prepare for the other person
When you find out who you’ll be sitting across from at the negotiating table,
research that person. Knowing about the other person can help you build
rapport, and you can walk into a room with the comfort and knowledge of
having some background on your opponent. One of the most common
instances where you should do some research on other person is before a job
interview. Perhaps, you and your interviewer share a similar past experience.
When you show that you know a fact or two about the other person from
having done your research, you usually score points with the interviewer. In a
negotiation, showing that you’ve prepared for the other person also serves
as an ice-breaker before getting down to the nitty-gritty.
Besides these obvious social benefits, knowledge about the other person
lets you know what you’re up against. Is this person reasonable? Is this
person a bottom-line person, or is quality more important to him or her?
Knowing what the other person values helps you emphasize that aspect of
your proposal.
It is also important to determine the person’s level of authority. If the person
is going to have to get approval from folks several rungs up the organiza-
tional ladder, you know you’d better provide some written materials or your
proposal probably won’t be repeated accurately. You can get more insights
on figuring out your opposition in Chapter 3.
Prepare about the marketplace
Research your industry. It’s as simple as that. A car dealer knows best about
cars. A chemist knows best about chemistry. An art dealer knows best about
art. If you’re going to negotiate in a world that isn’t familiar to you, research
it. Know the players, know whom to talk to, study the terminology. Do what-
ever it takes to be the smartest guy or gal in the room.
You should definitely have your personal evaluation of everything being
negotiated. You should also have a good idea of how the other party values
whatever is being negotiated. Don’t be afraid to ask questions. You can even
ask such questions of the person you are negotiating with. Asking questions
shows the other party that you’re interested and willing to learn.
Be a constant student of the industry or business in which you work. People
who have a spent a lifetime with a company bring added value to the com-
pany simply because of all the information they have stored in their heads.
The more you know about the business environment in general and your
company in particular, the better off you are. In Chapter 3, I offer some 
12
Part I: Preparing to Negotiate 

suggestions on where to look for information about the marketplace and give
you some direction on handling things that can influence a negotiation.
Set goals and limits
The only way to achieve anything is to set goals. Sometimes your goal setting
can be quite subconscious. This triggers the impulse purchase. You see
something you want, you set your goal to acquire it, your hand goes out, you
grab it, and it’s yours. That is a familiar retail scenario. In the business situa-
tion, setting goals is a more-serious, labor-intensive process.
When setting goals, you need to have a brainstorming session where all the
possibilities are explored for any given negotiation. Then you have to pare
back your list so you have a manageable number of goals to work on. You don’t
want to overload any single negotiation with all your hopes and dreams for
all times. Go into a negotiation with an appropriate list of things to achieve.
Chapter 5 walks you through this process.
The easiest and fastest way to keep your goals in mind is to write them down.
This helps you visualize them and makes them real. Place them somewhere
where you will see them on a daily basis. After you’ve written down your
goals, ask yourself why your goals mean so much to you. Goals are led by
your inner desires. Let your intuition guide you toward achieving them.
Before starting your next negotiation, ask yourself this simple question:
“What do I want out of this negotiation?” Don’t be afraid to answer it. 
Talk it out. Write it down.
After you’ve nailed down your goals, you need to set limits. Setting your
limits simply means to determine the point at which you are willing to walk
away from this deal and close the deal elsewhere. For instance, you set limits
when you interview for a job by establishing the lowest salary you’ll accept.
Setting limits is a scary thing. It takes practice for some people, but if you
don’t do it, others will take and take and take as long as you keep giving.
At some point, you realize that you have given too much — a line has been
crossed — all because you did not set your limits ahead of time. If you find
this happening to you, read Chapter 6 for five steps to setting limits.
Listen
The vast majority of people think they are good listeners. Instead of gratify-
ing your ego with self-indulgent reassurance, take a survey to figure out if
you’re a good listener. Find out the true state of your listening skills from
objective evidence or those who will be brutally honest with you.
13
Chapter 1: Negotiating for Life

Learning to listen is one of the most important skills to develop when negoti-
ating. Before a negotiation, know the specific areas where you want to gather
information. Listen attentively during the meeting. Get the most information
you can, and you will have a successful negotiation.
Check your bad listening habits at the door. Always expect to find something
of value from the other person. The rewards of good listening skills are amaz-
ing. I cover ways to improve your listening skills and give you a few tips to be
sure that nothing stands in the way of you and good listening in Chapter 7.
Stated affirmatively, here are some tips for becoming a good listener: Clear
away the clutter in your office. Count to three before responding to a ques-
tion so that the question (or comment) can sink in. Keep notes. Be sure that
you are fully awake and present.
If you experience communication problems during a negotiation, it’s proba-
bly because you or the other party wasn’t listening.
Part of the listening process involves interaction between the two parties.
Don’t be afraid to ask questions as you gather your information. When you
ask questions, you refine the information you have received from the other
party. Questions are a real power tool, and I cover them in Chapter 8 in detail.
If you don’t get the information you want to receive, ask a follow-up question.
And never, ever interrupt someone who is trying to answer a question you
have asked.
Whatever you do, don’t accept any substitutes for the information you are
seeking. Some folks will try to dodge a question or make a strong general
statement instead of answering your specific question. If someone responds
to your question without answering it, ask it a little differently. But don’t let
them off the hook.
Be clear
When I say be clear, I mean be clear in what you say and what you do. This
sounds easier than it is. You must be sure that your actions, your body lan-
guage, your tone of voice, and your words all send the same message.
Are you as clear as you can be in your communications? You can rate yourself
or ask those you love and trust. A good negotiator is an excellent communi-
cator and understands how others think, feel, and function. But first, you
must start by analyzing yourself.
Here are some tips for being clear: Know your purpose in speaking and cut
the mumbo-jumbo. Keep all your commitments. If you say that you are going
to get back to someone at 10 a.m., be sure that you get back to them at 10 a.m.

In the rush of the workday, we often shortchange ourselves and others on
clarity. When you say one thing and do another, you may confuse people.
Good communicators are consistent communicators.

Chapter 1: Negotiating for Life
The six negotiating skills in one film
Dog Day Afternoon is probably the best single
film on negotiating that you can watch. Millions
have seen a very young Al Pacino and Charles
Durning turn in virtuoso performances as captor
and cop in this classic film. Based on the true
story of a bank robbery that turned into a hostage
situation, the film shows the local police team
trying hard to resolve the situation but fumbling a
bit. Then the FBI team moves quickly into action
and negotiates with skill and training. The events
were re-created with incredible accuracy.
Each of the six basic principles of negotiating is
clearly demonstrated in this film. Here is a friendly
guide through the negotiation without ruining
the film.
 Prepare: You’ll notice right away that the
robbers are unprepared for the hostage sit-
uation. They came to rob a bank, not to take
hostages. In fact, one of the team members
bails out immediately in a comic lesson
about the importance of building a solid
team that is fully prepared. Note how the
police immediately and throughout the film
try to gather information about the man
holding the hostages. They use all the
resources of the state to find out who they
are negotiating against. Within hours, the
cops find out things that shocked the man’s
mother and his wife.
 Set goals and limits: The police set limits
before they ever start talking. Their goal is to
get the hostages out safely. When a hostage
is hurt, they find out how the injury hap-
pened. If it was an accident, they continue
the negotiation. If it was an execution, they
make a frontal assault on the site. Through
it all, they never forget their goal, even though
they appear willing to do so as far as the
captors know.
 Listen and clarify communications: This is a
constant. Note in the barber shop that some-
one is always in the background wearing
headphones. That officer is monitoring all
the communications both ways to be sure
that they are clear. He does not speak, but
he is an integral member of the negotiating
team. Most audience members would not
notice. Also, note the body language of the
FBI agent when he first meets Pacino’s
character. The agent conveys authority and
confidence, unlike the local policemen.
 Push the pause button: The police have a
firm hold on the pause button. One officer’s
sole job is to observe everyone’s emotional
state. This officer keeps a check on emo-
tions and removes officers before the strain
of the situation overcomes them.
 Close: The authorities keep the goal con-
stantly in mind. Notice how many times the
police try to close this negotiation.
You can watch this film more than once. Each
time, you will notice something new about the
way the skills in this book apply to this type of
high-stakes negotiation. It is fun to note some-
thing new with each viewing.
You will notice that films are used throughout
the book to make a point. Dog Day Afternoon is
so instructive that it is shown at the FBI training
school for hostage negotiators in Quantico,
Virginia. I also screen it frequently in my three-day,
intensive negotiating courses for corporations.

When you become sensitive to being clear, you can start helping others. You
can tactfully bring the tangent people back to the point of the conversation and
subtly curb the interrupters. When you meet people who are unprepared, you
can educate them and bring them up to speed. You can get some pointers on
improving your clarity, as well as other’s clarity, in Chapter 11. (You’ll also find
some tongue-in-cheek methods to really foul up communications.) As you
master the six skills, you model them for others on your team and often to those
on the other side of the table. And the negotiation goes all the better for it.
16
Part I: Preparing to Negotiate 
Building a career in negotiation
I have always been interested in the elements of
successful persuasion, even before I thought of
organizing all the information under the umbrella
of negotiating. In college, I went to hear every
notable speaker who came to campus, from the
conservative Reverend Billy Graham to socialist
speakers trying to lean the campus to the left.
As editor of the school’s literary magazine, I
interviewed most of those individuals.
Right after graduation, I became a U.S. Marine
Corps officer with my own reconnaissance pla-
toon. I began studying the elements of leadership
because I knew that my leadership abilities could
mean someone’s life someday — maybe mine.
You probably don’t think that giving orders in the
Marine Corps has anything to do with negotia-
tion. Marine Corps officers do operate under
many preset limits. But I found that the better the
preparation (mostly in the form of good training)
and the clearer the orders, the better the troops
followed. Our little platoon was selected to be the
first Marine ground combat unit in Vietnam. We
shared our missions with a group of Navy Seals.
Careful negotiations within our unit and with the
Seals resulted in many successful missions.
I went to law school at the University of California
at Berkeley in the mid-1960s where I was stu-
dent body president. You better believe that job
required a lot of negotiating between those who
wanted to close the school down and those
who wanted nothing to do with the undergrad-
uate student strikes after graduation. I hung a
shingle in what was probably the most challeng-
ing facet of the law — entertainment law — in
what was probably the least compassionate
environment — Hollywood! I started without a
single entertainment client; all I had was my skill
in negotiating. At the time, very little was writ-
ten on the subject. No college I had attended
offered courses on negotiation. I continued my
self-study of the field. My knowledge paid off on
my first (and, at that time, only) entertainment
client, and he recommended me to another
person, and so on, and so on.
Since then, I have enjoyed great successes. I
have negotiated for and against some of the
biggest names in Hollywood and against every
single studio in town (in all their incarnations). I
negotiated every production deal for Michael
Landon during the most productive years of his
life. I still negotiate the use of the names and
likenesses of such Hollywood greats as Donna
Reed and Elizabeth Montgomery. Today, my
book Clearance and Copyright is used in more
than 50 film schools around the country.
For examples in the book, I draw primarily from
my law practice as a full-time negotiator in the
entertainment industry where I represent actors,
writers, directors, and independent producers in
their negotiations with studios, financiers, and
each other. In the text, I also use examples from
my family life as a father, grandfather, and part-
ner to one of the master negotiators of all time.

Push the pause button
Everyone has a pause button — a little device inside our heads that helps us
maintain emotional distance in a negotiation. Some use it more than others.
Others don’t use it all. The pause button can take many forms — it can be a
break during a heated negotiation, or it can be a moment of silence when you
don’t agree with someone’s argument.
When you use your pause button during a negotiation, you prevent yourself
from saying things you may later regret. Your pause button also allows you a
moment of reflection. When you don’t use your pause button, you may jump
into a deal too quickly because you didn’t spend enough time thinking about
your words and actions.
Never let your emotions take control of your actions. Figure out in advance
what sets you off. Identify your hot buttons. When you know what upsets
you, talk about it with others on your team so you and they are ready if this
kind of situation arises. We all have hot buttons, so we may as well deal with
them upfront. I talk more about the benefits of using the pause button and
ways to cool your hot buttons in Chapter 12.
If a negotiation looks to be headed south and talks are at a standstill, don’t
panic. Use your pause button. Think about the steps that got you to this
point. Instead of making outlandish demands or angrily storming out of the
negotiating room, take a breather and suggest meeting at a later time.
Closing the deal
Sometimes deals don’t seem to close even when the parties are more or less
in agreement on all the important issues. Sometimes this happens because
someone in the room is being difficult. This takes all forms. Maybe a person
is being a bully or trying to pull the wool over your eyes. Maybe someone is
disrupting the proceedings by yelling or being bossy. Pushing past these
problems involves pushing the pause button — hard. Take breaks as often as
necessary so everyone has a chance to regroup. You are not the only person
in the room who is affected by these people, and Chapter 13 can help you
deal with people who make negotiations unnecessarily difficult.
Sometime deals get hung up because of the other side’s tactics. You probably
can list them as well as anyone: a constant change of position, playing good
cop/bad cop, having to check with an invisible partner. I cover these behaviors
and other disruptive actions in Chapter 15. When you run into one of these
behaviors, push the pause button. When you’re on a break, analyze your
opponent’s tactics, and when you return to the negotiating table, ask specific
questions of the other side. Listen carefully to get around the obstruction.
17
Chapter 1: Negotiating for Life

Closing is the culmination of the negotiation process, which I focus on in
Chapter 14. It’s the point where everything comes together, when two parties
mutually agree on the terms of the deal. But how soon is too soon to close?
The answer: It’s never too soon to close. You want to start closing as quickly
and efficiently as possible — under reasonable parameters, of course. You
don’t have to close the whole deal right away. You can close a piece of it by
agreeing tentatively and moving on to other issues.
Closing the deal isn’t always a smooth process. Sometimes you are dealing
with someone who fears making a bad deal or is afraid of his or her boss who
never likes a result no matter how good it is and how hard everyone worked.
Again, ask a lot of questions to find out what is going on, and then help this
person with his or her problem.
A good negotiator is often just someone who helps the other side under-
stand all the good points of his or her proposal and gives the other person
the tools and arguments to sell the proposal to whoever needs to be sold.
Handling All Sorts of Negotiations
You can apply the six basic skills to every negotiation, no matter what. But
some of the negotiations you’ll encounter may seem beyond the scope of
these skills. Trust me, they aren’t. You simply have to remain focused on the
six skills.
Negotiating is like tennis. You have to serve the ball whether you are playing
a rank amateur or in the finals at Wimbledon. Like the backhand and fore-
hand shots in tennis, your negotiating skills stay with you no matter what
court you are on or who your opponent is.
Negotiations can become complex for any number of reasons, and male-
female negotiations often have an element of complexity to them. And as the
world seems to grow smaller and move faster, you’re likely to face interna-
tional negotiations and negotiations that take place over the telephone and
Internet.
When negotiations get complicated
In simple negotiations, you can apply the six basic skills without too much
trouble. But what happens when a negotiation gets complicated? Complex
negotiations happen when the negotiation becomes larger in scope, and the
amount of work and organization requires more than two people (one on each
side of the negotiating table) can handle alone. When the negotiation shifts
from a two-person affair to a 20-person affair, the negotiation is complicated.
18
Part I: Preparing to Negotiate 

On a personal level, a negotiation becomes complicated when you invest all
your emotion and effort into getting the deal closed. For example, a salary
negotiation, although simple in theory, carries a lot of emotional weight
behind it.
No matter the size and factors involved in the negotiation, the six basic skills
serve as your core to making the negotiation a success.
Complicated negotiations often involve multiple issues, multiple parties, han-
dling the media, and other fun factors. I expand on these further in Chapter 18.
International negotiations
International negotiation (or cross-cultural negotiation) is one of many special-
ized areas in the world of negotiating. The six basic skills are just as critical, if
not more critical, in international negotiations as they are when you’re nego-
tiating on home turf. International deals require more preparation because
you have to tailor your negotiating approach to the customs of the country
you’re negotiating in.
Preparing for cross-cultural negotiating requires more than just under-
standing how foreigners close a deal. You have to know the differences in
communication, their attitude toward conflict, how they complete tasks, their
decision-making processes, and how they disclose information. Even the
body language in other countries is very different from what we’re accus-
tomed to in the United States. Eye contact, personal space, and touch vary
among countries. Chapter 16 has more points to consider and advice for
making international negotiations less stressful.
Research the country’s traditions before walking into a negotiating room on
foreign soil. Watch foreign language films, read travel guides, and learn key
phrases in your counterpart’s language during the preparation process. Bridge
the communication gap as much as possible. When you start behaving like a
native, you’ll earn the respect and confidence of your foreign counterpart.
Negotiations between men and women
Communication between the sexes is much different now than it was during
our grandparents’ time. For one, women are now leaders in large businesses
and politics, two worlds once dominated solely by men. As we begin the 21st
century, the communication gap between men and women has slowly nar-
rowed, but not completely. Fundamental differences still separate the two
sexes. In Chapter 17, I discuss the different communication styles between
men and women.
19
Chapter 1: Negotiating for Life

Negotiation on the phone 
and via the Internet
We’re riding on the information superhighway and never looking back.
The landscape of communication has changed dramatically, thanks to the
telephone and the Internet. These forms of telecommunication have made
communication faster and sometimes simpler. More importantly, they’ve cre-
ated a new mode of negotiating. You can now negotiate from the comfort of
your own home, in a car while driving to your office, or from a different part
of the world.
Negotiating via the telephone and Internet requires the same preparation and
etiquette as a face-to-face negotiation. The only difference is that the negotia-
tion happens at the lift of a headset or the push of a button. Although simpler,
using the telephone or Internet to negotiate is not as good as negotiating in
person. You miss the human interaction, the body language, and the gestures
that are so important in gauging others when negotiating in a room. For more
on telephone and Internet-based negotiations, see Chapter 19.

Part I: Preparing to Negotiate 
Giving people tools to enhance their lives
For years, I have been teaching negotiating
courses at universities and for private clients
across the country and in Europe and Asia. Good
negotiating skills translate into good working
relationships with employees, clients, vendors,
and customers. The ever-challenging task of
managing people entails delegating tasks, which
means empowering people to get results for
which you are ultimately responsible. Managers
engage in these negotiations every day. All of
us must negotiate in one way or another.
Included in most of the courses I teach is a nod
to gender differences. This material builds on
the work of Mimi Donaldson, who was the co-
author of the first edition of Negotiating For
Dummies. I give people tools to communicate
and negotiate with the opposite sex at home
and at work. Now with women gaining power
and position, the language of power is no longer
gender based. Role models are no longer just
male; they are also female.
I have always taught men and women to nego-
tiate fairly and appropriately. You can get what
you need and want, and build relationships in
the process. You may have to risk upsetting
someone for the moment. You may have to risk
not being liked by everyone all the time. That
comes with achieving results. You always have
to choose between comfortable safety and risk-
ing discomfort to go for what you want. I use
these principles as the basis for my courses in
negotiation.

f the most important negotiating skill is preparation, then the most impor-
tant thing to prepare is yourself. You must know what you want and don’t
want in your business and personal life to effectively complete every negotia-
tion you encounter. Negotiating is not a skill you take out once in a while when
you have to make a deal. Negotiating is a way to get what you want out of life.
Many people blame a lack of negotiating skills for not getting what they want,
but that’s only part of the answer.
People must also do some long-range thinking about their own lives. When
you think about the direction your life is headed, you can see the big picture.
Without the big picture, you run the risk of getting involved in a negotiation
that doesn’t contribute one bit to where you want to be in three or four
years. That’s a recipe for obtaining a result that makes you unhappy — not
because you didn’t negotiate well, but because the result doesn’t move you
along in the direction you want to go.
To use your negotiating skills most effectively, you require a master plan.
Think of the master plan as a strategy for achieving your hopes and dreams.
Everyone should have a master plan; it gives you a choice about where you
are on the train of life. You can either sit in the engine driving the train, or
you can hang on for dear life off the back of the caboose.

Several steps, large and small, can help you take charge of all the negotia-
tions you face in your life. Even if you currently think that you could never
take control of certain areas of your life, challenge yourself to entertain the
possibility. Consider actors, who do a great deal of waiting. Think of some
employees who regard their roles as reactive and not proactive, whose job
descriptions entail responding to someone else’s needs. The fact that your
dreams or your paycheck seem to hinge on forces beyond your control
shouldn’t stop you from creating a master plan for your life. Create a vision
statement and an action plan.
After you have the big picture well in hand, you need to prepare physically
and mentally for specific negotiations. This chapter helps with those tasks
that are so important for each negotiation that awaits you.
Creating Your Vision
Most corporations and businesses have a mission or vision statement. The
U.S. Army’s old adage is “Be all that you can be.” Employers often distribute
their statement to employees at every level. They post it on their Web sites,
display it on prominent bulletin boards, and print it in various company pub-
lications. Every employee is expected to know this statement. Ask those
same employees whether they have a vision statement for their own lives
and careers, and far too often the answer is no.
If you want to have the best personal life and a successful career, you need to
think about your goals. The good life, no matter how you define it, doesn’t
just happen. You need to set an agenda for both your short- and long-term
goals. Think of your life as a negotiation. The better prepared you are, the
smoother the negotiation is likely to go. Even a little planning is more than
most people do, so making a small effort now puts you far ahead of the pack.
The first step in creating a master plan for yourself is to identify your vision.
A vision is an image of a desired future. The word vision is from the Latin
videre, meaning to see. You should state your vision by describing, in present
tense, a picture of the future you see for yourself. Your vision should be as
rich in detail and as visual as possible. The description must be clear, under-
standable, and descriptive. Most important, your vision needs to motivate
you. You count on your vision to give your life shape and direction. Here are
some vision statements. I know that the first three have worked very well.
 Nordstrom: “To become America’s store of choice through the commit-
ment of each employee to provide customers the very best in quality,
value, selection, and service.”
 Microsoft: “Someday we’ll see a computer on every desk and in 
every home.”
22
Part I: Preparing to Negotiate 

 My law office: “To help my clients realize their dreams.”
 Young businessman: “To climb up the corporate ladder in an honest and
professional way.”
In his book Think and Grow Rich, Napoleon Hill states that 98 percent of
people are in their current jobs because of indecision — they never decided
what they wanted to do in their lives in the first place. That failure to form a
vision of what the future looks like explains why so many people feel that
they may have a life purpose, but they have no idea what that life purpose is.
Forget about the money, this is just a very unfortunate way to spend your life.
It’s important to go through the process of evaluating your vision statement
each year. In the past, I assessed my vision verbally. Today, I make sure to
write my vision down. Keeping a written record creates better accountability.
Your vision is a long-term, ongoing, open-ended process. When you read your
vision statement, it motivates you to passionately seek to achieve your goals.
Envisioning your future
People who write down their vision of the future are much more likely to live
in that dream world someday. The first step to help you think about and
achieve your dreams is to write them down. This handy guide is provided to
make it easy for you to do that. Sit down by yourself or with your spouse or
partner and quietly start to picture your future.
When you picture your future, don’t be bound up by your past or what other
people tell you or the negatives that have been fed to you over time. You
have to think long and deep and wide. You have to think outside the box.
In fact, the puzzle that gave rise to the phrase “think outside the box” is one
of my favorites. Here it is. Place nine dots on a sheet of paper (three rows of
three dots). Without lifting your pencil, draw four straight, connected lines
through all nine dots. Give it a try in Figure 2-1.
Figure 2-1:
The nine-
dots puzzle.
23
Chapter 2: Knowing What You Want and Preparing to Get It

Go through each dot once. Keep at it. If you get frustrated, relax and let your
imagination flow. Think outside the box. Play with it. The answer is at the end
of this section.
Think outside the box as you answer the following questions. They will help
you create your ideal picture of the future, so try not to be bound by the con-
straints of convention. Just as you did in solving the above puzzle, relax and
let your imagination flow.
After you have constructed this vision with a good deal of specificity, you are
on your way. Every negotiation will be conducted with your own long-range
goals in mind. Every decision you make will take this vision into account.

Chapter 2: Knowing What You Want and Preparing to Get It

The above list of questions leads you to your vision statement. With luck 
and enough quiet time, you can develop a very clear concept of your future.
Then, you will be able to commit to your own future. Creating your vision
statement requires you to think outside the box, as they say.
Looking at Figure 2-2, you can easily see why solving this puzzle is called
“thinking outside the box.” Now when someone tells you to think “outside 
the box” or “beyond the nine dots,” you’ll know where the phrase comes
from. Take the exercise one step further. How can you cover all nine dots
with a single straight line?
Answer: Use a paintbrush!
If you really want a vision statement that fits you personally, use the same
kind of mind-set in creating your vision as you do in solving puzzles and rid-
dles such as this one. Be open to all the alternatives. Don’t limit your thinking
to the obvious answers. Enjoy exploring all the possibilities as you decide
exactly what you want to achieve over the next three years.
Making a commitment
Sure, you have an idea of what a commitment is: a binding obligation, a
pledge, or a promise. But do you really know how to make and keep a 
commitment?
Figure 2-2:
The solution
to the nine-
dots puzzle.
26
Part I: Preparing to Negotiate 

People want to commit, but they lack the stuff to carry through with that
desire. For example, people who say they want to be thin may really want to
be thin. However, they don’t exercise, and they keep eating too much of the
wrong things. They don’t want to be thin badly enough to commit to the
steps they need to follow to get thin. The truth is, they wish that they wanted
to be thin badly enough to commit to it. The first step is to commit. You must
be so committed to your vision that you will do the hard work necessary to
get where you want to go.
Look at what you wrote in the previous exercise (in the section called
“Creating your vision”). Now write out the purpose you see for your life. 
This is your vision statement. Make sure that what you write inspires you.

What are the key words for you?

_______________________________________________________________
How does it strike your senses? If it’s not quite bull’s-eye, change it.

Chapter 2: Knowing What You Want and Preparing to Get It

Identifying your values
Your values are the principles and standards you live by. They define how
you regard others, and how you expect to behave toward the people with
whom you interact. Figuratively speaking, values define both where you want
to go and how you expect to travel.
Values also define your limits: the boundaries of behavior you will not cross
and that you will not allow others to cross in their dealings with you (see
Chapter 6 for more about setting limits). The clearer you are with your
values, the more you understand what you cherish. Then, making choices
about your goals becomes easier. To be a good negotiator, you must be able
to look into your own eyes in the mirror every morning and know you are
living up to your own standards. Values, goals, and limits are tightly con-
nected to each other.
28
Part I: Preparing to Negotiate 
Upping the stakes
Here’s my definition of commitment:
If you don’t achieve your objective, someone
will cut off your hand.
This definition sounds harsh. It is harsh. It draws
a gasp at seminars. I never use it unless some-
one starts blaming others for something when,
in fact, the problem would be solved by a little
higher commitment from the person doing the
complaining.
For instance, one participant insisted she had
done all the right things, and the “other guy”
was consistently late on a report due to her
every Thursday by 5 p.m. The “other guy,” in this
case, was a co-worker in another department
of her company, and she depended on his infor-
mation. When asked what she did about the late
report, she said, “Well, I call him Friday morning
and really chastise him for not turning in the
report.” She was someone who prefers to have
reasons for not getting a job done rather than
doing whatever it takes to get it done.
That’s when I stated my definition of commit-
ment and asked her, “What if your hand is cut
off at 5:01 on Thursday if you don’t have the
report from him?” Her demeanor changed. The
good solutions flew fast and furious. “I might tell
him that the report was due Wednesday. Not
only would I tell him it was due Wednesday, but
I would probably be a lot nicer to him. I would
probably want to know who was in charge of
the material for his report in case he died before
5 on Thursday. I would visit his office, ask about
his kids, and make sure that the material for my
report is in a fireproof filing cabinet.”
If the stakes are high enough, you will change
your behavior, even if it means taking extra
steps — that’s commitment. Even with the
people who seem most impossible, you can get
what you want if you are committed to getting
results.

Deciding How You Are Going 
to Achieve Your Vision
Having a vision and knowing your values is great, but you need to know how
you’re going to get where you want to go. You have to set a path for yourself
so you can eventually live in that picture you have created for yourself.
Note how values come into play in the business world. Small and large 
companies are specific when translating their missions into action. Think 
of the values (those things that are treated with importance and respect)
affirmed by companies like McDonald’s or Blockbuster. Both respect family
values. The fast-food chain’s mascot is a cheerful and colorful clown, and the
restaurants have play areas. The food chain is fast, clean, and brightly lit. It
caters to youngsters. Unlike many other movie-rental stores, Blockbuster
doesn’t have an adult-movie section. This feature has made Blockbuster a
safe place for parents to send their kids to pick up movies. Both companies
demonstrate their commitment to their corporate vision and values through
their action plan.
Internet service companies have also incorporated values into their business
models. All major Internet services now provide parental control blockers.
These devices help parents keep their children safe from Web sites that they
consider questionable while their kids surf the Internet.
The three-year plan
To negotiate effectively, you need to know why you are engaged in the negoti-
ation in the first place. Three-year plans are an excellent tool for planning
your personal and professional life. They are brief enough to follow through
on, and they are specific enough to move you toward meeting your vision.
Maybe three years from now you won’t achieve everything you planned for,
but if you don’t give any thought to what you want to accomplish over the
next three years, you don’t stand a chance of attaining much of anything.
Most people who aren’t happy with their lives and what they accomplished
during the last five or ten years never bothered to look forward and develop
a plan for that time period. Don’t let that happen to you. Make a three-year
plan and then make sure that your negotiations contribute to achieving 
that plan.

Chapter 2: Knowing What You Want and Preparing to Get It

Think big
Step one in achieving great results is to think big. In every aspect of a specific
negotiation and in planning your life, think big. You can always scale back
later. This is your life. When the next year goes by, it will be gone. You don’t
get to do it over again. So take off the ball and chain; don’t let your life be
shackled by small thoughts. You can never get more out of life than you
choose to.
Think bold
In addition to thinking big, you need to think bold. When your vision seems
very distant — when the road seems all uphill — you have to be very cre-
ative. Try tackling the problem in a different way to reach a solution. The
problem of figuring out how to make your vision become a reality is really 
an opportunity.
For all the horrible “B” films that director Edward D. Wood Jr. produced, his
bravado is worth noting. Watch Tim Burton’s Ed Wood, starring Johnny Depp
as the infamous director. Wood is consistently voted the worst director of all
time. Burton’s film traces Wood’s undying optimism to get the films made.
Studios refused to finance or distribute his films, but Wood persevered. He
thought bold. He rounded up every resource possible and got his films made,
despite their minuscule budgets. Ed Wood carried out his vision and trans-
formed his goal into a reality.
Think in sound bites
Refrain from using catch words and phrases during life planning. A life plan
ought to be more tailored and personal, and some phrases act as strong
guideposts. I use these phrases to help explain some complicated concepts
in my seminars and lectures. Here are a few of my favorite tips for life plan-
ning. These phrases are offered after people have established their vision
statements and before action plans are designed.
 The tyranny of “or”: As people make life plans, they often ask themselves
whether they want this or that. Try to use the word and. The word or is
limiting. The word and is expansive. Frequently, finances require that
people choose between desired purchases. When you make a life plan,
however, include everything you want in life. You only get one chance to
live this life. Live it free of the tyranny of or.
 The banishment of “just”: Whatever you do in life, do it well and with
pride. Never again say, “I am just a housewife” or “I am just a baker” or “I
am just . . .” Banish the word just as an adjective to describe you or your
life’s work. After you have established your vision, never diminish it with
a just.
30
Part I: Preparing to Negotiate 

 The law of parsimony: Although you have times when you want to lend 
a helping hand to the whole world, you have limited time in your life. You
can’t help everybody. Only help the people who can use your help. Those
are not necessarily people who need your help. Needy people sometimes
distract you from your life purpose. Your job is to keep a steely eye on
those goals you want to achieve for yourself and your family.
Putting your plan into action
After you are clear about your vision and you take steps to achieve that
vision, create your action plan. Your action plan includes the specific tasks
you need to do, whom you need to help you do them, and when you need to
get each step done. Action plans make you more efficient and effective. They
enable you to anticipate needs, potential problems, and the time necessary
for each step. The process of creating an action plan brings to light any
potential obstacles that you may encounter in completing the steps. Then
you can be clear about what you need to do to overcome these obstacles.
Here’s a recommendation for creating your action plan:
1. Prioritize each of your goals.
Think of your action plan like a meeting agenda. Some goals will carry
more weight than others. For instance, maybe buying a house and
adopting a pet are part of your three-year plan. Buying a house will 
probably require more planning and longer discussion than adopting 
a pet, so finding your new home would take a higher priority.
2. List the action steps required for you to accomplish each goal.
After you’ve prioritized your goals, determine what you need to do to
carefully execute each goal. Include as many details as you can think of.
3. Identify people you need to support you to achieve each action step.
If it’s a family-oriented goal, such as moving homes, you probably want to
involve the whole family. In a business-related goal, involve those who will
be an asset to the process. When taking steps to achieve a goal, time is of
the essence. Don’t let someone with a hidden agenda stifle your plan.
4. Identify potential obstacles to each of the action steps.
Pause when you identify an obstacle and figure out the best way to over-
come it. Solving a problem early in the process saves you the time and
hassle of dealing with a potential disaster down the road.
5. Estimate the completion date for each of the action steps.
Creating a timeline helps you methodically complete tasks by certain
dates. Trying to achieve too much at once can often muddle the goal-
setting process.

Preparing Yourself for Negotiation
You are the most important single element in this negotiation. Even if you are
the most junior person in the room, your performance at the negotiation is
more important to you and your future than any agenda or seating arrange-
ment. Do not shortchange yourself. Keep your confidence up. This just may
be the moment that helps you climb the executive ladder. Take a moment to
check on yourself, leaving other arrangements for later. This concern for self
is an important investment that pays off handsomely. This is your moment to
shine (even if you must shine in silence).
32
Part I: Preparing to Negotiate 
Look at the big picture to figure out the details
At a negotiation seminar in Palm Springs,
California, a questioner with an annoyed look on
her face raised her hand while I was in the
middle of selling the idea of a three-year plan.
“I came here because I wanted to negotiate the
purchase of my next car. I’ve been unhappy with
my last two purchases. Will you be addressing
practical things like that?”
“I just did,” was my immediate response. The
woman was nonplussed. “I’m sorry, I guess I
missed it,” she said, sounding annoyed. Suspect-
ing she hadn’t missed a word, I asked her what
kind of car she was thinking of buying.
“I’m not sure,” was her predictable reply. I then
asked her a series of questions about her life
and where it was going. I asked her how soon
she was planning to retire, whether she was
staying at her present job, how far she drives to
work, and what community activities she was
involved in.
The answers defined the cars that would fit her
needs within four or five models, two or three
years of manufacture, and even the fact that
she needed a subdued color. She became very
excited and felt that she had already saved
weeks of shopping and agonizing. My point
about reflecting on your own life before you
enter any specific negotiation was so well made
by this exchange that some in the audience
thought that my conversation with the woman
was preplanned.
She realized that her unhappiness with her pre-
vious purchases was because she had been
buying cars without thinking about her own life
and what she would be doing with the car. That
point seems so rudimentary to most people that
they don’t even realize the lesson: Consider your
needs so every negotiation fits into your life in a
positive way. If the negotiation doesn’t fit, walk
away. It’s so simple. Yet people often forget that
simple step. They leave themselves out of the
picture and then wonder why things don’t turn
out better for them.

A is for Alert
To negotiate at your best, you must be well rested and alert. If the negotiation
is early in the morning, make sure you eat breakfast. If you feel stressed, do
an early-morning workout or meditate. A well-rested and stress-free mind is
an alert mind. And when you are alert
 Your concentration and ability to listen improve.
 You’re more likely to be quick-witted and able to respond to questions
or attacks.
 You won’t rush to tie things up so you can get home or get to bed.
Your performance at any negotiation is aided by a good night’s sleep.
Sometimes getting that sleep is easier said than done. If you find yourself
thinking about a negotiation just when you want to go to sleep, try this trick:
Pull out a pad and jot down your thoughts. Keep going until you have cleaned
out your mind. More often than not, this simple exercise enables you to doze
off and secure some much-needed sleep. If you still can’t get to sleep after
writing down your thoughts, at least you have a crib sheet to help your 
sleep-deprived mind get through the negotiating session.
Dressing for success
During the 1980s, two books had considerable impact on what people wore in
order to get power and respect. These books, geared toward the professional,
have a much wider application if you read between the lines. The first book,
Dress for Success by John T. Molloy, chauvinistically addressed only men. The
book’s popularity led to a sequel, The Woman’s Dress for Success Book. Both
are valuable, if dated, aids for young executives. The theory of both books is
to look at the boss in order to look like the boss.

Chapter 2: Knowing What You Want and Preparing to Get It
Traveling smart
When I was younger, I always took the red-eye
from Los Angeles to New York, and I set my first
negotiation session for a 7:30 a.m. breakfast. I
now prefer to have some time to go to my hotel,
shower and freshen up, and gather my thoughts
for a 10:00 a.m. meeting. I attribute that chang-
ing preference to wisdom, not age. If you can’t
get enough rest on an airplane to function well
the next day, travel the day before. Don’t be
frugal when it comes to long-distance travel.
When traveling outside the United States to
negotiate, I always insist on one and preferably
two days to get over jet lag. For some reason,
going to Asia is less stressful on my body, and I
can be ready more quickly. If possible, I never
change planes on a business trip.

The startling response to Molloy’s books was that, all through the 1980s,
droves of young female professionals began wearing dark blue suits, white
silk blouses, and big red bows at the neck. Perhaps they were helping them-
selves up the ladder of success, but the necessity (or perceived necessity)
for ambitious young women to transform their appearance to break into the
good old boys’ club is distressing.
Today, dress styles in the workplace vary widely depending on the type of
business. In the entertainment industry, for instance, dress styles tend to be
more casual. Visit any animation studio and you will see folks dressed as if
they were attending an afternoon barbeque. But there is always a time and
place for everything. Clothing styles for the workplace continue to evolve.
Some companies still require business attire, others don’t. The point is to
dress for the occasion. If you’re attending an important meeting, you obvi-
ously want to look your best to be taken seriously and be respected.
I once met with a writer who came into my office to pitch a story idea. He
wore a T-shirt, jeans, and flip-flops. My immediate impression was one of 
laziness. I assumed that his pitch would be as jumbled as his attire. I was
right. The pitch wasn’t well thought out. It was carefree and meandering. 
This is not the impression you want to give the next time you approach the
negotiation table.
When I give a lecture or workshop, I always wear a tie. Even in places like
super-hot Singapore or super-casual Cannes, France, I wear a tie. I also
always wear lace shoes. Neither one of these is a requirement. It’s what I 
do to make myself feel comfortable and confident. Probably nobody would
notice if I wore loafers. But I would know. I would feel that I had been disre-
spectful to my audience.
Here is a less restrictive and simpler recommendation: Don’t dress to 
distract. You are in a negotiation. You want people to listen, and you need
their eyes as well as their ears. Here are a few things to keep in mind:
 Women, you pull the eye away from your face if you wear dangling 
earrings or expose any cleavage.
 Men, you improve no business environment anywhere with gold chains
or a sport shirt open to reveal massive amounts of that remarkable chest.
Although this attire may get you attention wherever you like to stop off after
work, it doesn’t contribute one bit to your negotiating position while you are
at work.
If a particular type of outfit works for you on vacation or at a party, more
power to you. But don’t confuse those casual social environments (which
may include a bit of negotiating in the course of an evening) with the negoti-
ating environment of the business world.
34
Part I: Preparing to Negotiate 

Of course, every rule has an exception. See the film Erin Brockovich for such
an example. In the film, Erin, played by Julia Roberts, is hired as a secretary
at a small law firm. She dresses in short skirts, revealing blouses, and stiletto
heels. Her co-workers don’t take her seriously. Little do they know Erin is
extremely driven and smart. Her wardrobe becomes second nature as the
film progresses. She begins to investigate a suspicious real estate case involv-
ing Pacific Gas & Electric Company, which leads her to become the point
person in one of the biggest class action lawsuits in American history against
a multibillion dollar corporation. All this despite her risqué wardrobe.
Mirror your environment as you prepare yourself for your first negotiating 
session. For example, don’t wear a three-piece suit to a place where all the
employees, including the executives, wear jeans and polo shirts to work.
Respectfully absorb that which is around you. Sink into the surroundings.
Become a part of them.
Some negotiators take this tip beyond the way they dress. For instance, some
negotiators even adapt to the pace of the speech. In New York, where people
tend to talk fast, good negotiators speed up their pace a bit; in the South,
where people tend to talk slowly, good negotiators slow it down a few
notches. Above all, know that good manners are different from place to place.
Walking through the door 
No matter how sleep-deprived, harried, or down-in-the-dumps you may be,
always enter the negotiating room with assertiveness. Establish confidence
and control from the opening moment. That moment sets a tone for the
entire meeting. This fact is true even if you are not officially in charge of the
meeting. These guidelines can vault the most junior person at a meeting to
MVP status almost immediately.
Never forget the pleasantries. If the last negotiating session ended on a bad
note, clear that away first. Otherwise, you run the risk that unrelated matters
may ignite the controversy all over again. If you can resolve the situation up
front, you can move forward unfettered. Ignoring such a situation just leaves
the ill-will hovering over the negotiating table. I call it the “elephant in the
room.” The bad feelings creep into and influence every conversation. The
negativity taints all the proceedings until it has been cleared away.
As your hand is on the door of the negotiating room or as you dial the phone
number of your counterpart, put on your attitude. Take a beat and lift your-
self up to the occasion. Grandmother was right — “Anything worth doing is
worth doing well.” Toss your head back — literally. Smile, inside and out.
Focus on your immediate purposes. Have your right hand free to shake hands
with whoever is there. If the meeting requires you to wear one of those awful
name badges, be sure to write your name in large letters and place the badge
high on your right side so people can easily read it.
35
Chapter 2: Knowing What You Want and Preparing to Get It

Improving your attitude just before the session begins can be one of the most
valuable moments you spend in a negotiation. 
Here are some tips in case you are in charge of the meeting:
 Make sure that all participants are present and ready to listen. If
someone is missing, you face the first dilemma of a meeting leader: 
to start or not to start the meeting. Follow your gut and the culture 
in which you are operating. If you are always prompt and you have a 
roomful of folks whose time is valuable (whose isn’t?), proceed and 
educate the laggard later. If the missing person is the boss, well, again,
the culture is important. Some bosses would be annoyed that you held
the meeting for them.
 State your purpose for having the meeting. This is like the opening
paragraph of a term paper. If there is not a written agenda, outline the
important points you will discuss. Knowing what is going to happen
helps keep everyone focused.
 If there is a written agenda, be sure everyone has one and take a
moment to review it. Put time restraints on each agenda item. Doing so
keeps you from lingering on a subject longer than expected and not
giving enough time to others.
 Make a clear request for agreement on the agenda and procedure.
Gauge how the other party feels about your agenda. This is an important
step on the road to closing a deal. This is your chance to build empathy
and start things off with something on which everyone is in agreement.
 Acknowledge the participants’ attitudes and feelings as they relate to
your purpose. Your objective is to close the deal. To do this, you need to
establish empathy from the beginning of the meeting.
 Begin according to the agenda. If you deviate from your plan at the
beginning of the meeting, you will have a very hard time gaining control
later on.
You’ve opened the meeting and presented your agenda. You’ve taken the first
step into the negotiation process. Breathe.
Leaving enough time
Deciding how much time to allocate for a negotiation session or for the entire
negotiation is always a tricky matter because you aren’t in control of the other
side. If you want to have the negotiation over by a certain time, say so right up
front. If a good reason exists for your desire, state that also. Leaving more time
36
Part I: Preparing to Negotiate 

than you actually need for a negotiating session is always better than allocat-
ing too little time. You can always use the extra time for something else if you
have overestimated the time that a negotiating session will take.
Defining Your Space
People often spend very little time considering the best environment for
negotiating, or they rely on rules that make arranging a time and place diffi-
cult. For example, when both sides consider it necessary to negotiate in their
own office, getting things started is impossible.
If your position is low on the corporate ladder and you feel you have no con-
trol over the details of the negotiating environment, giving this issue some
consideration is even more important. For example, you may think that the
location in which you negotiate for a raise may already be set. Read on. The
material covered in this section can help you make even your boss’s office a
more-receptive negotiating environment.
Negotiating on your home turf
Your own office often provides a powerful advantage because it is your home
turf. It’s your operational base. You have all the information needed at your
hands. You have a support staff, should you need their expertise or assis-
tance. Your comfort level is going to be at its highest in that environment.
The home turf is so important to the Grundig Pump Company of Fresno,
California, that it built a series of guestrooms right at its factory and hired 
a staff to look after visitors. You can see the plant, negotiate the deal, and
never worry about accommodations, meals, or anything else while you are 
in town. Grundig set up an ideal negotiating environment. The visitor is freed
from the shackles of travel arrangements and home office interruptions. This
setup represents the epitome of the oft-stated rule “always negotiate on your
home turf.”
Beware! Negotiating on your home turf is not always best. Often you are
better off in the other person’s office. The more time you spend on the other
skills covered in this book, the less important it is whether you are in your
office or someone else’s. Sometimes meeting in the other party’s office is
actually better for you. If your opponent in a negotiation always claims to be
missing some document back at the office, meeting there could avoid that
particular evasion. Sometimes bulky, hard-to-transport documents are criti-
cal to a negotiation. In that event, the best site for negotiation is wherever
those documents happen to be.
37
Chapter 2: Knowing What You Want and Preparing to Get It

Visiting the other person’s office always gives you a lot of information about
that person. A quick glance around the office tells you a lot about the
person’s interests, usually something about his family situation, whether she
is neat or messy, what his taste is in furnishings, and often, just how busy she
really is. You usually can tell something about the person’s place in the peck-
ing order of the business. Is her office close to the more-powerful people in
the organization or a fur piece away? How much of the coveted window space
does he have? The information you glean from visiting the other person’s
office allows you to know the person better. And the better you know and
understand the other person, the easier it is for you to relate to them. You
can never know too much about the person you are facing in a negotiation.
The most important consideration is to be in a place, physically and mentally,
where you can listen. Be emphatic on this issue — both for your sake and for
the sake of the person with whom you negotiate. If you cannot concentrate on
what the other person is saying, you cannot negotiate. It’s impossible.
Seating with purpose
Seating arrangements may seem like a silly subject to you if you’ve never
thought about it before. Sometimes the importance of seating can be 
overemphasized — but not often. Definitely do not leave seating to chance, 
in spite of the number of people who seem willing to do so. Where you sit
during a negotiation can have a big impact on how well you function during 
a negotiation.
Here are some seating tips:
 Sit next to the person with whom you need to consult quickly and pri-
vately. This person is your confidant. You don’t want that person sitting
across the table and off-center, where you will need to use hand signals
and glances to communicate.
 Sit opposite the person with whom you have the most conflict. For
example, if you are the leader of your negotiating team, sit opposite the
leader of the other negotiating team. If you want to soften the confronta-
tional effect, you can be off-center by a chair or two. If the shape of the
table or room gives you the opportunity to be on an adjacent, rather than
opposite, side to your opponent, you can lessen the confrontational
approach.
 Consider who should be closest to the door and who should be closest
to the phone. If you expect to use a speaker phone or to have people
huddling outside the negotiating room, these positions can be positions
of power. The person nearest the phone generally controls its use. The
person nearest the door can control physical access to the room.
38
Part I: Preparing to Negotiate 

 Windows and the angle of the sun are important considerations, espe-
cially if the situation generates heat or glare. Again, stay within your
comfort zone. If the room feels physically uncomfortable, kindly suggest
a different room.
Now about the negotiation of prime interest to most readers: asking for a
raise. Usually that conversation takes place in your boss’s office. Avoid the
seat where you normally sit to receive assignments. If your boss has a con-
versation area, try to move there for the discussion about your raise. Sofas
are the great equalizers. If your boss is firmly planted behind the desk, do
two things:
 Stay standing for a beat or two at the beginning of your presentation, but
not after you are invited to sit down. Speaking on your feet is a display
of uncompromised self-confidence.
 When you sit down, move your chair to the side of the desk — or at least
out of its regular position. You want to make the statement that this is a
different conversation than the normal routine of your boss assigning
you a task.
Try to avoid being lower than your boss when you talk about your compensa-
tion. Whenever you can, try be on the same eye level with the person you are
negotiating with, even if you normally take direction from that person.
Planning the environment far in advance
If your company is building a new space, get involved in planning the room
where most of the negotiating occurs. Fight hard to make it the right size,
near the restrooms, and near some areas that can be used for break-out 
sessions. Everyone has a tendency — during these days when money is 
hemorrhaging all over the place — to cut back on the negotiating space
because “we don’t use it that much” or “we can make do with less.”
All this is true. However, if you consider how important selling is to your com-
pany, or negotiating major deals to your law firm, or closing a transaction to
your bank or real estate business, you cannot overrate the value of this space.
This location is where you really make money. It is where the deals are made
that are at the heart of your business. Don’t “do with less” in your negotiating
space unless you are willing to “do with less” in your negotiation. Scale down
offices if you have to, but don’t scale down your negotiation space.
The next time your company designs new office space, look around at great
negotiating spaces. You don’t need a huge budget, but you do need to keep in
mind some basic needs. A good negotiating space is more than a huge confer-
ence table with marble top. In fact, the marble top can be a bit formal for
39

most negotiations. In my law office, we have break-out rooms nearby, great
cross ventilation, and a work station that can be turned toward the confer-
ence area. Everything is at our fingertips. The area was designed by Marni
Belsome, who took into consideration these tips about good negotiating
space. You can see a sketch of the conference room in Figure 2-3. For less
formal occasions, I furnished my office with a sofa, love seat, and two chairs
surrounding a large, low coffee table.

Mapping the Opposition
In This Chapter
 Researching the negotiator
 Determining the level of authority
 Understanding who’s the boss
 Discovering the opposition’s interests
T
he most common mistake made by folks who are getting ready to negoti-
ate is failing to learn all they can about the person with whom they are
negotiating. You may be negotiating with the largest corporation in the world,
but you’ll be in a room (or on the phone or on the Internet) with an individual
representative of that corporation. Find out all you can about that person.
Obviously, you want to know the name and title of that person. If you will be
negotiating with more than one person, you’ll want to know the names and
titles of everyone on the team. You can easily find out the negotiator’s name
just by asking him or her, if no one has bothered to tell you. Usually, you will
be handed a card. If not, I also say something like, “I want to put all your
information in my address book. What is your correct title?” And from the
negotiator’s name and title, you can tell a lot. For example:
 Position: A person’s title usually tells you a lot about where the person
stands in the organization’s pecking order.
 Lifestyle: A person’s name, which you can look up in a number of
sources, including your local phone book, can lead you to personal
information, such as the
• Neighborhood the person lives in
• Church the person may attend
• Schools the person’s children attend
• Areas where the person may shop

These details can give you insights into the individual and certainly
something to talk about — which doesn’t obligate you to talk about
them. When you find out about sensitive material, exercise discretion.
The exception would be if you discovered something which, if true,
would cause you to pull out of the deal. In that case, you would 
want to clear the matter up early and discreetly, rather than waste a
lot of time with someone with whom you aren’t going to do business
anyway.
The amount of time and energy you put into this kind of preparation reflects
how important the negotiation is to you. Or to the other side. If you find out
that the person you’re negotiating with is the president of the company, you
know right away that this negotiation is important to the other side, so you
may be inclined to take it more seriously. Perhaps the president is looking
you over for other business, or the ramifications of the deal are greater than
you had initially thought.
But much more important than what you discover from the name and title,
you want to know a few other things:
 What is the negotiator’s authority?
 Who is his or her client?
 What interests are driving this negotiation for the other side?
These are three key questions that you need to answer in order to know
about the person who will be sitting across the negotiating table from you.
Answering these questions is an essential step to success in the negotiation.
Negotiators who fail to ask these questions are so common that, when you
pursue the answers yourself, you will not only be more successful in the
negotiation, but you will often leave the negotiation having made yourself a
friend of the negotiator sitting on the other side of the table.
Identifying the Person Conducting 
the Negotiation
Usually, you already know the name of the individual with whom you’ll be
negotiating. If you’re negotiating with a large company, however, you may not
know the name of the particular person (or people) who will be in the room
with you. Ask. Ask whomever you are dealing with. But ask. Ask before you
get there. It’s good manners. It’s good negotiating.
42
Part I: Preparing to Negotiate 

After you know the negotiator’s name, find out as much as you can about the
individual or individuals who will be in the room. You probably already have
a good idea about how to research an individual — use the search engine
Google (www.google.com). The results are usually awesome.
But suppose that you’re dealing with someone who hasn’t risen to Google
status. Not everyone has a bio on the Internet. Humpf. Right away you know
that this person isn’t so scary after all. The corporation may be huge, but if
you can’t find the individual person you’ll be negotiating with on the Internet,
well, how scary can he or she be?
Don’t assume that the person won’t be a tough negotiator because he or she
is far down the totem pole. Sometimes those at the bottom of the corporate
ladder are the very toughest to deal with. They often have less flexibility than
someone higher up and often are trying hard on every level to show the boss
how worthy they are of a promotion.
Ask friends who have dealt with this person what they can tell you about him
or her. Ask acquaintances. Ask the person who is setting up the meeting. Ask
competitors with whom you have a relationship if they know anything about
the person you’ll be negotiating with. Make a cold call if you have to, but ask.
Find out all you can about the person. If you meet in their office, note the pic-
tures, hobbies, interests, and art that are in the room. The more you know
about the person, the smoother your talks with them will go.

Negotiating on film
The importance of learning all you can about the
person you’re negotiating with can’t be overes-
timated. It’s so important that the FBI shows the
movie Dog Day Afternoon at its academy in
Quantico, Virginia, during its hostage-negotiation
training course for police officers. The movie
doesn’t show the FBI gathering this information,
but it clearly demonstrates how fast its officers
gather information about the person they’re
negotiating with and how they use that infor-
mation in their negotiations.
The film is a very accurate rendition of a true
story. The FBI had to buy time. One of its impor-
tant techniques is to prolong the negotiation
while waiting for an opportunity to develop to
free the hostages. In Dog Day Afternoon, FBI
officers use the wife and a boyfriend to draw
out the negotiation. The FBI brought the power
of national, state, and local governments
together to learn this information quickly. You
and I don’t have those resources, so it takes us
longer to find out everything we want to know.
You’ll see all the skills that I talk about in this
chapter demonstrated in this film. I recommend
it to you at this point because it’s such a stun-
ning example of researching your opposite
number and then using that information to your
advantage.

Filling Out the Information Checklist
In this section, I provide a checklist of information that includes a wide vari-
ety of details that are nice to know about your opposite number. The items
are organized around different topics. You don’t want or need to find out all
these things at the same time, but you want to have this information as
quickly as possible. You can photocopy the following form and keep it in the
project file. The more completely you fill it in, the more valuable it is. I hand
out this checklist in all of my negotiating seminars, and I frequently hear back
from participants many months after they attend a seminar. They tell me
that keeping track of this kind of information has made negotiating easier
and has allowed them to forge better relationships with the people they do
business with.
Everyone has some special piece of information that they like to obtain.
For some, it’s the church that the other person attends. For others, that 
subject is forbidden territory. What follows is the basic information that is
always helpful and everyone wants to know in an ideal situation. But few situ-
ations in life are ideal. So fill out what you can and add to it every time you
talk to the person on the other side of the negotiating table. You’ll find that
your knowledge changes your relationship with the other person for the better,
and it will produce better results in your negotiations with that person. I keep
these notes in a special private place in the file. I am not wild about people
knowing how much propping up my memory needs. More importantly, I would
not want to offend anybody who didn’t like me “keeping a file on them.”

The Taking of Pelham One Two Three
The movie The Taking of Pelham One Two Three
shows an extreme example of the potentially
disastrous impact of not knowing whom you are
negotiating with. The title refers to a train
hijacking in New York. The Metropolitan Transit
Agency is totally unprepared for this event, and
it doesn’t know enough to find out whom it’s
dealing with or how to slow things down. In this
case, disastrous is an understatement.
Because the film so clearly demonstrates the
importance of finding out whom you are negotiat-
ing with, the FBI academy in Quantico, Virginia,
shows it during the training course in which police
officers learn how to negotiate with hostage-
takers. The film didn’t do very well at the box office
when it first came out, but today it’s a top-renting
title. You’ll enjoy the film, but don’t feel too smug.
We all fall short in this area from time to time.

After you find out the information you need for the checklist, tuck it away

Updating your checklist is particularly important when you negotiate with
someone whom you think you know pretty well. When a well-trained salesman
visits your office, the conversation usually starts with a pleasant exchange,
an inquiry about the family, or questions about other people in the organiza-
tion. This exchange of pleasantries is the last-minute update of information
that a skilled salesperson does almost instinctively.

Part I: Preparing to Negotiate 

Determining the Negotiator’s 
Level of Authority
Finding out how much authority the negotiator has is a critical piece of infor-
mation to obtain very early in the process. The last thing you want to do is to
make a deal, shake hands, and then have the person say, “I’ll get back to you
in a week.” If you know ahead of time the limits of the negotiator’s authority,
you can handle matters differently. For example:
 Present some of your information in writing so the person has a doc-
ument to add to the presentation they will make to the ultimate 
decision maker. Then information they present is more in line with
your presentation.
 Be willing to accept a slightly lesser deal within the authority of your
opposite number rather than delay matters while higher approval is
obtained.
The easiest and most comfortable way to find out how much authority some-
one has is just to inquire at the top of the first negotiating session. “Do you
have to check with anyone else in order to close this deal?” is a comfortable
way of asking.
Some people like to hide the limits of their authority and act as though
they have sole decision-making power when, in fact, they have to get the
approval of a lot of other, more-important people before they can act. In large
organizations, the limits of authority are generally pretty well spelled out,
so you can find out pretty specifically what the other person’s authority is.
But you have to ask. It’s worth the effort to keep probing on this subject until
you know.
Keep in mind that the limits on authority can be about a lot of things other
than just the dollar limit that can be negotiated. Limits on authority can
cover any aspect of the deal. Anything that commits another department or
an affiliated company almost always involves getting approval from that
other department or company. In a large corporation, even people with a
great deal of authority to enter business agreements can’t alter the corporate
policy on whether disputes are settled by arbitration or litigation. That deci-
sion is made in the legal department for the entire corporation. So you want
to find out the limits to authority that are important to you and to closing the
particular deal that you’re working on.

You don’t need magic to find a sympathetic ear
David Copperfield is the most popular, best-known
magician in the world today. One of the illusions
that put him on the map was making the Statue of
Liberty disappear in 1984 on network television.
A live audience was sitting just a few yards from
the statue as David performed this stunning feat.
The importance of the event to David and his
career was immediately apparent. Unfortunately,
the director of the Statute of Liberty hated any-
thing that smacked of a commercial use of the
monument. He told David that he would not
permit him on the island to perform the illusion.
After David called me in to help, I did some
research and discovered that the director’s
reluctance was a routine problem with this par-
ticular national monument. I knew that estab-
lished guidelines and fees exist for using all
national monuments in film and television pro-
jects. The solution was simply to identify a
receptive individual who was senior enough to
make a decision stick.
Fortunately, the secretary of the interior thought
that Copperfield’s proposal was a smashing
idea, and he authorized the event. The illusion
was one of the most impressive of Copperfield’s
distinguished career.
Getting through to the secretary of the interior
may seem like a magical feat on the order of
some of David Copperfield’s illusions. From my
ego’s point of view, I may enjoy leaving that
impression. However, the truth is that getting
approval was the result of lots of old-fashioned
hard work.
First, I obtained an organizational chart of the
Department of Interior and the Parks Department
with a simple call to my local congressperson’s
office. The chart showed who reported to whom
all the way up to the Cabinet level.
My next step was to discover the decision
maker’s willingness to override the director of
the Statute of Liberty monument. So I needed a
preliminary, delicate conversation before I ever
put the question of David’s request on the table.
I felt that this dictated my personal contact
rather than an intermediary. In other words, I
was unable to use any political friends to inter-
cede. I had to make the call personally.
The task was simply to make a series of tedious
phone calls. I started each call by identifying
myself. Then I explained who David was and
what he wanted to accomplish. These were all
cold calls; I talked to whomever answered the
phone. At some point in the conversation I
would be interrupted and referred to someone
else. I had a lot of partial conversations in the
process of finding the right person.
I decided to start at the top and work down. By
cold-calling first the White House and then the
Department of the Interior, and schmoozing with
staff members over two weeks, I learned a great
deal about the viewing tastes of various offi-
cials, including President Reagan and his wife.
Finally, a staff member of the secretary of the
interior responded so enthusiastically that I was
able to obtain a general letter of endorsement
over the secretary’s signature without ever
speaking directly with the secretary himself.
After that, getting permission for the illusion
was merely a matter of processing the paper-
work through regular channels.

Finding the Negotiator’s Key Client
Whom does the negotiator consider as his client? Knowing this fact is a key
bit of information that you need to understand before you negotiate. If you
know the answer to this question, you’ll unlock the secrets to success for many
a tricky negotiation, but never assume that you know the answer. First, let me
make clear what I mean by the question, which is based on this assumption:
Everyone has to answer to someone — or at least they feel they must.
Aiming to please
If you can figure out your opposite’s key client, you’ll be able to make a deal
with this person much more easily because you can actually help your oppo-
site move up in her organization. After you know the person or people whom
your negotiating partner wants to please, you can study those people so you
know what your opposite number is up against. You may also be able to put
in a good word for her.
Let me walk you through an obvious situation. You’re negotiating with some-
one from an organization. Whom does this person (the negotiator) need to
please? Who gives this person her annual performance review? The person
your negotiator has to please may not be the person who has to approve this
particular deal. He or she may not be the person with whom your opposite
number has the most direct contact. When I say client, I’m referring to the
person whom your opposite number needs or wants to please.
No matter how much power your opposite number has, negotiating with you
is just the first step of the process. Your counterpart must take the result of
the negotiation to somebody (as do you), and you both want that somebody
to be pleased.
Making it personal
When you’re buying a used car from a neighbor, you may think that the neigh-
bor doesn’t have a client in the sense that I’m using the word here. But your
neighbor wants to make his wife proud of him when he goes home. In this
example, the wife is your neighbor’s client, the person whom your opposite
number has to please.
49
Chapter 3: Mapping the Opposition

In other words, a very personal issue always lurks in the background of every
negotiation. You and I and your business partners and your friends and every-
one else in the world have someone whom we want to make proud, from
whom we want a pat on the back, to whom we have to answer. When you
know who that person is and something about him or her, you’re way ahead
in helping the person on the other side of the table present the results of the
negotiation in the best possible light. Many a time I have made a friend for life
and preserved a favorable result by suggesting ways to present the results of
our negotiation to that special person.
A quick aside: When negotiating with your teenager, many parents often are
frustrated because the teenager truly believes that he or she shouldn’t have
to answer to anybody. This attitude sets them temporarily adrift, without the
social anchors that you worked so hard to lay all around them. You have no
one to go to and nowhere to turn to find an ally because your teen is listening
to no one, except perhaps some other teens whom you’re not all that enthusi-
astic about to begin with. This lack of a “client” is one of the things that makes
negotiating with teenagers so difficult. Forget about negotiating specifics
when this happens. Lay your frustrations aside and try to tether that teen
somewhere, anywhere, before he or she drifts out to sea.

Even the boss answers to someone
Recently, I represented the lead actor on a hit
television series that ran six years. He wasn’t
happy with the story lines for his character and
had a lot of ideas about future stories for his char-
acter. Like so many shows, the series was being
shot in Toronto, Canada (substituting for a U.S.
city, of course). He knew that he needed to talk to
the big boss — not the writers or the lead writers
or even the producer — but the boss over all of
them, who was the executive producer. He met
with the executive producer and felt that they
had had a very productive meeting, but a month
later, he was very frustrated. Nothing that they
had talked about had happened. He felt ignored.
The guys at the very top hadn’t listened to him.
I told him that those guys looked like they were
in complete control because that’s the way they
wanted it to look, but they had to answer to the
executive in charge of the production back in
Los Angeles. My client was ready to get on a
plane to L.A. Not so fast, I counseled. The exec-
utive in charge of production had a boss — the
network president — and that boss had his own
clients: He listened to the audience and to
advertisers. My young actor client got the pic-
ture and began doing more publicity and
schmoozing with the advertisers at the net-
work’s annual meeting held in New York, where
they wined and dined all the advertisers. Pretty
soon, all his ideas materialized, his role on the
show was expanded, and he was a happy
camper. He had won favor with the real clients,
and that had a greater impact than the wonder-
ful arguments he had made to the person who
everybody else thought had all the power. Yes,
Virginia, every boss has a boss somewhere!

When you want to make an ally out of the person across the table, find out
who the real client is and figure out how to make that person happy. Part of
your job is to make your counterpart’s job easier. Do that, and you’ll come
away with a better result and someone who actually may feel indebted to you.
Focusing on the Negotiator’s Interests
When I talk about interests, I don’t mean things such as baseball (not that
it’s a bad interest and can’t make a difference in a negotiating session once in
a while). I’m talking about the person’s negotiating interests. You want to know
what that person is interested in getting out of the negotiation. It’s almost
always more than money. (If you’re buying a used car from an individual,
money may be the only consideration, but that’s about the only time it is.)
I can’t think of a negotiation of any importance that does not have issues
other than money attached to it, and often these issues are more important
than money, especially to the person across the table or to that person’s
main client.
For example, if you find out that the negotiator had a bad experience with
your company’s delivery, quality, or communication, you had better believe
that these issues will be important in this negotiation, even though the
person on the other side of the table may be reluctant to bring them up.
You also need to be alert to the possibility that the interests of the person
whom you’re negotiating with and the person whom he has to please are a
bit different. The person you’re negotiating with may receive his bonus based
on some cost-saving formula. His boss may be focused on timely delivery.
Be sure you find out all you can about the boss/client so you meet the needs
of both the negotiator and his client.
Recognizing faults that can trip you up
People use three statements when a negotiation goes badly because they
failed to find out something negative about the person whom they nego-
tiated with.
 “Nobody told me!”
 “Who knew?”
 “I wish I woulda known!”
51
Chapter 3: Mapping the Opposition

Never say those words again. When you use these phrases, you’re missing a
good opportunity to learn an important lesson: Get to know the person
you’re negotiating with before you make a deal with them. If a negotiation
goes sour because you got into a deal with someone who was unethical or
dishonest, you should say:
 “I screwed up. I didn’t investigate enough.”
or
 “I saw some signs and I ignored them.”
Failing to find out enough about the person with whom you’re negotiating is
the most common mistake people make in the preparation phase of a negotia-
tion. In fact, people repeat that oversight every day all across the country
when making the largest purchase of their lives: the purchase of their own
family home.
Preparing is essential, even 
if it’s someone you know
When it comes to gathering information about the other party, every day is
different. Don’t assume that you can begin any negotiation without special
preparation, no matter how well you know the person. When a seasoned 
purchasing agent sees a regular salesperson, the purchasing agent often
opens the conversation by saying, “What’s going on with you these days?”
Pleasantry or preparation?
A neighbor who’s about to ask you to stop parking in front of her house begins
by saying, “Hi. How is the family doing today?” Pleasantry or preparation?
After Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans, even the least skilled negotiator first
asked how the person on the other side had fared in the storm. No one pressed
for resolution of matters until housing and offices returned to some normalcy.
Even if such questions have been a pleasantry for you in the past, start making
them part of your preparation and treating the person according to the answer.
I have actually put off a negotiation if the person sounded stressed out or
confessed to being under a deadline. It’s good manners. It’s good negotiating.

Knowing the Marketplace
In This Chapter
 Preparing to research the marketplace
 Adding resources to your research
 Following your passion through research
 Getting specific about your next negotiation
R
esearching the marketplace is where most people begin and end their
preparation for a negotiation. That’s why I always talk about this part of
preparation last in my seminars. Many people don’t think enough about their
own goals when starting a negotiation, and even more fail to research the
opposing party in a negotiation. But everyone senses that they ought to know
about the subject of the negotiation. Some of us have that inclination better
than others. I define the marketplace as your line of business — the working
world that you’re operating in. Know that world and know it well. It will help
your next negotiation go smoothly.
This chapter makes some subtle distinctions and leads to some familiar, and
not so familiar, places to find the information you need.
Gathering Information: The One 
with the Most Knowledge Wins
Some people think that power comes from size, gruffness, or clout, but the
easiest and most effective single thing you can do to increase your power is
to prepare. You may be facing the greatest negotiator in the world, but if
you’re prepared, and the greatest negotiator isn’t, you have the upper hand.
Yet people routinely shortchange themselves when it comes to preparation.
Even experienced negotiators often sacrifice solid preparation on the altar
of self-confidence or a crushing time schedule. Some negotiators don’t fully
appreciate the value of spending the extra time and effort on thorough 
preparation. To others, preparing just feels like drudge work.

Preparation doesn’t have to be dull. Preparing for a negotiation can trigger
the same type of excitement experienced when preparing for a military scout-
ing mission. Your palms may not sweat, but the rush is similar. You’re about
to head into the unknown. The outcome is uncertain. Pulling together data is
like girding your loins, checking your ammo, becoming secure, and getting
ready. Prepare as though you are going into battle.
Browsing the Internet
Browsing the Internet is perhaps the easiest and fastest way to research the
marketplace because the Internet is a giant warehouse of information on any
topic you can imagine. The list of reliable search engines continues to grow
and improve as technology evolves. If you visit the Web sites for search
engines Google, Yahoo!, and Ask.com (to name just a few), or use Wikipedia
to research various topics, you’ll discover that nearly any information you
need is at your fingertips. Make it a habit to visit any or all of these Web sites
before entering a negotiation. Remember, knowledge puts you a step ahead of
the game.
But don’t believe everything you read on the Internet just because it’s sitting
there in black and white. Anybody can put anything up on the Internet to be
read by the world. Check your sources carefully. Information from the Internet
is not like the information you find in a book from a reputable publisher in
which editors have pored over every sentence for clarity and accuracy. Blogs
in particular require scrutiny because most of them present the unabashed
opinion of the author. Many sites are sponsored by commercial entities
whose sole and undeniable aim is to change your mind about something or
sell you something, and if the best way to do that is to leave out some essen-
tial facts, so be it. That being said, the Internet is a mighty awesome source
of information.
But no one source is perfect for providing answers to everything. If the
Internet doesn’t help you find the information that you need, the following
sections discuss other resources that very well may.
Visiting the library
The library is one of the most underused negotiating resources in your 
community. Reintroducing yourself to this great institution can be a blast.
The library has all sorts of resources you can use to find the value of various
goods or services. Of course, the Internet has sharply decreased everyone’s
visits to the library, but it remains a good source for hard-to-find periodicals
and research materials.
54
Part I: Preparing to Negotiate 

When you go to the library, don’t be afraid to ask for help. Librarians are among
the most helpful people in the world, and most city libraries designate a staff
person to assist in research.
Shopping the competition
Don’t hesitate to do your own research. Rather than read about what is happen-
ing in the marketplace, pound the pavement for the information. A firsthand
look can be a real eye-opener. Suppose that you’re planning to purchase an
apartment building. You may want to play the role of a prospective renter
before ever offering to become an owner of the entire building. Walk through
the neighborhood, visiting other apartment buildings. In an hour, you can
become the world’s leading expert on the price and availability of apartments
in that block or two. Talk with tenants in the building you’re planning to buy.
That approach always produces more reliable information than talking with
the owner or the owner’s representative.
Whether you are buying or selling, a shopping trip is one of the best ways to
educate yourself about price, availability, and quality considerations. I’m not
talking about buying — just shopping. Frankly, this is the only kind of shop-
ping I really enjoy. The more we know, the better we feel.
Don’t forget to make notes during your shopping expedition. You’ll be 
gathering a great deal of new information. You may remember most of it; but
without good notes, you won’t remember where you got the different pieces
of information.
Asking questions
Even after a negotiation gets under way, you can continue your preparation
by asking your counterpart questions. Some people are reluctant to ask ques-
tions because they’re afraid of appearing dumb. This is false pride at its most
expensive. You’re flying blind without accurate information. You can’t worsen
your position by requesting information from your counterpart. Your job is to
get a good outcome — not to impress the seller. If you have unanswered
questions, ask. Chapter 8 covers the importance of questions in more detail
and can show you how to ask good ones. Check it out.
Keep in mind that the answer you receive to your question during a negotia-
tion may or may not be accurate. Always accept it with respect . . . and then
check it out for yourself. You have an obligation to be sure that any informa-
tion you are relying on is, indeed, reliable.
55
Chapter 4: Knowing the Marketplace

What if you’re out of your element? Don’t try to hide your lack of expertise.
If you’re dealing with someone who is really knowledgeable in a field, and
you’re not so experienced, honesty — once again — turns out to be the best
policy. Eventually, the differential will surface. It’s better to reveal your inex-
perience yourself, and then you can ask all the questions necessary and
request additional time to research the topic.
You don’t have to make a deal until you are ready. Closing a deal is a voluntary
act. Get your information from anyone you can — including the opposition.
The more your counterpart wants to reach an agreement, the more quickly
you will receive the data you need to make your decision.
Reading insider reports
Take time to find out what the people in the business pay for the goods or
services you want to buy or sell. This strategy can save you a fortune over
the course of your life. Don’t rely on what friends tell you, although they may
provide good hints and direction. Go to the people who tell the merchants
what to charge. Go to the source the insiders use.
No matter what the subject, someone has devoted a lifetime of work to evalu-
ating and commenting on it. This is just a fact of modern life. Nothing is too
arcane to study, dissect, catalog, and chronicle. Often, you find out about
these insider reports from someone trying to convince you of just what a
great deal you are getting.
 For automobile dealers, the bible is called the Kelley Blue Book Auto
Market Report.
 The cost of money for almost anything (home mortgages and interest
paid on savings accounts or car loans) is printed regularly in The Wall
Street Journal.
 In the entertainment industry, the daily periodicals Variety and The
Hollywood Reporter announce script sales, weekend box office numbers,
new production entities, and executive shuffles.
 Prices of gold and other basic metals are printed in the Sunday editions
of most major metropolitan newspapers.
Consulting Consumer Reports
Consumer Reports is an old stand-by, but worth looking into when shopping
for consumer goods. Don’t overlook this valuable source of information when
you buy any kind of product. From microwaves to mortgages, Consumer Reports
has tested, rated, valued, and devalued a wide range of products and services.
Why reinvent the wheel?
56
Part I: Preparing to Negotiate 

You can now order specific articles from Consumer Reports by going to 
consumerreports.org. There is a small monthly subscription fee, but
it sure beats having to rummage through back issues of the magazines.
After you get into the system, the service is very efficient.
Playing Detective and Evaluating Info
When you begin the actual dialogue, make sure that you know more about
the subject matter than does the person with whom you’re negotiating.
You aren’t arming yourself with this information so you can be a showoff or
so you can put the other person down or to make the other person feel infe-
rior. It’s to make you the authority figure in the room. Don’t rush it. Let all
your preparation come out naturally and with as many specifics as possible.
Think of your favorite teacher you had in school — the one with patience and
the ability to explain ideas clearly. That’s how you want to deliver the infor-
mation that you have stored up for this meeting.
Also, if you’re really knowledgeable and someone says something that you
have never heard before (and you suspect is not true), it carries a lot
more meaning when you say, “Hmm, I haven’t heard that before. Let me
check into it.” If you, with all your knowledge, haven’t heard of something,
maybe it isn’t true. You won’t have to say anything. Everyone will fill in the
blanks for you.
All organizations, big or small, have information available to you whether it is
via the Internet, in print, or through word-of-mouth. You impress the person
on the other side of the table when you walk into a room with all the knowl-
edge at your fingertips. Sometimes, I hear people say that they overprepared
for a certain negotiation. That’s never true. The fact that you had information
that didn’t come out of your mouth doesn’t mean that you overprepared.
All that preparation made you confident. You were unafraid of any question.
You had it all in your head, and it served a purpose, even if the purpose was
never put into words in the actual negotiating session. The negotiator with
the most information wins!
Rob Reiner’s A Few Good Men is a film about playing detective and preparing
for the ultimate negotiation — in this case a courtroom battle between a 
disgruntled lawyer played by Tom Cruise and an evil military commander,
played by Jack Nicholson. Watch Cruise’s character and his team plan and
strategize their courtroom argument. The preparation is intricate, the team
knowing well that the defense will put up a tough fight. The story is based on
fact, where a Marine at the Guantanamo Naval Air Station in Cuba dies after

well prepared with information about the commander’s notorious history,
they win the case. Digging for information is hard work, but the payoff can
be rewarding.
Solving the mystery of value
Some types of preparation seem almost instinctive to many people. Every family
seems to have a designated researcher. If preparation know-how doesn’t come
naturally to you or your family, try to make a game of it. If you are entering a
negotiation to buy or sell a product or service, pretend that you’re solving
a mystery — the mystery of value. What is the product or service worth?
Forget about the asking price — what is it really worth?
Begin with these two important facts:
 Value is always in the eye of the beholder. When you finish with your
research, only you can conclude the ultimate value a service or product
holds for you. You’re the one who will be spending (or receiving) your
money. You must decide.
 From diamonds to dime stores, experts compile price surveys and put
out a report on what various items are fetching in the marketplace.
These publications are how insiders know what’s going on in the world.
Whether you’re buying a hotel or a holiday in a hotel, you can find insider
information on the price of the purchase.
Don’t forget that values change over time. One important thing for you to
decide, if you are a purchaser, is how long you’re going to keep the item you
are buying. The longer you plan to keep your purchase, the longer it needs to
hold its value. Information about normal depreciation is as available as infor-
mation on current value — usually in the same place. Knowing the rate of
depreciation for an item is certainly just as important as knowing its current
value.
As you gather information, be sure to keep good notes. You can’t expect to
keep all the facts you gather in your head. Good notes are easy to make as
you go and can be invaluable as negotiations progress. Usually, one or two
kinds of negotiation recur in your business. For those recurring negotiations,
you may want to keep a separate notebook with the information you gather.
For example, if you are a service provider or a consultant, your time is your
inventory. You may have a set fee (or fee range) depending on how much
time you spend and how far away the contract takes you from your home
base. (Remember: You usually can’t charge for jet lag recovery time, but you
expend your time nevertheless.) Keeping accurate notes can help you deter-
mine whether your fee structure is adequate or whether you need to demand
more during future negotiations.
58
Part I: Preparing to Negotiate 

Recognizing agendas: The source 
shades the results
As you gather information about the negotiation you are about to enter,
remember that everybody has an agenda. Everybody. If agenda sounds like too
strong a word — or if it sounds somewhat pejorative — let’s say that every-
one has a point of view. No human is without bias. It’s the way we are wired.
It’s not bad that the source you go to has a point of view. That point of view
may differ from yours. Prepare to be challenged if it does. Your job is to rec-
ognize that point of view and to factor it in as you gather your information.
Say that you find a painting in your late grandmother’s attic and you’re curious
as to what it’s worth. It’s a handsome painting, but you know nothing about
painters or painting. You are trying to decide what to do with it. Your best
friend is of no help whatsoever, so the two of you take it to various sources to
find out what it is worth.
 Your mother: To her, this painting may have great value because of the
emotional attachment that she has to it. She puts a high value on it.
 A gallery that takes paintings on consignment: The gallery may take an
objective view of the painting — no emotional attachment. A high offer
may be made if the painting is from a renowned artist.
 A pawn shop: A pawnbroker may offer a low amount of money because
he is making a loan that he doesn’t expect to be repaid. The pawnbroker
will have to sell the item. If you have ever been in a pawn shop, you
know that there is a huge stock of items. Things must sit on the shelf for
a while to allow people time to redeem them.
Each one of these people is giving you his or her honest opinion. Each one is
coming from a different place, a different point of reference. When you talk to
each of these people, you’ll need to factor his or her point of view into the
person’s evaluation of what the painting is worth. Depending on whether you
want to sell the painting or keep it and insure it, you will know what figure
suits your purposes.
Staying informed
Prepare yourself on an ongoing basis for the most common negotiations in your
life. If you sell boats for a living, you should know more about the kind of boats
you sell than anybody else in the world. Attend boat shows open to the general
public as well as seminars for the professional salesperson. Seek out the design-
ers and manufacturers of your boats for detailed information. Talk with your
co-workers over the water cooler. Take advantage of all these varied resources.
59
Chapter 4: Knowing the Marketplace

For instance, if you are a talent agent in Hollywood, know the type of material
studios and production companies are looking for. Don’t waste your client’s
time by sending him or her out to pointless meetings. Moreover, you don’t want
your clients knowing more about the marketplace and having them tell you
what companies they should target. Stay up-to-date on the latest deals, the
latest information about the prices that things are being sold for, and the latest
company mergers. Staying informed will benefit both you and your client.
The quality of the advice and information you receive varies widely. Decide
what to keep in your treasure box of information and what to reject, but keep
exposing yourself to anything and everything that can increase your stock-
pile of information. You never know when some bit of trivia can become your
secret weapon in a negotiation.
Preparing from the General 
to the Specific
I cannot stress enough the importance of knowing about the marketplace.
But a perfectly representative transaction does not exist. Within the market-
place that you have studied so hard and steadily, you will negotiate a specific
deal with a specific person with specific needs and goals. Each item that is
specific to this negotiation will affect the outcome of the negotiation. The next
sections address some of the things that push and pull on a negotiation.
Each one of these factors bears heavily on any specific negotiation.
Time
Whenever someone wants something in a rush, pull out your pocket calcula-
tor. The price should go up. Even if you decide not to charge more, mention
the possibility and push some buttons for a while. Many businesses post the
extra tariff for a rush job. If you don’t have a preset increase for a job or prod-
uct that has to be delivered with extra speed, at least be aware of the concept
and think about charging a little extra for the pleasure of a fast delivery.
Quality
When specifications tighten up, the price must go up. There is nothing wrong
with a customer being very specific about the shade of blue or the width of a
cabinet, but pickiness comes at a price. It takes extra time for you to be sure
that you meet those specifications, and you must factor that into the price.
60
Part I: Preparing to Negotiate 

Quantity
It almost goes without saying that a large order lowers the per-unit price
whether you are purchasing widgets or legal services. Is the reverse ever
true? Well, yes. If the purchase is so large that it corners the market or takes
the supplier off the market, the price should go up, not down.
For instance, if someone is buying so much silver that he controls the silver
market, make sure he pays a premium for that purchase because after he has
cornered the market, he controls the price that you can charge in the future.
You and everyone else would be at his mercy. Or if you’re a CPA or a lawyer and
one client takes so much of your time that you can’t service any other clients,
then you have to be sure that you earn the same amount annually from that
one client as you would from many clients. You also have to be prepared in
case that megaclient dies or leaves you. This means that this megaclient does
not get a price break and may actually pay more per hour than someone else.
Changes
Anyone who has ever added a bathroom to her house or updated a kitchen
knows that she will have to pay something when she changes from red tiles
to blue tiles. Even if the tiles haven’t been ordered, most contractors let you
know that “changes cost money.” At a minimum, the contractor has to
change the order. He may have a hard time getting the new color, or it may
not arrive on time. These are all risks that have to be taken into account.
He ought to be compensated for that.
Scope creep is the most insidious form of a change, and it happens all the
time. You have a big job. The client says, “Would you mind just doing this one
little thing?” It sounds sort of like when you’re at home and your spouse calls
out, “While you are up, can you get ----?” Typically, you’re happy to do it at
home, and you’re happy to do it on a job site. The difference is that at home,
you will be back in bed or back at the dinner table and that is the end of it.
And sometime in the not-too-distant future, you will want to make the same
request of your spouse.
At work, it’s usually a one-way request and once it starts, it doesn’t just stop
there. Over time, you have done a lot of extra uncompensated work. Most com-
panies have a policy to control this. If your company does not, install one now.
At the very least, be sure that the customer is aware that he has been given
something for free. You can do this a number ways. One is just to drop him a
note saying that you were happy that you were able to do what he asked, and
you wanted to let him know that there would be no charge for it. You put that
in the job file, and that way you can keep track of these little extras. They tend
to add up, but you forget all about them if you don’t make a note of them.
61
Chapter 4: Knowing the Marketplace

Risk
Every deal has a certain amount of risk in it. If you are taking most of the
risk, you deserve compensation against the occasional time when the risk
becomes reality — when you have to fix something because you took the
risk. For instance, if you are contracting a job and your client wants you to
hire certain workers instead of him hiring those workers, you are taking a
risk. You are taking the risk that they won’t show up or that they will do
sloppy work or . . . or . . . or. You deserve — no, you need — to mark up the
cost of those subcontractors because you are taking the risk that they won’t
perform. Maybe not on this job, but someday you will have to make good for
somebody else’s goof.
Strategic relationship
Watch out for this one. People will often try to get you to lower your price on
the promise of more business in the future or because they are such an impor-
tant customer. If none of the other factors that are listed above are present,
don’t do it. It’s seldom worth it. These important clients can run you into the
ground. More often than not, you want to take care of these customers with
superior service. That will get them talking you up, and it will make it easier
for you to hold your price with everyone else. After all, if Joe Big Shot is
paying $X, surely everyone else will have to pay $X also.

Setting Goals
In This Chapter
 Setting good goals
 Evaluating the goals you set
 Making an opening offer
 Maintaining your goals
You’ve got to have a dream.
If you don’t have a dream,
how you gonna have a dream come true?
T
hese words are from the song “Happy Talk” in the Rodgers and
Hammerstein musical, South Pacific. Bloody Mary sings them to Liat
and the Lieutenant just after they tell her that they’ve fallen in love.
Rodgers and Hammerstein taught us a thing or two about goal setting.
The entire show is about chasing after your dreams and all the wonderful
things that happen when you do. The essence of this great musical is that if
you don’t work toward your dreams, you regret it for the rest of your life.
Sometimes, your dreams — or, in negotiation terms, your goals — dawn on
you intuitively. Other times, you discover them through more dry, rational
processes.
Do you feel fulfilled in your line of business? Are you achieving what you
want in life? If not, the problem may be that you’re not setting goals, or per-
haps your goals are too general. Setting goals — in your life and in your next
negotiation — requires spending some time. Goal setting is a natural extension
of proper preparation. Goals are the flip side of limits, which are discussed in
Chapter 6.
You may be scared to set goals (and even more fearful of writing those goals
down) because you’re afraid of failing. But any athlete can tell you that failure
is part of winning. In baseball, if you can make it to first base in just four out
of ten times at the plate, you’re considered a really good hitter.

You don’t have to achieve every goal you set. But if you want to grow con-
sistently, you have to set goals for yourself and for your next negotiation.
Setting tangible goals is important if you are to be successful. In specific
negotiations, the process is essential.
Setting a Good Goal
Setting goals for yourself, for others, or for your organization is a practical
activity that demands preparation and disciplined focus. Setting goals is not
wishful thinking. It’s not fantasizing. It’s not daydreaming. A goal is any object
or end that you strive to reach. For example, becoming rich and famous may
be the result of achieving certain goals, but fame and fortune are not the
goals themselves. Deciding to write a bestselling book is not setting a goal;
it’s daydreaming. Deciding to write a book that is interesting and makes solid
contribution is a goal (an ambitious one, but a goal nonetheless). Research
shows that individuals who set challenging, specific goals do better than
those who don’t.
When you set goals, you need to consider what you want to achieve. Setting
specific goals gives you an overall perspective that shapes your decision-
making process. Use the following lists of questions to help you brainstorm
during your goal-setting session.
For business goals, ask yourself:
 What level do I want to reach in my career?
 What kind of knowledge, training, or skills will I need to reach a certain
level in my career?
 How do I want my partner or other members of the team to perceive me?
 How much money do I want to earn? At what stage in my career do I
want to earn this amount?
 Do I want to achieve any artistic goals in my career? If so, what?
For personal goals, think about:
 Do I plan on starting a family? If so, when?
 Do I want to achieve any fitness or well-being goals? For instance, do I
want to remain healthy at an old age? What steps do I need to take to
achieve this goal?
 How much time will I reserve for leisure? What hobbies do I want to
pursue?
Remember, these goals are about you. You have to pamper yourself
every now and then.
64
Part I: Preparing to Negotiate 

Once you have answered some or all of these questions, prioritize your goals
in order of importance. Be sure to prioritize until you’re certain that the goals
reflect your business and/or personal aspirations.
Here are a few points to keep in mind when thinking about your goals:
 Distinguish between a goal and a purpose. If your purpose in life is to
become an Olympic champion, set all of your goals with that ultimate
purpose in mind. You must take many steps along the way to becoming
a champion of any kind — the training, the dedication, the discipline.
Think about your purpose in life; your negotiating goals should con-
tribute to that purpose deal by deal.
 Don’t confuse goal setting with the process of deciding what to put 
forward as an opening offer. (Opening offers are discussed in the
“Setting the Opening Offer” section later in this chapter.) You must set
your personal goals yourself, before a negotiation begins. Get all the
information you can from others about the marketplace and the person
whom you’ll be negotiating with, but set your own goals. Only you know
what your personal dreams are and what will make you happy. Keep a
practiced eye on your goals during the course of the negotiation.
 Decide whether a goal is a good goal when you set it, not after the fact.
Sometimes people say, “Shucks, we didn’t set our goal high enough.”
If you’ve ever said that, one or more of the qualities described in the fol-
lowing sections was absent from the goal-setting process. Each of these
qualities is important. You don’t have to wait until after the negotiation
to find out whether your goals are well set. You can judge your goals at
the moment you make them by determining whether they contain the
qualities presented in the following sections.
Getting active participation 
from every team member
Whether you’re representing someone else in a negotiation or you’re part of
your company’s negotiating team, goal setting is a shared activity. Your first
negotiation is with the other team members to be sure that the goals are 
realistic and understood by everybody on the team. In the entertainment
industry, these types of relationships are common. For example, the agent/
writer relationship is one of the tightest relationships in the industry. Agents
must know their clients’ work and the type of work their writer clients seek.
It’s important for agents to know this to send their clients to appropriate
pitch meetings that will benefit both team members. In essence, agents must
know their clients’ goals. There is no sense for an agent to send out his or her
hot comedy writer to meet with a production company looking for the next
great science-fiction project. For one, the writer client doesn’t achieve his or
her goal of attaining a writing assignment. Secondly, the negotiation, or pitch
meeting in this case, stalls and goes nowhere. Both agent and writer lose out.
65
Chapter 5: Setting Goals

When assessing your team, odds are that you have someone on your team
whom you would prefer to leave out of a planning session. Perhaps this
person’s pace is slower than yours, and you’re afraid the team’s work will
slow down. Or the person may be cantankerous and hardly ever agrees with
the group. Don’t succumb to the temptation to exclude that individual.
This person can end up being a stumbling block later when you’re close to a
decision deadline. Be sure that everyone who is a member of the negotiating
team participates to the extent possible in setting the goals. Some people
may not be verbal, but make sure that they’re on board, even in a passive
way. You need everyone to agree on the goals. Then they are more likely to
own the goals — and the results.
Steven Spielberg’s Munich is an excellent example of how important it is for
every team member to actively participate in goal setting. The film is set
during the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, where 11 Israeli athletes are
taken hostage and murdered by a Palestinian terrorist group known as Black
September. In retaliation, the Israeli government recruits five Mossad agents
to track down and execute those responsible for the attack. The agents all
come from different walks of life, but they share the same goal: vengeance.
In the roundtable scene where the group members gather for their first
dinner together, the meal starts jovially. But as the scene progresses, the con-
versation shifts to an intense discussion about the ramifications of their goal.
Is vengeance a justifiable option? It’s a divisive goal, but despite objections
from some of the team members, they ultimately find common ground and
proceed with their mission. Without that discussion beforehand, the mission
surely would have broken down later.
Even with a personal goal that seems to be your decision alone, you can 
benefit from consulting with your family or friends. These people are
affected by the decision. If you make your friends and family a part of the
goal-setting process, they can be invaluable in helping you reach your objec-
tive. For example, if you want to write a book, your loved one can join in,
if not with content, then with helpful encouragement so you don’t let less
important tasks get in the way. Telling another person about your goal
makes it real and also puts a bit of pressure on you to keep working toward
your goal.
Keeping the goals on course
Many people out there are frustrated at not being heard. If you ask them to
participate in the goal-setting process, the list of demands may get a bit
excessive. Before long, the list of goals contains demands that are outside the
particular negotiation in which you are involved. This result is especially true
in workplace negotiations because, when asked to contribute, frustrated
employees may feel that this is finally their chance to relieve their frustra-
tion. Allowing people with specific agendas to take your goal off course can
keep you from getting what you want.
66
Part I: Preparing to Negotiate 

This caveat doesn’t contradict the good advice in one of my favorite mantras:
“There is no harm in asking.” If your goals relate to the specific negotiation,
you can choose to add an unrelated matter to the discussion. You can raise
an unrelated issue appropriately, but be prepared to abandon it quickly if the
reaction is too adverse. Although asking for a few extras probably won’t hurt,
you should be conscious that you are doing so. Be careful that you don’t sab-
otage the primary goals you’re trying to achieve in the negotiation.
Setting the right number of goals
The negotiation itself dictates the number of specific goals you should set.
It’s amazing how many goals some people can squeeze into even a simple
negotiation. Recognize that you can’t get everything done in one negotiation.
For example, if your priority is to get a raise, don’t demand a car allowance,
overtime pay, and an assistant all in the same session. By putting too much
on the table at one time, you just confuse people. Your boss’s eyes will glaze
over, and you may not get anything at all.
You want to be realistic about your goal setting. Setting too many goals in a
negotiation can make you look ignorant and naïve. To combat this situation,
walk into the negotiation with a written schematic of your goals. Stay on
course with what is written on the page.
Conversely, you don’t want to set goals too low. Setting very low goals is as
detrimental to a negotiation as setting unrealistically high goals. Setting low
goals signals weakness and indifference during a negotiation. The other party
will see right through you. You should set goals that are slightly out of your
grasp, but not so far that you can’t achieve them.
Setting specific rather than general goals
Your goals shouldn’t be so abstract that no one — including you — can tell
whether you achieved them. To avoid any ambiguity, quantify your goals as
much as possible.
If you’re selling your home, for example, saying, “I want as much as I can get”
is not a good goal. This is probably a true statement, but it doesn’t help you
achieve anything. A well-stated goal for the price portion of the negotiation
must include an exact amount, like $525,000. If you can’t be that specific,
you’d better prepare some more.
Along the same line, you can’t buy a house listed for $800,000 if your income
goal is only $60,000. This kind of contradictory goal will sabotage all the work
you put into achieving your goal. You should strive to rid yourself of contra-
dictory goals at every step of the goal-setting process.
67
Chapter 5: Setting Goals

Setting challenging yet attainable goals
It is absolutely certain that you never achieve more than your goals.
Experiments testing this thesis have shown it to be true. Surprise! At the
same time, you must ground your goals in the real world, otherwise you’re
just daydreaming.
If you’re asking $525,000 for your house, and no house in your neighborhood
has ever sold for that amount, you’d better have some good reasons for setting
your goal that high. Maybe you’re in a rising real estate market. Maybe your
house is larger or noticeably nicer than any other house in the neighborhood.
Maybe a state-of-the-art shopping center is under construction nearby, making
your location more desirable than ever before. Any of these factors make a
record-breaking price for your home attainable. Without special factors like
these, you’re wasting your time by starting with such a high goal.
Likewise, you want to be sure that the $525,000 is challenging. If every house
on the block sells for $525,000, that price isn’t much of a goal — unless your
house is noticeably more run-down than the others (in which case, you may
want to consider some landscaping or painting first). You may have to do
some research to find ways to justify asking a higher price than the others in
the neighborhood. If you find out that major construction is planned for the
near future, for example, you can make that part of your sales pitch.
Too many of us suffer from setting our goals too low. Shoot high or not at
all — you can be sure that the other side will never ask you to raise your
goals. But remember that you don’t have to become rich and famous before
breakfast. Goals that are too high for the deal lead to frustration and failed
negotiations. For the specific negotiation at hand, consider the marketplace,
current values, and your available options.
You can quickly see that setting a challenging yet attainable goal requires
that you have a good deal of information — information you always need
before you start negotiating. Setting your goals is one way you know whether
you’re prepared for your next negotiation.
Think of that big thermometer the United Way puts up before every fundraising
drive. The number at the top of the thermometer represents a figure gener-
ally a little higher than the previous year, but not too much higher. A better
economy, more members participating in the fundraising drive, or a special
event (such as building a new recreation center) justifies an increased amount.
As group members raise money, they fill the outline of the thermometer with
red paint to show exactly what has been contributed. Whether the organiza-
tion reaches its goal or not, the thermometer looks very red at the end of the
campaign, and those who contributed feel good.
68
Part I: Preparing to Negotiate 

Prioritizing your goals
Be sure to rank your goals in terms of importance. Ideally, you want to achieve
100 percent consensus about the official ranking of your goals. However, dif-
ferent individuals may hold onto their personal agendas. In those cases, let
the majority prevail and note explicitly the view of the minority. By making
special note of the minority view at the beginning, you record it for the dura-
tion. Later, you can allow the repeat discussion, but remind the advocates of
the minority view that they were outvoted.
It is a rare negotiation in which you achieve all of your goals. You must
know which are the most important. This decision can become contentious.
Teams often abandon the critical step of prioritizing in the name of keeping
the peace. Unfortunately, such teams only defer the argument to a later point
in time — and probably a worse time, such as
 When the team needs to hang together.
 When not enough time exists to deal with a side issue.
 When the stakes in the outcome seem higher because they are more
immediate.
 When a distraction from negotiating is the most damaging.
What a disaster! Bite the bullet and get the team together on this important
issue when you settle upon the list of goals.
Separating Long-Range Goals 
from Short-Range Goals
Set your goals for any particular negotiation with an eye on your long-range life
goals, but keep your feet planted firmly on the ground. You want to accomplish
the immediate objective of the current negotiation; you also want each negotia-
tion to advance you toward achieving your ultimate life goals. Your goals in any
negotiation should help you march along the life path you have set for yourself.
For instance, I had a long-range goal of publishing a comprehensive book on
negotiating. When I opened discussions with the For Dummies people, they
had other proposals on their desk. This became a very specific negotiation
with a very specific short-range goal: Choose me! They did. My long-range
goal was still out there. The successful resolution of the short-term negotia-
tion put me one step closer to it.
69
Chapter 5: Setting Goals

After that negotiation was resolved, another specific negotiation involved
the publishing contract. For that I hired an experienced New York lawyer
who did his magic quickly and effectively. Basically, the contract was
accepted as offered with some clarifications, but very little substantive
changes. Then — and only then — could I negotiate with my editor as to
what exactly “comprehensive book” meant. Fortunately, we had a large area
of agreement on the subject.
Setting the Opening Offer
The opening offer is nothing more and nothing less than the first specific
statement of what you’re looking for in a negotiation. After you have set your
goals for the negotiation, you can consider the opening offer. For example, in
a job interview the opening offer is the salary you’re seeking. Don’t look for
any hard-and-fast rules or magic formulas. To determine your opening offer,
you should draw heavily on the goals and limits you set and the information
you have gathered while preparing for the negotiation. Obviously, your open-
ing offer should be higher than the goals you have set for yourself. But it
shouldn’t be so outrageously high as to be off-putting to the other side or
make you look foolish or inexperienced. Figure 5-1 depicts this relationship
graphically.

Part I: Preparing to Negotiate 

Whether the amount you state in your opening offer is higher or lower than
the amount of your goal depends on whether you’re the buyer or the seller
(you determine how much higher or lower through good preparation):
 If you’re the seller, your opening offer should never be lower than the
goal you set.
 If you’re the buyer, the opening offer should never be higher than the
goal you set.
People are quite anxious about the opening offer. They’re fearful that they will
mess up the entire negotiation by blurting out a demand that is too modest
or too ambitious. State your opening offer positively and precisely. You want
the ability to measure your achievement. Use your anxiety level as a measure
of how well prepared you are. Part of being well prepared is knowing relative
values. If you know the value of what you’re offering, the opening offer is easy to
deduce. You just decide how much negotiating room you want to leave yourself.
Have your opening offer in mind even if you don’t plan to state it openly. This
approach speeds your reaction time to whatever offer the other side makes.
Breaking the Stone Tablet
Write down your goals but don’t chisel them in stone. Goals can and should
change throughout the course of your life. Use your written goals as a roadmap
to your success. Writing them down sets the process in motion and allows
you to frequently review your goals.
71
Chapter 5: Setting Goals
Opening on a high or a low
I know a real estate agent in town who always
negotiates from numbers much higher than where
he plans ultimately to end up. I always accommo-
date him by asking for outrageously low numbers,
knowing he likes to experience this process.
On the other hand, I successfully and quickly
sold my house in Beverly Hills by pricing it a
mere $5,000 over the price I thought would be
the ultimate sale price. I based the amount on
the sale price of a nearby home just two months
before. That house was almost the exact same
size as my house, but without a pool. So I added
a small amount for the pool and planted flowers
along the walkway. The feeding frenzy that
resulted caused the house to go out at exactly
the asking price!

During a negotiation, you should state your goals as just that. If you state
your goal as a take-it-or-leave-it demand, you create a terrible dynamic.
Remember these keys:
 Goals
 Limits
 Opening offers
If you keep these three concepts separate in your mind, your negotiations
begin — and end — on a much happier note.
Even if you never change your goals, you should review them just before you
close the deal. Then look at your goals again after closing the deal. If they were
too high, or maybe not high enough, consider what information you didn’t
have before you set your goals that caused you to miss the mark. Don’t kick
yourself if you decide that your goals should have been higher. Remember
the reasons for making the deal you made and learn from the experience.

 Walking away from a negotiation
S
etting limits and then sticking to them is one of the most important and
most difficult lessons you can learn. This chapter tells you how to set
limits and then how to use those limits to take charge of every negotiation in
your personal and professional life.
If you’re like most people on this planet, you can use some pointers about
enforcing limits. Many people don’t even want to think about setting limits
because they have such a tough time enforcing them. At one time or another,
you stayed in a relationship just a little bit too long because you never set
your limits. You probably agreed to do something you didn’t want to do
because you were unable to stick to your limits. Or you were angered by
somebody because you failed to make your limits clear to him as he
“crossed the line.”
To help you conquer this nearly universal problem, I divide it into two pieces.
One is setting your limits. The other is enforcing your limits. The importance
of limits shows up most clearly when you’re in a romantic relationship and
you don’t want to think about it ending, so you don’t think about your limits.
But when limits are crossed — when it’s often too late to correct the course
of events — these words are heard: “Now you’ve done it! You have really
crossed the line!”
Set your limits before you enter a negotiation. Setting limits early saves an
enormous amount of time during the actual course of the negotiation
because you already know your options. And knowing your options makes
you more decisive during the discussions. Rapid decision making depends
more on having your limits well in mind at the start of a negotiation than it
does on intellect.

After you set limits, they will help guide you through the negotiation. When you
carefully and realistically predetermine your limits, they serve as rudders,
navigating the negotiation through rough waters. Worried about dirty tricks
being thrown at you? Scared of unfair tactics? No worries, as long as you set
your limits.
What It Means to Set Limits
Your limits define the absolute most you are willing to give up to get what
you want. Setting limits means establishing the point at which you are willing
to walk away from the negotiation and pursue some alternative course.
Your limit may be the highest price you’ll pay for a car, the lowest salary
you’ll accept from a prospective employer, the farthest you’re willing to drive
before it’s your spouse’s turn to take over, or the latest curfew you’ll allow for
your teenager. If the negotiation doesn’t close before your limits are crossed,
then no car, no job, no trip, no date — no dice.
In business negotiations, setting limits may not seem necessary because the
marketplace can define the boundaries of the discussion. People generally
have an idea about the price of goods or services; they know what others are
paying for comparable homes, cars, or cleaning services. They assume the
discussion will not go beyond an acceptable range or what they consider to
be a fair and reasonable value for the product or service under negotiation.
Not true. Even business negotiations can go off track, especially in times of
economic downturn or if other business conditions change suddenly.
Think about the last three times you became upset about something in your
personal life. It’s almost a certainty that at least one of those situations was
caused by the fact that your limits were crossed. You probably didn’t articulate
those limits in advance. For example, your neighbor comes over unannounced
to chat. You have only a few minutes to spare, but you fail to tell your visitor.
Out of kindness, you listen while your blood pressure rises as the neighbor
talks for an hour.
Unfortunately, setting limits is a very difficult task for some people. It takes
practice and assertiveness. Start small: Set a limit of 60 seconds the next time
someone calls to chat when you don’t have time. Tell them upfront. That should
be enough time to take care of the pleasantries necessary to maintain the
relationship and still get you off the phone. You don’t have to be rude about it.
Simply set your limitations. Your time is precious.
Setting limits is worth the effort. People who consistently make bad deals usu-
ally don’t set limits before the negotiation starts. They don’t know when to walk
away. You must know your limits and know how to enforce them. Knowing that
you’re prepared to walk away gives you the strength and confidence to be firm,
even if the other party isn’t aware of your limits or your ability to enforce them.

Setting Limits in Three Easy Steps
When you know how to set limits and have confidence in that ability, you change
the entire negotiating process. But it is almost impossible to set and enforce
limits unless you have an attitude of prosperity. If you do not have a firm belief
about the prosperity all around you, you may have a hard time setting limits.
People who believe that the world is a stingy place and see the world through
an attitude of lack and limitation usually think that they have to close the deal
or another one won’t come their way. The truth is that the universe is a bountiful
place. No matter what your calling, there are more jobs, more opportunities,
more chances to express your success than you could ever possibly take advan-
tage of. Embrace the magnificent range of possibilities that life has to offer as
you read this section because that is the mind-set of a world-class negotiator.
Kenny Rogers may have said it best in his hit song “The Gambler,” which was
about the high-stakes negotiation that takes place around a poker table.
Rogers croons this important truth:
You gotta know when to hold ’em,
know when to fold ’em,
know when to walk away, and
know when to run.
Notice that the word “know” appears in each line of the chorus. Being able to
set limits is directly tied to knowledge, and knowledge is the result of prepara-
tion. Of course, you have to be prepared about the marketplace (see Chapter 4
for more on knowing the marketplace). You need to know the likely outcome
of the deal. But you also need to spend time preparing about your own life
and vision (see Chapter 2). And don’t forget to find out about the person
you’re negotiating with and know what he or she is seeking (see Chapter 3).
The last thing you want to do is blindly enter a negotiation and end up look-
ing like a novice because you haven’t prepared adequately.
This section contains three steps that master negotiators around the world
use to set limits. Notice how each of these steps includes the word “know.”
Know that you have other choices
Texas billionaire Nelson Bunker Hunt is often quoted as saying, “There is
always another deal around the corner.”
One reason Bunker made so many good deals during his life is that he was
always willing to walk away from a deal if it wasn’t right. He was good at setting
his limits and then sticking to them. Bunker’s slogan must be part of your core
beliefs. Keep repeating his quote until it becomes a part of your belief system:
“There is always another deal around the corner.”
75
Chapter 6: Setting and Enforcing Limits

Poor negotiators tend to attach themselves to the notion that they must close
every negotiation with a purchase or sale. Good negotiators, on the other hand,
often walk away. Walking away from a bad deal is just as important — maybe
more important — than closing a good deal. (For more on walking away, see the
last section of the chapter, “Sometimes, the Best Deal in Town Is No Deal at All.”)
In fact, you often have two incentives to walk away from a bad deal:
 You aren’t stuck with the headache, financial stress, or other difficulties
associated with the bad deal.
 One of your competitors will end up with the job, while you are off chas-
ing the good job, the profitable job, the job with the clients who are easy
to work with.
Whether the object of your affection is a stock, a piece of real estate, or a
potential lover, you must have in your heart and in your mind that you are
not stuck. The biggest prison is the one you build around your mind if you
decide you don’t have choices.
“There is always another deal around the corner.” Make this phrase your
mantra. Repeat it until it becomes part of your core. Own it. This truth can
influence your entire life and bring positive results to all your future negotia-
tions. In the entertainment industry, this mantra holds especially true.
Writers and actors deal with constant rejection. I profess this mantra to my
writer clients before they attend a pitch meeting to sell an idea. The chance
of them selling a pitch the first time they walk into a room is remote, espe-
cially for first-time writers, because many other writers are always waiting to
pitch their take on the same idea. Another deal is always waiting for you
somewhere. It just may take some time to find it.
Start making this your mantra today. Don’t wait until you’re in the middle
of an emotional situation to convince yourself that you have other choices.
The truth of this mantra can only be grasped in the crisp light of a clear and
uncluttered day — not in the depths of a specific problem.
Remember the scene before the intermission in Gone with the Wind where
Scarlett O’Hara stands at the foot of her war-ravaged plantation, Tara, looking
into the sunset? Nothing, not even the Civil War, deters Scarlett from knowing
that she has other choices. She vows to rebuild her plantation and her life
despite the obstacles ahead. Think of the negotiation in a similar fashion.
Know that you have other choices and opportunities elsewhere.
Know what the other choices are
Don’t develop just one alternative deal in a negotiation. List all the alternatives
available to you should the negotiation fail to close on the terms you want.
Don’t edit your list. Make it as long as possible. Life is always about exercising
options. What are your options if you walk away from this deal? You have
76
Part I: Preparing to Negotiate 

nothing to lose and everything to gain by listing your choices. Don’t inhibit
yourself. Instead, list all your options, even if you don’t think they are very
valuable or practical. You have plenty of time to edit them down later.
If you’re buying a new car, your alternatives may include going to another lot,
choosing another model, choosing another make, or delaying the purchase.
If you’re interviewing for a job, your alternatives may involve accepting a
lower wage, accepting another job, continuing your search, going to another
city, changing professions, or going into business for yourself. The point is
that you have many alternatives. Keep your options open. Don’t limit yourself.
Whatever the alternatives are in your situation, list them clearly and com-
pletely. If you find that you can’t list any alternatives, you aren’t ready to
start negotiating. One result of being well prepared is the ability to create this
list of alternatives before a negotiation begins.
Before you enter the negotiation, you should also try constructing a similar
list of alternatives for the other party. The more you know about the choices
available to the other side, the more strength you have in the negotiation.
Consider these exercises as a part of your preparation.
Know your “or else”
After you have created the list of alternatives, decide which alternative is
most acceptable to you. Pick your personal or else. Decide what you want
to do if the negotiation doesn’t close. Think about that course of action.
Play the scenario out in your mind.
Knowing what your “or else” is — that is, knowing what your favorite option
is if the deal doesn’t close — defines your limits for each negotiation. Suppose
that you’re willing to pay $300,000 for a house before you set your “or else.”
Then remind yourself that you have choices and list all of them. After you
write down your list, you may decide that you can accept another house that
is cheaper. This way, you can be firm or even lower the $300,000 price you
were willing to offer. On the other hand, if you decide that no other house
would be right for you, the price could go up rather than down.
A few years ago, the Harvard Negotiating Institute came up with something it
calls BATNA — the Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement. That’s the
Harvard way of saying “or else.” BATNA is a core element in its negotiating
course. It defines your best alternative if you can’t close a deal.
Most negotiations settle before either party’s limits are tested. World-class
negotiators have been doing this for centuries. The “or else” label is my own
tag that I used with a client as a young lawyer, and it has stuck with me ever
since. But your limits and the other party’s limits loom over every negotiation
like peregrine falcons circling high above, ready to swoop down for the kill.
You are much better accepting this reality before the negotiation ever starts.
77
Chapter 6: Setting and Enforcing Limits

Enforcing Your Limits
It goes without saying that you can’t enforce limits if you don’t have them.
In personal relationships, people often don’t express limits until they are
crossed. When raising children, parents often express limits as rules — rules
that must be followed or there will be consequences. This model often helps
people who think they have a hard time setting and enforcing limits.
The next four sections help you become Rex the Enforcer when it comes
to your limits. No one else will do this for you. If that’s your dream, well,
dream on. No matter what your lot in life, you and only you must enforce
your limits.
Write down your limits
I learned the importance of writing down limits for a negotiation during the
seminars in which I run a mock negotiation. Originally, I had participants
write down their goals and limits and turn them in before they would start
negotiating. While they were busy negotiating, I reviewed each team’s limits
and goals to see where the negotiation would end up. In fact, I could predict
the results based on this review and was seldom wrong. However, every now
and then, someone would settle outside the limits the team had handed in.
When I asked why, the person invariably would answer that he or she had
forgotten the limit the team had set.
Usually the class had a good laugh and that was that. But it bothered me.
I started having participants write down the limits and goals and keep a
copy with them during the mock negotiation. That solved the problem.
Participants never forgot their limits again.
It’s easy to understand how people can get caught up in a negotiation and
reach an agreement that they would not otherwise agree to if they had just
set their limits and then remembered them as the negotiation drew to a close.
A lot of people would avoid buyer’s remorse if they would set and stick to
their limits. When you write down your limits — your walk-away points —
before you start negotiating, you are well on your way to remembering —
and enforcing — your limits.
Establish your resistance point
One reason you must be very certain to set limits is that they automatically
define your resistance point. Your resistance point is close to your limit but
leaves enough room to close the deal without crossing your limit. At the
resistance point, you let the other party know that he or she is getting close
to your limit — and that you will soon be walking away.
78
Part I: Preparing to Negotiate 

Don’t remain silent until the other party crosses the limit and knocks the
negotiation out of the sky. You need to begin your complaints before that 
critical moment. Resist any proposal that too closely approaches the limits
you set.
How far out in front of the limit you set your resistance point is a matter of
your own personality and comfort zone. However, if you haven’t set limits,
you can’t know when to start putting up a strong resistance. You can bet that
the other party will be hurt and angry when you walk out if he or she hasn’t
had a clear warning from you in advance. Your counterpart needs to hear
that the negotiation is approaching a resistance point before the discussion
concludes.
Tell your team the limits
Obviously, you don’t go into a negotiation and announce your bottom line,
such as the most you’re willing to pay. But you do need to tell your teammates
about the limit you have set (and remind them not to let those specifics slip
to the opposing side). Just as important, make sure that everyone understands
the reason and agrees with the limit that has been set. You (or someone else)
haven’t just pulled an arbitrary figure out of the air. It’s an important limit
that will not be crossed.
By the same token, don’t be afraid to make adjustments if someone on your
team makes a compelling argument to change the limit before the negotiation
starts. Also, if — and only if — you gain new information during the negotia-
tion, you can adjust your limit. But the new information can’t be, “Gosh, the
negotiation won’t close unless I change my limit.” That’s why you set your
limits, in writing, in advance. Don’t fall into the trap of “having” to close the
deal. If the other side isn’t willing to settle within your acceptable range, find
someone who will.
In almost every area of your life, it’s good to articulate your limits to the
people you interact with. You would never sit silently as your child went out
the door at 9:30 p.m. if you wanted him or her back by 10 p.m. You would
state your expectations, clearly, nondefensively. Give your co-workers the
same courtesy. If you are being pestered with questions from the person in
the next cubicle, just say, “Let’s set a time to go over all of these questions at
once.” No use getting irritated if you haven’t even tried to set some ground
rules.
Sometimes setting “rules” for your co-workers is a bit difficult. They don’t
“hear” you. That is, they hear the words, but it doesn’t sink in. If that’s the
case, try taking their hands, looking them straight in the eye, and saying
whatever you have to say, directly without apology. You won’t even have to
tell them how important it is. Your manner of delivery will say it all.
79
Chapter 6: Setting and Enforcing Limits

Never paint yourself into a corner
If you state your limits immediately when negotiations begin, you violate a
fundamental tenet of sound negotiations. You probably already learned this
rule while fixing up your first apartment: Never, ever paint yourself into a
corner. In negotiations, you paint yourself into a corner by taking a strong
stand and not leaving yourself an alternative, or an out.
In other words, don’t start a negotiation by telling someone that you won’t
pay one dime more than 50 bucks (or whatever) unless you know that other
stores offer the same product within your price range. Such an announcement
paints you into a corner when no alternative exists.
This chapter should help you set limits, not shout limits. In fact, the final instruc-
tion the judge reads to the jury before sending the members to deliberate a case
is not to announce their position too quickly. In California, those final words are
“The attitude and conduct of jurors at the beginning of their deliberations
are very important. It is rarely helpful for a juror, on entering the jury
room, to express an emphatic opinion on the case or to announce a
determination to stand for a certain verdict. When one does that at the
outset, a sense of pride may be aroused, and one may hesitate to change
a position even if shown that it is wrong. . . .”
Too bad no one reads these words to us as we start each day.
Practicing Negotiating toward a Limit
Limits are not much help if you cave in every time you set them. In fact,
caving in too often can gravely affect a relationship. Parents who constantly
lay down the law only to pick it up a few minutes later usually end up raising
brats — confused, unhappy brats at that. Now you have one more reason to
practice enforcing your limits!
In the beginning, practice the steps in situations outside of your business or
personal relationships. It is particularly fun and somewhat easier, psychologi-
cally, to walk away from a deal when you’re on vacation. You are browsing at
your leisure, and you see something you want to buy. Be sure that you are
willing to buy the item, because you may just close the deal. Be equally sure
that you are willing to leave the shop without the item, because that is the
point of this game.
Note the price. Determine what you are willing to pay for it, which must be
much less than the indicated price. Don’t just grab a number because you
want to play a game with the shopkeeper. Give serious thought to the true
value of the item. If the item is already a bargain, maybe this isn’t the right
80
Part I: Preparing to Negotiate 

shop for this exercise. When you have set a price, begin talking with the
shopkeeper. Don’t say what your bottom-line price is. Instead, offer less than
you are willing to pay but above what you think the shopkeeper paid.
If the shopkeeper tells you that bargaining is against store policy, explain that
you would really like the item, but you feel it is overpriced. State that you are
from out of town and can wait until you get back home, but you would like to
make the purchase here, if you can agree on terms. Generally, the owner makes
a concession. If not, ask whether anybody is available with whom you can
discuss the matter further — you may not have engaged the decision maker.
(If you’re new at this approach, you may be more comfortable making your
first effort in a shop where bargaining seems okay, such as an antiques shop.)
If no further negotiation takes place, say thanks and politely walk out. Closing
even this non-negotiation in a formal way is important. Don’t just slink away
like a beaten hound. You offered the shopkeeper an opportunity to move
some merchandise. Make sure that the shopkeeper knows the opportunity is
passing. Don’t apologize for not overpaying for the item.
The shopkeeper may well respond with a lower offer. Don’t automatically
accept. Remember that, although you are willing to purchase the item, you
are seeking the experience of hanging tough, even walking away from a deal.
You may increase your offer slightly but don’t move too fast toward the end
point. After all, you want to practice!
If the shopkeeper quickly meets your unstated limit, keep the negotiation
going. Adjust your price downward, toward your last stated position. When a
buyer with cash meets a willing seller, what follows may surprise you even in
shops where you think bargaining is strictly forbidden.
How to Tell the Other Party When 
You’re the One Walking Away
If you decide (based on your solid preparation and honest judgment) to 
terminate a negotiation, don’t send a conflicting message. State clearly the
conditions under which negotiations can resume. Then walk. Don’t look back
or otherwise communicate hesitation.
Looking back is not natural. The human body doesn’t work that way. Your feet
and your face should point in the same direction. Besides, looking back is
confusing — to you and to your counterpart.
Never terminate a negotiation when you are angry. When you are angry, you
want to storm out of the room or slam down the phone. Fight the instinct.
Instead, take a break. Before you walk away from the negotiation, give your-
self some breathing room. If, after some thought, you want to terminate
81
Chapter 6: Setting and Enforcing Limits

the negotiations, end the discussion in a way that doesn’t damage your 
reputation in the community — whether the community is your family,
your firm, or your city. Do it in a way that allows you to do business with
those who like or respect your current counterpart.
82
Part I: Preparing to Negotiate 
Of Landon, limits, and landlords
Michael Landon was excellent at setting limits
in business. One of Michael’s limits was that he
would not continue to negotiate with someone
who was acting out of pure greed or avarice.
Requests substantially outside the normal range
were suspect, and phrases such as “Oh, you
can afford it” were death knells to a deal.
I was proud to represent Michael on all his pro-
ductions for the last decade of his productive
life —including his final movie for television,
Where Pigeons Go to Die.
The location manager found a great farmhouse
to use for the shoot and made a standard agree-
ment with the owner. For a fixed fee, Landon
Productions would have the full use of the main
house for a week before the shoot to add a loft
to the house, age the house (paint the indica-
tions of time and weather), and make other
minor changes. The crew would not disturb the
tenant, who rented a small building on the prop-
erty, and they would assure normal access in
and out of the rental unit. They would return the
property to its original state except the loft,
which the owner wanted to keep. Overall, the
agreement was a standard deal when a film
crew stays at one location for an extended
period.
After a few days of watching large amounts of
money being spent, the tenant decided that he
wanted some money himself. Because filming
always involves an element of inconvenience,
Michael authorized a modest payment. When
the location manager passed the offer along to
the tenant, he failed to explain why the offer was
more than fair or how good Michael was about
setting limits. Nor did he explain the probable
consequences of turning down Michael’s offer.
The tenant was unsatisfied with the amount
offered and sought out a local lawyer to obtain
“his money.” I gave the local lawyer a healthy
education about Michael’s way of doing busi-
ness. Michael always gave a warning before
ending negotiations so the other person could
change position, but my personal opinion was
that we had already offered the tenant too much
money. The tenant’s lawyer pressed on, speaking
of the great inconvenience to his client and stat-
ing that he had visited the set and “saw all the
money being spent.” I gave him a friendly warn-
ing about the adverse consequences of taking
such an approach, but the lawyer persisted.
Michael instructed me to repeat the offer one
more time, explain our position again, and then
steadily reduce the offer if they did not accept it.
We increased security on the set and followed
up with Michael’s approach.
The matter settled quickly, but Michael would
have been totally comfortable paying the tenant
nothing and accepting whatever wrath that
response would evoke. He had his limits, and he
knew how to enforce them.
Michael was one of the most generous men I
ever met, but he did not like being exploited. He
knew how to set limits.
Setting limits is the cornerstone of good parent-
child relationships. It should be no surprise,
then, that Michael, who was my very best client
when it came to setting limits, was also the one
with the most children.

Before you walk away from the negotiation, write a wrap-up letter. Writing a
letter gives you time to edit and correct yourself. It clarifies your view of the
situation. If you are mistaken about some aspect of the discussion, your view
is clearly stated and easy to correct. A letter puts things in perspective in case
the other side is mistaken about some aspect of the situation. Your letter
should cover each of the following:
1. Summarize the final position of the other side.
Be painfully accurate. Introduce this section with hedge words, such as
“I understand . . . ,” or “To the best of my memory . . . ,” or “If I understood
you correctly. . . .” Close this section with “If that does not correctly
state your position, please advise.” Such phrases enable the other side
to change position or make a correction without losing face or being
argumentative.
2. Summarize your own position.
Be painfully accurate. Here again, hedge words let the other side
reenter gracefully. Examples include: “In case it was not clear during
our discussions . . . ,” or “I’m sorry if this was not presented as clearly
in our discussions as it is in this letter.”
3. Explain about square pegs in round holes.
If you simply don’t believe that a deal can be made because the needs
and desires are so different, say so. No one is blameworthy. The parties
can work together on another project when the fit is better.
4. Never, ever blame the other person.
Even if you are walking away because you have decided the other person
is a sleazebag, hog breath, scumbag, you won’t gain anything by putting
that assessment in writing. The sleazebag may have a brother-in-law or
cousin whom you may want to do business with in the future. Never burn
a bridge — a bridge serves an entire village, not just one person.
5. Include a message of thanks.
Always include in your letter a thank-you sentence for the time and
attention you did receive. This final touch is the classy thing to do.
6. Telegraph your next move.
This feature is optional. A sentence such as “We will try to sell the script
elsewhere,” or “Next spring, we will try such a launch again” tells the
other side that you have other options, and you will be exercising them.
Of course, the sensitivity of the situation may limit you to a statement
such as “We will be moving on,” or “We will be examining our options
over the next few weeks.”

Chapter 6: Setting and Enforcing Limits

The Consequences of Not Setting Limits
Whether you have consciously set your limits or not, in every negotiation,
you have a point beyond which you won’t go. There’s also a point beyond
which your opponent won’t go. If you don’t set your limits ahead of time, you
discover them as your patience becomes strained. Often, people explode or
feel stepped on when this line is crossed. Much of setting limits is really figur-
ing out what your limits are — before they come up and hit you in the face
because someone crossed them.
Watch Alfred Hitchcock’s classic film Strangers on a Train and see a negotia-
tion go haywire because of its characters not setting limits. The film begins
innocently enough when tennis pro Guy Haines, played by Farley Granger,
meets a stranger named Bruno Anthony, played by Robert Walker, on a
train. During small talk, Bruno jokes about how an “exchange” murder
between two complete strangers would be the murder no one could solve.
After all, how could the authorities find the murderer when he is a complete
stranger with absolutely no connection to the victim? Bruno suggests that he
could kill Guy’s wife, and Guy could kill his father. From Bruno’s perspective,
the negotiation is sealed when the gentlemen step off the train. From Guy’s
perspective, the conversation is nothing more than a strange topic of 
discussion, and he thinks nothing of it. He doesn’t set limits. He doesn’t
give Bruno any details about how or when the murder swap should occur.
Regardless, Bruno crosses the line and murders Guy’s wife, anticipating
that Guy will finish his part of the deal. Guy’s life goes into a tailspin and
is changed forever. This is an extreme example of a negotiation gone
wrong, but it exemplifies how setting your limits from the onset helps
avoid disasters.
In your personal life, you usually discover your limits when anger or hurt
feelings signal that your boundaries have been crossed. If you identify these
limits ahead of time, you can avoid the anger or hurt by stating your limits
and enforcing them.
If a negotiation terminates because demands crossed the limits of one party
or the other, the end happens as swiftly, silently, and unexpectedly as a
pigeon hit from behind by a diving predator. The surprise factor is stunning.
Usually, one or both parties feel betrayed or angry or both. In truth, setting
your limits in advance can completely avoid the problem. Each party is aware
of the limits that form the negotiating boundaries.
84
Part I: Preparing to Negotiate 

Re-examining Your Limits
Set your bottom line (that is, the point beyond which you will not go) before
you ever start negotiating. In fact, set a bottom line as soon as you have the
data to do so. But don’t be afraid to take a second look at the limits you set.
When you have set your limits, write them down. Writing them down doesn’t
mean that they won’t change, but having a written record does mean that you
can’t fudge later and pretend that you aren’t adjusting limits. During the heat
of the negotiation, you don’t need to panic when your limits are tested
because you have them written down in front of you.
Slowly changing limits during a negotiation without mindful consideration is
a very common mistake. If you are conscious of what you’re doing and keenly
aware of the reasons, changing limits can be a positive and appropriate
course of action. However, if you don’t write down your limits — your “or
else” — you risk adjusting them by inches when a foot is needed. Slipping
and sliding creates confusion in your mind and in the minds of those with
whom you are negotiating.
Sometimes, the Best Deal 
in Town Is No Deal at All
Setting limits is tough. Walking away is even tougher. You may actually be
afraid that something bad is going to happen if you walk away from a negotia-
tion. Walking away often feels like failure. Don’t worry — nothing terrible will
occur if you walk away.
You can find out much about negotiation by walking away from a deal or two
just for the practice. Life does go on. Try it. It’s okay, and it can be educational.
Knowing how to walk away is critically important in your personal negotia-
tions. How many people do you know who are miserable because they don’t
have the strength or the experience to set limits in the workplace or at home
with children or spouses? People stay in bad relationships longer than is
healthy because of their inability to set limits and stick to them.

Part I: Preparing to Negotiate 
A sailing lesson becomes a negotiating lesson
During my basic training at the United States
Marine Corps Officer Candidates School in
Quantico, Virginia, I joined the Marine Corps
Sailing Team, an unofficial group who sailed a
small Marine Corps–owned sailboat in week-
end regattas along the eastern seaboard. I had
been sailing for years, and joining this group
seemed like a cheap and effective way to meet
interesting people and have immediate status at
events where I would not otherwise be admit-
ted. Sailing would also provide great weekend
relief from Officer Candidates School.
At my first opportunity, I went down to the docks
to sign up. The skipper was all Marine — he
wouldn’t consider anyone who hadn’t taken his
course. Lesson one: Get into the boat with an
instructor, sail toward the horizon, and turn the
boat over as fast as you can.
You learn a great deal about a sailboat by trying
to turn it over. The task is not as easy as you
may think. In fact, the assignment can be diffi-
cult without a good strong wind. Righting a
small capsized boat, on the other hand, is not
very difficult, if you’ve had practice.
Now I am not advocating brinkmanship in nego-
tiating or sailing. I have never intentionally (and
rarely unintentionally) capsized a boat since
that afternoon in Quantico. But that experience
taught me an important lesson that applies to
negotiating: Capsizing a boat (or killing a deal)
isn’t so easy, and righting a boat afterward (or
finding another deal) isn’t so hard.
This exercise also caused me to lose any fear I
had of capsizing a boat. Don’t be afraid to tip the
boat over. And don’t be afraid to walk away from
a bad deal.

L
istening is one of the most underrated skills in negoti-
ating. Most people believe that they get what they
want through talking, not listening. But the truth is, suc-
cessful negotiators spend more time listening than they
do speaking. This part gives you pointers on how to listen
more effectively and how to use what you hear. When the
time comes for you to speak up, make sure that what you
say is clear, concise, and effective. This part is full of prac-
tical tips for better communication and no-nos you should
avoid if you want to get your point across. If you feel that
no one understands you, this part can show you how to
be heard.

L
isten with your ears, your eyes, and every pore in between. Listening is
absolutely fundamental to all interpersonal activities. It’s also an essen-
tial negotiation skill that gives you a leg up in all kinds of situations.
Good listening skills can change your business life and your personal life.
How many women have left their husbands with the basic complaint, “He never
listened to me?” In your personal life, failing to listen leads your partner to
feel unimportant, ignored, and unloved. In your business life, not listening
leads to failed deals, bad deals, and no deals.
Listening is fundamental to every negotiation. Often, it’s the first skill invoked
in a negotiation. When someone approaches you personally or professionally
and seeks your acquiescence, approval, or action, that starts a negotiation.
You may not have anticipated a negotiation, but now you have no choice.
All you can do is listen.
My son-in-law Eddie Gleason (well, not quite yet, but both families are
hoping) improved his listening skills rapidly when he got into the home
improvement business. He realized that he couldn’t just scribble down the
first thing that clients would say about what they wanted. He has to listen
carefully, ask lots of questions, and pay close attention to the answers to
learn what the customer really wants. After he knows what the customer
wants, he gives his customers accurate bids and work schedules. Because of
his listening skills, he produces results that create happy customers who
refer their friends to him. Listening pays off.
At its simplest, listening is accurately taking in all the information that the
other party is communicating. Active listening involves all the senses and
many screening devices. At its most sophisticated, listening also involves get-
ting the other party to open up, to communicate more information, and to

express ideas more clearly than is the norm for that person. You may find
that the other person opens up merely because he or she realizes that some-
one is truly listening.
Often, people who describe their marital breakup as something they “didn’t
expect,” “didn’t know was coming,” or “didn’t have any clue about” were
simply not listening very well. If you’ve made one of these statements after
the breakup of a relationship, try to make a list of signals, signposts, events,
and comments that may have foreshadowed the breakup. If you had listened
to (and heeded) those early indicators, the relationship may have turned out
differently. Fortunately, listening is something you can master. Start practic-
ing right away.
Two Quick and Easy Starter 
Tips to Better Listening
Don’t waste any time. Get started right now being a better listener. Whether
you’re at home or at the office or on an airplane, start working on your listen-
ing skills. In your very next conversation, use two active listening tools:
restatement and paraphrasing. Both of these tools involve checking in with
the person who is talking to find out whether you’re hearing what he or she
is saying.
 Restating: Repeat, word-for-word, a short statement that the other
person has just made to you. Even if the next speaker is a flight atten-
dant offering drinks, you can say, “Okay, so my choices are . . .” and
rattle off the list. It’s harder than you think. But it’s a good start to 
raising your own awareness level about listening. You won’t use this
technique all the time or in every circumstance, but it’s a good place
to start.
 Paraphrasing: Recount, in your own words, the longer statements that
the other person has said to you. You can use this technique far more
often than the first. Don’t be embarrassed if you get it wrong a lot when
you first start paraphrasing back. This is a good technique to use when
someone is making a dense presentation and you want to be sure that
you understand it, every step of the way.
In either case, introduce your efforts with respect and good humor. Try start-
ing with the phrase, “Let me see if I got that right. . . .”

Part II: Getting Your Point Across 

Six Barriers to Being a Good Listener
Most people try to be good listeners, and most people consider themselves
successful. Yet accusations such as “You are not listening to me!” abound.
Unfortunately, a number of barriers to listening apply to a greater or lesser
extent to everybody at some time or another.
One of the biggest reasons that listening is so hard is that our brains have
been wired for thousands of years in a certain way. You can think much
faster than anyone can talk. Speech rate is about 100 to 150 words per
minute. You can listen at more than 500 words per minute. It’s only natural
that your mind may race ahead of the words you hear and even take in other
conversations. You have to be very careful that, when this happens, you refo-
cus on the speaker. Face it: You’re battling thousands of years of pure biology.
Naturally, you are one of the lucky few who has overcome these barriers.
But if you want to find out what keeps some of your friends from listening
more effectively, you may want to read the following sections.
The defense mechanism
One reason people don’t listen carefully during a negotiation is purely psy-
chological. Generally speaking, people don’t want to get bad news. Some
people state this derisively, as in, “Oh, he just hears what he wants to hear.”
Catchphrases like that almost always have more than a kernel of truth in
them. In fact, everyone filters out bad news to one extent or another.
Every animal has stunning built-in survival mechanisms. One of the most
important survival mechanisms is to hear danger coming. A predator, a fire,
even a storm all have some advance warning signals that animals that want
to avoid danger must hear and assess. Animals run from approaching danger.
Although humans have retained many useful self-defense mechanisms,
such as blinking, ducking, and flinching in the face of danger, we seem to
have lost a very important one — the ability to hear danger coming. Perhaps
we’ve decided that simply not hearing the danger is a better approach than
hearing and, subsequently, having to deal with it. Not so. This is one case
where animals are more advanced than humans are. Only when you hear and
can accurately assess the danger you face are you in a position to avoid or
defuse it. In fact, you should force yourself to probe even deeper if you sus-
pect that bad news is lurking.
91
Chapter 7: Listening — Really, Truly Listening

People use defense mechanisms in different ways. Some scream and holler,
causing others to flinch. Some cave in to the predatory aspects of aggressors
and instead hold in frustrations or grievances, using silence as a defense.
The best thing to do is listen. In this modern world, words — not winds or
sounds or temperature shifts — are the harbinger of bad news. In the work-
place, you don’t have to worry about a physical attack. You have to worry
about a future event that you can only learn about if you hear or read about
it. So listen. Listen very carefully. It’s important for you to get as much detail
as possible about whatever bad thing is coming your way. Unlike an animal
that must run away from danger, you must stand and listen and absorb as
much information as you can.
Barton Fink, by the Coen brothers, exemplifies not listening as a defense
mechanism in all its glory. The film is about a newly successful New York
playwright, Barton Fink, played by John Turturro, who accepts an offer to
write a film while living in a creepy Los Angeles hotel. He finds himself with
writer’s block. The Hollywood studio chief who hires Fink to write the picture
is Jack Lipnick, played by Michael Lerner, a loud, brash, overbearing execu-
tive based on MGM’s legendary Louis B. Mayer. Watch the scene where Fink
has his first meeting with Lipnick. Instead of listening to Fink, Lipnick uses
every scare tactic in the book to command the room. Because he failed to
hear Fink, Lipnick thinks he gets what he wants. In this case, he commissions
Fink to take the writing job. If he had listened, he would have heard the bad
news that Fink was not the man for the job. He would have known that Fink
simply wasn’t going to write the script. He would have been a lot better off
hiring someone who at least wanted to try to write the script.
92
Part II: Getting Your Point Across 
A case of the “yeah, buts”
One of the most self-destructive ways to listen
in business and personal situations is listening
with what I call the “yeah, buts.” This condition
occurs when there is a kernel (or more) of truth
in something negative that is being said but you
don’t want to hear it. You are defensive about
what the speaker is saying, so the first response
out of your mouth is “yeah, but.” Whether you’re
listening to a customer, boss, or spouse, you’ve
got to put the automatic “yeah, but” response
on hold. Watch out for responses like these:
 “Yeah, I know, but you’re not our only 
customer.”
 “Yeah, but honey, you’re always on my case
about that.”
 “Yeah, but you always use that tone of voice
with me.”
These responses keep you from hearing the
other person. You block out any chance you
have of learning something from this person.
You want to say “I hear you” or “I understand”
first. Then make sure that you do. Ask questions
to find out as much as possible about what the
other person is saying. Don’t stop until you fully
understand what is being said; then — and only
then — you can try to explain the situation. You
will get more positive results this way.

Weak self-confidence (the butterflies)
Many people who talk too much when they should be listening do so out
of nervousness. Talking a great deal is often a mask for, or a result of, old-
fashioned butterflies.
Butterflies are lethal to good listening — they cause a person’s mind to race
around searching for an answer, observation, or anecdote while the other
person is speaking. A mind in motion blocks listening as effectively as a mouth
in motion. Think back to your worst interview ever. Chances are that it didn’t
go well because you weren’t listening and, most likely, were talking too much.
Job interviews are nerve-racking experiences. The butterflies fly at full speed.
In the heat of the moment, you don’t realize how much you are talking.
By and large, the same people who talk too much usually don’t even listen to
themselves. Interrupt them and ask them to repeat something they just said,
and they can’t do it. They talk, but they don’t listen — not even to themselves!
An unfortunate side effect often occurs when your mind is racing during 
communication. The person speaking takes your silence for listening, not pre-
occupation. Then, when you give an inappropriate answer or, worse, a loud
“Huh?” that person makes an immediate and inaccurate assessment of your
IQ. In essence, you make yourself look stupid, something you don’t want to
do, especially during a negotiation. It sets you up for failure.
Understand that butterflies are not free. They are expensive. If your butterflies
cause you to lose control of your mouth when you need to be listening, they
can cost you a job, a sale, a contract, or a date. Take a moment to breathe the
next time you interview for a job or buy a car or audition for a role. A calm
mind allows you to focus on what you say without saying too much. Better yet,
it helps you listen.
Rechanneling anxieties into positive energy makes you look confident and in
control in listening situations, as well as when you speak. Energy can volun-
tarily escape your body through five channels: eyes, hands, feet, body, and
voice. Releasing your energy through eye contact is better than talking too
much. Leaning forward and listening harder is better than talking too much.
The key is to recognize that these feelings of anxiety are actually energy that
your body is generating to help move you through a dangerous situation. If it
sounds somewhat primordial, it is. The better your skills, the less threatened
you feel and the less nervous energy your body must manage. Be aware of
the ways in which butterflies affect each of these channels:
 Eyes: Butterflies cause you to look away from the person sitting across
from you, giving the impression that you’re not focused. Don’t let your
eyes flit around. Stay focused on the speaker.
93
Chapter 7: Listening — Really, Truly Listening

 Hands: Butterflies cause you to fidget or wring your hands. Sit on your
hands if you have to, but don’t be fidgety with them. Sometimes you can
settle the butterflies by clenching your hands in your lap. This drains
some of that energy that the butterflies create.
 Feet: Butterflies cause you to inadvertently tap your feet. This little tap
dance is real irritating. Instead, press your feet hard against the floor.
This is not noticeable and, like the clenched hands in the lap, can help
drain off all that nervous energy that is coming out through your feet.
 Body: Butterflies cause you to slouch or cross your arms against your
chest. This reaction isn’t as bad as some of the other behaviors because
a lot of people do this naturally. However, it makes you look very unre-
ceptive. Again, if this is the way the butterflies affect you, add some
push to it. Tense your muscles to relieve the pressure of the extra
energy and get you to a place where you can relax.
 Voice: Butterflies cause your voice to quiver or make you talk softly or
too loudly. Stuttering can also be a problem. This is the toughest chan-
nel to control because your voice is the hardest to hide and one of the
most obvious indicators of nervousness. Try not to talk much until you
get the butterflies back in their cage. When you do talk, use short words
and short sentences. Eventually, the butterflies leave.
Try to refocus your energy on listening instead of blocking. You can avoid the
pitfalls of the butterflies, but it takes a prolonged, conscientious effort.
The energy drag
Your energy can drag in two ways. One is the effect of your very own biorhythm
or energy cycle. The other is some specific factor that affects you at a specific
time for a specific reason. I talk about the biorhythm first.
Every human being has a biorhythm. That means that each person has a time
of day when his or her energy naturally peaks and a time of day when his or
her energy naturally slumps. It’s part of the human condition, and it’s slightly
different for everyone. This rhythm occurs totally independent of any specific
events. You have heard people say, “I’m not a morning person” or “She’s a
real night person.” They are talking about the natural biorhythm. By the time
you become an adult, you have a good idea of what the best time of the day is
for you to do various things.
And it’s not just the amount of energy, but what the energy is good for. I like
to write in the morning. If I can, I schedule meetings for the afternoon so my
reading and drafting activities take place during the morning hours. That’s me.
If at all possible, I schedule serious negotiations for the afternoon.
94
Part II: Getting Your Point Across 

What is your biorhythm? How do you normally function in the morning, the
afternoon, and the evening? It’s important to do what you can to match your
activities up with your own natural biorhythm. This isn’t always possible, not
even for me, but it’s a worthy goal to have in mind.
In the office, try not to schedule negotiations for the latter part of your work-
day, if that’s when your energy tends to be lower. For you, your mind won’t
be as fresh as it is before lunch, for example. You don’t carry the “baggage” of
your workday with you if you schedule meetings during the first half of the day.
On the contrary, you may have had a good day at work and you’re pumped
and ready for a negotiation late in the day.
But what if the other party is experiencing an energy drag? What if the other
party isn’t having a good day? Perhaps your counterpart doesn’t want to listen.
Your negotiation is then similarly in danger of not proceeding well. The unfortu-
nate truth is that often the two negotiators will have different rhythms to their
energy. You just have to try to make things work the best for you because it’s
not possible to change someone else’s rhythm. No matter what biorhythm may
be involved, more often than not specific circumstances will trump the bio-
rhythm. Sometimes people are just too tired to listen. Listening takes energy.
If your energy is flagging because of a lack of sleep or the crush of other busi-
ness, you have a hard time listening. Be aware of that fact. You probably have
said or heard, “Slow down, I’ve had a long day at work.” That’s the sound of
a good negotiator, someone who knows that you can’t always listen at top
speed. If the speaker needs to slow down for you to fully participate and pay
attention, just say so.
Habit
Maybe you have, over time, developed the habit of talking or thinking ahead
when you should be listening. If this is the case, you can treat this habit like
smoking; you can quit.
Changing this behavior pattern is difficult because you have to do it on your
own. No nicotine patch is available for effective listening. The more status
and power you have, the less likely people are to tell you that they think you’re
not listening. They notice. They react. They just don’t tell you. It’s like bad
breath; many notice, and few comment.
Habits are hard to break, no question about it. Just think about all the money
that has been made trying to get people to break the smoking habit or change
eating habits or stop a drinking habit. You won’t find many courses on chang-
ing listening habits because bad listeners usually aren’t so self-aware, and
their behavior isn’t so noticeably and immediately destructive.
95
Chapter 7: Listening — Really, Truly Listening

If you really want to break the habit of not listening, you can use the following
steps to improve. Don’t be too hard on yourself if your improvement isn’t as
a rapid as you would like. You’re way ahead of the pack for even trying.
1. Be aware of how you listen whenever anyone talks.
Do you actually turn physically toward them and look them in the eye,
or do you continue multitasking in some fashion or other?
2. Monitor how often your mind wanders, thinking of something else.
Wouldn’t it be embarrassing if an audible alarm went off every time your
mind wandered during a conversation?
3. Actively work on bringing your mind back to the conversation at
hand each and every time it wanders.
No matter how boring the speaker is, bring your mind back, and then try
to use questions to keep things more interesting. Chapter 8 talks about
nothing but asking questions. One of the best uses of questions is for
turning the boring into the interesting.
The preconception
Beware of the preconception. A preconception is an expectation that prevents
your mind from staying open and receptive. Like its relative, the assumption,
the preconception is an enemy to listening. Both problems seem to prey on
people in long-term relationships.
A preconception is a notion that just because a person has behaved one way
before, he or she will act that way again. If a person blusters once, for exam-
ple, you may well jump to the conclusion that the individual will display the
same behavior during the next negotiation. “Oh, he’s just that way” may be
an accurate statement of fact. But if that conclusion is used as an explanation
for every outburst, it may well mask the reality that the blustering party is
quite angry at some aspect of your behavior. The blusterer may be genuinely
frustrated this time at not being able to reach a deal or may be reacting to
pressures from places not related to the negotiation.
So how do you fight the preconception? Greet a person as though you are
meeting him or her for the first time. Practice on your receptionist or
whomever you first see at work. Stop. Turn. Look the person in the eye.
Ask, “How are you today?” And listen, really listen, to the answer. If you greet
people as though you are meeting them for the very first time, you will go a
long way to conquering preconceptions.
96
Part II: Getting Your Point Across 

Not expecting value in others
Many people don’t listen simply because they aren’t expecting others to say
anything of value. Every human being has something to contribute. Sometimes
you must do some digging, but everyone has some special knowledge. In a
negotiation, the other party has a great deal of beneficial information. But if
your normal mind-set is that the people you talk to have very little to con-
tribute, turning that around and listening effectively may be difficult.
When some people speak, what they have to say and how they go about
saying it is, to put it bluntly, boring. Spending the energy to listen to such
people may not seem worth the effort. But even these people often have 
valuable information and insight. Your job is to draw such speakers out.
Question them until you hit some nugget of interesting information.
In fact, good listeners tend to attract much more interesting company than
others. It’s also true that, by listening carefully to the company you keep, you
learn much more about the subjects that make them interesting.
Listening can be like sifting through sand on the beach. This is truer at a
cocktail party than at a scheduled negotiating session. To be the best possi-
ble listener at the negotiating session, you can practice at cocktail parties.
The next time you have to go to a party, keep repeating, “Buried within this
chatter is something of value.” If you want to find it, you can.
Becoming a Good Listener
I have five ways you can improve your listening skills right now. These tech-
niques are easy to use and bring immediate results.
Clear away the clutter
To be a good listener, you have to clear out the clutter. This isn’t just a ques-
tion of good manners, it’s an absolute necessity if you want to focus on the
person speaking to you. Noise clutter, desk clutter, and even mind clutter all
interfere with good listening. It also keeps others from listening to you.
Watch Mike Judge’s satire Office Space for a lesson on clearing away the clutter.
The film, released during the dot.com bust, is about an ordinary guy, Peter
Gibbons, who works for a large, high-tech company called Initech. The lesson
on clutter comes from Milton, Peter’s co-worker who is on the verge of being
97
Chapter 7: Listening — Really, Truly Listening

laid off. Milton is a frumpy curmudgeon who hides in his cubicle behind stacks
of files. Nobody talks to Milton. He mumbles throughout most of the film, and
the annoying office manager ultimately banishes Milton to a cockroach-infested
storage room. Most of us aren’t Milton, but the eccentric character teaches
us that clearing away the clutter makes life easier. Stacks of files, trinkets on
your desk, or a red stapler will only distract others when speaking to you.
Clutter gives an initial impression of disorganization. Disorganization leads to
mistrust from the other party because it sends the message that if your desk
is disorganized, so is your way of being.
Our law firm used to have an attorney whose office was such a mess that I
quit giving him work. I would go into his office with something that needed to
get done, see the mess, and leave without ever mentioning the task. We devel-
oped a wonderful friendship, but I took the work down the hall to another
attorney who always completed the task on time and without me worrying
one bit that it would be lost in a big pile on his desk. The lawyer who did the
work had a desk that was immaculate. He listened carefully to my instruc-
tions and never, ever missed a deadline. He was so busy that he eventually
left us to go out on his own where he is doing very well.
Think about the worst listener you’ve encountered in your life. If you have
a teenager, you probably don’t have to look far. Consider the all-too-typical
teen’s life: an MP3 player plugged into both ears, television set blaring, books
and clothes strewn everywhere. No wonder your teenager can’t hear you.
Your words may temporarily penetrate the chaos, but the full content of your
message doesn’t get through. It can’t get through all the clutter.
Why not learn from your teenager’s mistakes?
 When you talk to someone, don’t just mute the television set, turn it off.
 If you have something else on your mind, write it down before you enter
a conversation. With a note as a reminder, you won’t worry about forget-
ting to address the issue — and your mind is free to concentrate on the
conversation.
 Clear your desk — or whatever is between you and the speaker — so
you can focus on what the speaker is saying.
 Don’t accept phone calls while you’re talking with someone else.
Interrupting a conversation to take a telephone call makes the person
in the room with you feel unimportant and makes what you have to say
seem unimportant.
When a co-worker comes to your office, don’t feel that you need to engage in
a discussion right away. If you know that you need to finish a task, you may
be better off delaying the conversation. Otherwise, the unfinished task will
play gently on your mind and distract you from listening effectively. If the
project you’re engaged in will only take a moment to complete, try saying,
“Just a minute, let me finish this so I can give you my full attention.” If it’s
going to take a while, ask to schedule a meeting for later that day. You may be
98
Part II: Getting Your Point Across 

afraid that the other person will be insulted if you put him or her off. In fact,
the vast majority of people are flattered that you actually want to listen.
Your co-workers would rather wait until you can listen than have you
tending to other business while they’re trying to talk to you.
The same rule holds true for phone conversations. Never try to negotiate on
the telephone while you’re reading a note from your assistant, catching up
on filing, or doing research on the Internet. Trying to do two tasks at once
simply doesn’t work. True, your ears can be engaged in listening while your
eyes are occupied with something else. However, your brain cannot simulta-
neously process the conflicting information from your eyes and from your
ears. Both messages lose out.
I know a lot of people who like to brag about their ability to multitask, and
they’re probably safe to do so, if the tasks are not very important or accuracy
is not critical. But if it’s anything important, don’t multitask. Don’t ever try to
con yourself into believing that you can listen effectively while you’re doing
something else that requires the least little bit of brainpower.
To be a better listener, clear the clutter away — from your ears, your desk,
and your mind. Nothing gets in the way like stuff. Get rid of it.
Take notes
Taking notes is a great listening aid. Regardless of whether you ever refer to
your notes again, the mere act of writing down the salient points boosts the
entire listening process. Writing information down engages other parts of
your brain, as well as your eyes and fingers, in the listening process. It’s almost
impossible for a person to fully absorb an entire conversation of any length
without making some written notes.
Making notes is important throughout every step of the negotiating process.
Immediately after a negotiating session, review your notes to be sure that you
wrote down everything you may want to recall, and that you can read every-
thing you wrote down. Remember from your student days how confusing old
notes can be: strange abbreviations, unintelligible squiggles, large coffee stains.
When you are comfortable with your notes, consider providing a status
report to the other side. A confirming memo is an excellent way to assure
that you listened well. Writing down what you think you heard and verifying
the material with the other side are positive experiences for both parties.
However, if your counterpart believes that you recorded the conversation
incorrectly, he or she may get angry and reject your version. You still win in
such a case. Your memo serves an excellent purpose if the response reveals
that you and your counterpart have conflicting views of the proceedings.
Immediately thank the other party. Point out that you wrote the memo to be
sure that you listened well and interpreted the discussion accurately.
99
Chapter 7: Listening — Really, Truly Listening

You may not have listened carefully, but it’s just as likely that the other party
is correcting a sloppy communication to you. People often change or refine
their positions after they see them in black and white. Let that modification
happen gracefully. When the other party provides a new version of the nego-
tiation, simply change your notes. Don’t argue about the past conversation.
Fighting over who said what seldom furthers the negotiations; identifying the
opposing party’s position does. Remember: You write it out to get it right.
In family meetings, recording negotiations and agreements is often just as
important as it is in business meetings. Make a habit of writing down house
rules of conduct for young children and chores for older children. I even
know some couples who write out agreements between spouses or loved
ones. That way, everyone is clear on the expectations. Your life is easier, and
behavior is more consistent.
Ask questions
Asking questions is so important that I devote all of Chapter 8 to various
techniques of asking questions. I won’t detract from that chapter by trying to
abbreviate the subject here. Just remember that asking the right questions at
the right times, and listening to the answers, can move a negotiation forward
in a way that nothing else can.
Count to three
One. Two. Three. Here’s an extraordinarily simple device to help you listen
more effectively. Just count to three before you speak. This slight delay
enables you to absorb and understand the last statement before you
respond. The delay also announces that you have given some thought to
what you are about to say. It gives oomph to the words that will come out
of your mouth.

Using the edge of your seat
I love movies and theater and attend many
shows in Los Angeles. Occasionally, I have to sit
through a performance I don’t enjoy or a movie
that feels tedious, and my attention sometimes
begins to drift. If I feel myself losing interest, I
physically lean forward in my seat. Sometimes,
I actually slide forward a bit.
When I sit on the edge of my seat, my interest
seems to renew itself — a strange reversal of the
normal cause-and-effect relationship. By staring
at the screen or looking at the stage bright-eyed,
I actually become more alert. My friends confirm
that they have experienced the same outcome.
Try this technique the next time nature seems to
be overpowering your ability to stay focused.

As you practice this skill over time, counting may not be necessary, but the
pause always pays off. You absorb the message, and you give the other party
one last chance to modify the statement or question. Even if your response is
simply that you must consult with your client, spouse, or boss, pausing for
three beats helps you better comprehend and remember what the other
person said.
Wake yourself up
If you are truly interested in what the other party is saying, look the part.
Keep your eyes focused. Acknowledge the other party’s words with a nod.
However, if you feel yourself getting drowsy, don’t give in. Sit up straighter.
Stand up. Get the blood flowing in whatever way works for you. Don’t think
that you can effectively hide flagging interest without changing your physical
position. If you are tired, it will show. And if boredom sets in, don’t expect a
lively conversation and don’t expect a good negotiation.
In your very next conversation, just for the fun of it, assume the most atten-
tive position you can. Observe how this change in behavior improves your
listening skills. Follow these tips for enhancing your next conversation:
 Uncross your arms and legs.
 Sit straight in the chair.
 Face the speaker full on.
 Lean forward.
 Make as much eye contact as you can.
Listening Your Way up 
the Corporate Ladder
In a negotiation, silence is golden — in fact, it is money in the bank.
Remember, you can’t listen and talk at the same time (not to yourself or
to anyone else). Many a negotiation has been blown — and many a sale
lost — because someone kept talking long after discussion was necessary
or desirable. Conversely, many an opportunity to gain valuable information
has been lost because the listening activity stops too soon.
One of the best ways to control a meeting is to listen to everyone in the room.
Pretty soon you’ll be running the meeting. If a big talker is monopolizing the
negotiation, that person probably doesn’t even recognize that others want
to contribute to the discussion. Stifle your instinct to grab the floor yourself.
101
Chapter 7: Listening — Really, Truly Listening

Instead, point out someone else who looks as though he or she is trying to talk.
“Jane, you look like you had a comment on that.” Jane appreciates it, others
appreciate it, and you suddenly control the meeting even if you’re the junior
person at the table. Sometimes others can make your point for you. If you find
that you still have something to add, the group will probably let you do so.
You are now a hero, even to members of the other negotiating team. When you
do say something, everyone listens out of appreciation — if not admiration.
Various studies have shown that successful people listen better than their
counterparts — especially on their way up. Ironically, great success sometimes
causes a person to be a less sensitive listener, usually to that person’s detri-
ment. The most visible example is the president of the United States, who must
listen well during the rise to political power. However, a sitting president can
easily become cut off from the very people who helped in the ascent. The iso-
lated president is a common feature of the American political landscape.
To become successful in the business world and stay successful, you must be
a good listener. Here are some examples of the importance of listening effec-
tively while you’re on the clock:
 Many managers face setbacks in their careers when they prejudge an
employee before they hear all sides of the story. If you want to gain
respect as a manager, gather all the data from all the parties before you
take any action.
 New employees need to listen first when they enter a meeting or a
department. Get the lay of the land. Resist that first verbal contribution,
which will be everyone’s first impression of you, until you know that the
contribution is a good one.
 Salespeople lose sales when they talk more than they listen. The suc-
cessful ones use empathetic statements to show they understand what
the customer is saying and how he or she is feeling.
Broadway Danny Rose is one of Woody Allen’s best films. You don’t have to
like Woody Allen to like this movie. It’s all about some very senior stand-up
comics (has-been, borscht-belt guys) sitting around New York’s famous
Carnegie Deli reminiscing about the life of a renegade agent named Danny
Rose (played by Woody Allen).
During the movie, note that Woody Allen’s character talks nonstop without
ever stopping to think what he is saying. But he hangs in there. Give that
man points for tenacity. His negotiating success is purely accidental from a
technical point of view. He never uses any of the negotiating skills in this book.
You may wonder why people spend the time and effort becoming good nego-
tiators when people like Broadway Danny Rose can succeed without skills.
The movie demonstrates just how accidental his success is. Life is sweeping
this man along. He just keeps talking.

Asking the Right Questions
In This Chapter
 Developing the ability to ask good questions
 Avoiding the pitfalls of questioning
 Getting the information you need
 Making sure people are listening
“A prudent question is one half of wisdom.”
—Francis Bacon
H
ow you ask questions during a negotiation is very important because
questions open the door to knowledge — knowledge about the other
party and knowledge about the negotiation at hand. Questions are the keys
to the kingdom. No one ever wasted time asking a smart question.
This chapter covers the art of effective questioning during a negotiation.
Asking appropriate questions, knowing when to ask those questions, and
knowing when not to ask those questions are all techniques you should
master. They will lead you to a path of negotiating success. And even if a
negotiation is at a standstill, knowing how to ask the right questions creates a
discussion between you and the other party. That can lead to positive results
if your information is funneled wisely.
Tickle It Out: The Art of Coaxing 
Out Information
Effective listening requires probing. No one says everything you want to hear
in the exact order, depth, and detail that you prefer. You have to ask. No phrase
describes the job of questioning better than tickle it out. Questions are a way
of coaxing out information that you want or need.

In a trial, the question-and-answer format rules the proceedings. Attorneys
and the judge can talk to each other in declarative sentences, but all the testi-
mony is presented in the somewhat artificial format of question-and-answer.
In court, the purpose of every question should be to obtain specific informa-
tion. If the question isn’t answered directly, it needs to be asked in another
way. The rules in the courtroom are pretty specific; as a matter of etiquette,
you should apply similar rules in a business meeting. For example, courtesy
prohibits you from barraging the other side with rapid-fire questions; court
rules prevent the same thing.
Developing the ability to ask good questions is a lifelong effort. If you have the
opportunity to observe a trial, notice that the primary difference between
the experienced attorney and the less-experienced attorney is the ability
of the former to ask the right question at the right time. Almost without fail,
the key question is not a bombastic, confrontational inquiry, but a simple,
easy-to-understand question designed to extract specific information.
An excellent example of tickling it out occurred in the O. J. Simpson murder
trial during the questioning of police officer Mark Fuhrman. Lengthy, soft-
spoken questions led up to the simple query, “In the last ten years, have you
used the ‘n’ word?” “No,” the officer replied. “Are you sure?” the attorney
asked. “Yes, sir,” Mark Fuhrman responded. There were no fireworks, no vic-
tory dances at that point, but the quiet exchange permanently altered the
trial. Because Fuhrman’s statement wasn’t true, the defense was able to call
witness after witness to impeach his testimony. Eventually, the truth about
Fuhrman’s behavior smashed against that statement so explosively that
every other piece of evidence was damaged. Fuhrman and all his co-workers
were hurt by those brief words so gently tickled out during questioning.
About the only place you can regularly see trained people posing careful
questions is on the cable channel Court TV. It makes documentary series
related to courts and the law, and it airs real trials as they’re happening.
Tune in to one of the televised trials where you can see the question-asking
process in a carefully structured environment. You can learn a great deal
about how to ask questions by watching these court proceedings. Watch and
listen as the lawyers ask their questions. Obviously, various attorneys have
different skill levels. Some are better than others. Watching these men and
women in action sensitizes you to the good and bad aspects of questioning.
Okay, I know Columbo is a television show, but the entire series is available on
DVD! The famous detective, performed so consistently by Peter Falk, perfectly
demonstrates the key skill of a good negotiator: asking really good questions.
You will find Columbo using every type of question and listening to the answer.
No single source better demonstrates how to ask questions. You can learn
much more from Columbo. Study the man. Let him be your mentor as he enter-
tains you. He also has incredible integrity. He sets his goal and never wavers.
His steely determination brings victory in the toughest of circumstances.

Part II: Getting Your Point Across 

Battling the jargon
Don’t be shy or embarrassed about asking someone to clarify a statement.
Many people use jargon or shorthand when they talk, so you can’t always be
sure of what they mean. For example, when I met with the head of marketing
for the For Dummies book series, she started talking about the AMC. I teased
her about the jargon that, to me, meant American Multi Cinema, a large chain of
motion picture theaters. She quickly identified AMC as the advanced marketing
chapter, which is sent to various buyers months before the entire book is ready
for print. This situation was easy to handle because the brand manager was
happy to clarify. I just needed to ask.
A slightly more difficult situation arises when you are both in the same indus-
try, and the other person assumes that you know the meaning of words that
he or she is using. You may feel embarrassed to ask for the meaning under
that circumstance, because you think that you should know. You can handle
this situation by saying, “Just to be sure that we are using our shorthand in
the same way, tell me exactly how you define XYZ.” When the other person
gives you his or her definition, use it. Here are three useful responses when
the other party defines a term for you:
 “That’s great! We use that phrase the same way.”
 “Glad I asked; we use that phrase a little differently, but we can go with
your definition.”
 “Thanks, I just learned something new.”
If you really think the other person is miles off the target and some real
damage may be done if you use the word his or her way instead of your way,
say: “We should define that term in the written agreement so others won’t get
confused. You and I know what we are talking about, but we want to be sure
that everyone else does, too.” Don’t get into a battle over definitions.
There’s a third situation in which you may run into jargon. Some people, par-
ticularly doctors, lawyers, and accountants, use jargon to impress others
with their knowledge, power, or position.
As often as not, they use this device on their own clients. Use the preceding
techniques to get clear on the conversation, but if the problem is chronic,
look for another professional to serve your needs.
Clarifying relativity
Requiring others to define relative words is just as important as asking them
to explain specific pieces of jargon. Relative words are nonspecific, descriptive
words that only have meaning in relation to something else.
105
Chapter 8: Asking the Right Questions

Here are some examples of relative words that can create a great deal of 
confusion:
 Cheap
 High quality
 Large
 Many
 Soon
 Substantial
Don’t be shy about asking for clarification when someone lays one of these
words on you. If the person insists on using generalities, as some people do,
press for a range. If you still don’t get a specific answer, supply two or three
ranges and force the person to choose one.
106
Part II: Getting Your Point Across 
How big’s your pocket?
I wish I could say that I always eliminated the
confusions that occur when vague terms are
used. The truth is that people think that they don’t
have time to do so. Sometimes, you just want to
get out of a conversational situation, and the
last thing you want to do is prolong things by
making absolutely sure that you have all the
details correct. Other times, being specific just
doesn’t seem that important. Rarely do any of
these “reasons” outweigh the benefits of get-
ting specific information.
I recently had a meeting with a wealthy investor.
When we were finished discussing the subject
of our meeting, he mentioned that he had given
“pocket money” to one of my clients. I took that,
quite literally, as a small amount of reimbursement
for nonspecific expenses. I thought, “Oh, that’s
nice” and said as much. In the South, we call
that kind of money “walking around money.”
Later, I learned that he had written a check for
$100,000 and was annoyed and frustrated with
my client at the way the money was being spent.
He was also unhappy with me for not rectifying
the situation after he had informed me about it.
Needless to say, I was shocked to learn all of
this from a trusted friend whom the investor and
I had in common. Fortunately, we were able to
remedy the problem right away.
If his comment had been the subject of the
meeting, I would have sought clarification at the
moment. As it was, I didn’t give the comment much
thought, and his annoyance continued to simmer
until I heard the complaint clearly two weeks later
and was able to fix it. This story is a happy one
because I learned the details fairly quickly. The sit-
uation could have smoldered and seriously dam-
aged my client’s and (unfairly) my own relationship
with that investor. And why? Lack of clarity. When
my client explained carefully and completely how
the money was being spent, the investor was not
only satisfied, he advanced more money. Some
of the best time you can spend in almost any sit-
uation is that extra moment it takes to make
sure that everyone is communicating clearly.

Let’s say your new customer says, “We’re thinking of placing a big order with
you.” That’s good news if you and your new customer both use the words
“big order” the same way. But you need to ask for specifics. If your customer
doesn’t answer with a number, you can say, “Do you mean more like ten, or
maybe about a hundred, or would it be closer to a thousand?” Whatever the
answer is, just say “thank you.” Don’t belabor the point that you wouldn’t call
that a “big order.” You should make a note of the information, as well.
These situations offer a great opportunity to find out more about the com-
pany that you’re dealing with. It’s a good time to ask questions about the
normal size of the orders from this company, why it’s changing now, and
other pieces of information that will help you service this client much better.
Asking Good Questions: A Real Power Tool
When you listen attentively, you make an incredible discovery. Sometimes,
the person is not delivering the information you need. The chief tool of the
good listener is a good question. Questions are marvelous tools for stimulat-
ing, drawing out, and guiding communication.
Asking a good question is a learned skill requiring years of training. The founda-
tion of good question-asking is knowing what information you want to obtain.
Here are seven handy guidelines for asking better questions — questions that
are likely to get to the meat of things:
 Plan your questions in advance. Prepare what you’re going to ask about
but don’t memorize the exact wording, or you’ll sound artificial. A script
is too restrictive to flow naturally into the conversation. However, it pays
to outline your purpose and a sequence of related questions. If you plan
ahead, you can follow the speaker’s train of thought and harvest much
more information. Pretty soon, the speaker is comfortably divulging
information. The question-and-answer format can act as an aid to good
communication rather than a block.
 Ask with a purpose. Every question you ask should have one of two
basic purposes: to get facts or to get opinions (see Table 8-1 for exam-
ples of each). Know which is your goal and go for it, but don’t confuse
the two concepts.
 Tailor your question to your listener. Relate questions to the listener’s
frame of reference and background. If the listener is a farmer, use farm-
ing examples. If the listener is your teenager, make references to school
life, dating, or other areas that will hit home. Be sure to use words and
phrases the listener understands. Don’t try to dazzle your 5-year-old
with your vast vocabulary or slip computer jargon in on your technolog-
ically handicapped, unenlightened boss.
107
Chapter 8: Asking the Right Questions

 Follow general questions with more specific ones. These specific
inquiries, called follow-up questions, generally get you past the fluff and
into more of the meat-and-potatoes information. This progression is
also the way that most people think, so you are leading them down a
natural path.
Never doubt how effective the follow-up question can be. It’s so power-
ful that most presidents of the United States do not allow reporters to
ask them. Pay attention during the next White House news conference.
Usually, one reporter asks one question, and then the president calls on
the next reporter to avoid a follow-up question from the first reporter.
The follow-up question is the one that ferrets out the facts.
 Keep questions short and clear — cover only one subject. Again, this
tip helps you shape your questioning technique to the way the mind
really works. People have to process your question. This is no time to
show off. Ask simple questions. Questions are just a way to lead people
into telling you what you want to know. If you really want to know two
different things, ask two different questions. You’re the one who wants
the information; you’re the one who should do the work. Crafting short
questions takes more energy, but the effort is worth it. Pretty soon, the
other party is talking to you about the subject, and you can drop the
questioning all together.
 Make transitions between their answers and your questions. Listen to
the answer to your first question. Use something in the answer to frame
your next question. Even if this takes you off the path for a while, it leads
to rich rewards because of the comfort level it provides to the person
you are questioning. This approach also sounds more conversational
and therefore less threatening. This is one reason why I urge you to plan
your questions, not to memorize them.
 Don’t interrupt; let the other person answer the question! You’re asking
the questions to get answers, so it almost goes without saying that you
need to stop talking and listen.
The film The Silence of the Lambs is an excellent example of each of the above
elements of the question-and-answer dynamic. In one of the film’s pivotal
scenes, FBI agent Clarice Starling questions the sinister Dr. Hannibal Lecter
in his dungeon-like holding cell. She wants clues about a serial killer on the
loose. Lecter offers to provide her with clues if she provides him with stories
of her past. Watch how Starling quietly listens to Lecter’s questions and how
she asks for the clues to help her find the killer. Both parties ask direct and
tailored questions planned in advance. Watch the question-and-answer scenes
in the film for a lesson not only in how to ask questions, but also in how to
wait patiently for the answer.

Table 8-1
The Two Goals of Asking Questions
To Get Facts
To Get Opinions
“When did you begin work on the plan?”
“How good is this plan?”
“How many employees are available?”
“Will the schedule work?”
“What are the dimensions of the house?”
“What do you think of the design?”
“Which car reached the intersection first?”
“Who caused the accident?”
Avoid intimidation
A sharp negotiator who is trying to sell you something may try to use a series
of questions to direct you to toward a specific conclusion. Each question is
designed to elicit a positive response — a “yes.” This sequence of questions
leads to a final query posed in the same manner. When you respond in the
affirmative to this final question, the negotiation is complete — and you have
agreed to your counterpart’s terms.
109
Chapter 8: Asking the Right Questions
Learn from negotiations by asking questions
To profit from experience, you must be open and
willing to learn, even from what some people
may consider a failure. What appears to be a
failure can actually lead to new opportunities.
That is why so many companies have post-
mortem meetings, especially after a negotiation
that did not go so well. Use open-ended ques-
tions as a starting point for the next phase of
learning. Here are a few such questions:
 What went well and why?
 What went less well and why?
 What would you do differently now?
 What would you do the same way?
 What went unexpectedly well and why?
 What went unexpectedly badly and why?
 What new assumptions/rules should be
made?
 What additional information would have
been helpful? How could you have foreseen
what happened?
 How can you improve learning in the future?

That technique may work for what I call a one-off negotiation. By that I mean a
negotiation with someone you never plan to see again, such as when you sell
a car through a newspaper ad. It doesn’t work so well with people whom you
plan to have a long-term relationship with. You want the other party to under-
stand and be content with the outcome, not to be tricked into signing a piece
of paper that he or she may regret later.
Some people use questions to intimidate or beat up on others. Someone may
ask you, “Why in the world would you want to wear a hat like that?” You may
be tempted to take off the hat and use it to pummel that person. The best
answer, in such cases, is often no answer. Let a few beats go by and then
go on without answering or acknowledging the question. Some conduct is
unworthy of any of your time or energy. Don’t try to educate such a person
on the niceties of living in a civilized society. It won’t work. Keep your eye on
your own goal and ignore the diversion.
Ask, don’t tell
How you ask questions is very important in establishing effective communi-
cation. Effective questions open the door to knowledge and understanding.
But you must be watchful that asking questions does not evolve into you
telling the other person instead of asking. You have probably heard a ques-
tion like, “Isn’t it true that no one has ever charged that much for a widget?”
or better yet, “Can you name one company that met such a deadline?”
These are statements masked as questions. You usually can detect a shift
from asking to telling by the tone of voice that the person uses as he or she
asks these questions. The art of questioning lies in truly wanting to acquire
the information that would be contained in the answer.
Effective questioning leads to the following:
 Establishing rapport: Don’t try to impress others with your ideas;
instead, establish rapport and trust by eliciting ideas from them and
expressing how much you care about hearing their ideas. Rapport is the
ability to understand and to connect with others, both mentally and
emotionally. It’s the ability to work with people to build a climate of trust
and respect. Having rapport doesn’t mean that you have to agree, but
that you understand where the other person is coming from. It starts
with accepting the other person’s point of view and his or her style of
communication.
 Better listening, deeper understanding: Oftentimes while you are talk-
ing, the other person is not listening but thinking about what he or she
is going to say. When you ask questions, you engage the other person.
He or she is much more likely to think about what you are saying. You lead
the other person in the direction you want to take the conversation.
110
Part II: Getting Your Point Across 

 Higher motivation, better follow-up: The right answer will not be
imposed by your questions. It will be found and owned by the other
person, who will be more motivated to follow it up. Most people are
much more likely to agree with what they say than with what you say.
Avoid leading questions
To get the most telling answers and objective information, don’t ask leading
questions. Leading questions contain the germ of the answer you seek. Here is
a typical example of a leading question:
The other person: “I have only used that golf club a couple of times.”
You: “How did you like the great weight and balance on that club?”
Because your question contains a glowing editorial of the golf club, the other
person will have a difficult time saying anything negative about it, even if
that’s what he or she feels. A nonleading question, such as “How do you like
it?” is neutral and more likely to elicit the truth. That’s what you want to hear.
If the other person swallows his true opinion or simply fails to express it to
you because of the way you asked the question, you are the loser. The other
person hasn’t altered his feelings, he just hasn’t expressed them. You have
lost an opportunity to influence him.
Here are some more examples of leading questions:
 “Don’t you think that such-and-such is true?”
 “Isn’t $10 the usual price of this item?”
 “Everyone agrees that this widget is best; don’t you?”
If phrased in a nonleading way, these questions are more likely to extract
accurate information or honest opinions. Here are the same three questions
reworded:
 “What do you think about such-and-such?”
 “What is the usual price of this item?”
 “Which widget do you think is best?”
Leading questions don’t help you improve your listening skills or get the highest
quality information. As a sales tool, however, you may want to lead the person
to purchase an item on terms favorable to you. When you’re closing a deal,
the leading question may help lead the other person right to a close. In this
section, we are looking at questions you ask to find out what the other party
is thinking, not to affirm your own views or serve your own financial interests.
111
Chapter 8: Asking the Right Questions

In court, leading questions aren’t allowed. Witnesses are forced by the laws
of evidence to give their own views, not to mimic what the lawyer wants.
That’s because in court — as in this section — the focus is to find out what
factual information the witness has to offer or what honest, independent
opinion the witness has formed.
Don’t assume anything
We all know that the word “assume” makes an “ass” out of “u” and “me.”
When people make flagrant and obvious assumptions, they tend to make a
joke about it. What most people don’t realize is how many times each day
they make routine assumptions about the intention of the other speaker,
without double-checking with that person.
Good listening requires that you don’t assume anything about the intention
of the speaker. This rule is especially true in conversations with family,
friends, and work associates. You learn how they use words and often know
their verbal shorthand. This familiarity can lead you to presume that you
understand a friend’s, family member’s, or co-worker’s point — without 
carefully considering what this person is actually saying to you. Be wary
of jumping to conclusions about the speaker’s intent, especially with the
important inner circle of people closest to you.
Lawyers say, “Don’t assume facts not in evidence.” This legal principle covers
a group of questions that are not allowed in a court of law. The most famous
example of a question that assumes a fact is
“When did you stop beating your wife?”
This question is actually a trap because the wording implies that you beat
your wife in the past. This example demonstrates why such questions impede
good communication. The question immediately puts someone on the defen-
sive, and responding accurately is impossible if the underlying assumption is
false. If the speaker’s purpose is to draw out the truth, these three questions
are more objective:
 “Did you ever beat your wife?”
 (If yes) “Have you stopped beating your wife?”
 (If yes) “When did you stop beating your wife?”
In business, leading questions are often viewed as improper. At a minimum,
they are challenging, which often leads to hostility. Here is an example:
“Why does your company insist on overcharging on this item?”
112
Part II: Getting Your Point Across 

Now break down this question so it doesn’t assume any facts not in evidence.
Again, to get at the information objectively requires three questions. It also
eliminates the hostility.
 “What does your company charge for this item?”
 “What do other companies charge for this item?”
 “Why do you think this discrepancy in pricing exists?”
Note that in this example you and the other person may have different pricing
information. Breaking the question down into three parts offers an opportu-
nity to clear up this difference without getting into an argument.
At home, such questions often get viewed as accusations. Because of the
emotional ties, such questions can be even more off-putting than they are at
work. They can launch an argument pretty quickly. Consider this question
that assumes a fact that the other party may not agree with:
“Why won’t you ever talk about it?”
This particular example shows how such a question seems to assume an
unwillingness to communicate. In fact, the other party may want to talk about
“it” but doesn’t have the skill-set or the emotional strength or the trust to talk
about a particular subject. Try breaking this question down so it contains no
assumptions. Guess what — it takes three questions again. As you read these
questions, play them out in your mind trying to picture the reaction of some-
one you’re close with.
 “Would you be willing to talk about it sometime?”
 “What are the circumstances that would make it easy for you?”
 “How can I help create those circumstances?”
Ask open-ended questions
Unlike simple yes-or-no questions, open-ended questions invite the respondent
to talk — and enable you to get much more information. These are the types of
questions to use when you want to find out a person’s opinion or gather some
facts during the course of a negotiation. The more you get the other person
to talk, the more information you learn. Yes-or-no questions limit choices and
force a decision. These types of questions are called closed questions.
Here is a simple closed question requiring a yes-or-no answer:
“Do you like this car?”
113
Chapter 8: Asking the Right Questions

An open-ended question, on the other hand, encourages the person to start
talking:
“What do you like best about this car?”
Try some classic open-ended questions when you need to get information.
These questions invite the other party to open up and tell all:
“What happened next?’
“So how did that make you feel?”
“Tell me about that.”
Notice in the last example that you can ask a question in the declarative
format (as a request rather than as a traditional question). That technique
can be very useful if you’re dealing with a reluctant participant. People who
won’t answer questions will sometimes respond to a direct order.
Open-ended questions aren’t the only types of questions you can use to get
people to talk. Here are some other types of questions to help get responses
you need:
 Fact-finding questions: These questions are aimed at getting informa-
tion on a particular subject. “Can you tell me the story about how you
decided to bring this product to the market?”
 Follow-up questions: These questions are used to get more information
or to elicit an opinion. “So after you do that, what would happen next?”
 Feedback questions: These questions are aimed at finding the difference
that makes the difference. “May I say that back to you so I understand the
difference between what you are proposing and what I was offering to do?”
Ask again
When a speaker fails to answer your question, you have two choices, depend-
ing on the situation.
 Stop everything until you get your answer or a clear acknowledgment
that your question will not be answered. Silence can be golden at these
opportunities. Most of us are uncomfortable with silence. An individual
may feel compelled to answer a difficult question if you remain silent
after posing the question. “The next one who speaks loses.”
 Bide your time and ask the question later. If the question was worth
asking in the first place, it’s worth asking again.
114
Part II: Getting Your Point Across 

Which of these two techniques you use depends on the situation. If the 
situation is fast paced and the information you requested is fundamental to
decision making, use the first technique. You can choose the second technique
(to bide your time) whenever you know that you’ll have another opportunity
to get the information, and you don’t need the information right away. Biding
your time is always easier and less confrontational, but if you really need a
piece of data, don’t be afraid to say, “Wait, I need to know. . . .”
A good way to handle someone who doesn’t answer your question is to make
a little joke out of the situation with a statement such as, “You’re leaving me
in the dust,” or “I need to catch up.” No matter how serious the subject
matter of the negotiation, a little humor never hurts, especially if you don’t
spare yourself as a subject of that humor.
If the person makes a little joke back to avoid the question, you may have to
shift back to a serious mode. Persevere until you either get an answer to your
question or you realize that you must go elsewhere. If the other party isn’t
going to answer your question, make a note of that fact so you remember to
use other resources to get the answer you need.
Use your asks wisely
If you’re lucky, the opposing side will answer most of your questions before
you ask them. That’s why you shouldn’t spew out your questions like a
machine gun. Have patience. Only ask essential questions. If you don’t care
about the answer one way or the other, don’t ask. You are granted only so
many asks in any conversation. Don’t use them indiscriminately.
Every child learns the futility of repeating the question, “Are we there yet?”
At a negotiating table, you may never “get there” if you have overstepped the
asking line. The consequences: The listener becomes oversensitive to your
probing, which often translates into resistance to answering your queries.
When someone becomes resistant in one area, they will be resistant in other
areas and, therefore, unreceptive to your general position. That’s a high price
to pay for asking too many questions.
To become a really good questioner, take some time after a negotiating session
to think about the questions you asked. Identify the extraneous questions.
Remember that every question should serve a purpose. You’re not looking
for damage that was done in that particular negotiation; you’re evaluating the
quality of the questions.
115
Chapter 8: Asking the Right Questions

Accept no substitutes
You are listening. You are asking all the right questions at the right time. You are
patient. So why aren’t you getting the information you need? One of the follow-
ing possibilities may exist:
 The person simply doesn’t understand your questions. You might try
rephrasing your questions.
 The person simply doesn’t want to answer your questions. Maybe com-
pany policy prevents disclosure of the information. Maybe the person
feels uncomfortable discussing a particular subject matter. If you believe
this is true, make a note and find out the information elsewhere.
 The person is not good at answering questions. The avoidance is not
deliberate or devious. Because of bad habits, sloppiness, or laziness, the
person neglects to respond to your inquiry. Keep probing.
 The person doesn’t know the answer and is uncomfortable in saying
so. If you suspect this, ask if the other person needs time to research the
answer.
 The person is a pathological liar. In this case, run. Never negotiate with
a liar — you can’t win.
In each of these cases, the result is the same. You are not getting a valuable
piece of information. Take the suggested possibilities to get the information
you need. Don’t give up.
Dealing with Unacceptable Responses
The next three sections discuss techniques people use to avoid providing
accurate answers. Do not allow these ploys. When you’re alert to these sub-
stitutes for honest information, you can demand the real McCoy.
Don’t tolerate the dodge
Politicians, as a group, seem specially trained to provide anything but an answer
when asked a question. It’s almost as though there is some secret college for
Congress members where they go to learn about the artful dodge. Just tune into
the Sunday morning shows that feature our elected representatives. For exam-
ple, if someone asks about the state of public education, the representative may
launch into a dissertation about family values. It’s odd how many interview-
ers let elected officials get away with avoiding questions Sunday after Sunday.
116
Part II: Getting Your Point Across 

You don’t have to do that. Don’t accept the dodge when you ask a question.
Recognize this tactic for what it is and repeat the question, this time insisting
on a real answer or an exact time when you can expect an answer.
When people say that they have to look into something and get back to you,
about the only thing you can do (without making a rather obvious and frontal
assault on their honesty) is wait. However, you can nail them down to a specific
date and time that they will “get back to you.” If the question is important
enough for the other side to delay (or not answer at all), the issue is impor-
tant enough for you to press forward. Asking, “When can I expect an answer
from you?” is a direct way of obtaining that information. Be sure to make a
note of the reply.
Don’t accept an assertion for the answer
A person who doesn’t want to answer your question may try instead to
emphatically state something close to what you’re looking for. This technique
is common when you’re asking for a commitment that the other party doesn’t
want to make.
Sometimes, an assertion about the past is substituted for an answer about
the future. For example, you ask whether a company plans to spend $50,000
on advertising in the next year. You receive an emphatic statement that the
company has spent $50,000 each year for the past four years, that sales are
rising, and that any company would be a fool to cut back now. Don’t settle for
such assertions — push for an answer. Say something like “Does that mean
that your company has made a final commitment to spend $50,000 for adver-
tising this year?”
Because assertions are sometimes delivered with a great deal of energy or
passion, you may feel awkward insisting on the answer to your question.
Not persisting with the inquiry can be fatal to your interests.
Don’t allow too many pronouns
Beware the deadly pronoun: he, she, they, especially the infamous they
and the power-gilded we. Pronouns can send you into a quagmire of mis-
understanding. Every single day, it seems, I say to someone, “Too many 
pronouns.” During a negotiation, force your counterpart to use specific
nouns and proper names. This preventive measure avoids a great deal of 
miscommunication.
117
Chapter 8: Asking the Right Questions

With pronouns, you must guess which “they” or which “we” the speaker is
talking about. Don’t guess. Just throw up your hands and say, with humor,
“Too many pronouns.” I have never met anyone who begrudged me taking
the time to clarify this issue. More often than not, the request is greeted with
a chuckle. The potential for confusion is obvious, and everyone appreciates
the effort to maintain clarity.
Look for Evidence of Listening
As you listen to the other party in a negotiation, be alert to the occasional
indicators that the other person is not really listening to you. If the other
person says something like “uh-huh” or “that’s interesting,” find out immedi-
ately whether this response is an expression of genuine interest, a way of
postponing discussion, or — equally fatal to communication — a signal that
he or she is fighting the dreaded doze monster. Those little demons that tug
at the eyelids in the middle of the afternoon cause odd, nonspecific utter-
ances to fall from the lips.
If you suspect the latter, ask a probing question or two to ferret out the truth.
Asking, “‘Uh-huh’ yes you agree, or just ‘Uh-huh’ you heard me?” is a good
way to flush out the noncommittal uh-huh.
When someone says “That’s interesting,” find out exactly what makes it inter-
esting. Don’t be afraid to keep things lively. This approach is much better
than having the conversation die right there at the negotiating table.
If you decide that, indeed, your conversational partner is simply not listening,
take a break. Often, a quick stretch or, in a more serious case of the afternoon
slumps, a walk around the block helps revive everybody. If a distraction is
causing the lagging interest in what you are saying, deal with it. Discuss the
preoccupying problem or have the distracted party make that critical call.

Listening to Body Language
In This Chapter
 Deciphering others’ body language
 Using your own body language effectively
 Putting your knowledge to work in a negotiation
 Recognizing resistance, boredom, and nervousness
 Exhibiting openness, interest, and confidence
W
e all recognize such emotions as fear, sadness, happiness, love, and
hatred in other people’s unspoken communication. Words are seldom
necessary to express these feelings. People also send subtler messages with-
out using words. Studies show that up to 65 percent of what we communicate
is nonverbal.
Honing your ability to use and understand body language is one of the most
enjoyable ways to improve negotiating skills. If you’re not already fluent in
body language, practice it. The knowledge will allow you to become a smarter
negotiator by recognizing such things as resistance, boredom, and nervous-
ness, all of which can hamper a negotiation. Those who have a command of
body language use this ability to signal their message: “I’m desirable, attractive,
and worth getting to know.”
This chapter sets out a lot of basic principals of body language in America
and how it conveys a person’s true feelings, sometimes better than the words
that are being uttered. When you are tuned into the range of expression that
is communicated through body language, you can begin to use it more con-
sciously in your negotiations, both to send messages and to understand 
communications from the other side.

Everybody’s Bilingual
In addition to the words you speak, you also use another, silent language —
body language. Body language refers to all the ways people communicate
without speaking or writing. We are born with an ability to communicate non-
verbally. In fact, we spend the first few months of our lives communicating
without words.
People can send and receive body language from four different parts of the
body. In order of expressiveness and reliability, these are:
 Facial expressions and eyes
 Arms and hands
 Legs and feet
 Torso positions and posture
It’s written all over your face
Human beings receive most nonverbal cues from the face. Because people
primarily look at each other’s faces during communication, humans have
evolved to understand facial cues the best. Professional card players rely
so heavily on controlling their facial expressions that the term poker face is
used to describe the ability to hide feelings behind a mask of nonexpression.
Interestingly, photographic studies show that even the most practiced card
sharks can’t prevent the pupils of their eyes from expanding when they open
a really good hand.
Silent signals from the rest of the body
The general rule for arms, hands, legs, and feet is that closed positions
(crossed arms and legs) signal resistance, and open positions signal
receptivity.
The torso position can be the hardest to read because posture and seating
position are often a matter of individual habit. Moreover, people don’t always
have the opportunity to observe each other’s full torso during a meeting.
Nevertheless, the torso can be a valuable source of meaning to the experi-
enced observer.
120
Part II: Getting Your Point Across 

The next time you’re at an airport or shopping mall, watch callers talk on
their cell phones. See if you can guess who is on the other end of the line, just
by observing the callers’ body language. Notice the positions of their bodies.
If a person is cradling the phone affectionately, with head cocked and body
draped languidly, a romantic interest is probably on the other end. If the
person is shifting from foot to foot and looking around, an uncomfortable per-
sonal call is probably taking place. If the caller is standing erect and staring
down at some notes or looking straight ahead in concentration, the call is,
most likely, business related.
Remember to listen
Don’t forget that body language doesn’t replace other forms of communica-
tion. Body language is part of the big communication package everyone uses
all the time. You should evaluate verbal and nonverbal messages within the
greater context of the situation. (Read the section “Don’t Believe Everything
You See,” at the end of this chapter.)
Next time you watch a feature film, pay particular attention to the actors
when they aren’t speaking. What are they saying to you with their bodies?
Consciously think about the message being communicated. The better the
actors, the more they are able to communicate without words. Feature films
can provide a wealth of education about body language, especially scenes
without dialogue.
12 Angry Men (the original black-and-white film with Henry Fonda at the center
of the action) is a film that I show at every intensive, three-day negotiating
seminar. It’s the story of a jury considering the fate of a young man accused of
murdering his father. The first vote that the jury takes is 11-1 for conviction.
Fonda, as the holdout, leads a discussion among the other jurors, but doesn’t
appear — from the dialogue — to have made any progress. Finally, he stands
and makes a bold proposal: “Let’s take one more vote — by secret ballot. If I
am the only one for ‘not guilty’ I will change my vote and we can go home.”
Obviously, someone changes his vote or the movie would have to end there.
I stop the film at that point, and we go around the room as the participants
guess which juror changes his vote. Many participants are able to pick the
correct juror from the body language. The dialogue is little help. Those par-
ticipants who do not pick the correct juror are generally off by only one or
two. By that I mean if they don’t pick the next juror to change his vote, they
pick the second or third juror to change his vote (it is, after all, a 90-minute
movie). Sometimes, a participant will still focus on the dialogue instead of the
body language, and those who do select the sixth juror to change his vote.
Rent the film. Try the exercise. It’s a real lesson in body language. My favorite
line in the movie is when one of the jurors storms out of the room while another
juror is trying to talk to him. Fonda leans over and says, “Never mind. He can’t
hear you. He never will.”
121
Chapter 9: Listening to Body Language

What Our Bodies Can Say
Verbal and written communications are not the only elements of communica-
tion in a negotiation — or in life. Good negotiators only get better when they
draw meaning and insight from the way a person stands or sits, the way a
person dresses, or the panoply of facial expressions that play out during a
conversation. That’s why, in my negotiation seminars, I say, “Listen with your
ears, your eyes, and every pore in between.”
Different nonverbal communications are associated with different attitudes.
Becoming savvy to these relationships can put you at a great advantage. As a
negotiator, you have two distinct tasks:
 Make sure that your body language expresses the message you want to
send. Your body language needs to be consistent with your words.
 Read the nonverbal signals of the person with whom you are negotiating.
You need to recognize when someone is sending conflicting words and
actions, and when someone’s gestures add emphasis to the words.
When you become a student of body language, you quickly realize that ges-
tures come in packs. Rarely does anyone invoke one random gesture to the
exclusion of all others. Rather, there is a symphony of sight and sound, all
working together.
Charmers aren’t necessarily the best-looking people in the room; they are
the ones who have a command of body language. When such a person focuses
on you, you definitely know that the person is interested; the attention can
almost make you blush. The person is employing dozens of nonverbal signals
to convey his or her focus on you.
122
Part II: Getting Your Point Across 
Making a career of reading body language
During court trials, most people focus on the
lawyers, witnesses, defendants, and victims. In
high-profile cases, however, attorneys often hire
consultants who concentrate solely on the mem-
bers of the jury. Working in the courtroom, jury
consultants study the body language of the
jurors and interpret their reactions to specific wit-
nesses and pieces of evidence. Based on these
skilled observations, the consultants try to deter-
mine which way the jury is leaning — which
witnesses are winning favor and which evi-
dence is most persuasive.
When you reenter the United States after a trip
abroad, you usually have to fill out some forms
declaring what items you are bringing into the
country. You hand the form to an immigration
official, who is trained to look at a traveler’s
eyes when asking, “Do you have anything to
declare?” What the eyes say is much more
important than what the form says.

Matching your body language 
with your words
Don’t mix and match when it comes to your body language and your spoken
words. Even people who haven’t read this book draw meaning from your
body language when you speak. People expect corresponding body language
to accompany verbal messages. Inconsistent communications from you will
throw your listener off, even if the person has never heard the phrase “body
language.”
When you’re speaking, be sure that your body language matches your words,
if you want your words to be believed. If you are enthusiastic about a project,
show that enthusiasm in your body. Don’t recline relaxed on the sofa. The mes-
sage of disinterest communicated by your body will be remembered far longer
than the words of interest that come out of your mouth.
Several reasons may explain why your body language may not match your
words.
 You’re having an energy drain. When you’re tired, keeping your body
properly expressive takes extra energy. Think about the potential posi-
tive outcome of your negotiation session. It may provide you with a
boost of adrenaline, allowing you to get through the negotiation ener-
gized instead of drained. Feed the left side of your brain with positive
thoughts and don’t lose a deal because your tired body says, “I don’t
care one way or another.” You can always stand up or walk around.
If you have to, step outside for a moment to reignite your energy.
 You’re not concentrating on the communication of the moment. As you
read about body language, you will notice that many gestures, movements,
and mannerisms indicate that a person is actually thinking about a matter
other than the current topic of conversation. If you find your mind wan-
dering, the other side will quickly see it in your face. Ask for a break so you
can make a phone call and clear a concern out of your mind. When you’re
in a negotiating session, be sure that you are in the session with your
heart, mind, and soul. Your physical presence may be much less impor-
tant than your mental presence. Athletes call it “being in the zone.”
 You have developed bad communication habits. Some classic comic
sketches illustrate this point: The disgusted spouse utters a terse, “Fine”
with lips clamped tight. This reaction lets a partner know that things are
anything but fine. And then there is the smiling letch leaning in for the
kill who says, “Why, I wouldn’t hurt a fly.” In both of these examples, the
body language trumps the spoken word. The listener gets the nonverbal
message much more clearly than the verbal message. If you have any
mannerisms that project a different meaning from the words you are
uttering, work on breaking the habit.
123
Chapter 9: Listening to Body Language

Reading someone else’s body language
Being able to accurately read the true attitude and feelings of someone across
the table can be enormously important. Seldom do you see adults physically
clap their hands over their ears to avoid hearing something, but people have
other ways of signaling that they aren’t listening, such as allowing their eyes
to wander or attending to an unrelated task.
Disney released a wonderful film called Frank and Ollie about a couple of the
world’s greatest observers of body language. Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston
were two of the original animators of such classics as Cinderella and Bambi.
This film shows them mimicking various elements of body language to 
communicate feelings and then making sketches of their own movements.
Watch this movie as a primer on body language; it illustrates the points of
this chapter better than all the words ever written on the subject.
The ability to read a person’s body language enables you to adjust your
approach to that person. Based on what you learn about the other
person’s mood or attitude, you can temper your own words and actions
appropriately — for example, you can calm down someone who’s agitated
or perk up someone who’s bored.
Discover how much fun you can have reading the body language of others.
The more you practice this skill, the better you will be at negotiating. The next
time you go to an event connected to your work, pause a moment at the door.
Instead of looking for someone you know, look over the room. Identify the
more influential people. Try to distinguish who wields power. Who are the
employers? Who are the employees? What differences in body language make
social status apparent? If you’re at a social gathering, see if you can spot very
outgoing people. Who is shy? Are any of the couples fighting?
Interpreting conflicting messages
Reading the body language of another person is not a trick to gain advantage.
It’s a tool to improve communication. People who are exhibiting incongruous
body language are frequently unaware of the fact that their spoken words and
their true feelings, as revealed by their body language, are not consistent.
By drawing out those differences and reconciling them, you have done a
great service for your side and for the person with whom you are negotiating.
If you pick up an incongruity between what a person’s body is saying and
what that person’s mouth is saying, you can assume that something is
going on. You want to take a reality check and start asking the person 
124
Part II: Getting Your Point Across 

questions about what he or she is thinking and feeling. It’s usually one of the
following:
 The person is unaware of his or her effect on others.
 The person’s body language is expressing a hidden agenda.
 The person is too tired or is confused.
I remember sitting in a theater watching the film Basic Instinct for the first
time. In the film, Michael Douglas plays a San Francisco cop who is fatally
attracted to a key suspect in an ice-pick murder. The suspect is played by
Sharon Stone, in a star-making performance. Audiences gasped during the
now infamous interrogation scene. I gasped too. Watching the film again
recently, I was reminded that the interrogation scene is a good example of
how body language can cause conflicting messages. In the scene, Douglas
and his fellow cops interrogate Stone. She twists and manipulates her words,
shamelessly toying with the cops’ libidos. Instead of nailing his suspect,
Douglas is entranced by his femme fatale and eventually falls for her schem-
ing ways. Stone is calm and collected during the entire scene, using her body
language in a risqué fashion to successfully manipulate the situation.
The nervous laugh
One of the most common examples of body language not matching the situa-
tion is the nervous laugh. A laugh that is not a reaction to anything humorous
signals nervousness or discomfort. In fact, it’s a dead giveaway. If you hear a
nervous laugh, let a few beats go by and then turn directly to the source of the
laughter and encourage that person to verbalize his or her feelings. Depending
on the situation, you may say: “Ben, how do you feel about the pricing struc-
ture?” or “Ben, how do you feel about adding Leslie to this team?” Often, the
person won’t admit to having any concerns. You know better. Keep probing.
You may have to return to the subject a few times, rephrasing your request
until the truth comes out.
Positive words but negative body language
Many employees complain that their supervisors give mixed messages with
body language. The words are positive, but the body language is negative.
For example, your boss calls you in for a meeting. She says, “Good morning,”
and begins to discuss your recent improvement in punctuality. However, her
arms are crossed at the waist, and her head is angled away from you so that
she’s looking at you sideways. You know that these are negative signals. If you
have the guts, you may venture, “It looks to me like something may be bother-
ing you.” Your boss may be forthright about her annoyance, or she may pound
a fist on the table and deny her true feelings with a sharp reply, “What makes
you think anything is bothering me?”
125
Chapter 9: Listening to Body Language

Blind spots
If you get conflicting verbal and nonverbal messages from someone, but that
person denies that a discrepancy exists, you are witnessing a blind spot —
something you know about others that they themselves are not conscious of.
Blind spots cause miscommunications and resentment.
In a negotiation, if you suspect the other party has a blind spot, you need to
take frequent reality checks. Check out your understanding with your coun-
terpart’s body language. You may even begin with the statement, “I need a
reality check.” Then go right into your reading: “I sense I have lost you,” or
“I sense we should take a break.” If you take responsibility for your need,
your counterpart is less likely to be defensive, and you are more likely to get
truthful information. This way you may get at your opponent’s true feelings.
Sometimes you even uncover some underlying interests.
Most people have at least one blind spot: one area in which they don’t really
know how their words or actions are affecting people. Blind spots are like
bad breath — everyone knows except the person who has it. The best way to
find your own blind spot is to invite feedback.
If the blind spot belongs to another, you need to ask the person if he or she
wants your feedback. If the response is no, believe it. You may need to find a
higher-up to deal with the issue — someone the individual must listen to.
Emphasizing with body language
Pound the table. Wave your arms. Jump up and down. These are a few of the
classic ways you can use your body to emphasize communication. It’s the
equivalent of scrawling something in all caps and red letters. However, save
these demonstrations until you need them.
If you use loudness throughout a negotiation, the added volume carries no
special meaning when you really need it. You just seem bellicose. The late,
great Johnny Carson used to refer to his lawyer as Bombastic Bushkin.
The tag fit, and it stuck. Soon, no one around this particular lawyer paid
much attention to the bombasity.
I once went into a print shop with a rush project. The owner slapped a big
red sticker on the order. It felt good. He threw my project on a stack of work.
Everything in the stack had the same red sticker. My heart sank. The red
sticker lost all its meaning. Raising your voice too often has the same result.
The key to emphasis is a change from the norm. Body language always
involves a cluster of movements. It should naturally be tied into voice levels,
tempo, and loudness. Sometimes, you can create extra emphasis by exhibit-
ing body language that runs counter to the communication. For example,
you may lean forward and quietly, slowly say that you are very, very angry.
126
Part II: Getting Your Point Across 

Here the emphasis is created just as powerfully — maybe more so — than if
you had been yelling at the top of your lungs.
Surprises can occur in any negotiation. Generally speaking, however, you
should know going into a negotiating session what will and won’t be important.
Hold back your emphasis until you get to the stuff that is really important to
you. This strategy is why a good negotiator lets the merely annoying issues
slide by and saves the emphasis for the truly important points.
Using Your Knowledge of Body Language
in Your Next Negotiation
From the moment you walk into a negotiation, you should observe the body
language of everybody in the room. During the negotiation, keep observing
your opponent’s body language. Focus on the four channels: face and head,
arms and hands, legs and feet, and torso (see the “Everybody’s Bilingual” sec-
tion, earlier in this chapter). When you are so focused on the total person
who is talking to you, you will listen better. Your observations of body lan-
guage will help you pick up unstated nuances such as what items are more
important, and what items are less important to the other side.
Complete shifts in body language during a negotiation can be more telling
than isolated signals. These shifts reveal that an issue is vitally important or
is causing stress to the other party. For most of the negotiation, your coun-
terpart will stay in the same general position. Notice any shifts from that
position. These movements may very well indicate that the person you are
dealing with has changed in attitude in some way. Being aware of this body
language can be particularly important if the other party
 Feels that you are talking about a sensitive issue.
 Is losing interest.
 Needs a break or a stretch.
 Is turning off to your arguments.
Watch that body language! It can be like a traffic signal. The shifts in body 
language can be yellow caution lights telling you to proceed slowly, look,
and listen. In the extreme, they are red lights telling you to stop! Stop now!
Don’t go further without taking a break. They can also be green lights telling
you to go in for the close.
Don’t ignore nonverbal signals. You may even want to include your observa-
tions in your written notes just as you include spoken words. This record helps
build familiarity with the other person’s unspoken vocabulary. Everybody
uses body language differently.
127
Chapter 9: Listening to Body Language

Knowing where to stand
One of the most important observations you can make about a room full of
people is the personal space each person commands. During conversation,
for example, people don’t lean closely into the space of an important person
they think has greater standing than they do (either in wealth, influence,
power, or social status). In a study of personal space, rooms of unsuspecting
subjects were photographed and later identified. Without fail, the more 
powerful people are accorded greater personal space by the other people
in the room. 
Spatial relationships come into play when you set up a room for a meeting.
Almost intuitively, people know that an important negotiation warrants a
table large enough to keep a formal distance between people. If someone
must dominate a meeting, that person is seated at the head of the table.
Control over the dominant chair may be the most obvious and enduring sign
of power both in the workplace and at home.
Seating in a meeting is important, because once the spatial relationships are
established, they are not easy to change. Take a moment before your next
meeting and think about what relationship you want to establish with the
other attendees. Arrange the seating accordingly.
Watch the Coen brothers’ comedy The Hudsucker Proxy for one of the more
blatant examples of power defined by the seating position during a meeting.
The film is about a mailroom clerk, played by Tim Robbins, who finds
himself thrust into the presidency of Hudsucker Corp., run by a brazen

Even a deer needs space
Animals are instinctive about personal distance.
I took my three daughters to Yosemite National
Park. We stayed at the Wawona Hotel, an old,
colonial lodge at the south end of the park. One
morning, we saw three deer on the sprawling
lawn of the hotel. All three girls tiptoed quietly
toward the deer. The deer were used to humans
and did not spook easily. When we got a surpris-
ingly close 10 feet from the deer, the deer moved
away slightly. With every few steps of ours, the
deer moved a few steps away correspondingly.

us shrink to less than their comfort zone.

Making the first contact
One of the best ways you can begin a meeting is with great body language.
Let your enthusiasm and energy show. Stick out your hand. Meet the other
person’s eyes and give a good, firm handshake. If you don’t own a good hand-
shake, develop one now. This skill is not difficult, but many people don’t shake
hands well. Let the flesh between your thumb and forefinger meet the other
person’s flesh between the thumb and forefinger. Press — do not squeeze —
the hand. One pump accompanied by eye contact is plenty. One or two more
may express great enthusiasm; any more than that can make the person
uncomfortable.
Today, the landscape for making the first contact has broadened. For instance,
women greeting women in America can touch both hands at the same time
as an alternative to a handshake. A hug, even in a business meeting, is appro-
priate if the relationship between two people warrants this familiarity.
Increasingly (especially in Hollywood), hugs between men and women, or
two men or two women who know each other, are common. A classic male
show of power is to shake hands in the normal fashion and reach with the left
hand to also grip the man’s elbow. Watch old tapes of President Clinton who
routinely used this two-handed greeting when he was president.
However, as you begin taking more careful note of body language and how
people relate to each other, you will notice that the space between two
people still reveals a lot about the relationship. As you can see in Figure 9-1,
friends may stand a foot apart, but you would not stand that close to some-
one you were being introduced to for the very first time. 
Showing that you’re receptive (and 
knowing if your counterpart isn’t)
If you pay attention to body language early in a negotiation, you can spot sig-
nals of how receptive (that is, how ready to listen and how open to your ideas)
your counterpart is. Consider eye contact, for example. Research shows that,
during conversation, people look at each other between 30 and 60 percent of
the time. A listener who meets your eyes less than 30 percent of the time is
probably unreceptive. If eye contact is made more than 60 percent of the time,
chances are the listener’s attitude is positive.

Chapter 9: Listening to Body Language

Table 9-1 shows some positive and negative cues associated with being
receptive and unreceptive. If you want to look ready and attentive, or if you
need to recognize these qualities in your counterpart, look for the positive
cues. You probably don’t ever want to look unreceptive, but you do want to
notice if others are unreceptive, so you should also be familiar with the nega-
tive cues in Table 9-1.

the greater the receptivity of the person. They lean forward, whether 
they are sitting or standing. Receptive negotiators unbutton their coats.

Chapter 9: Listening to Body Language

By contrast, people who aren’t willing to listen may keep their hands on their
hips, lean back in the chair, or protectively fold their arms across their chest.
People who aren’t receptive clench their hands into a fist or tightly grip some
other body part. Having one leg up on the arm of the chair often appears to
be an open posture, but watch out, this position may signal a lack of consid-
eration, especially if the office doesn’t belong to the person demonstrating
this behavior. Figure 9-2 shows the typical body language of someone who’s
receptive and someone who definitely is not.
Studies show that parties are more likely to reach an agreement if they begin a
negotiation displaying receptive body language (shown on the left in Figure 9-2).
This result appears to be true whether the stance was an unconscious deci-
sion or a contrived strategy for beginning a meeting in a positive manner.
In addition, the defensive postures are also contagious. If one person assumes
a defensive posture and holds that position for any period of time, you can
actually watch others in the room adopting the same position. It’s amazing
but true. Body language is contagious.
Seeing a change of heart
Observing how someone is sitting or standing (as in Table 9-1 or Figure 9-2)
is only the first step in reading body language — after all, people aren’t
frozen in time like statues. They move; their positions and gestures change
with their attitudes and emotions. Notice these shifts. They are important.

They may mean that the person is getting restless, or they may mean a shift
up or down in the person’s acceptance level.
As someone’s acceptance of your ideas grows, you may notice the following
indicators:
 Cocking the head
 Squinting the eyes slightly
 Uncrossing the legs
 Leaning forward
 Scooting to the edge of the chair
 Increasing eye contact
 Touching the forehead or chin, as in the statue The Thinker
 Touching you (if the movement is to reassure, and not to interrupt)

Chapter 9: Listening to Body Language
Even the innocents can catch other 
people’s body language
Some years ago, the great media hoaxer Alan
Abel pulled off a hoax on The Phil Donahue
Show that ballooned out of all proportion to
Alan’s expectations. Alan, who is 81 at this writ-
ing and still pulling stunts on the media, got him-
self booked on the daytime talk show along with
eight of his elderly pals. The show’s topic was
gay senior citizens. What Donahue and the
audience didn’t know was that Alan was plan-
ning a hoax called FAINT (Fight Against Idiotic
Neurotic Television). Alan and his pranksters
planned the scenario a week in advance. The
scenario involved each of Alan’s pranksters
raising a hand to ask a question to the gay
senior citizens on stage. When Donahue held
the mike for the question, each prankster
fainted, pretending to be unconscious for 30 sec-
onds. It was all a hoax, but soon enough, a really
bizarre thing happened:
Members of the audience, who were not in on
the hoax, began to faint. For real.
Even Donahue removed his coat, feeling hot
under the collar. He braved on through the show,
musing that the lights on the set must be too hot
or that the air conditioning wasn’t functioning
properly. After five audience members went
down, Donahue evacuated the audience and
continued his show without them. The broad-
cast ended ten minutes early that day. In fact,
the joke was to see how long it would take the
unflappable Donahue to cave in. Donahue fin-
ished the show as unflappable as ever.
The media had a field day with this story, which
made the evening news and appeared on page
1 of the New York Post. The hoax was easy to
verify because the participants all admitted
their respective roles in the caper. The sugges-
tive power of body language has never been
demonstrated more convincingly.
If you want to see a video of the hoax, check out
Jennifer Abel’s documentary about her father,
Abel Raises Cain. It’s all there. Body language is
truly contagious. When you start a negotiation,
be positive — in your voice, in your stance, in
your smile, in every aspect of your being. Others
will pick up on it. That’s a fact!

Figure 9-3 shows someone who’s receptive to the other party’s position in a
negotiation.
Just as you can gauge increasing acceptance to your ideas by watching body
language, you can also notice signs of increasing resistance to your ideas.
For example, if someone clutches the back of his neck with his palm, you can
interpret this gesture quite literally as, “This message is a pain in the neck.”
Here are some other gestures of resistance:
 Fidgeting nervously (cannot accept what is being said)
 Reducing eye contact (cannot accept what is being said)
 Placing hands behind one’s back (indicates an attempt to stay in
control of one’s own self — resisting the urge to act out verbally or 
physically)
 Placing a hand over one’s mouth (may indicate an attempt to hold back
a negative comment)
 Locking ankles
 Gripping one’s arm or wrist
 Crossing the arms in front of the chest
Figure 9-3:

134
Part II: Getting Your Point Across 

 Squinting one’s eyes dramatically
 Making fistlike gestures
 Twisting the feet or the entire body so they point to the door
Ferreting out boredom
One of the most important body language messages to look for during any
conversation, but especially in a negotiation, is an indication of boredom.
Looking out the window, holding the head up with one hand, doodling in a way
that seems to absorb the doodler’s complete attention, drumming fingers on
the table — all these indicate that the listener is no longer paying attention.
What should you do if you notice that the other party in your negotiation is
showing signs of boredom? People who are losing interest may be shifting in
their seats, fidgeting, or pointing their feet toward the exit. Don’t start speak-
ing louder or faster, as you may be tempted to do. Instead, say, “Wait. I need a
reality check. I’m sensing that I’m losing you. What’s happening?” And then
listen. You may find out what’s really keeping this person or group from
accepting your idea. Doing a reality check can save a great deal of time and
win you respect as a person who is perceptive and willing to risk hearing the
truth. This fact alone makes huge points in your favor during any negotiation.
Wearing your confidence on your sleeve
During a negotiation, projecting confidence is important. A lack of self-
confidence can result in nervousness. If your body language reveals that you
are nervous, your counterpart may deem that you’re not secure enough
to maintain a strong position in the negotiation. This person may be less
inclined to compromise on the terms in an effort to reach an agreement.
135
Chapter 9: Listening to Body Language
Negotiating charades
You can modify the familiar game of charades to
sensitize yourself to the importance and mean-
ing of body language. These two formats seem
to work best:
 Someone can mime an emotion, and the other
players must identify it. This game is simple
and fun, and it demonstrates the variety of
nonverbal communications available in face-
to face communications.
 Players can mime an entire negotiation —
either individually or as teams. The other team
or player is required to figure out specifi-
cally what the negotiation is about and what
positions are represented.

In addition to making sure that your body language expresses self-assurance,
you can also benefit from being able to gauge your counterpart’s confidence
level. This awareness of the other party’s strength as a negotiator can help
you determine your own goals, limits, opening offers, and attempts to close
the deal. Watching body language is the key to assessing your counterpart’s
degree of comfort during the negotiation.
Just like children, adults who get nervous tend to fidget in their chairs (although
this behavior can also indicate boredom or preoccupation with other matters).
Nervous fidgeting can also include putting hands into the mouth, tugging at
clothing, jingling change, fiddling with items in a purse, or fondling any personal
object. When people are nervous, they often increase their distance from those
they are negotiating with. Nervous people frequently verbalize their condition
without using words through throat clearing, oral pauses, or guttural sounds.
Confident people may place their hands in a steeple position (touching the
fingertips of both hands together to form what looks like a church steeple).
Sitting up straight and using frequent eye contact also shows confidence.
Someone who is confident physically sits on a level slightly higher than any-
body else. Propping your feet up is not just an expression of confidence, but
an act of claiming territory. If you can put your feet on something, you own it.
Closing the deal
Often, closing a deal means physically closing in on the person with whom
you’re negotiating. Consider the insurance salesperson who physically
leans into the buyer’s space with an assuring nudge for her to sign the appli-
cation. The agent lowers his voice, softens his tone, leans forward with the
completed application, and says, “If all the information is correct, place your
name here.”
Closing a negotiation often means closing in. Intimate distance — touching or
being 6 to 18 inches apart — is usually reserved for personal, affectionate
interactions. However, you may find yourself or your counterpart naturally
moving that close as you reach more agreements and draw nearer to closing
the deal. A good salesperson knows that an appropriate touch on the cus-
tomer’s forearm or hand cements the deal.
The body language of acceptance varies widely from one individual to
another. The exact point in time at which you get concurrence is more often
marked with slight nuances than raucous outbursts. Seldom does someone
jump up in joy at the moment of making the decision to close a deal. In my
experience, the bigger the deal, the more subtle the display at that magic
moment when the other side makes the mental commitment to close the
deal. The terms are then generally reviewed by both sides to be sure that the
deal is acceptable.
136
Part II: Getting Your Point Across 

If you close a deal, don’t forget to carry out the terms of the agreement.
This follow-up is important. There is no bigger let-down than to shake hands
on a deal and then not hear from the other side for days. Be sure that the
next step is taken. If it isn’t your direct responsibility, keep checking with the
person who is responsible. You are the person who closed the deal, so your
integrity is on the line.
Don’t Believe Everything You See
Body language augments rather than replaces the spoken word. The mean-
ings of certain actions or gestures can vary depending on the circumstances
and the individual. Consider these examples:
 Sitting erect may indicate a stiff bargaining position, or it may indicate
a stiff back. Stay alert to the body language, but combine your observa-
tions with the spoken words to determine the correct meaning.
 Gestures of anger are used when a person is genuinely angry; however,
these actions can also be employed for effect. Some executives (especially
in the entertainment industry) are notorious for using such gestures.
But keep in mind that some people are just blustery by nature.
137
Chapter 9: Listening to Body Language
Learning the hard way
After providing training and conducting semi-
nars extensively on this subject, I can still make
mistakes in reading body language. I once had
an important negotiation in my office. My coun-
terpart was a well-known financier of indepen-
dent films, but I had never met him face to face.
He came into my office and headed right to the
corner, which contains two sofas, a large coffee
table, and a couple of chairs.
He chose the love seat, put a hand on each arm-
rest, and discussed the project with legs spread
apart. “Wow,” I thought, “This guy is really open
with me. He is not nearly as tough as his repu-
tation.” We continued on. Slowly, I realized that
he is every bit as tough and closed up as his
reputation purports.
I went home very frustrated and thought clearly
about the negotiation. I remembered that my vis-
itor is also extremely overweight; the sprawled
position is the only one that is comfortable for
him. I later concluded that his body language
was also territorial. He came into my office and
staked quite a claim. He literally possessed one
sofa all to himself for the duration of the meeting.
Eventually, we made a deal. During our next
meeting, however, I didn’t misread him. I bar-
gained hard. Melting him down took awhile, but
I succeeded — partly because I knew that con-
vincing him was necessary. The first meeting
produced less progress because I had not been
as aggressive. I thought we were already in
agreement. I worked harder after I correctly
read his body language.

Evaluate body language cautiously, just as you do all the other information
that comes to you during a negotiation.
Different strokes for different folks
No matter how much you know about body language in general, don’t grow
overconfident when applying your knowledge to a specific person — especially
someone you don’t know very well. Each individual has unique body language.
A child can tell when a parent is really angry, even if the body language that
parent uses to indicate serious trouble is the opposite of what the general
public uses. For example, although silence usually indicates that a person is
calm, some parents clam up when they’re angry. In such families, the children
soon learn that silence means real trouble is looming.
Consider the context
As you become more sensitive to body language, you become more con-
scious of the differences in the meanings of gestures. A clenched fist usually
represents anger. Held firmly above the head, it can be a symbol of quiet
rage. Pumped up and down, especially if the person is also jumping and
squealing, a clenched fist can be an expression of extreme joy.
Prepare for the bluff
Most adults have the art of “faking it” pretty well perfected. People are prone
to hide their real feelings in a business setting. Negotiators may display all
the signs of accepting a deal, although their true reaction is quite the oppo-
site. When you think the other side is accepting your proposal, try to close
the deal. That provides a good check on your reading of the other party’s
body language. If you can’t close, what you observed was something other
than acceptance. Don’t be fooled the next time you see the same reaction
from that person — and keep trying to close.
Smiles are almost always an expression of happiness. However, society some-
times requires a smile when the soul is not happy. The mouth drawn tightly
and obligingly back reveals a devotion to duty more than merriment. And a
half-smile (one corner of the mouth crooked upward) reveals a wry feeling of
superiority — like the smile on the face of the bad guy just before he shoots
the good guy in an old Western.

Chapter 9: Listening to Body Language
A look that deceived the experts
One of my more protracted negotiations lasted
more than five months. My clients were John
Kobylt and Ken Chiampou, popular radio talk show
hosts in Los Angeles. They wanted to syndicate
their afternoon drive-time show called The John
and Ken Show. My clients and I were trying to
obtain the syndication rights from KFWB, the radio
station that employed them. We shared many
meals and meetings with their station manager,
and in every meeting, the other party was atten-
tive and interested. The words and body language
were supportive and encouraging. We left every
meeting feeling heard and understood. Some
meetings were attended by outside consultants
on the project, who also shared our perception
that the other side was moving toward agreement.
The long negotiations culminated in a phone con-
ference scheduled to confirm the details of the
deal. A third-party financier from New York was
on the line. My clients were standing by. Several
members of the other team were plugged in.
The president of the company that owned the
radio stations began speaking. We were shocked
to hear the opposite of what we expected. “I’ve
decided not to go forward with this deal,” was the
opening sentence. “We have all worked hard on
this, so I wanted to give all of you my exact think-
ing,” he continued. He set out four reasons for
rejecting the deal. We had heard every objection
before. Each objection had been systematically
answered several times. He obviously had not
understood our proposal.
My clients were so upset that they didn’t go to
work. Instead of calling in sick, they called in
“disgusted.” When they told me what they were
going to do, I pointed out that their contract had
sick-day provisions. However, it did not have a
“disgusted-day” provision. Nonetheless, they
called in “disgusted.” That ploy got some atten-
tion. The president invited my clients to his
house that afternoon. They talked. We arranged
another meeting.
I knew I had to gain my counterpart’s interest
and attention. My clients and I made charts and
graphs. We made up some new words to
describe the plan we were proposing. We put
the results of our efforts into two fancy, leather
notebooks with the names of the two managers
embossed on the cover.
Watching the body language was fascinating.
In the past, my counterpart was earnestly lean-
ing forward, nodding, and saying, “I under-
stand.” He demonstrated all the classic signs of
approval. This time he acted a bit giddy right in
the middle of the presentation. “Oh I got it. I got
it,” he exclaimed, very animated and excited. He
was laughing as though we had just finished
some one-on-one basketball. “Very good,” he
said, “You got me.” I thought he was going to give
me a high-five.
He knew all about body language. He knew how
to look attentive, interested, and approving in
spite of the fact that he wasn’t understanding
my words. When we changed some of those
words and added pictures, we got through to
him. When that happened, he dropped the well-
practiced body language of careful listening
and took on the joy of a kid with a lollipop. After
we got past this hurdle, the rest was easy. We
signed agreements within the month. Within a
year, The John and Ken Showwas heard on more
than 100 radio stations across America.

Most of the differences between the body language you see and the intended
spirit of the communication are accidental. These differences are generally
not the result of a sinister plot. The impact on you will be the same if you are
misled. This chapter helps keep you from being misled by body language that
is different from the message of the spoken word. When you make such an
observation, don’t assume that the other person is intentionally trying to
mislead you.
You can read more about body language with the two seminal works: Body
Language, by Julius Fast, and How to Read a Person Like a Book, by Gerard I.
Nierenberg and Henry H. Calero. Both books contain very good bibliographies.
A more recent book worth reading is Reading People: How to Understand People
and Predict Their Behavior — Anytime, Anyplace by Jo-Ellan Dimitrius and
Mark Mazzarella. Dimitrius, a renowned jury consultant, provides a wealth
of tips for ferreting out people’s viewpoints, motives, and character traits.
And, by all means, look into the granddaddy of them all: The Expression of the
Emotions in Man and Animals, written by Charles Darwin and first published
in 1872.

Tuning In to Your Inner Voice
In This Chapter
 Discovering your inner voice
 Using your inner voice
 Brainstorming your way to success
 Listening to warning messages
And this above all, to thine own self be true
And it must follow as night the day,
You cannot be false to any man.
—William Shakespeare
Your inner voice is your subconscious mind talking to you. Call it a hunch,
intuition, or a sixth sense, too many people ignore this inner voice.
When you seek your inner truth, you are more likely to be honest and ethical
in your dealings with others. That’s what Shakespeare was trying to say.
Your inner voice tells you when a deal is sour. Your inner voice tells you to go
forward with an agreement, although the money may not be right. Listen to
that voice. Go to a quiet place and get in touch with what is really going on
inside. Talk it out with a trusted adviser if you like, but nothing and no one
can give a message as powerfully accurate as your own inner voice can.
One reason that women frequently make such good negotiators is that they
tend to have better intuitive skills than men. Some men belittle women’s 
intuition as less useful than a quantifiable response to the objective data
being presented. However, studies show that successful people, be they men
or women, rely heavily on intuition. Learn to trust and value what your inner
voice says; don’t dismiss it because of self-doubt or the skepticism of others
or your own inability to explain logically how you reached your decision.

The Origins of Your Inner Voice
Everyone’s mind works on two levels: the conscious and the subconscious.
Your conscious mind is where you do math, perform logic, and control most
of your physical activities. Your inner voice is located in your subconscious
mind. For those interested in the scientific explanation for the inner voice,
this section explains the biology of it all. Please, no dissecting.
The conscious and subconscious mind
The mind constantly processes millions of pieces of data quickly and effi-
ciently. The brain feeds the results into a storage device unmatched by any
filing system in the world. The conscious mind uses this data for speech,
recognition, and every other human activity. The actual processing of the
information, however, is completely outside our conscious experience.
We are unaware of the process because it is subconscious.
This subconscious realm is the source of your dreams. The meaning of dreams
is not always obvious, especially to the layperson. Psychiatrists are so inter-
ested in dreams because dreams are like windows to the subconscious mind.
When you go to sleep, your conscious mind quiets down. Messages, in the
form of dreams, barrage you from your subconscious mind, not because your
subconscious mind becomes more active, but because your conscious mind
becomes less active.
The phenomenon is much like viewing the stars in the heavens. People say,
“The sky is full of stars tonight.” In fact, the number of stars in the sky hasn’t
changed. You just can’t see them when the glare of the sun obscures them or
when the night’s cloud cover conceals them or when the city lights dim them.
Remove those things that blanket them with light or physically obstruct their
light and millions of stars are visible to the naked eye. Take a place like Death
Valley in California. You can walk by the light of the stars even if the moon
isn’t visible. It is amazing. The stars are visible because no buildings or trees
or light sources block or wash them out.
When you fall asleep, your conscious mind also takes a rest. The noisy
thought processes of your conscious mind no longer block out the activity
of your subconscious mind. Your dreams are a product of this activity.
Sometimes, your demons come tripping out. The welcome and unwelcome
activity of your subconscious mind plays out much more vividly at night than
during the day because your conscious mind is not busy blocking it out.
142
Part II: Getting Your Point Across 

The brain scans millions of pieces of data at lightning speed (and maybe even
faster). The result is fed to the speech and reasoning centers of the conscious
mind. Only then are we aware of the process and only then can the results be
put to use.
For example, someone may say to you, “Hi, how are the kids?” By the time
your response arrives at the speech center, a great deal of information has
been processed, evaluated, and accepted or rejected. This has occurred 
without interference from the conscious mind. In fact, your speech center
may be otherwise engaged even as the recognition process is occurring. Your
conscious mind goes on with the talking while your amazing subconscious
brain gives you a final answer to the person’s question. Your processing 
centers have done all the work — without words, without anxious thought.
The process is almost instantaneous and highly accurate because no data is
overlooked.
This speedy, subconscious processing of massive amounts of data is what
really goes on when we resonate with a hunch or an intuitive feeling about
something. Many people develop this aspect of their brains, either by acci-
dent or by design, to a very high degree. However, everyone’s brain functions
in this way.
If you did not have a subconscious that could send such messages, you
could not function in the world. You would have to be institutionalized. If you
can read this book, you can read your subconscious. Unfortunately, no one
teaches you how to read those messages in school. Readin’, writin’, and 
resonatin’ is not currently the accepted grade school curriculum. Although
this discussion of the phenomenon is hardly complete, you may feel more
trusting next time your subconscious provides an answer to a complicated
problem.
Cameron Crowe’s Jerry Maguire is a wonderful film about negotiating in busi-
ness and in your personal life. It is also a film about listening to your inner
voice. The film opens with Jerry Maguire (played by Tom Cruise) realizing
that the cutthroat world of representing professional athletes isn’t all he
imagined. Jerry has a beautiful girlfriend, a successful career, and lots of
money, but his inner voice tells him that something is missing from his life.
So Jerry spontaneously writes a stirring, visionary statement for his sports
agency and titles it, The Things We Think And Do Not Say: The Future of Our
Business. Not everyone accepts the statement, and he is unceremoniously
fired from the agency. Stripped of his job and a good measure of his identity,
Jerry embarks on a journey of self-discovery that leads him to greater per-
sonal and professional success all because he listened to his inner voice at
the start of the film.

Left brain vs. right brain
No, this isn’t a biology textbook, but by understanding how your mind works,
you can manage your thoughts and become a better negotiator.
Research on brain theory helps explain why some people are good managers
but weak leaders. Research indicates that the brain is divided into two halves:
the left and right half. These are called hemispheres. Each hemisphere serves
a different function, processes different kinds of information, and deals with
different kinds of problems. The left hemisphere works with logic and analysis;
the right works with emotions and imagination. Table 10-1 shows a break-
down of left-brain vs. right-brain functions.

Processing information 
for decision making
The next time you enter into a negotiation, remember the two most important
aspects of the brain when it comes to persuading another person: Your brain
stores information in your memory, and it processes this information to make
decisions and solve problems. How you process information determines what
type of decision maker you are.
People can be tested to determine how they process information. Based on
their test results, they can be categorized into different types of decision
makers. Table 10-2 shows four of the most frequently used categories of 
decision makers.

Bringing Out Your Inner Voice
The inner voice is easily masked. If it were not, you would go crazy from all
the voices in your head. Consequently, you can talk, read, process data, and
perform myriad tasks while your subconscious mind is busily doing its thing.
Quieting your mind
If you want to get in touch with your inner voice, you must quiet your con-
scious mind. For some people, this involves a mind-relaxing activity such as
running, walking, or fishing. Other people must sit quietly for a few minutes.
Do whatever works for you in order to let those inner messages surface.
Try meditation, which has been scientifically proven to increase mental 
clarity and thinking ability and integrate left- and right-brain functioning.
Meditation also can improve physical, mental, and emotional health.
If this is a new idea to you, you may have to practice. You have to work 
extra-hard to quiet your conscious mind until you get used to accepting the
complete messages that come from the subconscious without explanation.
As you do, the messages come to you more often and more clearly. Don’t be
discouraged as you attempt this process, and remember that listening to your
inner voice is a personal process. Your subconscious is your own storehouse
145
Chapter 10: Tuning In to Your Inner Voice

of information, unlike anybody else’s. It’s where your entire life is captured.
You can enjoy great success if you can use that information by following your
inner voice.
The disadvantage of articulating answers and decisions brought to you by
your subconscious is that you are unable to discuss the process that
occurred or describe the logic that was used. You were not conscious of the
process while it was occurring. You cannot explain the entire process to
someone in the same way you can explain a conscious, logical path from
problem to solution. The logic occurs too quickly and uses too many bits of
data to explain rationally.
How many people in your life can question you about how you arrive at your
decisions? The longer the list, the less comfortable you are with decisions
that you cannot rationally explain. Very successful people have fewer people
to answer to, which is one reason they can get away with intuitive problem
solving. When the boss says, “I smell a rat!” nobody asks for a detailed analy-
sis. Subordinates accept the intuitive process. “Put it in a memo” is simply
not an appropriate response to the boss’s hunch . . . intuitive process . . .
inner voice.
For a perfect example of someone getting in touch with her voice and then
trusting it, see Little Miss Sunshine. This loopy, dark comedy of a road picture
ends with 8-year-old Olive, played by Abigail Breslin, having to decide
whether to compete in the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant. Her father
and brother are passionately telling her not to do it. Her mother is telling her
to go ahead with it. The camera pulls in tight on Olive’s face. She goes quiet
for a moment. You can actually see her mind going quiet as she gets in touch
with her inner voice. Then she makes her decision and follows through on it.
The scene is a good demonstration of the process of quieting your mind so
you can hear your inner voice, and it shows how the inner voice can be used
by anyone at any age in any situation.
Brainstorming
Brainstorming is a great way to bring your inner voice to the surface. During
brainstorming, you let all the ideas flow without editing or judging. You write
down or say every idea that pops in your head — no matter how crazy it may
be. This creative-thinking technique works because it helps to free you from
fixed ideas. The intent is to get every possible idea out on the table.
You can try brainstorming on your own — with a notepad and pen — but
brainstorming almost always works better with a group because you can
build on each other’s ideas.
146
Part II: Getting Your Point Across 

After the idea fountain has run completely dry, stop. Give everyone a final
opportunity to add something to the list. Be sure that everyone has articu-
lated every idea that they could possibly have. Then take a little break to let
people shift gears from the free-wheeling creative session to the practical job
of narrowing the list to a manageable number of ideas.
When you are ready, look through your list of ideas and choose the ones that
you believe will best yield results during the negotiation process. This is best
done by the same group that came up with the list in the first place. That way
everyone is heard. No one has sour grapes later when his or her ideas don’t
show up on the final list. And most importantly to the welfare of the group,
an idea can be fleshed out and explained if the brief expression of the idea
wasn’t clear to everyone. Sometimes a good idea doesn’t seem so good until
it carries a bit of an explanation.
Take a look at Oliver Stone’s JFK. The film is one big brainstorming session.
The film follows New Orleans D.A. Jim Garrison (played by Kevin Costner)
and his obsessive investigation into the assassination of President John F.
Kennedy. It’s like a collage of all the books and articles, documentaries and
television shows, scholarly debates and conspiracy theories since 1963.
We know the events by heart: the grassy knoll, the hobos in dress shoes, the
147
Chapter 10: Tuning In to Your Inner Voice
Hearing two voices? You’re not crazy
Be assured that you don’t have two different inner
voices inside you. You only have one of these phe-
nomenal subconscious centers. When people
talk about conflicting voices within themselves,
they are frequently experiencing their conscious
mind testing the solution provided by the sub-
conscious mind. Almost without exception, the
solution provided by the subconscious part of
the mind survives this testing, but the solution
provided by the conscious part of the mind is
easier to rationalize and explain. The conscious
thought process can be reduced to words.
Much of the “testing” of what is provided by
your subconscious is your memory of voices
from your childhood, mostly from your mother or
father. Your inner voice tells you to go forth. A
parental voice, indelibly etched in your memory,
says, “Don’t do that. That is dangerous. You will
fail.” As adults, we need to recognize the play
of memory messages. If you are hearing those
old parental warnings, look skyward and say,
“It’s okay. I can do it. And if I fail, that’s okay, too.
I need to try — for me.”
If the owner of that parental voice is still alive,
look skyward anyway. Don’t act out this con-
versation with the real person. The last thing
you need is a protracted discussion with a dubi-
ous critic at just the time you need to gather up
your courage and embark on a new adventure.
Inner critics aren’t all bad. Having an inner critic
is good when you need that kind of feedback.
Decide between your inner voice and your inner
critic and do what is right for you.

parade route, Lee Harvey Oswald, Clay Shaw, the three shots, the eyewitness
testimony, the gunpowder tests, Jack Ruby, the wrong shadows on the photo-
graph, the Zapruder film, and on and on. Garrison and his team attempt to
put all the pieces of the puzzle together to build a case against Clay Shaw, a
respected businessman who is linked to various conspirators.
Brainstorming sessions abound between Garrison and his team. It all builds
up to the final courtroom scene. Consider the pivotal scene in which Garrison
and his investigators sit in a restaurant, brainstorming facts and opinions for
the trial. The scene is intercut with shots of the alleged fabrication of the infa-
mous Time-Life photo of Oswald holding a rifle. The rules of brainstorming
are clearly demonstrated in this scene. Everyone contributes; some ideas are
shot down, while others are praised. As the group breaks up in frustration,
the trajectory of the other sequence lands the photo on the cover of Life
magazine. Was the photo fabricated? Who knows?
Heeding Special Messages
The inner voice is most adept at sending warning messages. This feature
remains in all of us from primitive days when survival depended on keen
senses. The messages to run, duck, hide, be quiet, or stay still had to be hon-
ored if cave people wanted to stay alive. The warning cry is the one emitted
most strongly by the inner voice. What a great tool! It can guide you away
from dangerous decisions you may make in your life. Sometimes those 
warnings come through loud and clear. When that happens, heed them.
Messages that are both loud and clear are special indeed. These messages
are rarely wrong.
Shady characters
Although hardly anyone states it so bluntly, one thing you want to know about
the other party in a negotiation is whether you can trust the information that
person gives you. What is this person’s reputation for honesty and accuracy?
If you are trying to negotiate efficiently, you must find out the general trust-
worthiness of the assertions from the other side.
Sometimes you hear that someone is not dishonest, just ignorant, inefficient,
or inexperienced. These qualities may sound better than dishonesty, but they
have the same consequence to you. As a negotiator, you can’t afford to blindly
accept anything that such a person says to you.
148
Part II: Getting Your Point Across 

A different but highly related issue is whether you can trust the client repre-
sented by the person with whom you are negotiating. Even if you trust the
negotiator, you may feel that you need to be extra-careful in dealing with the
party on the other side of the negotiating table.
The best advice I can offer is not to do business with a person you don’t trust.
No lawyer in the world can protect you from someone determined to do you
in, cheat you, or steal from you. No cop or security system in the world can
protect your house from a sufficiently determined thief. President Kennedy
once prophetically observed, “There is no Secret Service agent who can 
guarantee a president’s life, if someone is willing to give their own life in
exchange.”
Sometimes you are forced to do business with someone you don’t trust. In
such a case, be sure to focus on the parts of the contract that will protect
you if something goes wrong. Decide where a lawsuit would be filed and in
which courts. Your lawyer can be a big help here. Make provisions for when
and how you can check the books for accuracy. In such a case, you must pre-
pare a much more detailed contract than you normally would.
Having clauses that protect you is always important in case you come to
honest differences that you did not anticipate. Such clauses are the special
province of an experienced attorney. For example, if someone is to pay you
money under a contract, you want a fast and certain way to collect in case of
default. The negotiator who does not consider this aspect of the deal is not
doing a good job. Negotiating for big payments is futile if the payments are,
as a practical matter, uncollectible. You may want to insist that all funds
under negotiation be held in a special account until the contract is finalized.
If you want to include clauses to protect yourself but can’t get the other
party to agree, you must decide whether you want to do business with this
person. Listen carefully to why the other party is not willing to provide cer-
tain mechanisms that put your mind at ease about payment. If that person
insists on maintaining an unfair out, think twice before entering into the
agreement. Be clear in expressing the importance of these provisions and
why you must have them.
If everything else seems good about a deal, walking away based on these
points can be difficult. The other side knows that and will often turn the issue
into a trust test: “If you trust me, you’ll make this deal with me.” Look such a
person right in the eye and say, “I trust you well enough to enter this deal.
But I don’t know what good or bad fortune is going to visit you over the next
year while I need steady payments. You may quit the company (or sell your
business). You may get killed. I just don’t know what the future holds.”
149
Chapter 10: Tuning In to Your Inner Voice

Questionable deals
If your inner voice tells you that you don’t want to make a deal, stop the nego-
tiation. Relax. Examine that message. Either your subconscious will send you
a more detailed message, or your conscious mind will work it out logically.
Heed any strong messages that a given course of action is wise or unwise.
Mold your conduct to that message. You don’t have to stand up in the middle
of a meeting and announce to the assembly that your inner voice is telling
you that the discussions are over. In fact, you may decide to keep the source
of your decision to yourself. You should heed the message and begin to 
concentrate on closing the discussion. Wrap up the deal. Use the message
without necessarily announcing it to the room.
Pre-buyer’s remorse
If you experience buyer’s remorse before you even buy, stop everything.
Ask yourself why you have reservations. What is the reason you don’t want
to buy this boat? Is it that you’ll never use it? Or that you may move soon?
Or perhaps because it’s not as big as your neighbor’s boat? Sometimes, you
can resolve these reservations; other times, you can’t. Don’t go forward with
a deal if your inner voice tells you not to.
Try to develop your ability to listen to your inner voice. It is the most impor-
tant voice you can possibly hear. No one knows you better than you do.
People who learn to hear their inner voice — unfiltered by reason or 
rationale — are always happier with their decisions (and thus less likely
to experience buyer’s remorse) than those who are not able to do so.

In This Chapter
 Organizing your thoughts
 Being clear during a negotiation
 Capturing an audience
 Avoiding the pitfalls of not being clear
R
aw power flows from the simple ability to be clear and accurate in every
step of a negotiation. Unfortunately, no one is born knowing how to
express ideas clearly. This chapter is actually a short course in communica-
tion skills, showing you how to speak, write, and conduct yourself clearly at
every stage of a negotiation.
The ability to communicate clearly is one of the six basic negotiating skills.
With practice, you can see how communication skills impact a negotiation.
You can tell when your negotiation is faltering because of weak communication.
To improve your ability to communicate clearly, play the games sprinkled
throughout this chapter. These activities help build communication skills just
as practice improves the chances of making a basket from the free-throw line.
If you want to be the best at anything, practice the component skills.
What Being Clear Means
In many ways, clear communication is the other side of effective listening (see
Chapter 7). Just as you cannot listen too well, there is no such thing as being
too clear. You can be too blunt, too fast, and too slow. You can’t be too clear.
Being clear does not mean that you reveal your position at the earliest oppor-
tunity or that you lay out your limits as an opening salvo. Being clear simply
means that when you speak, write, or otherwise communicate, your listener

understands your intended message. Sounds simple enough. Why aren’t
more people successful at it?
If you have any doubt about what being clear means, watch Patton, the won-
derful biopic starring George C. Scott as Gen. George Patton. The opening scene
is an unforgettable example of clarity. He is exhorting the troops to battle.
In fact, he is whipping them up with an unforgettable call to duty. It’s not just
the words — as clear as they are. Scott reinforces his words with his tone, his
stance, and the huge American flag behind him. Everything in the scene is
consistent with his message. It couldn’t be clearer. Although General Patton’s
personality often got in his way, he was never accused of not being clear.
The reason more people are not good communicators is that most people com-
municate from this point of view: What do I want to tell my listener? How am I
going to appear? What are they going to think of me? Not effective. Your point of
view must be from the listener’s side of the communication. Ask yourself these
questions: What does my listener need to know? What information does my lis-
tener need to make a decision? What is my listener’s knowledge of the subject?
First, you must be clear with yourself about what information you’re trying to
get across. Then you must know who the listener is, what filters are in place,
and how to get through those filters so you can be understood.
Organizing Your Thoughts for Clarity
Before you can organize your thoughts, you need to assess what your listener
needs and then find out how experienced he or she is with the subject matter.
When you know that, you can figure out how much of your presentation needs
to focus on general education — bringing the other person up to speed, as
they say.
After you have taken care of these preliminary matters, you are ready to 
organize your thoughts. You can organize your thoughts in many ways, but
the important thing is to do it. Here are my favorite three ways to organize a
presentation.
P.R.E.P. for a presentation
The first way to get organized is by using the P.R.E.P technique. Use the
approach: point, reason, example, point. It works because it’s so logical;
you won’t leave anyone in the dust. Here’s an example:
152
Part II: Getting Your Point Across 

 My point is: Exercise is energizing.
 The reason is: It gets your heart rate up.
 My example is: After at least 20 to 30 minutes of increased heart rate,
you are more energized when you come out of the gym than when you
went in.
 So, my point is: Exercise is energizing.
The P.R.E.P. approach can definitely help you organize your material.
Now, read the paragraphs about P.R.E.P. again. Note how I explained this 
concept using the P.R.E.P. approach. Mark the appropriate sentences with
the letters P.R.E.P. for each of the corresponding ideas.
This formula works with any presentation, from a five-minute informal chat,
to a thirty-minute formal speech using many examples. The P.R.E.P. approach
is a great way to get organized and be clear.
Outline your points
Another strategy is to list and number your points. The following is an example:
I recommend that you hire the consultant to create a plan that will
1. Increase sales
2. Improve morale
3. Generate productivity
Tell ’em once, tell ’em twice, tell ’em again
Here’s the classic standby used by presenters and writers across the country:
 Tell ’em what you’re gonna tell ’em.
 Tell ’em.
 Tell ’em what you told ’em.
I use this one a lot because it drives a point home.

Chapter 11: Being Crystal Clear: Telling It Like It Is

Tips for Being Clear
A well-turned phrase always involves an element of art. You don’t have to be
an artist to be clear. The flowery phrase is nice; the clear phrase is a necessity.
Part of the beauty of a clear phrase is how accurately it hits the bull’s-eye;
that is, how precisely it conveys your meaning.
If you assign people to complete tasks for you at work, your first task is to
clearly tell the person what you want him or her to do. Easier said than done.
Getting results in the workplace has less to do with charisma than with clar-
ity. For best results, take your time. If something is worth saying, it’s worth
saying clearly. Here are some hints for maximizing clarity.
1. Set the climate.
Be sure you’re in a place conducive to concentration at a time when the
assistant or co-worker can pay attention. Listen to your words as you set
the tone. A harried manager may unwittingly say, “Now this is a simple,
mindless task; that’s why I’m giving it to you.” Not very motivating.
2. Give the big picture.
Describe the overall objectives. People need to see where their part fits
into the whole to feel like they are a part of the loftier goal.
3. Describe the steps of the task.
This is the meat of the delegation discussion. Sometimes these steps are
already printed in an instruction or procedures manual. You still need to
go over these steps, however briefly, to assure yourself that the employee
is familiar with them. If the steps are not already written out, have the
person write the list as you speak. This effort increases the probability
of retention.
4. Cite resources available.
Point out where to find other references on the task, if any. Resources
include anyone who has completed the task before, a general book on
the subject, or a specific manual for your office.
5. Invite questions.
Even if you feel that you don’t have time to answer questions, the extra
attention is worth the effort. Better to spend the time to explain a task
up front than be unhappy with the results later. Invite questions with
open-ended prompting such as, “What questions do you have?” not
“You don’t have any questions, do you?”
6. Get the person to summarize his or her strategy for accomplishing
the task.
154
Part II: Getting Your Point Across 

This step takes guts on your part; you risk being answered with a defensive
“Do you think I’m stupid?” Use this sentence: “Call me compulsive —
I need you to summarize how you will get this done.” When you take
responsibility, you reduce defensiveness in the other person.
7. Agree on a date to follow up.
The deadline depends on the complexity and value of the task. You may
need time and practice to develop the fine art of following up without
hovering. You greatly increase the chances that the person will meet the
deadline if he or she helped to set it.
When you speak, ask “Did I make myself clear?” Ross Perot’s line during his
oh-so-brief presidential campaign was, “Are you with me?”
Such questions often help both parties proceed more productively. “Did I
make myself clear?” may remind the other person to listen instead of lazily
replying “yes.” If the point is critical, you may ask the other party to repeat
the information back to you just to be sure that you are communicating effec-
tively. Assure your counterpart that repeating vital information does not 
constitute an agreement — just clarification.
Know your purpose or goals
When you know exactly what you want to say, communicating clearly is
much easier. In the past, you must have had the urge to say, “So, what’s your
point?” — usually with an exasperated tone. More often than not, a person
who is asked that question looks surprised and fumbles for a good, one-
sentence answer. When the speaker doesn’t know the point, the listener is
hopelessly lost.
In any communication, you should know the point and be keenly aware of the
overall purpose or goal. Simply saying, “Oh, I just like to talk” is okay for
recreational situations. But if you’re trying to get someone else to provide
some action, approval, or acquiescence (that is, if you are in a negotiation),
you need to have your short- and long-range goals in mind.
Cut the mumbo-jumbo
Some concepts are, by nature, just plain difficult to grasp. Sometimes being
clear requires creativity. For example, if you have many numbers to present,
try putting them in graphs — bar, pie, or line charts — anything but reams of
numbers. Keep the lists of numbers as a backup.
155
Chapter 11: Being Crystal Clear: Telling It Like It Is

By all means, oversimplify technical points at first — you can explain fully later
in the conversation, after you have your listeners hooked. Also, define jargon
and spell out acronyms. For example, I say, “I’m going to LAX,” and people from
outside of Los Angeles may not know that LAX is the airport. People from
New York head to JFK. You got it. It’s the airport. Avoid references that may
leave your listener wondering what the heck you’re taking about. In written
materials, footnotes and appendices serve the purpose of clarity. Do every-
thing you can to make listening and understanding easy and enjoyable.
Keep your commitments
Being clear includes being consistent in the words you say and the deeds
that follow. If you say one thing and do another, it’s confusing. Your inconsis-
tent conduct turns an otherwise clear communication into a real puzzlement.
Keep each and every commitment that you make during a negotiation. In life,
keeping commitments is important; in a negotiation, it’s essential.
Keeping your commitments is the acid test of clarity; it’s also the bedrock
of trust. A notorious thief can look you in the eye and say, “I will have that
assignment on your desk at 2 p.m.” If the assignment is there, the thief has
gained your trust. On the other hand, if an honest person misses the 2 p.m.
deadline, your trust in that person is diminished.
If you tell the other party that you will call back at 9 the next morning, be sure
to call at that time. Breaking your promise calls your integrity into question
and creates confusion about what exactly you meant when you promised
to call back at 9 a.m. Failing to keep your word also upsets the other party.
Such inattention may be considered, debated, and evaluated by the other
side. Their loss of trust may call into question side issues and create tensions
that are counterproductive to a negotiation.
If you are negotiating with someone on behalf of a client or company, failure
to keep commitments is harmful to you and the party you’re representing.
This neglect can damage your relationship with your client or your standing
within the company. Word often gets back about your unprofessional behavior.
Professional negotiators are often falsely blamed for not returning calls or not
providing documentation in a timely fashion. Don’t provide grist for that mill.
Write it down
The written word is often more useful than the spoken word when you’re
trying to communicate clearly. When you have something to say, write it
down, look at it, edit it, and make it right. When the words are your own, you
don’t have to release them until they are as near to perfect as possible.
156
Part II: Getting Your Point Across 

Many people believe they can’t or don’t know how to write as clearly as they
speak. This is rarely true. The simple fact is that when you write instead of
speak the words, you can see more easily whether your message is unclear.
You can see in black and white that the words are ambiguous or your thoughts
are incomplete.
Also, the written word disallows such conversational crutches as “ya know
what I mean?” When used as a rhetorical question, this phrase doesn’t clarify
the issues. It moves the conversation deeper into confusion.
The process of putting your thoughts into writing brings you face-to-face with
your failure to communicate clearly. Rather than bemoan your lack of writing
skills, open your eyes and say honestly — maybe for the first time in your life —
“Wow, I didn’t realize how poorly I have been communicating my ideas.”
Here are some basic tips to get you on the road to clear communication:
 Use short sentences.
 Use short words.
 Avoid jargon and abbreviations — even when you are writing to another
professional in your field — unless the other person uses these terms
exactly the way that you do.
 Complete your sentences.
 Stick to one idea per paragraph.
 Have a beginning, middle, and end to the overall communication.
 Be accurate.
Don’t be afraid to number paragraphs to cover different points, but don’t delude
yourself into thinking that numbering paragraphs brings order to a document
that otherwise lacks coherence or good sense.
Try being a journalist
When you think of clear writing, the most common reference point is your
daily newspaper. From coast to coast, there is a consistency in stories written
for the newspaper that seems to cross regional lines, ownership, and size of
the newspaper. You may find it odd that so many journalists write in the same
style with the same degree of clarity.
Actually, every school of journalism in the country teaches students about
the “five horsemen” of journalism: Who?, What?, Where?, When?, and Why?
The journalist is supposed to answer these five questions in the first para-
graph of a story. The next five paragraphs should each expand on the answer
157
Chapter 11: Being Crystal Clear: Telling It Like It Is

to one of the questions. The least important information appears at the end
of the story. That way, if the story is too long for the available space in the
newspaper, editors can just delete the end of story, and no important infor-
mation is lost.
Look at a copy of today’s newspaper. Pick any story that interests you in the
first section (or the news section if you read your daily paper online). I point
you to that section because stories there are more likely to follow the tradi-
tional structure of news writing. Reporters depart from the structure in some
of the special-interest sections, such as the sports or entertainment sections.
As you read the first paragraph of a straight news story (especially a story
from one of the wire services), notice how the reporter explains:
 Who the story is about
 What the person did to land in the news
 Where the event happened
 When the event took place
 Why the event occurred
Read the last few paragraphs of the article and notice how trivial that infor-
mation is compared to the first few paragraphs. Notice how the first few 
paragraphs after the lead paragraph are packed with important material 
compared with the information later in the story.
Use the same technique, and you can’t go wrong. Remember: You’re providing
the information your listener needs to know to achieve your goal. Organize
the facts like a newspaper story.
158
Part II: Getting Your Point Across 
Play Whisper
You may remember this game from your youth.
Sometimes called Telephone or Rumor, I use
this game to teach listening and clarity skills. It
also teaches the dangers of believing a story
told to you through several different people.
First, I come up with a one- or two-sentence story.
I usually pick a sentence right out of the news-
paper. Whisper the story into the ear of the person
on your left. That person repeats the story
exactly to the next person, who then repeats it to
the next person, and so on. The last person in the
chain repeats the story aloud. Each additional
person in the chain seems to add an individual
twist to the story. Everyone has a good laugh
when comparing the final story to the original.
When I play advanced versions of this game, I add
time pressure and distractions to the repetition
process. For example, I often stand at the front
of the seminar room hurrying the class along.
This game can produce a lot of laughs in a
classroom, at a party, or at a dinner table. But at
the negotiating table, miscommunication is no
laughing matter.

Steering Others to Clarity
Nobody wants to be a bad communicator. Most people are insulted if someone
tells them they are difficult to understand. At the beginning of my seminars,
I discuss the basic skills needed in every negotiation. Then I ask students
to rate themselves on these skills. I have never had anyone in any seminar
describe himself or herself as a poor communicator — even those who say
that communication is the area that they need to work on the most.
When the other party is not being clear, your job is to steer that person toward
concise communication. Don’t just toss them this book (although it may
make a nice gift). Coax from your counterpart a clear statement of intentions,
wants, and needs. Your technique for acquiring this information depends on
the type of person you are dealing with. The following sections contain some
tips for accomplishing this important task. Each section is devoted to a per-
sonality type you may encounter.
Tangent people
Some people are not clear because they ramble; that is, they go off on a tangent.
 Listen up to a point. You are listening especially for a good point to
break into their discourse so you can bring them back to the topic.
 Be assertive when you interrupt. Not impolite, but firm.
 Your first statement should be a validation, “Yes, you’re right. Now, as to
the purpose . . .” That’s how you get people with this type of communi-
cation pattern back on track.
Interrupters
These people even interrupt themselves. They lose their train of thought
while they are speaking and tend to jump from point to point.
 Take careful notes while an interrupter is talking. But don’t write the ideas
down in the order they are presented. Write a topic heading. Make notes,
and when the speaker switches topics, leave a lot of space. Write a new
topic heading and the notes. When the speaker switches back to a previ-
ous topic, go back to that topic section and continue your note taking.
 Concentrate and stay focused. This is hard work.
 Keep reminding the speaker of the most recent statement before the
interruption. Don’t leave until you get a specific answer.
 Be appropriate but keep pressing with your own specific questions.

Chapter 11: Being Crystal Clear: Telling It Like It Is

Unprepared people
Some people may have difficulty getting fully prepared for negotiations.
For whatever reason, they never seem to have all the answers. You can do
one of two things:
 Postpone the meeting.
 Conduct the meeting at the unprepared party’s office. Tactfully invite your
counterpart’s support people who may know more about the subject.
Too busy to be clear
These important people don’t think they can take the time to be clear. They
save minutes, but others may spend hours trying to figure out what they
want and need.
 Schedule meetings at the beginning of the day to avoid distractions and
ensure everyone’s full attention.
 Guard against interruptions; for example, request the person hold his or
her calls for ten minutes in order to get information.
 Be efficient in meetings — have a written agenda even for a two-person
meeting. The agenda shows others how much you value the person’s time.
 Show you are taking notes and recording comments.
 Be appropriate but keep pressing for the details you need.
Sometimes, you need to steer your boss to clarity. The next time the boss slams
papers on your desk and says, “We need this yesterday,” do the following:
1. Stifle the urge to answer “in your dreams.”
2. Answer immediately.
Respond with a positive, “Yes, absolutely — will do.” After all, this is the
boss. And this reply will relax your employer because it’s what any boss
wants to hear.
3. Ask for prioritization.
This step is essential: Because you are already fully aware of your priorities
and the allotted time to accomplish them, answer, “Here’s the situation,
Boss. I’ve got these other two priorities you want by 3 o’clock today.
Which of these can be put off until tomorrow?”
160
Part II: Getting Your Point Across 

By following these steps, you have forced the boss to be clear. Your boss
needs to prioritize — that’s a boss’s job. Sometimes your boss will go away
without making any further demands, realizing that you are already working
on important projects.
Capturing an Audience
You’ve heard the phrase, “It’s all in the presentation.” The same applies to you.
Clarity makes you a good presenter during a negotiation. Here are some tips to
help you get through your next negotiation, when the spotlight is on . . . you:
 Analyze your audience. Put yourself in your counterparts’ shoes. Try to
understand their map of reality, and anticipate what outcome they seek
from the negotiation (see Chapter 3). After you gauge what your audience
wants, you can figure out how best to sell your ideas of the negotiation
at hand.
 Set your goal and keep it handy. Decide what outcome you would like
to achieve as a result of the negotiation (see Chapter 5). Make sure that
everything you say and do contributes to that outcome. Make sure that
you stress your key points. Present your ideas and, if you are making a
formal presentation at the beginning of a negotiation on a large project,
consider giving your audience an outline of your presentation so they
can follow along. They can follow your outline and use it to take notes. It
also gives you a measure of control on what information they take away.
 Do your homework. Research. Research. Research. Don’t start a negoti-
ation knowing little or nothing about your topic. Anticipate questions,
and make sure you have the facts to back them up (see Chapter 4). Always
prepare so you’re ready for any emergency such as a well-aimed question
from one of your counterparts. Preparation will give you reserve power.
You want people to sit up and take notice. If you are going to make a
formal presentation at the opening of a negotiation, be sure to practice.
Practice until you know you are prepared to tackle any question thrown
at you. Remember, your time in front of a group is your showcase.
 Confidence is the key. Confidence is the key to being crystal clear.
Remember, you have to be confident to show confidence. Have faith in
yourself and your abilities. Think about how your presentation will help
your audience to get what they want. Your goal remains fixed. Your job
is to convince your listeners that your goal is something they want for
their side also. Careful preparation provides the solid ground you need
to support your self-confidence. Coach yourself. Tell yourself you can do
it. Listen to your inner voice (see Chapter 10) and tell yourself that you
are more qualified than anyone else in room to give your presentation.
161
Chapter 11: Being Crystal Clear: Telling It Like It Is

 Plan your presentation. Make a list of all the points you plan to discuss
in your negotiation. Group your topics of discussion into sections and put
the sections in the order that best achieves your objectives. When you
put your talk together, keep in mind why your audience would want to
hear what you have to say. Their interest in your points is not automatic.
Remember, they are there to convince you that their goals are just what
you want, not vice versa. You have to work to get their attention. Never
assume that they will automatically pay close attention to what you
have to say.
 Plan your format and delivery. Speak loud and clear. Don’t mumble.
Don’t put your hand near your mouth, obscuring the sound of your
voice. How you give your talk can be every bit as important as what you
say. If needed, use your outline to guide you through your discussion.
Don’t make your presentation monotonous. You don’t want to bore your
audience. The most exciting idea in the world will fall on deaf ears if it’s
presented in a boring manner. Conversely, audiences have been known
to rally around some pretty lame ideas when they were fired up by a per-
suasive speaker.
 Manage expectations. Communication is a two-way street. Before you
begin your negotiation, be sure everyone in the room knows what to
expect. They will arrive with some preconceived ideas. Your advance
communication about your presentation needs to be clear to set the 
perceptions right so no one is confused or disappointed.
Never take your audience for granted. People have very short attention spans.
Not more than 15 percent of a person’s brain power is required to understand
your language and grasp what you mean. Don’t let the remaining 85 percent
of a person’s brain slip into a daydream. To keep your audience with you,
make your message visual, build anticipation, create a conversation cycle.
Keep your listener’s mind 100 percent occupied.
When You Have to Say No
Sometimes, you just need to say no, and being as clear as possible should be
your goal. Here’s how to do it without alienating someone.
Tom knocks on top of your cubicle partition, leans in, and asks, “Got a minute?”
Instead of glancing at your watch and saying okay with a martyred sigh, you
look up and analyze the request. You see his lower lip trembling and his eyes
filling with tears. You know he wants to talk about his divorce — again — and
you have a report to finish. You recognize that this won’t be a 60-second
interruption, no matter what he claims. You resist the reflexive hot button
response, “In your dreams, pal,” because you depend on Tom in your job.
A rapport with him is a priority for you. Use the triple-A approach:
162
Part II: Getting Your Point Across 

 Acknowledge: Tell him that you understand how he feels and what he
wants. “Tom, you look upset — it looks as though you need to talk.”
This statement, which takes only six seconds to say, calms him because
now he doesn’t have to work to make you understand his feelings. You
have said, in essence, “I understand your priority — and it’s important”
(another sentence that takes six seconds to say). We call this six-second
empathy.
 Advise: Let him know your priority — calmly and confidently. Say, “Tom
here’s the situation. I have a report to finish for the boss, and it’s due in
half an hour.” You have understood his need, and now you’re asking him
to understand yours. Many people, when told of your priority, will back
off. But not Tom. That’s why there’s a third step.
 Accept or alter: Accept the interruption with time limits (“I can give you
five minutes”) or suggest an alternative option (“I’ll come to your cubicle
after I finish the report”).
This is the best way to say no. Use it as a model. You won’t always be able to
achieve the ideal outcome described, but try to come as close as you can.
With peers, you can suggest an alternative option, but what about with your
boss? Tom will actually thank you and go away happy. With the boss, your best
option is almost always to accept. The boss’s priorities are your priorities —
it’s in the job description. However, don’t leave out the second step. Always
advise the boss of your activities and priorities. Sometimes the boss is grate-
ful for the information and withdraws the request or removes some of your
existing obligations. Other times, you are expected to do all the work anyway.
Advising puts the burden on the boss to say which task is to be done first.
Never skip that step.
Barriers to Clarity
The biggest barriers to clarity are your own fears and lack of concentration.
You fear that if you make yourself clearly understood, an adverse reaction
will follow — some vague, unspoken, definitely unwanted reaction. Identify
those fears and work to make them less of a roadblock.
Fear of rejection
Everyone has a built-in fear factor. You may be afraid that if you present your
ideas clearly, the listener will reject you or your conclusions. The natural
inclination is to avoid rejection by blurring lines, being unclear, and failing to
state your case accurately.
163
Chapter 11: Being Crystal Clear: Telling It Like It Is

Instead, you postpone the inevitable. After all, when the listener eventually
understands you, he rejects the concept with the added energy that comes
from frustration. “Why didn’t you say so?” he asks. “Why did you waste my
time?” he demands. These are tough questions to answer.
If it is true that an accurate statement of intent would cause the deal to fall
apart, being clear is even more important. When you close a deal without
being clear, the parties have different understandings and expectations.
You are finalizing a bad deal. In fact, you are closing a deal that cannot 
possibly work.
Fear of hurting someone else
Often, people avoid hurting the feelings of others not out of compassion, but
out of self-protection. Everyone wants to be liked; no one wants to be shunned.
Toward that legitimate social end, you have probably learned to obfuscate
with a vengeance.
I’ve developed some stock phrases to use after a bad play or a weak film
when the producers cluster around to hear my praise. “Very interesting” is
one of the most damning. “Brave” is good. “Top of the genre” is probably my
noncommittal favorite. Sometimes, when a work is a “work in progress,” such
vague statements are suited to your purpose of encouraging the creators.
Such phrases are intended to mask the truth, and they do just that.
Being clear and being confrontational are two different things. If you have
bad news to deliver, do so with dignity and respect for the person’s feelings.
Even if you feel, in every fiber of your being, that the person is overreacting
to your news, don’t say so. Let the feelings run their course. But don’t flinch
or amend your statement. Just wait. This, too, shall pass. Being clear in such
situations takes strength and confidence. Never sacrifice clarity to avoid con-
frontation. Your desire to do so generally masks the real motive — which is to
spare yourself the discomfort or trauma of delivering bad news.
General distractions
Other barriers to clarity can be fatigue, laziness in preparation, or the clutter
of distracting interruptions.
 Fatigue: You may be just plain tired and unable to focus. Pay attention to
your body’s signals. Sometimes a brisk walk outdoors revives you. Good
nutrition and adequate rest are requirements for a master negotiator. If you
eat right and get plenty of sleep, you can eliminate the need for cup after
cup of coffee to stay alert. But, in a pinch, an occasional dose of caffeine
works, too.
164
Part II: Getting Your Point Across 

 Laziness: You may not have prepared well enough and you are dreading
being clear on some facts that are unsubstantiated. If this situation strikes
a familiar chord, do your homework.
 Interruptions: Your listener may be doodling or not making eye contact.
The room temperature may be extreme. Noise levels may be too high for
you to be heard clearly. Hopefully, you are assertive enough to request
these changes appropriately.
If the conversation or negotiation is important, be sure that you are well rested,
prepared, and in an environment where clear communications can be heard.
The High Cost of Not Being Clear
I realize that my clarion call for clarity flies in the face of advice you may receive
from others who are not professionals in the area of negotiating. In fact, some
say that ambiguity is the lubricant of negotiations. That saying not only pro-
longs a bad myth about negotiating, it has spilled blood, cost lives, and
wasted millions of dollars, drachmas, and dreams.
The highest cost of all
The first Gulf War (Desert Storm) may well have been avoided if the diplo-
mats had been clearer in the days just before the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq.
President Saddam Hussein of Iraq wanted to destroy Kuwait for a number of
reasons — all of which were good and valid to him. He was not prepared to
take on the United States, let alone the entire world. Therefore, he met for
several hours with America’s Ambassador April Glaspie.
The ambassador said to Hussein, “We have no opinion on Arab-Arab con-
flicts, like your border disagreement with Kuwait.”
Astonishing.
The ambassador insists that there was more to the discussion than was
printed in the transcript, but she doesn’t deny these comments. A disparity
exists between the two parties’ renditions. Assume that each party related
the events as accurately as possible. Obviously, they were not as clear with
each other at the time of the original discussion as they were in the reporting
of the discussion afterward.
Even Hussein’s telling of the tale indicates some lack of clarity regarding his
intentions toward Kuwait. He never said his intention was to eliminate Kuwait
from the face of the earth. On the other hand, the United States never even
hinted at the kind of response that was ultimately invoked.
165
Chapter 11: Being Crystal Clear: Telling It Like It Is

Obviously, the communication was not clear. Clear communications may or may
not have prevented the Gulf War. A clear message from the United States to
Iraq may not have been believed. Perhaps Iraq was willing to wage war against
the United States for some mysterious reason. The world will never know.
However, documents show that within the month before the invasion, the
United States communicated directly to Saddam Hussein in a way that caused
him to think Iraq could cross the border into Kuwait without repercussions.
If you ever question the wisdom of being clear, please think for a moment
about the men and women who died in the Gulf War and their families who
still miss them. Every war provides stories of the high human price paid for
failed communications. In World War II, Japan actually intended to send us a
two-hour warning before the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.
The Japanese decoder at the embassy was out sick that day, and his replace-
ment could not type. Consequently, the message wasn’t delivered to anybody
in authority until after the fact.
Deals that disappear
A common example of lack of clarity occurs when one party intentionally
makes an unrealistic opening offer. Early in the negotiation, one person
throws out an outrageous opening offer although it is intended as a trial 
balloon, it is presented as though it were a reasonable offer or worse, as
something for which there is very little negotiating room. If the offer doesn’t
get the expected reaction (shock, disbelief, laughter, and ultimately bursting
of the balloon), the person who made the offer often recounts, with great ani-
mation, that the other person “didn’t even bat an eye.”
Too much is made of the fact that a counterpart doesn’t faint when an unreal-
istic number is offered. What you don’t hear about so often is the follow-up.
As I was writing this book, I purposely followed up every time I heard such a
story. I tracked the negotiations to see the results. I was not totally surprised
to discover that — in a majority of the cases — the deals fell through. In all
but one case, the reason was an excuse other than the initial high demand,
such as scheduling conflicts, changing concepts, and postponements.
This little study of mine was not scientific in any way, but it provided interest-
ing support for my theory. When you start with an opening offer or a demand
that is well outside the reasonable range, the other side will often slink away
rather than get involved in a futile negotiation.
It would be difficult to ascertain what percentage of negotiations never get
underway because the initial demand was too high. I believe that it happens
more often than most people suspect. The person who is turned off may
never say a word to the party making the demand. Think of your own behav-
ior. If you think the prices in a boutique are outrageous, do you say so? Or do
you smile at the shopkeeper and say, “Just looking”?
166
Part II: Getting Your Point Across 

The prices you pay without even knowing
Deals that don’t close are to be expected if you’re not clear during the nego-
tiations. The harder item to assess is how the dynamic of the discussion
changes when communications are not clear.
When you are not clear, the other party feels insecure. Rather than confront
you on your lack of clarity, the person you’re negotiating with often just com-
pensates in one of two ways:
 Reciprocal obfuscation: That term simply means that the other party
starts to be unclear, too. (I love the irony of using a hard-to-understand
phrase to describe things that are hard to understand.) The other party
doesn’t know where you stand, because you are not being clear. So, they
won’t feel comfortable making a clear commitment either. This situation
substantially slows down a negotiation and may make productive com-
munication almost impossible.
 Leaving lots of room to maneuver: If you are not clear, others won’t feel
safe enough to tell you specifically what they want. Rather than commit
to a position, your counterpart will leave lots of room to maneuver, until
you clarify where you want to end up.
These consequences are almost impossible to detect. Instead, you begin
blaming the lack of clarity or indecisiveness on the other party. If you run
into one of these behaviors, see whether the problem didn’t start with you.
Even if it didn’t — even if you are dealing with someone who is naturally
unclear or reluctant to take a position — you can push that person to greater
clarity or decisiveness by communicating more clearly yourself.
Worst case: The deal closes
When a lack of clarity is a major factor in a negotiation, the biggest disasters
occur when the deal closes and no one realizes that confusion remains.
When written contracts are to follow, a lack of clarity is usually caught by
the lawyers during the drafting stage, and the ambiguity can be worked out.
In a less formal situation, the confusion generally isn’t discovered until much
later. When that happens, both sides feel cheated and misled. People are rarely
neutral about the cause of miscommunications. Blame is never far behind the
discovery that the two parties failed to communicate well. Each party feels
intentionally misled. The acrimony often permanently damages the relation-
ship between the parties. The fallout often damages reputations, too.
The truth of the matter is that the results of an intentional lie and a mere 
miscommunication are often about the same. Preventing an innocent mis-
communication is well worth the extra energy expended.
167
Chapter 11: Being Crystal Clear: Telling It Like It Is

Phrases You Should Never 
Use during a Negotiation
Clear communication is as much about getting rid of bad habits as it is about
acquiring any new skills. As you look over this section, ask yourself whether
you do any of the things that interfere with communications. Getting rid of
those habits will serve you better than any new skill. The truth is, being clear
requires periodic checkups like an annual physical. Everyone needs to look
at this aspect of home and office life from time to time. Bad habits creep into
communications rather easily.
Certain phrases go “clunk” against the ear every time you hear them. Here are
some phrases that have little place in life, let alone a negotiation. When you
hear these phrases, a yellow caution light should start flashing in your head.
These phrases often indicate a situation that needs to be addressed. And if
you hear one or more of these utterances come out of your mouth, stop
immediately. Laugh about the slip or apologize, but don’t assume that the 
listener doesn’t have the same set of yellow caution lights that you do.
Maybe the listener doesn’t, but you can’t take that risk.
“Trust me”
This overused term is now the hallmark phrase in motion pictures for the
producer who is not to be trusted. People who must say “trust me” are often
the very people who don’t deserve to be trusted.
When someone says “trust me” as a substitute for providing the specific details
you requested, be very cautious. Ask again for a commitment. If the person
balks, explain that it’s not a question of trust, but an acknowledgment of the
fact that circumstances change. Explain that the agreement must be enforce-
able, even if the current negotiators are no longer accessible. You want an
agreement so clear that you don’t have to trust the other person.
“I’m going to be honest with you”
So has this person been dishonest all along? This cliché is the cousin to the
phrase, “I’m not going to lie to you.” It makes you wonder, “Oh? Would you lie
to someone else?”
William Shakespeare’s great line delivered by Queen Gertrude in Hamlet is,
“The lady doth protest too much, methinks.” Shakespeare knew a great deal
about human nature. When people loudly declare their innocence, they
168
Part II: Getting Your Point Across 

almost always lose credibility. Gertrude says that the Player Queen affirms
too insistently to be believed. So those who are always reassuring you about
their honesty probably aren’t being very honest with you.
“Take it or leave it”
Even when you are making your final offer, presenting the deal as a “take it or
leave it” proposition is a mistake. Even if the other side accepts the offer, the
deal leaves them feeling bad about the decision. Unbelievably, we have heard
of people putting such an unpleasant tag on an offer that was otherwise okay.
This label makes the offer sound bad even if the terms are reasonable.
If you hear this phrase, evaluate the offer on the merits, not on the way it was
delivered. Especially if you are a professional negotiator, figure out if the offer
is acceptable based on what you want out of the negotiation. Don’t let a bad
negotiating style confuse you. If you are negotiating for yourself, and you
must continue working with your counterpart in this deal, you may want to
consider whether you can maintain an ongoing relationship with a person
who is bullying you with “take it or leave it” statements.
If you are making a final offer, say so without using the antagonistic take-it-or-
leave-it phrase. If you are feeling frustrated and anticipating a refusal, push
the pause button (see Chapter 12). When you are feeling that way, it is hard to
calmly explain the reasons that this must be the final offer. You are likely to use
this verboten phrase (“Take it or leave it”) or something similar. That approach
hurts you in the long run because you look like a bully. And you don’t increase
the chance of your proposal being accepted.
“You’ll never work in this town again”
This is a bully’s threat. Everyone has observed this bullying behavior. Once is
enough. Threats never win the hearts and minds of the person you are attempt-
ing to persuade. In today’s litigious society, threats are not smart.
“You’ll never work in this town again” used to be a stock phrase in the enter-
tainment industry, uttered furiously by the tirading studio executive dealing
with a recalcitrant actor or writer. An executive at Twentieth Century Fox
once issued this threat to an actor who refused to accept a lesser credit than
his contract guaranteed for work on a television series. The series ultimately
failed, and, guess what? The actor was unemployed for several years. The actor
sued Twentieth Century Fox, attributing his long period of unemployment to
the studio’s threat. Who knows, he may have been out of work anyway, but
given the threat, the jury sided with the actor and awarded an enormous
judgment.
169
Chapter 11: Being Crystal Clear: Telling It Like It Is

People in positions of power often get frustrated when someone of lesser
status refuses what they view as a simple and reasonable request. Usually,
the next step is a plea to “play ball.” Then some avuncular advice follows,
such as “You know, you really would be better off helping us out of this one,”
or “We’ll make it up to you on the next one.” When the person isn’t persuaded,
the power player often pops a cork.
Good manners, common sense, and the growing body of employment law all
favor the threatened person. Don’t resort to this tactic. You could lose the farm.
A slur of any kind
We are well into the 21st century and, in the United States at least, negative
comments about the race, gender, sexual orientation, or national origin of
another person are no longer widely tolerated. Many people are concerned
with being “politically correct.” There are those who are offended at any
inquiry that could even identify these traits, such as “What kind of a name is
that?” Unless you know differently for sure, steer clear of the most innocent
of references unless they are relevant.
If the information is irrelevant, you should even avoid neutral statements
such as, “The person was a woman” or “The man was from China.” You may
receive an angry response, such as “Just what is that supposed to mean?”
“Why did you mention that?” Worse yet, the person you are speaking to may
think those thoughts without verbalizing them. This situation raises a barrier
to communication that you won’t even know exists.
Even if you are with a group that seems to be quite open about expressing
whatever they happen to think or feel about another group, don’t join in.
Be discreet. You never know who may be suffering in silence — feeling 
outnumbered and helpless.
Oh sure, you may be able to disparage all members of a certain group in the
privacy of your own home with impunity. But even there, I urge you to curtail
such comments. Those attitudes are too easily passed on to the young, and
the slurs have a nasty way of showing up in conversation outside the home.
The last thing you want in a tough negotiation is to let an offensive phrase
slip out just when you want to close. You can lose the deal you are working
on and the trust and confidence of your counterpart in the negotiation.
Unwitting slurs can stop a negotiation in its tracks. You may be pegged for-
ever as a bigot; and some people don’t negotiate with bigots. If you have
some bad habits in this area, work on cleaning up your language.

How to Really Garble Communication
Sometimes I can talk all day about how to improve communication and
people never get it. In the spirit of fun, here are some handy tongue-in-cheek
tips for people who strive to be bad communicators, to stay unclear, and to
keep creating quagmires and confusion in their lives.
Use these six little secrets to keep your life in chaos. Use them in business
and at home to keep things in turmoil. These are also handy ways to ensure a
high employee turnover.
Raise your voice
If you really don’t want to get your point across, just begin shouting or scold-
ing. Either response prevents any further intelligent discourse. This rule is
particularly important when a language barrier prevents someone from
understanding you. When someone doesn’t understand your language, just
talk louder. Loud communicates the same message to people all around the
world. Loud is disrespectful. Loud characterizes someone you don’t want to
do business with.
Leave out details
Details let the other person know exactly what you want or need. Leave the
message fuzzy if you want to continue having bad communication. Details
take time. You can shave valuable minutes off the average communication by
leaving out the details. After all, it only takes a few hours to clean up most
messes created by such an omission.
Don’t check to see if you were understood
This rule is very important for would-be bad communicators. If you spend
time checking to see whether you were understood, all the other efforts you
make to be a bad communicator can be thrown out the window. Don’t give
the other person a chance to say, “I didn’t understand xyz.” Otherwise, you’ll
have to clarify. If you want to be unclear, do your deed and skedaddle before
anybody can ask any questions.
171
Chapter 11: Being Crystal Clear: Telling It Like It Is

Walk away and talk at the same time
Toss your request, instruction, or demand flippantly over your shoulder as
you are walking away from the person to whom you are speaking. Preferably,
avoid looking at the other person during conversation. This technique denies
virtually any possibility of being understood. And you haven’t wasted those
precious seconds required to face the person you are talking to and make eye
contact.
Assume that everyone understands you
If you are a bad communicator, you already know about the dangers of assum-
ing information, but we thought we would remind you anyway about the most
popular tool of the unclarity trade. Just send an old-fashion telegram when a
detailed letter is needed.
Don’t permit any objections or questions
Heck, don’t permit any response. The other person may be taking up your
time to understand the niggling information. Toss out whatever you have to
say and cut off the discussion. Anything further would just help clarify what
you are saying.

Part III
Getting Past the
Glitches to 
Close It Up

In this part . . .
You’re all fired up to negotiate . . . so why am I telling
you to cool down? The fact is, putting some emotional
distance between yourself and the negotiation actually
gives you the upper hand. Look in this part to find your
personal pause button so you can put those emotions on
hold and calmly close the deal. Some people believe that
closing the deal is the last step to every negotiation. Not so.
You must keep the close in mind throughout the negotia-
tion process, from beginning to end. Negotiations can drag
on interminably when this simple fact is forgotten.

A
ll master negotiators possess a certain skill that intimidates, inspires
awe, or just plain leaves others in the dust. This essential negotiating
skill is hard to discern as you sit with a master negotiator, but over the years,
I have discovered that the ability to maintain emotional distance from what-
ever is being discussed is what differentiates the master negotiator from the
very good or merely lucky negotiator.
The best way I know to maintain this emotional distance in a negotiation is
through a technique I call pushing the pause button. Knowing when and how
to push the pause button not only endows you with an aura of composure
and confidence, but also gives you control over all the critical points of the
negotiation.
The notion of a pause button and how to use it in a negotiation first appeared
in some booklets that I wrote before I penned the first edition of Negotiating
For Dummies, which included an entire chapter on the topic. As I began
reviewing literature in the field, I realized that virtually every book and lec-
turer talked about how you have to learn to keep your emotional distance
during a negotiation, but Negotiating For Dummies was the only book that
showed you how to do that.

What a revelation. As I began facilitating workshops around the world, I spent
more and more time on this important skill. I am particularly proud of this
contribution to the field of negotiation.
This chapter explores the wonderful world of the pause button and the hot
buttons that everyone has. You can use the pause button as a tool to avoid
the high cost of the emotions triggered by your hot buttons. The more you
know about these subjects, the better success you will have in negotiating
and in life.
Defining the Pause Button
Pushing your pause button is the best way to keep some emotional distance
during high-stress situations — at home, at work, anywhere you need a little
space. I teach this method in my negotiation courses to explain the concept
that waiting is good — that doing nothing is sometimes the right action. I tell
students, “If you’re getting stressed out, don’t just do something . . . sit
there.”
Pushing the pause button just means putting the negotiations on hold for a
moment or an hour or an evening while you sort things out. Everyone owns a
pause button, so to speak, and everyone pushes it in a different way.
When you push the pause button, you freeze-frame the negotiation — much
as you freeze-frame a movie on the television screen with your remote con-
trol or on your computer. You step away, physically or psychologically, to
review the work you have done up to that point and check over your plan for
the rest of the negotiation. You take a break. It may be purely mental; it may
be imperceptible to the other side; but you give yourself whatever time it
takes to review matters before you continue.
This focused review is a separate activity from the other basic elements of
negotiation. It gives you an opportunity to regroup, catch your breath, and be
sure that you aren’t missing anything. The pause button gives you that little
bit of emotional distance that allows you to make the decisions you want to
make in your business and your life.
Pushing the pause button gives you the opportunity to review the entire
process of negotiating and to make sure that you aren’t overlooking anything.
It allows you to avoid getting boxed into a corner. By pushing the pause
button, you keep your emotions from ruling (and ruining) the negotiation.

Knowing how to use your pause button is so important that I include a pause
button on the Cheat Sheet at the beginning of this book. Tear out this pause
button and carry it with you until you develop one of your own. Whenever
negotiations get heated, having this card with you should serve as a reminder
to press your internal pause button. (The back of this card lists the basic
skills of negotiation. After you press pause is a good time to review these
skills as they relate to the negotiation at hand.) I am told that senior execu-
tives across the country have taped this little card to their computer screens.

Chapter 12: Pushing the Pause Button to Turn Off the Hot Buttons 
The pause button in High and Low
High and Low is a film based on the novel King’s
Ransom by American novelist Ed McBain. It’s a
movie about kidnapping and a mis-assessed sit-
uation. See how this subject matter is handled
in the hands of one of cinema’s greatest direc-
tors, Akira Kurosawa.
This classic movie features one of the great
actors of our day, Toshiro Mifune. He plays a
wealthy businessman who must work through
his moral, ethical, and financial dilemma when
his chauffeur’s son is mistakenly kidnapped
instead of his own. What a negotiation! And
even though the film is subtitled, you will have
no trouble following the story.
Notice, first, how the professional negotiator —
the senior law enforcement official — begins
the process by pushing the pause button.
Everybody has to settle down and wait. Next,
they gather more information about the boy who
was kidnapped and information about the
demands. When the phone rings, the profes-
sional negotiator dons a pair of earphones and
listens. The detectives record the message so
they can listen to it again and again. This way,
clear communications are ensured.
The kidnapper is very bright. He never stays on
the line long enough to be traced, and he knows
Japanese law, which he cites during the con-
versation. One of the detectives calls him the
“smartest crook I ever saw.” But they still don’t
know much about him and don’t seem to be
trying very hard to gather information about him.
You quickly note that this lack of preparation —
which leads the police to speculate about the
kidnapper and his motives — hurts the negoti-
ation because the detectives are acting on
hunches that turn out to be wrong. It makes you
want to throw your Negotiating For Dummies
book at the screen.
You think the movie is going to focus on the
hostage situation. Instead, the plot turns to the
negotiation between the wealthy industrialist
and everyone else in his life as he decides
whether to pay the ransom. The movie goes on
from there, picking up speed each time one
phase of the story ends and a new one begins.

Telling the Other Person 
That You Need a Pause
Everyone has a different way of pushing the pause button. Sometimes, how
you push pause depends on the situation. Here are some of the more
common pause buttons you can use:
 Ask for a night to think the negotiation over. Most people will respect
your request to “sleep on it.”
 Excuse yourself to the restroom. Who’s going to refuse that request?
 For a short break, just lean back in your chair and say, “Wait a minute, I
have to take that in.” For a dramatic touch, try closing your eyes or rub-
bing your chin.
 In a business situation, having someone with whom you have to consult
before giving a final answer is a convenient excuse for pressing pause.
Simply say, “I’ll have to run this by my partner (or family or consultants
or whomever) and get back to you at 9 tomorrow morning.”
So that’s the idea: Your pause button is anything you do to create a space so
you can think over your next move. In chess, those breaks can take so long
that competitive chess has rules about how long the thinking time can be. At
the end of the time, a buzzer goes off. In a negotiation, nothing dictates the
length of breaks. You have to fight to create the time instead of being forced
out of time by an artificial time limit.
Checking with the boss: A classic 
that needs a little prep
If you plan to consult with your boss as a means of pushing pause in a negoti-
ation, you should let the other party know that you don’t have final say.
However, like everything else in a negotiation, don’t try to use this reason
unless you have a boss whom you have to check with from time to time.
Admitting early in the negotiation that you don’t have final authority is often
beneficial. Make it clear that someone above you must approve the decision.
That way, the other party won’t get angry with you. Working this information
into the beginning of your negotiating formalizes the pause button and sets
the tone for a thoughtful, considered negotiation.
178
Part III: Getting Past the Glitches to Close It Up 

Taking notes now for pauses later
Taking notes is helpful at many points in a negotiation (see Chapter 7), but
note taking can also be a pause button. In fact, one of the best times to pull
out your pen is when you need to pause. Writing down statements that con-
fuse or upset you is an excellent way to push pause. Rather than blurting out
an inappropriate or angry response, tell the speaker to hold on while you
write down the statement. Asking the other party to check what you’ve writ-
ten to be sure that you got it right can be enormously effective if the words
upset you. The process of putting those words to paper almost always causes
the other party to backtrack, amend, or better yet, erase the words alto-
gether. You’ll find that most people don’t want their unreasonable statements
on paper for all the world to see.
Coming up with a few pause buttons
Think about all the negotiating situations you’ve found yourself in and the
various pause buttons that different people use. Write down as many as you
can think of in the space below.

The most popular pause buttons that participants report in my seminars
include: taking a drink break or a bathroom break, telling a joke or story,
opening a window, stretching, checking with another team member, and
asking for clarification on some topic that has already been covered.
No matter what your pause button is, you are way ahead of other negotiators
by understanding this concept and knowing how to use it. As you grow as a
negotiator, you will depend on your pause button more and more.
179
Chapter 12: Pushing the Pause Button to Turn Off the Hot Buttons 

Knowing When to Pause
Your first practical opportunity to use the pause button arrives before you
participate in the first session of a negotiation. Ask yourself whether you are
as prepared as you need to be. Then, when the first sentence is uttered,
you’re ready to listen because you have pushed that pause button. When you
speak your first words, you are clearer for having taken that break.
Use the pause button at each critical moment to review the negotiation or to
decide when to close a deal. Definitely use the pause button whenever you
are feeling pressured or under stress.
Of course, the pause you take is only as valuable as what you do during it.
Ask yourself specific questions during these brief respites. Circumstances
differ for every negotiation. Usually, you need to ponder a specific point. You
may want to use the time to check over the other five essential skills in a
negotiation:
 Prepare: Do you need any additional pieces of information?
 Set goals or limits: How close are you to your original goals? Is the
shortfall acceptable? Are the limits you previously set still viable consid-
ering the additional information you have gained during the negotiation?
 Listen: Did you hear everything the other person said? Did it match up
with the body language? Do you need to go back and ask any questions?
180
Part III: Getting Past the Glitches to Close It Up 
A 9-year-old experiences the pause button
My mother sent me to spend one summer with
my Uncle Jim, who lived in Georgia. Quickly, I
noticed how cautiously he answered questions
to which my mom would give a quick yes. Very
often, when I made a request, he would ask a
few questions. (I now recognize that he was
merely preparing himself because I was a new
commodity for him.) If he still was not ready to
answer, he would light his pipe!
He would ceremoniously tamp the tobacco in
the pipe, ritualistically light it with a long
wooden match, and then draw deeply, holding
his breath for what seemed like an eternity,
before slowly exhaling the thin blue smoke into
the silent, anticipatory space. Occasionally, he
would go through all the motions again, though
I was sure the pipe was lit.
Whatever followed seemed like wisdom rede-
fined. How clever! The wisdom was not so
much in his decision but in my uncle’s comfort-
able and not-so-obvious pushing of the pause
button.
Buying even a little time to review and distance
oneself from the negotiation is the critical dif-
ference between the master negotiator and the
merely good negotiator.

 Be clear: Do you wish you had expressed a point or an idea more clearly
or directly? Try to answer this question from your counterpart’s point of
view, not yours.
 Know when to close: Can any part of the negotiation be closed now? If it
seems like everyone is in agreement, have you had plenty of time to live
with the final proposal before accepting it?
When you become conscious of pushing the pause button and what to do
during the pause, such a quick review as the preceding one is almost auto-
matic. Sometimes you are just giving your mind a break. Sometimes you are
pushing the pause button for everybody involved in the negotiation, espe-
cially if things have gotten a little heated.
Parties can get caught up in the emotions of a negotiation. They’re afraid to
lose face. They become angry or distrustful of the other party. They fall in
love with the deal and ignore facts that are important to decision making —
especially if the decision ought to be to walk away. They let their own moods,
or the moods of the other party, rule the negotiating sessions, causing the
negotiations to wander off course. These problems disappear when you use a
pause button.
If you want to watch a negotiator with his hand firmly on the pause button,
see the HBO movie Barbarians at the Gate. This film, based on a true story,
stars James Garner as the president of Nabisco and depicts his efforts to buy
the company. Unfortunately for him, another buyer — played by Jonathan
Pryce — is better prepared and carries a pause button with him everywhere.
Watch him make millions of dollars by delaying a deal one hour. This movie is
a fast-paced, exciting lesson in high-stakes negotiating. What separates the
winner and the loser are preparation and the effective use of the pause
button.
Pausing before a concession
Every request for a concession calls for pushing the pause button. Your
moment of reflection gives the concession some significance. You must 
treat the concession as significant, or you aren’t perceived as having made a
concession — the other party doesn’t realize he or she has gained anything.
No concession is unimportant. By emphasizing each concession in your own
mind, you have not given ground for naught.
This is not just an act. A pause, no matter how slight, before making a conces-
sion gives you an opportunity to be sure it’s the right thing to do in addition
to giving the concession some importance. You want to be sure that you
always have something left to give up in order to hold onto what is important
to you.
181
Chapter 12: Pushing the Pause Button to Turn Off the Hot Buttons 

The obvious and easiest example is conceding a price too quickly. Too often,
a quick concession robs the other party of the good feelings that she right-
fully deserves after making a good bargain. It leaves the other party feeling
that she priced the article too low and that she could have gotten more if
she’d been smarter. Although that may be true, what advantage is it to you
that she feels that way? None. Worse, now she’s out to prevent that mistake
from occurring the next time you negotiate, or she compensates by taking a
hard line on another aspect of the deal. Giving a concession too quickly can
have ramifications across the board.
Pausing under pressure
Some negotiators use pressure to get what they want from you. They may
impose an artificial deadline, use emotional “hurry up” language, or ask
intimidating questions, such as “Don’t you trust me?” or “What else could
you possibly need to know?” Don’t give in to these pressures. Tell whoever is
bullying you into reaching a decision that if you’re not allowed to use your
pause button, you’re not going to negotiate with him at all. Sometimes the
pause button is your only defense against being pressured into making a deci-
sion based on someone else’s deadline.
Decisions made under artificial pressures — especially time pressures
imposed by the other side in a negotiation — are often flawed, simply
because the decision maker does not have sufficient time to consult that
most personal of counselors, the inner voice. (Chapter 10 can get you in
touch with your own inner voice.)
If you’re feeling pressure to reach a decision immediately, you can even push
the pause button to assess whether you need to push the pause button. Take
a few moments to consider whether the pressure for a speedy response is
reasonable. Certain external circumstances do require immediate decisions.
However, they are few and far between, especially in a business negotiation.
If You’re Not the Only One to Pause
Your awareness of the pause button sets you apart from other negotiators.
But don’t worry if the other side is also aware of this technique. Don’t think
of the pause button as a top-secret weapon because, when your negotiating
counterparts have their own pause buttons, the negotiations proceed even
more smoothly and come to a more satisfactory resolution.
Sometimes you have the strong sense that the other person needs to push
the pause button. Never say so in so many words. Instead, be very explicit
about your need to take a break. Mince no words.
182
Part III: Getting Past the Glitches to Close It Up 

 “I need a break.”
 “You know, things are getting a little heated in here. Can I take five?”
 “Let’s call it quits for a while. Can we get together tomorrow morning to
pick this back up?”
Consider how non-threatening those words are. Contrast that approach with
sentences that use the word “you” a lot. For instance, “Hey, pal, you really need
to cool off. Let’s take a break.” No matter how you tone that sentence down,
the other party will put up resistance or react negatively. When you request a
pause, you should focus on your needs and wants, not the other side.
183
Chapter 12: Pushing the Pause Button to Turn Off the Hot Buttons 
Pushing the pause button to save lives
The most dramatic example of good use of the
pause button is during a hostage situation.
Hostage situations arise in several different con-
texts. Sometimes hostages are taken to make a
political point. Sometimes hostages are taken in
an old-fashioned kidnapping for financial gain.
The most common hostage situation arises
because something went wrong in a robbery.
With today’s swift communications techniques,
officers often arrive on the scene of a crime as
the perpetrator is coming out the front door,
which sends the criminal running back into the
building. When that happens, the scared crimi-
nal is trapped and has a brand new problem on
his hands: the unplanned holding of whoever is
inside the bank or store. The criminal doesn’t
have time to figure out what a pickle he is in and
usually thinks he has some terrific advantage.
What happens in real life is that some highly
skilled, well-trained law enforcement officials
swoop in to negotiate for the release of
hostages. The police have a simple mission: Do
nothing to endanger the hostages or to prevent
getting them out safely.
The television cameras generally focus on some
cool cop trained for the task of lead negotiator.
This person was typically trained at the two-
week FBI school in Quantico, Virginia. Where
does all that cool come from? Truth is that no one
can be counted on for constant cool.
That’s why a member of the support team is in
charge of the pause button. This member’s main
task is to continually monitor the entire situation
to be sure that all the officers keep their cool —
no grandstanding, no heroes, just a lot of hard
work. This officer insists on taking enough time
to get the captor’s demands in detail. Without
such a pause, a captor rarely thinks through and
states demands so specifically. If the demands
are laid out clearly, the negotiation closes suc-
cessfully more often than not. The captor usu-
ally walks out with his hands over his head.
Next time you see such a situation on television,
try to find the person standing calmly near the
lead negotiator. That person is probably the
keeper of the pause button. Wouldn’t it be great
to have one person in your life in charge of
keeping the cool? But you’re on your own; you
have to pack your own pause button. Don’t
leave home without it.

When someone else asks for a break, be very cautious before you resist it. If a
person needs thinking time or needs a moment to regroup, allow it. In fact,
take a break yourself. But be alert. If you conclude, after one or two breaks,
that the other party is unfocused or is not paying attention, you may decide
to try to extend a session. You have to distinguish between the other party
using a pause button and the other party just being restless or tired.
Allowing the other party to push the pause button, or pushing your own
pause button, makes the negotiating process more focused, effective, and
pleasant for everyone involved.
Dealing with Your Hot Buttons and 
Other Emotional Responses
Everybody experiences emotions and responses. Just because you are
involved in a negotiation doesn’t mean that you’ll remain cool, calm, and col-
lected throughout. In fact, the more important the negotiation is to you on a
personal level, the more likely it is to stir up your emotional responses.
Of course, sometimes we forget that we have pause buttons — especially
when someone else is pushing our buttons. For example, you ask a co-worker
to do something, and she responds, “That’s not my job.” Feeling your blood
pressure rise, you may be tempted to blurt out, “Well, it’s not mine either,
blockhead!”
You may think this, but you needn’t say it. You have a pause button. When
you push it, you realize that if you utter your first response, you won’t get the
job done and you may alienate the co-worker. (Remember, friends come and
go; enemies accumulate.) So instead you say, “I understand.”
And you do: The person feels overworked and underpaid — don’t we all?
Then you may say, “I know that you’re swamped, but this thing has to get
done to meet the deadline. Can you give it any time at all?” And the negotia-
tion begins. Now you have a chance of getting what you want.
The ability to respond emotionally is a part of every healthy human being.
When you feel emotions welling up inside you, having control means that you
choose to use these emotions to your advantage, instead of allowing them to
send you to the locker room in defeat or cause you to blow up. This section
discusses the emotions that commonly arise in any negotiation — at home or
at work — and suggests ways to handle them in yourself and others.
To negotiate masterfully, you must stay in control of your emotions. This
means having the confidence to take control in the first place and the skill 
to channel your emotions effectively as the negotiation progresses. You can
184
Part III: Getting Past the Glitches to Close It Up 

usually do this — with one exception: when people or situations push your
hot buttons. Hot buttons are stimuli that trigger a response of resistance and
cause you to be tempted to go out of control.
Identifying your hot buttons
So before I go any further, I am going to ask you to do something that is more
difficult than listing your pause buttons. I want you to list your hot buttons. In
seminars around the world, people often get emotional while doing this. The
question is: “What makes your blood pressure rise?” or “When are you most
likely to get upset in a negotiation?” Write down your answer in this space:
____________________________________________________________
____________________________________________________________
____________________________________________________________
Acknowledging clearly and unequivocally what upsets you in a negotiation is
a big step toward avoiding that situation. You recognize your own demons.
You won’t get rid of your hot buttons, but you will know to push your pause
button as soon as the other party exhibits a certain behavior. Does yelling
bother you? If you are aware of that, you can push your pause button at the
first sound of a raised voice.
At my three-day intensive negotiating seminars, I ask the participants to
share their hot buttons with the group, and they always list a wide range of
behaviors. Lying is always one of the first hot buttons mentioned. Many
women dislike being talked down to. Everybody seems to have an aversion to
yelling, vulgarity, and physical bullying, such as desk pounding. If the group
is large, someone usually brings up a new irritant. You are not alone in having
a hot button. You are part of the human race.
Negotiators (and, in fact, humans in general) deal with many different emo-
tions all the time. I will discuss the most common hot buttons that come up
during (and often get in the way of) negotiating.
Pushing the pause button on anger
Negotiations naturally involve a risk of being upset. When people don’t get what
they want, one natural response is to get angry. Everyone knows what it feels
like: The pressure literally builds inside the body. You feel like exploding — and
sometimes you do. However, you have the ability to express anger calmly, but
firmly. Anger is often useful in helping determine your limits. (Truth be told, you
usually get angry because you allowed someone to cross your limits.)
185
Chapter 12: Pushing the Pause Button to Turn Off the Hot Buttons 

When you are genuinely angry at something that happened in a negotiation,
letting the other side know is usually best. This advice doesn’t mean that you
go ballistic. If you don’t consciously and calmly express your anger, it will slip
out anyway, in a more destructive way. Here is what you do: Use “I” state-
ments. For example, say, “I feel really angry because . . .” Avoid “you” state-
ments such as “You are wrong because . . .” They invariably escalate the
emotional charge in the situation.
A prime factor in effective negotiation is the honest communication between
the parties. If you are truly angry about something that has happened, you
need to tell the other side. People are not mind readers. They don’t know
when they have stepped over the line unless you tell them. Let some time go
by, but don’t let the point go, especially if your relationship with the other
party matters to you.
186
Part III: Getting Past the Glitches to Close It Up 
Using anger to reset limits
Not too long ago, I was negotiating the details
of a major stage presentation scheduled to
appear at one of the leading theaters in Los
Angeles, whom I represent. The producer and I
had a two-page agreement covering all the big
stuff — dates, ticket prices, and such. But we
were having a devil of a time with the details.
My client was talking directly with the producer
over some technical points. Tempers flared.
With a rising voice and a “we’ll teach you a
lesson” tone, the other party told my client that
the production would just bypass Los Angeles
altogether. Such a rescheduling would actually
have been more convenient for the other side
than sticking to their promise to come to Los
Angeles on the agreed dates.
After a couple of weeks, things settled down. My
client didn’t want to “make a stink about it.” I
convinced him that constructive comment was
useful. The next time I talked to the lawyer for the
other side, I told her how wrong I thought her
client’s approach was. I calmly said that threats
to break our written agreement really made me
angry, that my client was angry as well, and
threats had no place in our relationship.
Her initial reaction was the same as my client’s:
“Oh, that has all blown over. We didn’t really
mean it.” I reiterated my position clearly and
firmly. When she tried to minimize it, I told her I
wasn’t looking for an apology, but I felt I had to
stick with the point until I was sure that she
understood. By minimizing the situation, she
made me think she didn’t understand that all of
our discussions had to take place on the
premise that each side would live up to its com-
mitments in the written (and signed) short-form
agreement. She paused, and then said, “I
understand.”
We never heard such a threat again. We have
negotiated more shows with the same company
and expect to continue to work with them for
years to come.
Note that the first outburst (in which the other
party threatened to bypass Los Angeles) nearly
blew the entire negotiation and damaged the
relationship. My statement (noting that my client
and I were both angry about the way we’d been
treated) went a long way to clear the air.
Although no one apologized, we reached an
understanding, and no more threats were made.

Expressing enthusiasm
There is no need for secrets or trickery in negotiations. One of the themes of
this book is that your counterpart should be as well prepared as you are —
it’s more fun that way. Here are two guidelines about expressing enthusiasm
during a negotiation:
 Don’t be afraid to show that you really want something . . . that you like
it . . . that you think it is terrific . . . that you would do anything to own it,
and so on.
 Always resist the temptation to gloat or make an outburst when you
think that you have won a point. Gloating is expressing excessive satis-
faction and tends to tell your counterpart that you defeated him or her.
Gloating suggests to the other side that he or she should not have made
the deal. It is better to stay humble (not arrogant) even when you won
every point. You don’t want your counterparts to feel exploited. Just tell
them how much you enjoyed working with them.
It’s legitimate for the person on the other side to ask that anything you
promise during the negotiation be included in the contract. So don’t let your
enthusiasm cause you to promise something that you can’t or won’t deliver.
And when you’re negotiating with someone who is very enthusiastic, be sure
that any promises that he or she makes to you during the course of the nego-
tiation show up in the written contract.
Almost every real estate agent I have ever worked with has said, “Don’t let
the sellers know that you really want the house.” Nonetheless, I have never
bought or sold a house from or to someone without expressing how terrific
the house is.
Many people are afraid that if they reveal how much they want a negotiation
to end in their favor, they will be taken advantage of. But as long as you prop-
erly prepare and set your limits, you cannot be exploited. In fact, letting
others know how much you want what they are selling can give you a great
advantage. You can even get the seller to become sympathetic to your posi-
tion after you reveal how much you want the item in question.
Showing how much you want something is particularly important with some-
thing like a house. Most home sellers have grown attached to the home
they’re selling. They are feeling a sense of remorse at having to sell the home.
People don’t just sell their homes because the floors are dirty. Often, people
are forced to sell their homes because of some traumatic event, such as a
divorce, a job change, a death, the kids’ departure, and so on. In these cases,
you are much better off if the seller knows that you really, really want the
187
Chapter 12: Pushing the Pause Button to Turn Off the Hot Buttons 

house, that you love it, and that you will not change an inch of it. Even when
the reason for the move to another home is positive, the seller is not going to
be happy with derogatory remarks about the old homestead.
Now we’re not saying that you should fake a gush of adoration when none
exists, or be anything but honest when expressing your feelings. We simply
want to wipe away any fear you may have about expressing your eagerness in
a negotiation. If you have otherwise prepared and set limits, virtually no risk
is involved in honestly appreciating the object of the negotiation. You are
able to walk away if the terms of the sale are not right.
Employing a positive attitude
Your attitude is the first thing people are exposed to during a negotiation,
even before you voice a greeting or reach across the table to shake hands.
Attitude is infectious, just like laughing, yawning, and crying are infectious,
so if you begin with a positive attitude, your counterpart will sense that and
adopt some of those good feelings. This works in reverse too, so if someone
else approaches the negotiation with a poor attitude, you’re likely to pick up
on it. When you display a positive attitude — that is, believing that a situation
will turn out favorably — your body language reflects your thoughts and
sends signals of openness.

Passion pays off
Expressing enthusiasm is important when a dis-
tributor is interested in an independent film.
Harvey Weinstein is a master at this technique.
He founded Miramax Films with his brother Bob.
Miramax is now owned by Disney, and their
company is now simply called the Weinstein
Company. The first thing he does when he sees
a film he wants to distribute is to convince the
filmmaker that he really, really loves the film,
that he understands the concept, that he knows
how to distribute the film, and that he would
never dream of changing one frame of it.
This approach works.
Harvey’s ability to obtain the rights to distribute
the best films in the independent film world is
unmatched. The pictures he distributed as the
head of Miramax — The English Patient;
Shakespeare in Love; Life Is Beautiful; Chocolat,
and many, many more — are classics of inde-
pendent filmmaking. Nobody, but nobody, is
better at convincing filmmakers that they should
entrust their babies (oops, films) to his tender,
loving hands. He pursues, cajoles, and per-
suades with passion and purpose. He is tireless.

This idea is critical when you hit a speed bump in the negotiation. In those
tough situations, it’s not what happens to you that counts. It’s how you react
to what happens to you. The pause button is a powerful tactic you can use to
think and act positively. Your success is largely guided by your attitude. In
fact, a study by Harvard University found that when a person gets a job, 85
percent of the time it’s because of their attitude and only 15 percent of the
time because of their knowledge and skills.
Here are four tips to help you maintain a top-notch attitude at the negotiating
table:
 Focus on the future rather than on the past. Focus on where you want
to be and what you want to do. Create a clear image of your ideal out-
come to the negotiation and then take whatever action you can to begin
moving in that direction.
 Focus on the solution. Whenever you’re faced with a problem in the
negotiation, focus on what you can do to change it. Think and talk about
the ideal solution to the setback. Don’t waste time rehashing and reflect-
ing on the problem. Solutions are usually positive, whereas problems
tend to be negative. When you offer solutions, you become a positive
and constructive person.
 Look for the good. Assume that something good is hidden within each
challenge. The old saying about every cloud having a silver lining con-
tains a lot of truth. Sometimes you can’t see it when you’re passing
through the storm, but if you look for the gift, you will find it. Whenever
you push the pause button, you have the opportunity to search for the
positive in the situation.
 Look for the valuable lesson. No matter what comes up in the negotia-
tion, assume that whatever you are facing at the moment is exactly what
you need to ultimately be successful. Use it to learn, expand, and grow.
“Nothing can stop the man with the right mental attitude from achieving his
goal; nothing on earth can help the man with the wrong mental attitude.” —
Thomas Jefferson
Acting assertively
Do you find it difficult to express what you want and need to your boss? Are
you unable to respond at times when you think you should? Are you frus-
trated by a feeling of powerlessness in some day-to-day negotiations? You
don’t need to change your basic communication style to make your needs
known. You can assert yourself softly and appropriately.
189
Chapter 12: Pushing the Pause Button to Turn Off the Hot Buttons 

The art of being assertive is a crucial skill, involving the ability to confidently
and comfortably express your wants and needs without hurting or being
hurt. Many people didn’t learn the art of being assertive as children. In fact,
many people had their assertiveness deprogrammed. As a result, they are ill-
prepared to meet the challenges of the workplace, where people need to get
results through other people. Priorities compete for attention, and the
squeaky wheel often gets the grease, especially in ego-driven environments.
Life’s all about confronting challenges, standing your ground, and, most of all,
having the courage to state clearly what you need and want.
In your life, you face the same choices over and over again — you must
choose between telling the truth to someone who needs to hear it or keeping
the truth tucked away unsaid. You must choose between being comfortable
and safe, or risking discomfort and even the loss of some of your perceived
popularity to get what you want. The payoff for taking the risk is better rela-
tionships built on trust and honesty.
Dealing with discouragement
Many professional negotiators work in the sales field. Selling, even when it’s
done well, involves a great deal of rejection and failure, which can lead to
feelings of frustration and discouragement.
One of my sons-in-law has a career in sales. His company has prepared him
for those moments when he feels that no one will ever buy from him again,
that he will not be able to provide for his family, that he is a failure. Sales is a
tough occupation. Knowing about the tough spots in advance helps John sail
through those patches without giving up.
Tom Hopkins is a master trainer of salespeople. In his book Selling For
Dummies, he spends a great deal of time discussing these emotions. His
advice for when discouragement creeps into your negotiating environment is
the best in the field. The part of the book titled “You Can’t Win ’Em All” deals
with what to do with such feelings and, to some extent, how to avoid them.
Nobody at Wiley Publishing asked me to plug this book. The truth is, this was
the first book I read in the For Dummies series. I was impressed by the quality
of the information, particularly the suggestions on how to keep your spirits
up and keep on going.
The gist of Tom’s advice is to consider failure to be a learning experience;
that is, failure is really feedback that enables you to change direction. I like to
say, “Every ‘no’ puts you one step closer to ‘yes.’ Gathering in the ‘no’s’ gets
you to the ultimate ‘yes’.”
190
Part III: Getting Past the Glitches to Close It Up 

Failure is not an accident. It’s the result of interactions in a system. Failure
has structure and sequence. It involves people, thoughts, feelings, and
actions. Once you understand this sequence, you have a chance of structur-
ing things differently in the future. Failure provides a great learning opportu-
nity and should be viewed as the lifeblood of success.
Look at the case of Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president of the United States.
In 1831, he failed in business. In 1832, he was defeated for the legislature. He
failed in business again in 1834. His sweetheart died in 1835. In 1836, he had a
nervous breakdown. He was defeated for Congress in 1843, 1846, and 1848.
He was defeated for the Senate in 1855, defeated for vice president in 1856,
and again defeated for the Senate in 1858. But in 1860, he was elected presi-
dent of the United States. His string of failures led to his ultimate success.
If things go wrong in a negotiation, don’t be discouraged and wait for others
to change. Instead, start by changing yourself and turning your failure into an
opportunity.
Here are some tips to turn failure into opportunity:
 Get rid of all negative emotions and learn. There is no failure, only
feedback! Briefly acknowledge your discouragement, and then focus on
what you could have done differently. Learning from feedback means
that you are more likely to be flexible in your dealings with others.
 Go into your next negotiation with a fresh mind-set. Use the situation
you are in now as a starting point, and then consider various options as
a roadmap to your ultimate success.
 Take different views of the situation. After you look at the scene from
your view, look at it from different perspectives. Think about how the sit-
uation appears to someone who isn’t involved. Take the emotions (yours
and your counterpart’s) out of the picture, and then think about how
both parties interacted and try to better understand the process.
In a protracted negotiation, you must be prepared to face frustration again
and again. Anything worth doing has the potential for triggering a great deal
of frustration. Nothing of value is handed to you on a silver platter. Seeking a
challenge is part of the human condition.

Chapter 12: Pushing the Pause Button to Turn Off the Hot Buttons 

Handling Stressful Situations
There you are — in the same negotiation . . . again. A few people are stub-
bornly saying the same things they said last week, and you can’t see any
progress. “I hate being here,” you begin to think. You start to worry about
being late to your next appointment. Your face feels hot, and your temple
starts to throb. Just then, someone says something about the computers
being down (again) and that’s why the new figures aren’t ready yet. On top of
it all, the room is terribly warm and, remember, you’re never supposed to let
them see you sweat. “These people don’t know how to control the tempera-
ture,” you think, glaring at strangers across the table. You feel your neck and
shoulders tighten, and the throb in your right temple intensifies and spreads
across your forehead. “My day is ruined,” your internal voice declares. And it
may be.
Stress is an internal response to an external event. All the people and situa-
tions in a negotiation make up the external event, and all your mental and
physical reactions (including stress) are internal responses. Because the
external events seldom are under our complete control, how can you change
your internal response? Pretend to be happy when you’re miserable or to like
the people you can’t stand? Not likely.

Not failures but steps before success
My grandfather was a friend of Thomas Edison.
He wrote Edison’s biography in 1929 after writ-
ing two books about the history of electricity
and its spread throughout the country. He tells
the story of Edison’s invention of the light bulb.
Before he finally succeeded, Edison tried 2,386
different times to sustain light using electricity.
“Wasn’t that discouraging?” he was often
asked. “No,” was his constant response. “Each
time something did not work, I knew I was one
step closer to success.”
No one could use this new invention until Edison
invented a distribution system, meters to mea-
sure the use of electricity, and devices to be
sure that customers got the same strength of
electricity no matter how far they were from the
source. Edison experienced failure far more
often than success — unless you consider
each so-called failure to be a step toward the
successful end.
Edison was able to do this because he kept the
ultimate goal in mind. With the light bulb, his
purpose was to find that elusive combination of
filament and containers that would sustain light.
He didn’t care what the specific combination
turned out to be, so he kept going when any par-
ticular combination failed to work. He knew that
he would eventually find the answer. You can
handle your own small setbacks when you stay
focused on the larger objectives.

At WAR with yourself
Stress is caused by resisting what’s going on around you. When you resist a
stalled negotiation, a rude person, or an uncomfortable situation, you
respond with three emotions: worry, anger, and resentment.
Notice that the first letters of these three words describe the stress response
perfectly: WAR; that is, the war within you. If you look at a stressful event,
you find that the worry, anger, and resentment are not a part of the event
itself; the event is merely the trigger that sets off these three emotions inside
you. Try to distinguish the emotions from the events:
 Worry: You worry about being late. Are you going to a beloved, joy-filled
place or to a place you’d rather not go, where you feel anxiety and pres-
sure to perform? What’s the worry really about — fear of reprisal or pun-
ishment? Is it perceived lack of choice on your part?
 Anger: You feel anger at people whom you suspect aren’t hearing you. Is
the suspicion familiar? Do you often mistrust people — and yourself? Or
is your anger related to the notion that you do more than most people
and aren’t properly recognized for your effort? Do you feel the duties
you have in life are fairly distributed, or do you feel you do more than
your share? Many external events can bring this anger to the surface.
 Resentment: You feel resentment at these people who don’t know how
to control the temperature in their own office! Are you often impatient
with people who don’t do things exactly as you do?
These emotions are human and normal. You gain control when you are aware
of your emotions. When you ignore the WAR, the stress and tension build up
inside of you. Awareness puts you in charge of your reactions.
Stop, look, and listen . . . before 
you have a meltdown
Are you someone who always seems to be stressed out? For example, do you
resent strangers in the supermarket who always seem to be standing in a
faster-moving line? How can you stop fuming and seething in the supermar-
ket line and become the person pleasantly chatting with the customer ahead
of you?
Take a look at your reaction. Is it worry (about not getting home on time)? Is
it anger (at the incredibly incompetent management that didn’t schedule
enough cashiers to work the day)? Or is it resistance (to standing in a line
193
Chapter 12: Pushing the Pause Button to Turn Off the Hot Buttons 

with nothing productive to do)? Consider the opposite of this reaction —
acceptance. Learn to accept. Don’t think, “Oh goody, a stalled negotiation!”
Instead, think about recognition, such as, “Ah — a stalled negotiation. That’s
one of the things that drives me crazy, and now I must deal with it.” Use
humor to accept your circumstances. Only when you accept a situation can
you effectively act upon it. If you’re busy resisting it, you’re paralyzed.
Acceptance involves three steps: stop, look, and listen.
 Stop: Push the pause button. You can use it to gain control over an auto-
matic emotional response.
 Look: Recognize that you are now experiencing one of your stress trig-
gers. Then recognize that you can choose whether to get upset. Look
also means to look at what you really want and ask, “Is being emotional
going to help me get it?” Usually, the answer is no.
 Listen: Pay attention to what your inner self is telling you to do. (In
Chapter 10, I tell you how to get in touch with this inner voice.)
Generally, if you don’t like the deal you’re being handed in a negotiation,
you have three alternatives: adapt, alter, or avoid.
• Adapt means adapting yourself to the situation. Listen to what the
person is saying. You may have unrealistic expectations about the
time it takes some people to reach a resolution, and you may have
to adapt to a delay.
• Alter means changing the situation. Find alternative routes to your
goal; prepare better before the negotiation starts.
• Avoid can usually be eliminated right away. Unless you avoid nego-
tiations altogether, you can’t avoid people and situations that may
cause you to be overly emotional.
Your inner voice will tell you whether to adapt, alter, or avoid. Follow its
advice and you will no longer feel stress.
The best tool to handle emotional people is the empathetic statement. A sin-
cerely empathetic statement shows that you’re listening. Listening by making
an empathetic statement defuses emotional people because often such
people are being emotional to make their points heard. The empathetic state-
ment is calming, comforting, positive, and specific. A good one takes only six
seconds. “I understand how frustrating it is not to get the information when
you want it.” Six seconds. “I understand how easy it is to get impatient with
that machine.” Six seconds. “It sounds like you’re very upset. It looks like you
need our full cooperation.” Six seconds. Not only do you defuse the other
person, you now have time to think of a response to achieve your goal while
staying within your limits.

Chapter 13
Dealing with Difficult People 
and Situations
In This Chapter
 Keeping your cool with difficult people
 Minimizing disruptive behavior during meetings
 Building rapport to influence outcomes
 Dealing with personality types that stall the negotiation
O
ften, you become frustrated or angry in a negotiation not because of
what is being offered but because of how it is being said. Each of us
have a certain kind of individual that riles us up. You know the types —
people who have the potential to get your dander up and throw a meeting off
course. This chapter presents guidelines for handling such people.
I start with the folks right in our very own office before I discuss the folks
who are sitting across the table from us. Then I cover both the personality
types and the terrible tactics that can derail a negotiation.
Office Pests
Let’s face it: Office environments tend to breed weird social dynamics. Most
people can relate to the off-the-wall antics that take place in the Dilbert comic
strip or television show The Office precisely because those behaviors happen
in real life. The next few sections offer tips on dealing with offensive behavior,
working with passive-aggressive co-workers, and managing meetings — the
stuff that makes day-to-day office life fun.
Responding to offensive behavior
Some people don’t seem to care if they hurt someone else or tell a joke at some-
one else’s expense. When you’re the target of such behavior, remembering that

the perpetrator is almost always acting out of insecurity is difficult. You wish
you could ignore the situation, and sometimes you can. But more often you
need this person’s help or input in some part of your job. Your reactions are 
typically anger and resentment.
Sometimes you think of the perfect response after an attack, when it’s too
late. Here are some tips to keep in mind so you can respond appropriately on
the spot to deflect that person and stay in control.
 Don’t resist the person’s remarks. Instead, validate them. For example,
if someone says, “You keep forgetting that price over and over again.
Have you lost your mind?” you say, “It must seem like that to you, 
doesn’t it?” Refusing to strike back eventually bores your attacker. When
there is no fuel for the fire, there is no fire. Admittedly, this is very unnat-
ural. To pull it off you must come from a position of strength. With this
tactic, you will appear to be a wimp or a giant, depending on how you
handle the situation. So, if you can’t respond without rancor or hurt
while looking the other person right in the eye, you may be better off
trying a different approach.
 Acknowledge the truth. The comments that hurt most are those that
have an element of truth in them. For example, if you know you’re not
the most prompt person in returning phone calls, you will be especially
sensitive when someone accuses you of that neglect. The more you
know yourself and your flaws, the better prepared you are when some-
one points them out to you. You can then make it easier to acknowledge
the kernel of truth without agreeing with the way it was said. You can
say, “Yes, sometimes I don’t return calls as fast as I would like to.” You
must then determine which attacks deserve an apology or explanation
from you and which don’t.
 Show the person off. If someone makes a disparaging remark to you in
front of a group of people, call attention to that person. That is, with an
expansive gesture toward the person, address the group. Say something
like, “Well, that didn’t sound very nice to everybody, did it?” or “Gee,
these people aren’t going to get a good impression of you.” Then pause
and let peer pressure take over. Someone in the group is sure to say,
“Hey, yeah Joe, cut it out.”
 Assess your situation. Initially, you may be shocked that you’re being
treated unprofessionally. Take a deep breath and try to understand
exactly what is happening to you. You are probably not the only one
being treated this way. In fact, it’s a dead bang certainty that you’re not
the only one being treated this way. So look around the room and see
who the other victims are. They will appreciate you for speaking up.
 Take concrete action. After you’re fully aware of what is happening, don’t
simply decide to live with the situation. It won’t improve unless you do
something about it. In fact, left unaddressed, the situation usually gets
196
Part III: Getting Past the Glitches to Close It Up 

worse. Let the person in question know that you are on to his or her
game and that you will escalate it to a higher authority, if necessary.
Quietly, professionally, and privately let the person know that you will
have to report his or her difficult behavior.
 Don’t let the problem fester. Make sure to take action swiftly. If you
don’t, you may eventually become so angry that your efforts to address
the situation could become irrational. It’s far better to tackle the prob-
lem while you can maintain some objectivity and emotional control. I
had a recent case in the office where a film editor was working long
hours in the tight quarters of an editing bay with a woman who was con-
stantly berating him. Eventually, he picked up an empty soft drink can
and hurled it in her general direction. You guessed it. I represented his
employer. The woman had filed a complaint against the company, and —
in spite of the provocations — she had a very strong case. The editor
had suffered in silence way too long for his own good, for the good of
the company, or for his own future. Don’t let these situations fester. Deal
with them well before you feel like hurling something at the person who
is bugging you.
 Guard your reputation. Constant complaining about the situation can
earn you the title of “office whiner.” Others in the office may wonder
why you’re unable to solve your own problems, even if their tolerance of
the situation is part of the problem. If you’re involved in a constant con-
flict, fingers may start pointing at you for other problems that arise in
the office.
 Don’t sink to the person’s level. As bad as the person may be, don’t
engage in a dysfunctional approach to deal with him or her. For instance,
don’t start a trail of e-mails gossiping about the person or bad-mouthing
the person to others. You are a professional. If you must have a single
confidant, select that person with a great deal of care. Make sure you
have known the person for a long, long time. Recall Monica Lewinsky
and the terrible downward spiral of her life when her confidant, Linda
Tripp, finally revealed her own hidden agenda.
 Keep it private. Keep your conversations with the other person about
his or her behavior private. Never lose your temper at work or engage in
a confrontation in front of others in the office.
 Make the first move. If you approach a difficult person with the belief
that he or she is as eager as you are to restore rapport, go ahead and
make the first move. Start your conversation with statements such as
“I’m sorry for what I may have done to make you angry” or “I could be
wrong.”
Now, let’s be realistic. None of these methods are easy and none of them
automatically lead to a healthy work environment. If you use these tech-
niques to show you’re not a victim, the office monster usually decides to pick
on someone else. That’s not the ideal result, but it’s better than you being
197
Chapter 13: Dealing with Difficult People and Situations

picked on. Then you can become the office hero by helping the new victim go
through the proper channels to address that person’s behavior and achieve
the result you were not able to achieve on your own.
For a lesson on how to handle a really difficult person at work, see The Devil
Wears Prada. In the film, Anne Hathaway stars as Andy Sachs, a fresh-faced
Midwesterner who goes to New York seeking her first job. She lands a job
working as an assistant to Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), the powerful
editor of Runway, a famous fashion magazine. Miranda throws things (her
coat, her purse) at her assistants, rattles off tasks to be done immediately,
and demands an unpublished manuscript of the new Harry Potter book in
three hours because her twins want to read it. She tells Andy that she needs
to get rid of her wardrobe, devote 24 hours a day to the job, and hope to God
she remembers all of Miranda’s commands. Andy is up to the challenge. The
job is physically and emotionally draining, but she succeeds in her position
by acting swiftly. She never shows she’s a victim and instead uses the job as a
springboard to future success.
One of the reasons the movie is so successful is that it is based on a novel by
the same name — a roman à clef. A roman à clef is a novel in which an actual
person is fictionally depicted. In this case, the character of Miranda Priestly
is based on the editor in chief of Vogue, Anna Wintour, and Andy Sachs is
based on the author of the novel, Lauren Weisberger. So the book has the
heavy bias of the overworked assistant, but the film is a great lesson — start
to finish — on handling difficult people.
Handling the passive-aggressive co-worker
Meet the passive-aggressive personality: passive because these people don’t
speak out directly or act openly, but aggressive because they are focused 
on getting what they want, even if it’s at the expense of others. Passive-
aggressive people can be hostile, and the anger eventually surfaces some-
how. They get even in ways that are so indirect that it’s difficult to pin these
people down. For example, they may leave work half-finished, do it late, or 
do it inaccurately. Some common excuses are “I forgot,” “I didn’t know it 
was due then,” “I didn’t know it included all of this.”
If an instruction can be interpreted two ways, the passive-aggressive worker
will almost always interpret the directive in the way that makes the least
sense. When the mistake is pointed out, this person will point to the instruc-
tion and say, “But you said . . .” Always be very clear with this type of person.
198
Part III: Getting Past the Glitches to Close It Up 

The passive-aggressive person seems to be cooperative, is often calm and will-
ing to help, and may never complain. But somehow the work you counted on
or the task they promised to do doesn’t get done. Aggressive behavior can sur-
face in many other ways with these people. Talking behind your back and leav-
ing angry notes or messages are two other ways they express their resistance.
How can you handle these people? Follow these two general rules when deal-
ing with passive-aggressive people:
 Don’t rely on such a person to do anything critical. This is not an indi-
vidual you should, for example, hire to work for you, marry, or allow to
handle your insurance. The reason is that you never know how this
person will take out his or her emotions on you, and you frequently
don’t even know what those emotions are. These people aren’t straight
with you. And they can end up making you as angry as they are.
 Take your personal feelings out of the equation. Don’t overreact to this
person’s tactics — accept that this is how passive-aggressive people
treat everyone. Yes, indeed. That is who they are, and you can figure out
how to work around them.
Don’t get involved with a passive-aggressive person if you can help it.
However, if you must work with a passive-aggressive individual, follow these
guidelines for remaining cool and objective:
1. Put it in black and white.
Have the person write down all your expectations — or, better yet, write
them down yourself and keep a copy. Be very specific in your notes.
Then the person can’t say, “I didn’t know.”
2. Clearly state the consequences if certain actions aren’t performed —
and have the individual write these consequences down.
Even if you are not this person’s boss, you can still point out 
consequences — there should always be consequences if the person
doesn’t meet expectations. For example, you may say, “If you don’t
deliver the figures by this deadline, I will have to let your boss know.”
3. Follow up.
Don’t let a long time go by before checking up on this person. Keep 
documenting all conversations by writing down what you said and the
response. You just make matters worse by not staying on top of things.
4. Give the person the benefit of the doubt.
Be positive. Watch out for any temptation to get nasty. Keep your cool.
199
Chapter 13: Dealing with Difficult People and Situations

What if you are a passive-aggressive individual at times? How do you know if
you are? Answer these questions with a yes or no:
 Do you utter “tsk” and sigh loudly so someone else can hear?
 Do you mutter under your breath just loudly enough, so someone will
ask, “What did you say?” and then you reply, “Nothing”?
 Do you find you forget to do things you really don’t want to do?
 Can you think of at least three things you recently did above and beyond
the call of duty for which you should have but didn’t receive notice or
thanks?
 Do you judge people as thick if they can’t read your mind?
If you answered yes to at least three out of five of these questions, you
exhibit passive-aggressive tendencies. Cut it out! Start using direct “I” state-
ments, such as “I want . . .” and “I need. . . .” Why? People most often ignore
nonassertive signals — they tend to respond to direct communication. The
more your signals are ignored, the more frustrated and unhappy you become.
Staying in control during a meeting
Intense meetings can get pretty emotional for everyone. However, if you don’t
keep your own and everyone else’s emotions in check by curbing inflamma-
tory behavior, you won’t get anything accomplished. The following are four
types of people who can throw your meeting off course unless you stay in
control.
Dealing with dominators
Dominators are people who disrupt your negotiation because they need to
dominate the conversation. Often these people have strong control issues,
and this is how they express it. You need to be strong and firm in dealing with
these people. Here are some suggestions:
 Credit the speaker’s knowledge of the subject and constructive 
contributions.
 State the need for opinions from other participants. After the speaker
has spoken two or three times, I usually look right at him or her and say,
“I need to hear from some other people.” I have never had a person
speak anyway or become annoyed at the simple statement of an obvious
truth. Be sure to really encourage others to participate. Sometimes the
dominant person is filling a vacuum. More often, the rest of the group
has become somewhat beaten down, as in, “Why bother?” Then you
have to work extra hard to rebalance the group.
200
Part III: Getting Past the Glitches to Close It Up 

 Ask the group or another individual for views or reactions.
 Intervene in personal attacks by partially paraphrasing objective 
information.
 Find a natural break or pause and intervene.
Restraining the ramblers
Ramblers are people who go off on tangents and bore the other participants.
Usually, these folks just need attention. You need to take control and not sac-
rifice the attention of many to accommodate the needs of one person. Try
these techniques:
 Ferret out the final point or question. In this situation, I wait until it’s
clear to most of the people in the room that this person’s statements are
wandering badly. Then I slowly ask, “And your question (or point) is?”
Drawing the question out is key because the person has to stop and
actually hear that his or her time is up. The person realizes that he or
she needs to state the question or point.
 Confirm your understanding of the point of the story.
 Restate the urgency of the objectives and the time constraints.
 Direct a question to another participant or to the entire group and refo-
cus on the objectives.
Curtailing the competing conversers
Sometimes people have side conversations while you’re trying to move
through the meeting agenda. That creates several problems. You lose the
attention of the people in the competing conversation. The people right next
to the conversation have a hard time hearing. You lose control of the meet-
ing. The side conversations tend to multiply. You need to nip that distraction
in the bud and take control. These ideas may work:
 Pause and look directly at the conversers.
 Ask the conversers to share their ideas with the group.
 Restate the importance of the objectives and state that the group will
accomplish more if one person speaks at a time.
Addressing the arguers
Some people feel a need to argue with whatever is being presented. It doesn’t
matter what subject is being discussed; up goes their hand and out comes a
slightly contrary view of the matter. Be aware of those people and use the fol-
lowing guidelines:
201
Chapter 13: Dealing with Difficult People and Situations

 Address the person who is presenting the argument. Use paraphrasing
(restating someone else’s ideas in your own words) to express your
understanding of the remarks he or she has made. If more than one
person is involved, do this for each person. And then give them your
position. Often these people will want to continue this fruitless discus-
sion. In this situation, call on the next person before you answer the
arguer again. You say something like, “Okay, let me answer your ques-
tion, and then I’ll take the questions from Mr. Blue Shirt and Ms. White
Blouse.” This makes it very difficult for the arguer to keep up the dia-
logue. You have cut ’em off at the pass.
 Restate the agreed upon agenda in order to move the discussion back
toward your desired outcome. Summarize points of agreement to re-
establish a positive tone.
Personality Types That Block Closing
Certain types of people always seem to get what they want and leave a
destructive wake of bad feelings behind them. When you negotiate with such
people, you feel that the only thing that would get through to them is a sharp
jab to the chin. You walk away feeling angry and inadequate. This is the kind
of person who makes you say horrible things like, “I coulda killed ’em.”
Before you spend one more moment deciding how to beat these people at
their own game, understand one thing: People with this type of personality
are not nearly as good at negotiating as you are. The fact that you are even
thinking about this problem, when you could be out playing tennis, is proof
positive that you are in the lead. You can be sure that not one of those diffi-
cult types thinks about the impact on you. Ultimately, such people are the big
losers in life. They usually fail to gain as much as they could in specific nego-
tiations, too.
Noted psychiatrist Dr. Ellis Schwied treats a lot of troubled teens. He states
the concept another way: “When dealing with troublesome personalities,
calm yourself. Find your own inner strength and relax into it, rather than
trying to overpower the apparent strengths of the other person.”
In his poem If, Rudyard Kipling said, “If you can keep your head when all
about you are losing theirs . . . you’ll be a man, my son.” Old Rudyard knew a
thing or two about negotiating.
You possess the tools to deal with difficult people. Unfortunately, in the heat
of the moment, forgetting that fact is easy. The following are some helpful
tips.

Part III: Getting Past the Glitches to Close It Up 

The bully
Bullies come in all sizes, shapes, and colors. They use a variety of tech-
niques, such as making take-it-or-leave-it offers, screaming, needling, and
making their counterparts the butt of a joke. You may remember such a
person from the schoolyard. A bully is anybody who tries to intimidate some-
one who is perceived as weaker.
No matter what you do, negotiating with a bully is not going to be a pleasant
experience. If you are negotiating on your own account, you may be wise to
call the whole thing off at this point, because someone who bullies you during
the negotiation will probably try to bully you after you reach an agreement.
Whatever you do, don’t try to outbully a bully. Instead, rely on the six basic
skills of negotiating:
 Prepare: Be sure that you know everything you need to know about
your counterpart before you begin the negotiation (see Chapter 3). To
be forewarned is to be forearmed. Knowing ahead of time that you’re
dealing with a bully somehow takes much of the sting out of the bullying
remarks. It certainly prepares you emotionally and may allow you to
choose ahead of time the words you will (or won’t) utter.
 Set limits: Be sure that you’re very clear about the limits you have set
(see Chapter 6). Never accept from a bully a deal that you would not
accept otherwise.
 Listen: You must work hard to listen to a bully. First, bullies mask their
message in a mélange of language that is hurtful in some way or another.
Second, your own animosity is building, so empathetic listening is virtu-
ally impossible. Finally, if the bully’s purpose is to achieve a desired out-
come by using intimidation rather than sharing information and
reaching a common solution, the bully may never give you the informa-
tion you need. (See Chapters 7 and 9.)
 Communicate clearly: This is very important. Don’t speak often . . . but
when you do speak, make it count. With as little emotion as possible, let
the other party and everyone else in the room know exactly what you
are after (see Chapter 11). Even if you don’t persuade the bully, someone
else may later bully the bully for you.
 Maintain emotional distance: Keep a tight grip on your pause button
(see Chapter 12). Responding in kind is easy when someone is trying to
bully you. Take a few minutes to cool off, if necessary.
 Close: Try to close the deal at every opportunity (see Chapters 14 and
15). After all, if the negotiation isn’t fun, you don’t want it to last any
longer than it has to. After the deal is done, you are done. Fight the
impulse to spread the word about this person.
203
Chapter 13: Dealing with Difficult People and Situations

If you have followed these steps, and closure still seems unachievable, try
telling your counterpart that you are feeling bullied. This may not do any
good, but sometimes a bit of candor can diffuse a situation. Yelling back at a
bully does no good, but telling the bully that the behavior is having the
intended result may just change that behavior. It’s crazy but true: Even bullies
don’t want to be known as bullies. Your simple, unemotional assessment of
the situation will go a long way toward turning things around — especially if
other people are around when you make your statement. Use nonaccusatory
words and “I” phrases, such as “I really feel beaten up when you talk like that.”
Frequently, bullies act from a perceived threat to their position of power. A
landlord may be a bully, but a landlord is sharply restricted in every jurisdic-
tion by strict laws governing the rights of the tenants. The same is true of
people to whom you may owe money. Harassing tactics used to be stock in
trade for creditors. No more. Consumer protection laws exist in every state in
the union. If you face off with a bully, find out what your legal rights are. Then
speak softly and carry a big stick.
Inside every bully is a real wimp who can’t bear the thought of anyone find-
ing out about that weakness. The bullies of the world don’t have any confi-
dence in their inner strength, their true stature, so they create false strength
by bullying people. This compensating behavior doesn’t work in the long run.
It doesn’t even work in the short run if a counterpart realizes what is going
on and walks away from the deal.
The more bluster you hear, the more frightened and scared the bully is. This
knowledge is not all that comforting when you are being yelled at, but push
your pause button, figure out your next move, and then present it calmly.
Sometimes talking about the other person’s fears at the beginning of the next
negotiating session can be very helpful. The other person generally denies
any fear but often settles down because you have made fearful feelings
acceptable. After that mask is removed, you can get on to the substance of
the conversation.
The screamer
The screamer is anybody who does a great deal of yelling or screaming. This
personality type is a variation on the bully, but I deal with screamers sepa-
rately because three distinct types of screamers exist. Each type requires a
very different response:
 The screamer is truly angry, upset, or scared. That is the subspecies this
section is about.
 The screamer is a habitual screamer. Like Old Faithful in Yellowstone
National Park, this person just pops off every now and again. These
types are annoying, but harmless — if you know you are dealing with
such a person, just don’t respond.
204
Part III: Getting Past the Glitches to Close It Up 

 The screamer is a bully. If the person is just trying to bully you, read the
preceding section and act accordingly. You don’t have to accept this
behavior.
The worst thing you can do is sink to the level of someone else’s negative
behavior pattern. If you are not normally a screamer, don’t start just because
the person sitting across from you starts screaming.
A chilly “Are you through?” works well in the movies but is probably little
more than an unimaginative insult in most real life situations. A better, if
more difficult, approach is to be sympathetic. Empathizing with someone
who is yelling at you runs against every instinct in your body, but it may be
the best way to take the fire out of an angry screamer. The next time some-
one is yelling at you, try one of these phrases:
 “I hear from your voice that you’re upset.”
 “Let me be sure that I understand you . . .”
 “Tell me more about that.”
All these phrases are surprisingly calming. It’s not that you’re agreeing with
the screamer, but you’re using empathy, telling your counterpart that you
want to understand what he or she is saying and feeling. Let others know that
you are not upset by their hysterics and deal with the behavior indepen-
dently of the substance of the conversation.
The emotional blast and the content are two different things. If you are able
to draw a distinction between the two in your mind, the other person may
also be able to establish the distinction. If the blast is more than a style — if
it is born out of true emotional outrage — take a break. A situation is seldom
so urgent that you can’t take a breather and come back at a later time. Even a
short break is helpful to clear the air after an outburst.
If you encounter a personality clash that seems too serious to resolve with
any of the preceding methods, you may be able to substitute one or both of
the negotiating parties. Another member of the team may be fresher and per-
haps better able to deal with the bellicose negotiator.
If your boss is a screamer, the result can be very damaging to your health and
your mood, if the screaming is personally insulting, blaming, or shaming. This
person’s anger is most likely not confined to the office, and unless you are a
psychologist on the side, you should not attempt to treat the emotional prob-
lem. You can attempt to modify the behavior toward you in several ways.
When the screaming begins, use an “I” phrase such as, “I feel belittled when
you raise your voice this way. Can you speak more calmly?” If the boss yells
back and refuses, say, “I can’t listen to this. I’ll be back in a few minutes.” And
leave the room. The screamer will either be calmed down when you come
back, or it will be time to dust off the old résumé.
205
Chapter 13: Dealing with Difficult People and Situations

I have heard many success stories using this approach, and many stories of
dusting off the old résumé, which is a success as well. You determine your
own limits for how you will be treated.
For a classic example of a screamer, watch the film Swimming with Sharks.
The film is a satiric look at the nastier, more foul-mouthed side of Hollywood.
Guy, played by Frank Whaley, is a typical nobody who dreams of being a
somebody. (Even his name confines him to anonymity.) When Guy lands an
assistant job working for world-famous Hollywood producer Buddy
Ackerman (Kevin Spacey), his future looks bright . . . until he realizes what
he’s in for. Spacey delivers the best performance of the film, yelling, scream-
ing, and throwing hissy fits practically every time he’s on screen. He verbally
and mentally abuses Guy, until he pushes him over the edge. I won’t ruin the
big twist of the film because part of the delight of the film is seeing how the
tables turn between the lead characters. Suffice it to say, it involves a precari-
ous and rather mean-spirited hostage situation. Watch the film and think
about how you would handle a character like Buddy. Did Guy take the right
approach? You decide.
The star or the boss
Everybody is awestruck by someone.
The problem may even be worse in the United States, where we make so
much of our heroes. Negotiating with anybody in whose presence you feel
helplessly speechless is difficult at best. You cannot negotiate effectively if
you can’t even get the cotton out of your mouth to speak.
How do you handle these situations when you have business to transact?
Perhaps you have to negotiate with a celebrity. Even having to speak to your
boss’s boss’s boss can give you that same sort of feeling. What can you do?
Prepare yourself. Make sure that you know well what you want, why you want
it, and what the justification is for your request. Also, find out about the human
being under the image. Inside every famous, powerful, or wealthy person is a
person. Find out about the individual. Is he or she married or single? Are there
children? What hobbies interest the person? The best way to diffuse the situa-
tion is to go back to Chapter 3 and work on gathering information.
If you negotiate with someone who has you quaking in your boots because of
star power, do what Toto did at the end of The Wizard of Oz. Poor Dorothy
has quite a job getting an interview with the Wizard. The importance of the
meeting is of gigantic proportions in her mind. Emerald City has all the trap-
pings of power, money, and influence. She follows the Wizard’s instructions
206
Part III: Getting Past the Glitches to Close It Up 

exactly and returns to collect her trip back to Kansas. She doesn’t have any
luck with this distant, powerful presence until her little dog, Toto, pulls back
the curtain to reveal the real person. That’s when Dorothy begins to make
progress. 
So find the real person. If you talk to the real human being rather than the
image on the pedestal, you make good progress. Otherwise, things are pretty
hopeless.
The biased buyer
Some negotiators occasionally suspect that they are about to lose a deal
simply because they belong to a particular group. Not fair. Not right. Yet it
happens. And dealing with a biased buyer is particularly difficult because
this subtle discrimination is never verbalized.
If you have substantive evidence that bias exists against you, facing it head
on is best, in a matter-of-fact manner, calmly and with dignity. A well-
rehearsed phrase, delivered without accusation or emotion, is very helpful.
“Are you open to granting this contract to a woman?”, “ . . . to an African-
American man?”, “ . . . to a Chinese paraplegic?”
You almost always receive a torrent of assurances. This is the 21st century.
Basing decisions on anything but merit is not politically correct. Today, being
politically correct is very important, especially in the business community.
207
Chapter 13: Dealing with Difficult People and Situations
Going ape over the Ape Lady
My own example of speechlessness in the
presence of a hero was the evening I met Jane
Goodall, who devoted her life to the study of the
silver-back gorillas in Rwanda in West Africa. I
was at the Governors’ Ball after the Academy
Awards ceremony. Ms. Goodall attended
because a documentary about her work had
been nominated for an Oscar. Obviously, the
place was packed with the biggest names in
Hollywood.
There, bathed in the look of soft talcum by a
shaft of light, was Jane Goodall. I grew up read-
ing National Geographic magazine and fanta-
sizing about doing such important work. There
she was. I introduced myself. All I could do was
blurt out my admiration and then my knees
turned to butter. 
Fortunately, there was no need to negotiate
anything. But if negotiation was necessary, I’m
sure I could find the gentle, modest human
inside my idol, who would admire some of my
own skills and abilities. If you are worried about
your own ability to negotiate with a “star,” keep
this in mind: Being struck speechless can
happen to anyone who has no connection with
a person other than absolute awe. If you need
to negotiate with a star, just take care to be well
prepared and have your own purpose firmly in
mind.

Accepting that assurance is in your best interest, whether the sentiments are
true or not. The mere fact that the assurance was offered benefits your posi-
tion, even if it doesn’t change societal behavior in general. But after you
acknowledge and accept the assurance, don’t drop the matter too quickly.
Ask this important follow-up question: “Exactly what is your criteria for
making a decision about the terms of this deal?”
If the answer is price, press on. “What price must be beaten?”
If you are told the price level, ask whether your price will be shopped.
Shopping means that one of the good old boys retains the contract by match-
ing or minimally beating your price. This is important data to obtain in any
event. The information is absolutely essential if you suspect bias. The earlier
you obtain the detailed, specific data upon which the decision will be made
and the more thorough you are, the less room the other side has to manufac-
ture objective data later. Keep good notes.
You must be vigilant not to jump too quickly to the conclusion that bias is the
basis for a particular result. In the workplace, discouraged workers often
complain about the boss and sometimes jump to the conclusion that they are
being picked on because of race, gender, or religion. Actually, a large number
of supervisors in the work-a-day world are equal-opportunity oppressors.
They savage any underling who happens along, regardless of race, religion,
nationality, gender, or sexual orientation.
208
Part III: Getting Past the Glitches to Close It Up 
Could I be the problem?
It is hard to admit and hard to face, but consider
the possibility that the difficult personality in the
room may be your own. What a revelation. No
one likes to think this, but if you hear people yell
often, you may have a negotiating style that is
particularly frustrating. If your negotiations
seem unnecessarily contentious, consider what
you can do to change that pattern.
One difficulty is position negotiating. If you get
stuck on one position, you are not well pre-
pared. You don’t have adequate information to
understand where other safe areas for agree-
ment may exist. You have not identified your
own goals and limits sufficiently enough to define
your range of movement. If you have done your
homework, you can have the flexibility to reach
agreements. In your next negotiation, grab your
pause button (see Chapter 12) and listen twice
as much as you usually listen. These two simple 
changes give you an opportunity to observe
yourself. If you really want to become a first-
class negotiator, you have to take a hard look at
yourself.
Let me be more blunt. If two different people got
upset with you in two of your last three negoti-
ations, chances are very good that the fault lies
with you. No matter how strong a case you can
make that the situation wasn’t your fault, it prob-
ably was. Your version of the facts isn’t relevant.
The only important fact is that people frequently
get upset with you. Try to figure out what ele-
ment of your style of presentation makes deal-
ing with you frustrating, upsetting, or annoying.
Ask someone who loves you point blank. Don’t
defend yourself. Sit quietly and listen to the
whole awful truth. Then try to fix whatever is
wrong.

Chapter 14
Closing the Deal and 
Feeling Good About It
In This Chapter
 Exposing the facts and myths about win-win negotiating
 Recognizing what constitutes a win
 Finding creative solutions
 Bringing closure to a deal
T
his chapter is about the glory moment when it all comes together —
when you close the deal. It’s also about closing the deal in a way that
makes both sides feel good about the outcome. Both sides should feel as
though they achieved something that is workable and that everyone involved
in carrying out the deal will want to make work.
Closing a deal is seldom a single moment with crashing cymbals and loud drum
rolls. Typically, closing a deal is a process of reaching agreement on one point
after another, adjusting back and forth. Let’s face it, the first piece of closing a
deal is when two people — who may be far apart in their thinking — sit down
and say, “What the heck, we are far apart, but let’s at least try to make a deal.”
The next point of agreement might be that those 10,000 widgets have to be
delivered within four months. (Ah, you’re right; there are two points of agree-
ment there.) As the discussion progresses the number of widgets may change
or the delivery date may change, but slowly a complete agreement is reached.
So the work is more like Michelangelo sculpting a statue of David than David
Copperfield pulling a rabbit out of a hat. Yes, sculpting or crafting an agree-
ment is the right image, not magic. There is no magic to reaching sound
agreements, just hard work, a lot of imagination, and a willingness to let the
agreement reach the size and shape that it needs to be instead of trying to
force it into some pre-existing notion of what should be.

Most people think of closing the deal as the only satisfactory resolution of a
negotiation. However, it’s critical to figure out whether the deal should close
and, if so, how to close it to ensure smooth performance throughout the life
of the agreement. This chapter covers the skills and techniques of actually
closing the deal so that it will last. The next chapter will deal with how to get
past the tough spots and — if necessary — how to walk out if there is no deal
to be made.
Closing is a skill that you must develop separately — and keep in mind every
step of the way — if you are to become a successful negotiator. We all know
people who don’t seem to care whether they ever close the deals they are
working on. They are delightful at dinner parties. They can be frustrating at
the negotiating table. Don’t be one of those people. Use your closing skills
from the first moment of the negotiation.
Good Deals, Bad Deals, and 
Win-Win Negotiating
Finding a win-win solution, a deal in which both sides are satisfied, is difficult
if you don’t even know when your own team is winning. You can’t believe
how many people can’t tell the difference between a good deal and a bad
deal. That situation should never be the case if you use this book. Usually, I
hear the lament about a deal long past. When I hear an someone complain
about a deal he or she made, I am immediately curious. I ask and explore. I
coax out the details. More often than not, the speaker either forgot why the
deal was made in the first place, or the other party breached the agreement.
 A good deal is one that is fair under all circumstances at the time the
agreement is made. It provides for various contingencies before prob-
lems arise. A good deal is workable in the real world.
What is and isn’t fair is very subjective. The parties must decide for
themselves whether an agreement is fair based on their own criteria.
Make sure that everyone is in agreement. Draw the other side out on this
basic point before closing the deal. You don’t want to sign a deal with
someone who is harboring resentments over some aspect of the agree-
ment. Be sure that the other side agrees that the deal is a good one.
 A bad deal is not fair under all the circumstances. It allows foreseeable
events to create problems in the relationship after the deal is struck.
Some aspect of the agreement looks great on paper but simply doesn’t
work out in the real world — for reasons that were predictable during
the deal-making process.
210
Part III: Getting Past the Glitches to Close It Up 

Each party should assess whether the deal is good or bad. You determine
whether a deal is good or bad for you; the other party determines whether
that same deal is good or bad for him or her.
Assessing the deal
To be sure that you have a good deal and a win-win situation, take a break
just before closing (push the pause button — see Chapter 12). Ask yourself
the following questions:
 Do you know whom you are dealing with and why he or she wants to
make this deal with you?
 Based on all the information, can the other side perform the agreement
to your expectations?
 Does this agreement further your personal long-range goals? Does the
outcome of the negotiation fit into your own vision statement?
 Does this agreement fall comfortably within the goals and the limits you
set for this particular negotiation?
 Are the people on both sides who have to carry out the agreement fully
informed and ready to do whatever it takes to make the deal work?
In the ideal situation, the answer to all of these questions is a resounding yes.
If you are unsure about any one of them, take some extra time and push your
pause button. Review the entire situation. Assess how the agreement could
be changed to create a yes answer to each question. Try your best to make
the change needed to get a firm yes to each question.
When you have a yes response to each of the preceding questions, close the
deal. Don’t go for any more changes even if you think that the other person
wouldn’t mind — you never know! As Solomon wrote many years ago: “There
is a time to reap and a time to sow.” When it’s time to close a deal, close it.
Justify your decision to yourself
If you can’t alter the deal so that you can answer yes to each question above,
be very thoughtful before closing. If you decide to go forward, write down
exactly why you are closing the deal anyway. For example, you may have a
project or piece of property that no one wants except the person you are
talking to right now. Your choice is to wait a long time because your
prospects have declined or accept this deal with its less-favorable terms.
Your choice. Just write down why you are making the choice so you don’t
become part of that army of people with tales of exploitation. This exercise is
particularly helpful to your state of mind if the results don’t work out — you
have a record as to why you took the deal. You won’t be so hard on yourself.
211
Chapter 14: Closing the Deal and Feeling Good About It

Get more information
If you have a question about the answer to any of the first three questions,
get more information either from the other side or from another source. Ask
people who may know about the other person. You would be amazed at how
much people like to talk when you ask for an opinion and wait. Ask open-
ended questions that seek a true opinion, not a leading question that may
invite approval without yielding the information that you need. For instance,
don’t say, “Isn’t it great that I am about to close a deal with Joe?” Rather, ask,
“Do you think Joe can deliver 10,000 widgets in 60 days?”
Checking out references is one of the most overlooked resources. Many
people look at a list of references and assume that the referral will be positive
or the source wouldn’t be on the list. So they don’t check the references. You
can learn a great deal from checking out references, even from the most obvi-
ously biased sources. Relatives who serve as references are going to say
good things, of course. But they can also provide valuable, factual informa-
tion. For example, a relative may volunteer the names of other people with
whom the other side has worked, reveal the other party’s experience in the
field, or offer information on the other side’s financial strength.
What is most amazing to me is that if you really listen and draw the reference
into a conversation, you will often get an earful when you say, “This has been
great. I look forward to working with _________. Do you have suggestions for
things I should look out for in order to make this relationship work well?”
So check out the other side’s references, but do so in a conversational manner
and try to draw out facts, not salve for your ego. This often is your last oppor-
tunity to avoid a bad deal that you may have to live with for a long time.
The people you are dealing with are more important than the paperwork 
you draft. Know your counterpart very well before you enter into a long-term
relationship. No lawyer can protect you from a crook. Lawyers can just put
you in a position to win your lawsuit. No matter how strong your case is, you
don’t want to be in a lawsuit. People do bad things all the time, and when
they do those bad things to you, bringing a lawsuit won’t make you happy to
have been in business with that person. Do everything you can to stay out of
business with the bad guys.
Don’t backtrack
Don’t risk the deal by bringing up a new point, no matter how inconsequen-
tial the idea may seem. Going back for one more little item that’s not all that
important may annoy the other side and threaten the entire deal. No one
wants to do business with someone who wastes time trying to grab some
small, additional advantage instead of closing up the deal and moving on
when it’s time to do so. You may not be after a big point, but that point can
sour the relationship if not the deal itself. (See Chapter 15 for more about this
nickel-and-diming technique.)
212
Part III: Getting Past the Glitches to Close It Up 

Creating win-win deals
Some negotiations are pretty straightforward, and the interests of each party
are clear. For instance, when you are buying a car from someone who wants
to sell a car, the negotiation is win-win if you find a price that works for each
of you, assuming the wheels don’t fall off the day after your check clears. 
In more complicated negotiations, the motivations are not always so easy 
to find, at least not the more subtle factors that are driving the negotiation.
Sometimes some head scratching and imagination is required to fully under-
stand the interests of the other side.
Win-win is when a deal fills your needs and goals while at the same time 
filling the needs and goals of the other side. But your counterparts must
determine their needs and be sure they are satisfied. You can’t play mind
reader and divine their needs and then start giving up what you want to 
make them happy.
213
Chapter 14: Closing the Deal and Feeling Good About It
A good deal and a bad deal in Collateral
Watch the film Collateral. The film is a unique
thriller that contains both a good and a bad deal
within the first half hour of the film. It opens with
Tom Cruise exchanging briefcases with a
stranger in an airport. Then, intriguingly, it
seems to turn into another movie. We meet Max
(Jamie Foxx), a cabbie who picks up a customer
named Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith). She rattles
off the streets he should take to get her to
downtown Los Angeles. He says he knows a
faster route. They make a deal: The ride will be
free if he doesn’t get them downtown faster.
She agrees. The lengthy scene is like a self-
contained negotiation. For Max, the deal is an
easy sell. He wins by getting his customer
downtown faster.
After dropping Annie off, Max picks up his
second customer of the night, Vincent, played
by Cruise. Vincent needs a driver to spend all
night with him, driving to five destinations.
Vincent offers Max six crisp $100 bills as per-
suasion, and Max agrees to the deal. Max and
the audience think this is a good deal. Pause the
film and decide for yourself.
The deal turns out to be a bad one. Max didn’t
ask the key questions. If he had, he may have
learned that Vincent is a contract killer. Instead,
Max figures this out when a dead body lands on
his cab and he discovers Vincent’s true motive.
Without having clearly reviewed the offer,
Max’s deal gets increasingly worse at each of
the five stops. Max can’t turn back at this point,
so he must go through with the deal or die. Quite
a decision for someone to make, but Max’s mis-
take is an important lesson in assessing the deal
at hand before closing.

Because creative thought is often necessary to arrive at win-win solutions, I
have found that the best negotiators in a tight spot are also people who enjoy
games or riddles — people who enjoy figuring things out. This is not to say
that the only good negotiators are those with a Sudoku puzzle lying around
the house. But it does help if you enjoy the challenge of figuring out what
serves both sides — and the solutions are not always easy.
A sample problem
In my seminars, I like to follow up the discussion about thinking creatively
with a negotiating problem. This problem is adapted from a story from the
Middle East that dates back to the seventh century. Since the first edition of
this book, several readers have sent in variations to the story, and one indig-
nant professor corrected my version of the source. I suspect that no one
knows for sure after all the centuries have passed.
A wise Arab left 19 camels to his three sons. To the oldest, he left half of
his camels. To the middle son, he left a third. To the youngest, he left a
sixth. Unfortunately, 19 does not divide by any of the fractions that dear
old dad mentioned in his will.
The three sons quarreled long into the night. (Quarreling is unartful negoti-
ating.) One wanted to own the camels communally. One wanted to sell the
camels and split the profit. One just wanted to go to sleep. Finally, they
consulted with the wise woman of the village. What did she tell them?
Before reading any further, pick up a pencil and try to come up with a solu-
tion. Play the role of the wise woman of the village. Go ahead and take a
moment to do that now.
If you don’t reach a conclusion, here is a hint: This wise woman is smart
enough to know that she ought to charge these three lads for solving their
problem. Maybe she had attended some ancient law school.
The solution
The wise woman told the three young men to give her one camel as a fee, and
the payment would solve the problem. Then she wished the sons well. Each
of the sons thought long and hard, and then agreed to give up the camel. This
decision left them with 18 camels. The oldest son took his half of the camels
(9), the middle son took his third (6), and the youngest took his sixth (3). The
wise old woman, to whom they gave the 19th camel, also received their
enduring gratitude. Everybody won in terms of camel ownership. But the
negotiation was a real win-win because the three brothers lived happily ever
after, and the wise old woman had new stature in the village.

Part III: Getting Past the Glitches to Close It Up 

This is a great story, but it comes with a caution: The wise woman’s solution
only worked because the brothers wanted to close the deal in a way that was
fair among them, even if the deal meant making a substantial donation to the
local shaman. If any one of them was seeking an exact, legal interpretation of
the father’s will, this solution was nothing more than a mathematical trick.
Here the participants were not fooled. Each son truly believed that he
received his fair share.
Here, the solution was objectively sound. The answer provided fairness
among the brothers, which is what they sought. But an exact division of 
the 19 camels, according to the father’s formula, would have carved up the
single camel, which went to the wise woman of the village. This deal worked
because all three brothers wanted to accept the expedient solution of giving
away one camel.

Chapter 14: Closing the Deal and Feeling Good About It
Myths surrounding win-win negotiating
Often, participants in my seminars are familiar
with the phrase win-win negotiating. Many
attendees have used this buzzword to justify
caring too much and too early about a counter-
part’s feelings and sacrificing their own needs
and goals on the altar of conciliation.
No book or informed advocate promotes giving up
or subordinating your goals in the name of taking
care of the other person. Always assume that
there are two equal adults in the negotiation —
unless of course, you are negotiating with a child.
Then you really want to hang on to your objec-
tives. Let the child set the agenda, and you lose
before you ever begin.
If you are one of those people who think win-win
means skipping over any of the steps in this book,
now is the time to adjust your thinking. Use all
your negotiating skills for every deal you negoti-
ate. Pursue your dreams with passion and with
respect for others. There are no shortcuts.
I was so concerned about some of my rough
talk when it comes to win-win negotiating that I
called Fred E. Jandt, the author of the best-sell-
ing book, Win-Win Negotiating: Turning Conflict
into Agreement. He told me that his great dis-
appointment was the number of people who
had read the title and not the book. He too had
a lot of people in seminars who thought that
win-win negotiating meant that you were to
make concessions early and often in order to be
sure that the other person was happy. He was
glad to hear that I was on a mission to
straighten folks out. His closing comment was,
“I need all the help I can get on this one. It is
truly troubling that so many people have twisted
the title of my book into an excuse for their bad
deal making.”

Note also that the brothers could have fought another night or more over
which camels they each received. Or they could have argued about the crazy
formula their father used or some other real or imagined affront. But instead,
the brothers pushed the pause button and agreed to defer to the wise
woman. She used a little sleight of hand, but she solved the problem and
received legitimate compensation for her very valuable services. Each of the
sons got what he wanted: a good feeling about the father’s will . . . and some
camels. The deceased father had taught his sons one last valuable lesson.
Sometimes, even substantial real-life situations are settled with such simple
win-win solutions.
Concessions vs. Conditions
In a negotiation, you will make concessions and conditions, so you need to
understand the difference between the two. A concession is when you give 
up a point. Don’t forget to get something back for it. A condition is what you
require to grant the concession. For instance, you might say, “I would be will-
ing to knock 20 percent off the price as you asked, if you can guarantee an
order of this size each month for the next three months.” Twenty percent is a
pretty nice concession in most people’s mind. Don’t give up that big discount
without getting something worthwhile in return. Make sure that the other
side earns whatever concession you grant.
In this example, the condition is a guarantee of additional sales. If the other
side purchases only the original amount and refuses to give you that conces-
sion, it must pay full price. You should always keep this concession/condition
balance in mind during a negotiation. You can put a condition on any conces-
sion that you are willing to give during a negotiation. In fact, you should
receive some specific benefit for each concession.
You can view each request for a concession as a mini-negotiation within the
larger negotiation. You give in order to get. But before you give, always con-
sider what you can ask for in return. View every request to give something 
to the other side as an opportunity to gain something for your own side. Be
stingy with your concessions; they are the coins of the various transactions
that take place during a negotiation.
Don’t make any concessions until you have a sense of everything that the
other side will demand. You have just so much that you can give up, and of
course, there are certain things you want. You don’t want to reach the end of
the negotiation having given up everything you could give up without receiv-
ing everything that you wanted to receive.
216
Part III: Getting Past the Glitches to Close It Up 

As you negotiate concessions and conditions, try using phrases such as
“Assuming we reach agreement on everything else, . . .” or “As long as the
overall deal works, . . .” This statement helps your and your counterpart
make sure everyone gets what they want.

Chapter 14: Closing the Deal and Feeling Good About It
Win-win on the airwaves
In my own practice, I negotiated the contract for
John Kobylt and Ken Chiampou, who host the
number-one talk show, The John and Ken Show,
in Los Angeles during the important afternoon
rush hour drive time. They were brought to Los
Angeles from New Jersey at a mere 10 percent
over the minimum union scale. They were glad
to take the job because of the opportunity to
work in a much larger market. After two years,
they thought that they had proven themselves,
and they wanted a very substantial increase in
salary. The station manager agreed that they
were well received by the listeners, but pointed
out that their ratings had been up and down.
The station executive thought that the team had
pretty much reached a plateau in ratings. He
was happy with that outcome but could do no
more than double the hosts’ salaries. I was
seeking much, much more.
We finally settled on a base salary with
bonuses. A modest improvement in the ratings
would slightly increase the bonuses. At the high
ratings levels that the station didn’t think were
achievable, the station manager agreed to very
high bonuses. When the ratings spiked upwards
and John and Ken beat all the competition, the
station was ecstatic and did not begrudge
paying the talented John and Ken much more
money than they had originally requested.
Why was the station manager happy to pay
more than he would have paid if he had just
agreed to my initial demand? Our arrangement
protected the station from taking a high risk,
which would have been very burdensome if the
team had not performed as I predicted. John
and Ken were happy because they earned their
compensation. This was a true win-win result.
When we started the negotiation, we were so
far apart on salary points that it seemed we
would never get together. Even as the bonus
concept was put on the table as an approach,
we remained far apart. The negotiation was a
real struggle. The answer came when we made
the bonus structure start with small increases
at the beginning. An additional 100,000 listeners
didn’t add much to the salaries. But as the size
of the audience grew, 100,000 additional listen-
ers were very valuable to my clients.
This solution gave great comfort to the station
manager, who didn’t really mind paying heavily
for spectacular results. The agreement gave my
clients hope and incentive. Today, everybody is
as happy with the results as we were on the day
we signed the agreement.
Both sides were sensitive to the needs and
desires of the other. We spent a great deal of
time educating each other about our needs and
hopes. What we didn’t do is spend time worry-
ing about the people on the opposite side of the
table. That is how we got to our win-win result.

What It Means to Close a Deal
A deal closes when the parties agree on enough terms that they can move
forward with the performance of the deal. For example, if you agree to pay
someone $500 to paint your house a certain shade of green on Saturday using
a certain brand of paint, that may well close the deal for the two of you. If you
have some trust or history between the two of you, the other details could
remain unexpressed. Without history or trust, you would need to specify the
quality of the paint and the amount of scraping and sanding that would take
place. For yet other people, the deal would not be closed until everything
was committed to writing.
This section of the chapter is designed to get you and your opponent to the
point where you both feel the deal is closed and that you are both ready to
perform under the agreement. It is designed to help you recognize when it is
time to stop negotiating the deal and to start living the deal.

Part III: Getting Past the Glitches to Close It Up 
Bend a little, get a lot
I had a client who was about to produce a fea-
ture film. We wanted to close fast, but be fair. I
offered a relatively short, three-page definition
of net profits to a young lawyer for his writer
client. I made it relatively simple and straight-
forward because I did not want an extensive
negotiation. This definition was vastly better (in
addition to being shorter) than the average
studio definition of how profits are determined
after a film is released. The document contained
a minimum amount of accounting detail.
“My client insists on a piece of the gross,” the
young lawyer kept stating loudly and to the exclu-
sion of any comment on details of the definition.
“Okay,” I said. “I can’t give him actual gross
profits, but maybe we can provide adjusted
gross profits. Would that be acceptable?”
“Yes,” was the eager answer.
I changed the title of the three-page document
from “Net Profit Definition” to “Adjusted Gross
Profit Definition.” I also changed the word “net”
to the words “adjusted gross” throughout the
document and sent the revision over to the
young lawyer. I braced for a tirade. The docu-
ment was signed without comment.
Not one penny more went into the writer’s
pocket, but he could say around town that he
had received a piece of the adjusted gross prof-
its. He could avoid all those bad jokes about net
profits. They are called monkey points, because
net profits notoriously translate into no money
for the writer. He felt good.
We had made a match. The young attorney had
stated what he needed, and he got it — even
though the victory was symbolic. And the out-
come didn’t cost my client a dime.

Remembering to push the pause button before closing is critical during a
negotiation. Take a breather, look over the entire agreement. Make sure it
works for you and the other side in the real world. Don’t agree to a house-
painting contract on Saturday when it has been raining for two weeks, and 
no let-up is in sight. In fact, when you use the six essential skills listed on the
card in front of this book, somebody at the negotiating table almost certainly
figures out how to close up the deal if it’s truly ready to be closed. If every-
one at the table is using these basics, you are likely to close the deal much
more quickly.
Understanding the Letter of the Law
A short course on contract law is well beyond the scope of this book, but you
should understand a few key points if you ever negotiate a deal in the busi-
ness world. These two pages won’t make you a lawyer or eliminate the need
for a lawyer, but they will make you savvier about the negotiating you do.
Legal definition of a closed deal
Unless you have a specific arrangement to the contrary, no deal is closed
until the parties reach an agreement on all the points under negotiation. That
is the way U.S. law works. As they say, “It ain’t over till the fat lady sings.”
Nevertheless, students of negotiation are often upset when only one point
remains in contention in a deal, and then the other party begins backing off
on some of the points where agreement was reached. But as long as some
point is under discussion, the deal remains open and subject to adjustment
by either party. Even if an agreement seems to be in place regarding various
pieces of the deal, the deal isn’t final until both parties reach an agreement
on all points. Backing off on previously agreed-to points doesn’t happen
often, but it does happen, even to experienced negotiators.
My favorite example of this was when Kim Basinger agreed to star in Boxing
Helena. The deal was being extensively negotiated, but the producers had 
her word that she would perform in the film, so they started raising money by
selling the right to distribute the film in various territories around the world.
But Basinger changed agents in the middle of the deal. Her new agent hated
the script. He threw it across the room, calling it garbage. She backed out. The
producers sued. Initially, they won. Basinger appealed. Then the producers
lost. The court said that the deal still contained open points that were impor-
tant to Basinger, so either party could back out. In fact, some of the cover let-
ters from the producers’ lawyers to Basinger’s lawyers said explicitly that the
deal wouldn’t be final until Basinger agreed to the producers’ changes.
219
Chapter 14: Closing the Deal and Feeling Good About It

To have an enforceable contract, you need agreement on four elements:
 What you are getting
 What you are paying for what you are getting
 How long the contract will last
 Who the parties are in the contract
Everything else, you can work out along the way. If you are missing any one
of those four items, you cannot have an enforceable contract.
Offers and counteroffers
A wide misconception is that you can always accept an offer. When a party
makes an offer and you make a counteroffer, the law looks at the transaction
in a very particular way. The law breaks that simple process into two steps,
one of which is implied. Legally, you rejected the initial offer and put a new
offer on the table. If you receive a written offer, you can write “accepted”
across the document and the deal is done, but be careful when you coun-
teroffer. You are rejecting the offer from the other party. The other party may
let you accept a previous offer, but is not bound to do so. You do not have a
legal right to demand that the old offer from the other side stay on the table
after you have rejected it and put another offer on the table.
Written versus oral contracts
Samuel Goldwyn once boomed: “An oral agreement isn’t worth the paper it is
written on.” Actually, oral agreements are generally enforceable. The law
requires a few contracts to be in writing: Some examples are contracts that
sell land, employment contracts for one year or longer, and contracts that
convey an interest in a copyright. Generally, contracts do not have to be in
writing. The problem is with proving the contents of an oral agreement. If you
get into a dispute, be assured that you and the other side will remember the
agreement differently.
The dispute often boils down to very different renditions of what you said
and what the other party said. The situation can be pretty hopeless unless
you have something other than your own memory that hints at the terms of
the contract. For instance, if you have three checks with “installment 1 of 10,”
“2 of 10,” “3 of 10” and so on written on the explanation line, those notations
are very strong evidence of some kind of agreement that called for ten pay-
ments in the face amount of the check. The other details may be murky, but
that piece of the agreement would be crystal clear, which in turn would give
support to the other things that you are claiming to be true.
220
Part III: Getting Past the Glitches to Close It Up 

Legal protection before the contract
So what happens if one or both parties begin to carry out the terms of the
deal before a fully enforceable contract is signed? That’s okay. On the basis 
of a technicality, the courts won’t abandon someone who acted in good faith.
Worst case: The party who performed — that is, the party who painted the
house or delivered the goods — will receive the fair market value for the ser-
vice or product provided. This concept is called quantum meruit. (There — 
I did it. I got a Latin phrase in the book. My fabulous editor will probably 
take it out, but I figured out a way to get it in the book. What good is my law
degree if I can’t speak a little Latin?) Literally, that ancient phrase means
“what the thing is worth.” That’s fair. (See Chapter 15 for more on going 
forward without a formal contract.)
Recognizing When to Close
The when of closing is easy: early and often. Some people don’t seem to want
or need to close the deal. They are like cows chewing their cud. They just go
on and on enjoying the process, burning up time, and never bringing discus-
sions to a close. And then again, like cows, they will put something away and
bring it back up later and chew on it some more. Disgusting. Fortunately, you
know that closing is a separate skill, and you keep it in mind at every phase
of the negotiating process.
221
Chapter 14: Closing the Deal and Feeling Good About It
Wheeling and dealing in the Old West
James Stewart and Janet Leigh star in the classic
film The Naked Spur, made in the days when cin-
emas were still advertising “Made in Technicolor.”
The movie was shot in the beautiful Colorado
Rockies.
This film is one great negotiation scene after
another. Then the plot slides neatly into a life-
and-death negotiation between the lawmen, led
by Stewart as an upstanding marshal, and the
man they hope to bring to justice.
The negotiation that forms the film’s climax
slowly emerges as the lawmen take the outlaw
back to Kansas. Watch this guy. He is good. He
has his objective in mind and never misses an
opportunity to advance his cause. Everything he
does is designed to close the deal on his terms:
He wants his captors to let him go.
As the overall negotiation nears its end, notice
all the little deals between various characters
that contribute to the main negotiation. This film
doesn’t revolve around negotiation as most of
the examples in this book, but you’ll enjoy this
old-fashioned Western, and with your under-
standing of the negotiation process, you will
notice the many negotiations as they take place.

Keep the closing in mind as you prepare for your negotiation, as you listen to
the other side, and every time you speak. A little piece of your mind should
always focus on the closing — on bringing the negotiation to a mutually
acceptable solution. You aren’t likely to miss an opportunity to close when
you view closing as a separate aspect of the negotiation rather than just the
lucky result of a negotiation.
The proper moment to make your first effort at closing a deal is when you
first sit down.
Your mantra for closing: early and often. A recent study of salespeople
revealed that a very small percentage of sales close after the first effort. Most
sales close after at least three efforts to get the order. Try to close any negoti-
ation as early as possible and keep trying until you prevail.
If you have trouble closing deals, intentionally try to close your next negotia-
tion earlier than you think is possible. You find that no harm is done and that
the other side actually becomes sensitized to the need to conclude matters.
Make a game of it. Chart your efforts to close. Your rate of successful closings
rises as you become more and more aware of closing as a separate skill to
bring out early and often.
Many people find it is easier to close a deal if they set a deadline to do so.
Negotiations tend to fall into place at the last minute. Having a deadline is 
like having a referee at the bargaining table. Remember, every deal has time
constraints, so establishing a deadline can help the negotiation come to a
smooth end.
The phony deadline is a classic negotiating tool used to hurry one side into 
a quick close. If you suspect a phony deadline, don’t sit back and accept it.
Instead, test it. Get an explanation.
Knowing How to Close
The purpose of this section is to take the mystique out of closing and to pro-
vide some mechanics to make your efforts to close more fluid. It’s a beautiful
thing to see someone seamlessly switch from a substantive discussion into
closing mode and then back.
222
Part III: Getting Past the Glitches to Close It Up 

With a friend or family member, rehearse the various approaches for closing.
The more naturally they roll off your tongue, the easier the attempt will be
for you in a real situation. Role play. Describe a typical negotiation situation
to a friend and then have your friend challenge you with the objections in
this section.
The good closer
Most used car lots have one person who is paid to close deals. You may have
encountered a salesperson who, rather than close the deal, introduces you to
“the manager.” People in the auto industry call this person the closer.
People who are constantly resolving conflict and solving problems in their
personal lives are thought of as agreeable and cooperative. At the negotiating
table, they are considered brilliant. When a negotiator finds a solution to
what appears to be a difficult negotiation, the feat brings the problem solver
praise all around — including from the folks on the other side of the table.
More than once, people who I negotiated with have called me and asked me
to represent them in some unrelated negotiation.
People who are skilled at wrapping up a negotiation share these characteristics:
 Strong closers always seem to find a solution. The approach may not
be the original one, but it gets the desired result. Weak closers tend to
get stuck on a position.
 Strong closers generally accomplish tasks on time. Weak closers often
procrastinate in many aspects of their lives.
 Strong closers rejoice when a deal closes. Weak closers feel either a
sense of loss when the project comes to an end or waves of self-doubt.
Either way, closing does not bring unbridled joy to the weak closer in
the same way it does for the strong closer.
Good closers are often witty or clever, but they don’t have to be. They just
need to have the confidence to follow through with the goals and limits they
set when they started planning the negotiation. They consider themselves to
be effective people. Creating consensus where none exists is a fun activity for
the good closer and a struggle for the weak closer. Each one of these qualities
is a result of the learned skills set out throughout this book. People are all
born negotiating successfully: for food, for dry diapers, even for a good burp.
Over time, life beats up on some people. Take back your life. Methodically set
out to get what you want using the six skills in this book.

Chapter 14: Closing the Deal and Feeling Good About It

The only three closing strategies 
you’ll ever need
The entire country seems to be in a search of the perfect close — the one
that won’t fail. When I get to this point in my seminars, pencils are poised.
Fresh paper is found. The class is alert. Here’s the big secret: The three ways
to make the sale or to successfully close the negotiation are:
1. Ask
2. Ask
3. Ask
Students always write “Ask” on their papers as I share the first closing strat-
egy. When I announce the second strategy, some students get a little smile on
their face and quit writing. Very few write the third “Ask.” But they do get it.
A smile spreads across their faces as they realize that the wisdom of the ages
works better than some new high-tech secret.
No matter how powerful your computer is, what the range of your cell phone
is, or how clever your tracking system is, you still have just one way to get
the order or close the deal: Ask whether your counterpart will agree to the
current terms. If you have trouble asking for commitments, address that
issue. Being able to clearly state your need helps in every negotiation and in
every other phase of your life. (If you need to practice making yourself clear,
turn back to Chapter 11.)
Fortunately for the army of people who give seminars, the nation continues
to search for an easy answer to the issue of closing the deal. Maybe you are
one of those people who is on such a search. Maybe that’s why you bought
this book. Meanwhile, earn your success the old-fashioned way: Ask for it.
Heck, you should insist on it. Nothing short of persistent, organized inquiry 
is going to close any negotiation. It just won’t happen by itself.
Using linkage to close
Linkage is a great concept to help close a deal when no compromise is in
sight on the last point in contention. Linkage simply means that you hook a
requested concession to something you want so the deal can close.
Here is the kind of situation that cries out for a linkage strategy:
 The parties on the other side are making a final demand. They can’t go
any further. They can’t give any more than they already have.
 You don’t want to cave in on this point, because the deal won’t work for
you. If you concede, you will not have enough incentive to close the deal.
224
Part III: Getting Past the Glitches to Close It Up 

Here is what you do:
1. Take a pause.
Be sure that the other side is not just bluffing, that he really can’t go any
further on this point.
2. Look over the entire transaction. Find an area where you didn’t get
everything you wanted or find an item that can be changed in your
favor to bring balance back to the deal.
3. Link the two issues together.
Tell the other side that you will agree to his request if he will make the
adjustment you need in Step 2. The item you link to his request may
never have been discussed before or, more likely, it was discussed, and
you tentatively agreed to drop your desire. But linkage is always accept-
able. It makes you the creative problem solver.
The other side wants the deal to close just as much as you do. When 
you bring balance to your side without throwing his side out of balance,
everyone gets something they want. You are a genius. At least, that is
what people will say in the moment.
225
Chapter 14: Closing the Deal and Feeling Good About It
Closing according to Shelley “the Machine” Levene
See the film adaptation of David Mamet’s
Glengarry Glenn Ross. The film is about four real
estate agents working the same sales. The boss
stages a contest. The one who sells the most
units by the end of the month gets a Cadillac.
The second-place salesman gets a pair of steak
knives. Third and fourth place get fired. And
those who close the deal get good sales leads.
The film is a biting look at the failure of the
American dream.
Look at Shelley “the Machine” Levene, for exam-
ple. Played by Jack Lemmon, Shelley was once
a hotshot salesman, winning the office sweep-
stakes month after month. Now he is making no
sales at all, and his wife is in the hospital. It’s
heartbreaking to hear the lies in his sales pitch
about how he would feel wrong if the customer
weren’t able to share in the “marvelous opportu-
nity” he’s offering. In one of Lemmon’s best
scenes of all time, he makes a house call on a
man who does not want to buy real estate. The
man knows it, we know it, Lemmon knows it. But
Lemmon, as Shelley, keeps trying, not registering
the man’s growing impatience to have him out of
his house. Behind his façade, Shelley has no
enthusiasm for what he is doing. The potential
customer sees right through Shelley’s hard sell.
This scene shows the fine line between decep-
tion and breakdown. If you don’t let your true
colors show when closing the deal, the results
can be disastrous.

Here are some examples of linkage in response to specific objections:
OBJECTION: “We can’t pay this person more than $100,000 next year.”
LINKAGE: “If you could go to $110,000, maybe my client will agree to a
two-year contract.”
OBJECTION: “There’s no way we are going to quit using Joe as our sup-
plier for lead pipe.”
LINKAGE: “Maybe we could sell you half-lots of lead pipe so you can con-
tinue to buy from Joe while trying out our company.”
OBJECTION: “Your daily fee is too high for just a one-hour speech, even if
the conference site is out of town.”
LINKAGE: “Maybe I can also give a seminar in the afternoon, so you feel
like you are getting your money’s worth.”
Linkage is a powerful tool that you can use to help close a deadlocked 
negotiation. Here are some phrases that are often used to introduce the 
linkage concept:
“Well, maybe we could look at some of the issues again.”
“Well, we may be able to work something out here.”
“Tell ya what I’m gonna do.”
Linkage is one of those tools that makes you feel like a real top-notch negotia-
tor, because it helps you solve a real problem. Neither side can give on the
point under discussion, so you find something to trade. Use linkage to find
your way out of a tough spot, the next time you find yourself in one.
Barriers to Closing
If you find it difficult to close, the real question is probably not “How do I do
this?” but rather “Why do I hesitate instead of going for it?” Merely stating the
question helps you to start thinking about the answer.
Overcoming fears
Each person who has a barrier to closing a negotiation or a sale probably has
some fears or apprehensions about the process. The most common fears are:
226
Part III: Getting Past the Glitches to Close It Up 

 Fear of failure: Most people have this fear to one extent or another.
After all, no one likes to fail. It’s not fun. In extreme cases, this fear 
will keep you from asking for what you want in the negotiation. After 
all, if you don’t ever make your request, you can never fail to get it. 
The deal you are seeking will be a piece of ever-dangling fruit waiting 
to be plucked.
 Fear of rejection: Everybody wants to be loved. Nobody really likes
being cast aside. So the fear of rejection can block a person from asking
for agreement. No ask, no rejection. It is as simple as that.
 Fear of criticism: Some people live or work in a situation in which 
they are likely to be criticized when they get back to what should be
their support group. One way to prevent those negative words and 
looks is to never close the deal. Who can criticize a deal while it’s still
being negotiated?
 Fear of making a mistake: Some people believe that make making a 
mistake is a sin instead of a normal part of life. The mere possibility of
doing something that could be deemed a goof dredges up all sorts of
uncertainties and self-doubts. So instead of finalizing the deal, these
people shy away from closing the negotiation in a timely fashion.
 Fear of commitment: Now here’s a biggie. Closing a deal is a powerful
commitment to deliver on a deal. Sometimes closing a deal triggers a
short-term commitment like buying a particular car, but the conse-
quences are sure to last for a year or two or five. Sometimes closing a
deal results in a commitment that requires participation on both sides
for longer than most American marriages last, so it’s no surprise that
many people get hung up on this idea.
 Fear of loss: Some negotiations last a long time and can be pretty
intense. Closing the negotiation means losing that intense relationship.
The real key to success for you may not be an elusive strategy. It may be your
own personal, mental blocks to closing a deal. Many people have them. Do
your best to deal with your own demons on your own schedule in your own
way. But deal with them. Your negotiation skills will improve when you face
your fears and refuse to let them get in the way of closing a deal.
This is, of course, much easier said than done. You didn’t go out and buy
these fears at a department store, so they can’t be discarded like an old 
piece of clothing that is boring you. But after you identify these fears and
start working on saying “good riddance,” you’re on your way. You may need
to talk to a mentor, a therapist, or a trusted family member.
227
Chapter 14: Closing the Deal and Feeling Good About It

The actual disposal of such old baggage is beyond the topic of this book, but
you can minimize the impact of such fears, even if you don’t purge them com-
pletely from your system. One of the following tips may work for you:
 Keep in mind the consequences of not going for the close. When you
don’t try to close, you end up in the same position as if you had been
rejected. You put yourself exactly where you don’t want to be.
 Think about the criticism you’ll receive from those who are looking to
you to close this deal.
 Put words to your fear. You can actually tell the other side the problem,
such as, “Here’s the hard part for me. I need to close this deal or call it
quits.”
 Put a deadline on the negotiation up front and talk about it with the
other side. That way, even the person on the other side of the table will
be helping you over this hump.
Be sure to keep in mind that the other party may have some mental blocks 
to closing also. These blocks are the same fears that you may face, and the
other side is unlikely to acknowledge how they affect the negotiation. If you
sense that the person you are negotiating with has a fear that is blocking a
close, don’t play shrink — unless you are one. Instead, use one of the tech-
niques I mentioned above to help him or her over the fear. You can set a time
frame for the negotiation, mention the folks who want the other side to close
the deal, or mention the consequences of not closing the deal.
Overcoming objections
The term objection is more commonly used in the specialized negotiation of
sales. Salespeople around the world want to know how to get over, past, and
through objections. They are looking for simple answers to the two most
common objections: price and product.
When someone directly states an objection to whatever you are proposing,
an opportunity is at hand. You have the opportunity to clear away one more
barrier. Every objection you get past puts you closer to your goal of closing
the negotiation. An objection — honestly stated — is just another way of
inviting you to satisfy some concern or to meet a need that you didn’t
address earlier in your presentation.
Answering objections is the fun part of a negotiation. You get to use your
imagination. You get to reach into your information bank and come up with
the answer. Countering objections is the part where you get to show your
stuff, and your preparation really pays off because you get to explain why.
228
Part III: Getting Past the Glitches to Close It Up 

Using questions to get where you want to go
When you try to close a negotiation and you get an objection, a question is
your best friend. Gently probe to find the answers to the following:
 Is the stated objection really the thing that is bothering the other party?
 What will the other party do if this deal doesn’t close? What is his or 
her or else?
 Can you meet or beat that alternative?
The frustrating dilemma is that you cannot state these questions in a direct
manner. You must ask for the information indirectly. You must tease the
answer out. For example, look at the first question in the preceding list. You
usually can’t say, “Come on, tell me what’s really bugging you.” You have to
relax yourself and get the other party to relax so you can get to the source of
the concern. Here are some ways to tickle out the information (each question
is a variation on the theme):
 “If we can find agreement on that one item (price, for example) can we
close this deal today?” If not, you know something else is bothering the
other person.
 “How about if we . . . ?” Suggest a whole new approach. Use linkage to
make the deal work for the other party. (When that works, you know
that you’ve stumbled on what is really bothering the other side.)
 “In a perfect world, what would this deal look like to you?”
You are inside the negotiation, so you have made some progress. The
answers to these questions can turn up all sorts of information you need to
know — information you can’t ask about directly. Keep digging until you’re
satisfied that you fully understand the objection. And if you want to improve
the questions you ask throughout the negotiation, check out Chapter 8.
Going back to square one
People usually use the phrase “back to square one” to express the loss of a
goal or objective. If you run into a blank wall, you may be inclined to shrug
your shoulders and say dejectedly, “Well, I guess we’re back at square one.”
Next time that happens, listen to yourself and think of this book. You have just
given yourself some great advice. Trouble is, most people don’t know great
advice when they hear it, even if they hear this wisdom from themselves!
Square one in negotiating is preparation. Part I of this book deals exclusively
with preparation. When you have a hard time with an objection or can’t close
the negotiation, the answer is almost always lurking in Part I. You generally
need more information about the person you are negotiating with or about
your own company or product or about the competition. 
229
Chapter 14: Closing the Deal and Feeling Good About It

The biggest difference between the very successful negotiator and everyone
else is in the foundational work he or she does before the negotiation ever
begins. I wish that there really were a quick fix, a magic wand, or a sure way
to get ahead in life. Unfortunately, no single factor is as directly responsible
for success in individual negotiations and success in life as preparation. I say
“unfortunately” because a whole lot of people look at preparation as work.
In seminar after seminar, I find that my closing question-and-answer session
deals with the opening topic of good preparation. This fact is especially true
with sales groups where some people are looking for the fast close, that special
phrase that saves the day. Nothing saves the day like a good night’s rest —
after you burn the midnight oil getting ready.
If you’re still in doubt, go back and do a little more preparation about your-
self and the marketplace. I cover preparing yourself in depth in Chapter 2 so
you can understand the unique value you bring to the table. A lot of people
don’t realize the importance of self-knowledge as it relates to a negotiation.
You need to thoroughly understand why your counterpart is in a negotiation
with you in the first place. Chapter 3 helps you understand the marketplace
so that you know that the deal you’re offering is fair.
All of these qualities have something to do with preparation. I know that a
book titled Joy of Preparation would never sell as well as Joy of Cooking and
Joy of Sex, but if you embrace the joy of preparation, it will make an enor-
mous difference in your life. Every minute you spend on preparation is, as
they say, money in the bank.
Watch Robert Zemeckis’s film Contact for a look at overcoming obstacles to
close a deal. The film, based on the novel by Pulitzer Prize–winning author
and astronomer Carl Sagan, is about a radio astronomer named Dr. Ellie
Arroway (Jodie Foster), who discovers an extraterrestrial radio transmission
that is clearly from an intelligent alien source. Her research is called the SETI
project (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence). The government doesn’t
have faith in the project and blocks funding.
Look at the scene where Ellie asks a group of private financiers for continued
funding of her research project. The odds are against her, but Ellie walks 
into the boardroom prepared and determined. She pleads her case to the
financiers, and her enthusiasm for her research shines in the meeting. She’s
persistent without being overbearing. The financiers initially seem reluctant.
Ellie is convinced that the deal isn’t closed, but as she leaves the boardroom,
the financiers stop her and tell her that her funding is secured. The deal
closed because Ellie believed in herself.

Part III: Getting Past the Glitches to Close It Up 

Closing When It’s All in the Family
Parents have an important calling and a rewarding challenge. Mothers and
fathers teach values, morals, and appropriate behavior by being positive role
models, creating consistent and fair standards of discipline, and enforcing
the rules with love and kindness.
These qualities are easy to define, but good parenting really takes all the
negotiating skills in this book. To reach closing with children means to be
explicit about consequences for breaking from expected rules or standards 
of behavior. First, the standards must be clearly established.
It’s a good idea when deciding on rules and standards of behavior to have
regular family meetings. As problems and conflicts arise during the week,
post them on a meeting agenda sheet on the refrigerator or nearby bulletin
board.
The purpose of the meeting is problem solving. Everyone attends and has a
voice in suggesting solutions. Many parents are played off against each other,
especially when they are separated or divorced. Having everybody in the
same room at the same time can prevent that. Decide together on procedures
and standards of behavior. These decisions can be posted as Family Rules.
If everybody is not in the same room at the same time, you may unintention-
ally create a situation where a family member assumes a conclusion that has
not been reached. For example, the teenager really wants to stay out all night
on prom night. The parents are undecided. Dad says, “Sounds like fun. I
remember doing that when I was in high school.” The teen takes that as a yes
and runs with it — straight to Mom who says “we’ll see.” The teen goes ahead
and makes all the plans, planning a stop to change clothes at someone’s
house, committing to drive, offering to pitch in with breakfast plans at
another’s house.
The teen, deep into joyful expectations, assumes that all these plans will defi-
nitely close the negotiation with the parental units. When the parents finally
research the planned activities and find a lack of adult supervision, Mom says
no, and Dad backs her up. Emotional upheaval results. Many teen friends are
now inconvenienced, and Mom and Dad are in a weak position — they could
be accused of breaching the agreement (which was never really made).
Parents need to follow up very carefully when closing a deal with teenagers,
so no false closure results. Always be clear about what state of decision you
are in, even if you say clearly, “I’m not sure yet; don’t make any plans.”
231
Chapter 14: Closing the Deal and Feeling Good About It

Closing is a necessary skill for you to practice consistently with your chil-
dren. Adults are more equipped to handle uncertainty. Children need to know
where they stand — the young live in the here and now. This is as true for the
teenager as it is for the 2-year-old. When you have completed all the other
skills, and children are clear about your expectations, closing the deal means
checking out the child’s understanding of the resolution. Encourage the child
to say in her own words how she feels after a conflict is resolved, or after
something she wants is either given or denied.
When the Deal Is Done
The negotiation is over. The contract is signed. The client is happy. You are
being roundly congratulated. Administrative details have yet to be set up, but
your job is over — almost.
You have two things left to do for the good of the deal and for your own
growth. One is to review the entire negotiation, and the other is to be sure
the deal is properly executed. And then the congratulations can begin.
Review the process
As soon as you have a chance to do so, go to a quiet place and think back
over the negotiation and consider what you may have done differently.
Consider the consequences of the various choices you made. I’m not talking
about self-flagellation; I’m talking about calm review of the entire negotiating
history, mentally playing out various options you had along the way. This
process is one final review after you have time and distance from the com-
pleted negotiation. This is particularly useful after the successful negotiation,
because you don’t have any self-doubt or blame.
Here are some questions to think about during the review:
 What additional information could you have gathered before the 
negotiation started? Where would you have gotten that information?
 Did you know as much as you would have liked to about the other party?
 Were you as well informed as you needed to be about the marketplace?
 Were your goals appropriate to the situation? Note that you are not
asking if you achieved all your goals. If it happens that you did achieve
all your goals, you probably didn’t set them high enough.
232
Part III: Getting Past the Glitches to Close It Up 

 Were your limits appropriate to the situation? Did you learn anything
during the negotiation that caused you to change your limits? Did you
adjust your limits to keep the deal instead of adjusting your limits based
on new information?
 Did you listen as well as you could have? Were there times where you
did not have the patience to hear the other side out?
 Were you as clear as you could have been throughout the negotiation?
Did your lack of clarity ever threaten the deal?
 How often did you use your pause button? What pause button did you
use? What was happening that caused you to use your pause button?
 Did you start closing right away? How many efforts to close did you make?
I know these are a lot of questions to answer. They’re based on the six basic
skills of negotiation, so you can also analyze your negotiation using those
points. (And so you don’t have to tattoo those skills on your forearm to
remember them, I’ve included them on the Cheat Sheet at the front of this
book. You’re welcome!)
Set up systems for checking the system
Regardless of whether you are a part of a large organization or you are negoti-
ating on your own behalf, don’t close up the file and consider a negotiation
over until you have taken steps to ensure that the agreement will be carried
out. You need to make sure that the agreement’s execution is ethical, timely,
and honest. Precautions you can take include such items as marking a calen-
dar with the dates that various items are due, checking that the people who
must carry out the agreement are on board and understand the terms, and
making sure that the progress is being reported to the other side.
Most large organizations have a separate department for just that purpose.
The department is often called Contract Administration or something very
close. Even when departmental staff handles these details, you should call
the department after an appropriate amount of time has passed (usually a
week or two) and satisfy yourself that the servicing system is in place. If you
are a salesperson, you want to be sure that the order is being or has been
processed.
You check because if something goes wrong in servicing a contract, the prob-
lem reflects badly on you. This is true regardless of how far such matters are
from your responsibility. You negotiated the deal. If the terms are not carried
out in a professional and timely manner, the other party will remember that
the deal he or she made with you went sour. Unfair, but true.
233
Chapter 14: Closing the Deal and Feeling Good About It

Make it your personal responsibility to be sure that the other party is happy.
The effort may take a few extra moments and may involve following up with
people who should take care of business without prompting. But the benefits
of repeat business for you and the preservation of your own good reputation
will benefit you many times over. Your personal duty is to live up to the spirit
and letter of the agreement. I consider this a sacred trust. Your word is your
bond. Don’t ever forget that.
Remember to celebrate!
New beginnings and final endings are celebrated in every culture, even
though the events may look very different. The signing ceremony to mark 
the end of the negotiation and the beginning of the life of the agreement
looms large in the United States. Such events feel like a natural time to 
celebrate. Such celebrations make reopening any discussion on the terms
mighty difficult. Americans shake hands even over the smallest agreements
and pop champagne corks for the big ones. No matter where you are in the
world, people celebrate reaching important agreements. Some go to church,
others throw a party, and some light a candle. A parade occurs almost spon-
taneously when a surrender is signed in war.
It is also important to celebrate when you decide not to close a deal and to
walk away from it. Close only a good deal. Avoid the bad deals. Be happy
when you do not close a bad deal. Walking away from bad deals is like avoid-
ing a collision in traffic. You breathe a huge sigh of relief and thank goodness
that you avoided the accident. When you are successful in avoiding a bad
deal, celebrate whatever way you know and love best — but celebrate.
Celebrate with all the joy and verve that you bring to closing a good deal.

In This Chapter
 Dealing with glitches that block the deal from closing
 Handling conflict so both sides benefit
 Walking away from a deal
 Contemplating a renegotiation
You can get ridiculously close to an agreement, and the entire negotiation
can still fall apart on you. After all of the hard work and time you’ve
invested in getting to the final stages, it’s frustrating to walk away from the
negotiating table empty-handed. This chapter explores the roadblocks, from
dirty tricks used by the other party to environmental glitches, that keep a
deal from closing and how you can overcome them.
Many circumstances and events can send the best of negotiations skidding
off track. In chess, these moves are called gambits. In track, such barriers 
are hurdles. In steeple chasing, they are hedgerows. In a crime chase, they
are roadblocks. In the military, they are Catch 22s. In a negotiation, they 
are glitches — from the German word, glitchen, meaning a slippery spot in 
the road.
Overcoming the Glitches
Glitches happen. You cannot ignore them or be overly frustrated by them.
You can’t avoid them. They are part of the life of any negotiator. Heck, they
are part of life. If you are prepared for them, you actually derive a certain
pleasure from dealing with glitches when they come up in a negotiation.

I could write 22 volumes describing all the different glitches you may
encounter, and sure enough, your next negotiation would uncover a new vari-
ation, a new slippery spot for you to maneuver. But the secret to successfully
negotiating through any glitch is the same — keep your ultimate goal in mind.
You are trying to reach an agreement — don’t get sidetracked by glitches.
The best way to get through your next glitch is to push the pause button 
(see Chapter 12). Take a mental break from the negotiation. Check your own
performance on each of the essential skills of any negotiation. Use that pause
button with a vengeance. Find the problem and fix it. Then you can get back
to the substance of the negotiation and close the deal. Always keep the nego-
tiation moving toward the desired end.
The following sections provide general guidelines and some easy steps for
getting past some of the most common glitches that people run into when
they are negotiating.
Dirty Tricks That Torment
Most glitches in a negotiation are something the other person says or does. If
you make a mistake, the error is easy enough to correct. The frustrations —
the glitches — arise from something the other party does. It’s easy enough to
take care of your own goofs. Figuring out your counterpart’s goofs and how
to get around them takes special talent. Some of the more common, madden-
ing moments in a negotiation are listed in this section.
A constant change of position
Any negotiation involves concessions. Each side makes these concessions
based on the information the two sides exchange about the factual matters
and the priorities of the parties. Barring unusual circumstances, priorities
should not change. Keep a consistent position about those items that are
important to you and what your goals are.
If the other side changes its position concerning what is and what is not
important, stop everything until you find out what happened. Don’t ignore
the issue. One of the following situations occurs:
 Maybe the other party experienced a significant change of circumstances.
Get the new situation firmly in mind. Then revisit the point on which you
thought there was some level of agreement. Maybe the new situation calls
for a new solution.
 Perhaps the other side is trying to pull a fast one.
236
Part III: Getting Past the Glitches to Close It Up 

 Maybe the other side is not as prepared as he or she should be. If that’s
the case, take a break. Your negotiation will go better for both sides if
both sides have prepared. Just say, “Maybe we should take this up
tomorrow. That will give you time to meet and sort out any last-minute
items. No rush. We want you to be ready for this.”
Written memos are useful tools in this situation, but a caveat is in order. If a
constant change of position is part of a person’s negotiating style, expect the
person to constantly lose your documentation, not have time to read it, to
misplace it, or simply to ignore it.
If you suspect that your counterpart may conveniently lose your written 
documentation, be sure to use firm and clear language in your memo: “If you
disagree with any portion of this memo, please advise by such-and-such a
date.” Being this specific helps more than saying “as soon as possible” or
“immediately,” which mean different timeframes to different people. Even
more helpful is to distribute your memos to everyone the negotiator wants 
to impress. This way, the negotiator’s peers, superiors, and colleagues can
monitor the progress of the proceedings.
Good cop, bad cop
A less obvious but equally dangerous glitch is the good cop/bad cop ploy.
This label grows out of the police interrogation technique of having one offi-
cer question a suspect harshly and another, gentler cop be the relief ques-
tioner. The gentler cop — the good cop — pretends to befriend the suspect.
The theory is that the suspect will spill the beans to the good cop.
Don’t fall in love with the good cop. The good cop, more often than the bad
cop, does you in. If you doubt that, remember that the good cop is the know-
ing partner of the bad cop. One does not exist without the other. They don’t
wander unknowingly down different paths. They do what they do deliberately.
The good cop is usually the more pleasant personality of the two, but in a
negotiating context, they are in cahoots.
Here are some ideas for putting the good cop/bad cop duo in their place:
 Use their little game against them. Go ahead and confide in the good
cop. Confide to the good cop that the bad cop has just about blown the
deal. Confide about your other opportunities. But never drop your
guard. Set deadlines. Be clear. Don’t lose focus. Your discussion with the
good cop is an extension of your discussion with the bad cop. Don’t
forget that for one minute.
 Create a bad cop of your own. Tell your counterparts that you’d love to
do what they want, but your boss is obsessed with sticking to the points
at hand. It’s easier to create your own fictitious bad cop who appears
more unyielding than to have a bad cop who is present at the negotiation.
237
Chapter 15: When the Deal Just Won’t Seem to Close

 Let the other team’s bad cop talk and talk and talk. Sometimes it
resolves the problem, especially if the bad cop is being obnoxious.
Eventually his own team will get tired of hearing him and tell him to 
quit talking.
 Turn the good cop into a bad cop by calling him on his bluff. This 
tells the other side that you’re aware of the good cop/bad cop dynamic.
Sometimes just identifying them both in your own mind allows you 
to better handle the situation without you having to come out and
accuse them.
Watch Oliver Stone’s controversial U Turn for a classic example of the good
cop/bad cop relationship. The film is about a drifter, Bobby Cooper (Sean
Penn), whose car breaks down in a small Southwest town. Bobby meets a
sultry young woman named Grace (Jennifer Lopez) and is invited home to
help her install her drapes. Soon her enraged husband, Jake (Nick Nolte),
comes charging in and threatens Bobby with his life. The good cop/bad cop
dynamic soon emerges between Grace and Jake. Jake paints a disastrous por-
trait of his wife, calling her disloyal. Jakes offers Bobby a large sum of money
in exchange for killing his wife. Bobby is torn. Later, Grace seduces Bobby
and warns him of the abusive Jake. She wants Bobby to kill Jake in exchange
for her love. Bobby’s life depends on whom he believes. I won’t spoil the
ending of the film. Suffice it to say that the good cop/bad cop duo’s negotia-
tion blindsides Bobby and leads him down a treacherous path of deceit.
The invisible partner
One of the more frustrating glitches you can run into in a negotiation is to
discover — usually late in the game — that the other side can’t agree to 
anything without consulting some invisible or unavailable partner or boss.
Overcoming this glitch can be like shadow-boxing.
If you run into the invisible-partner glitch, you may not have gathered enough
information about the other party (see Chapter 3). You should have determined
the decision-making authority of your counterpart early in the negotiation. To a
large extent, good preparation avoids the problem of the invisible partner.
The invisible partner is quite similar to the good cop/bad cop tactic, and a bit
more frustrating. An unnamed, unseen bad cop is off in the wings continually
vetoing the progress made in the discussions. This situation usually arises in
small business transactions or real estate deals, although a variation of it can
exist in large organizations. Banks often use the so-called loan committee in
this way.
If you sense a silent-partner excuse coming, ask for the opportunity to pay
your respects to that silent partner — no negotiating. Heavens no, wouldn’t
think of it. You just want to introduce yourself and pay a courtesy call.
238
Part III: Getting Past the Glitches to Close It Up 

Keep your word. Don’t use the first meeting to negotiate, if you promised 
not to pursue a business discussion. After you have made a courtesy contact,
however, you always have the option of making direct contact for the pur-
pose of breaking a logjam. Someone else in your organization can contact the
silent partner as well. Frequently, these folks in the wings work behind the
scenes because they are really softies and have a hard time saying no them-
selves. You can use this vulnerability to your advantage.
There is a very helpful, non-negotiating, procedural question that you can 
ask of the invisible partner, even in the initial meeting. Upon meeting Ivan the
Invisible, express your gratitude for having the opportunity to meet him; then
assure him that you’re delighted to be working with the Designated Negotiator.
After the small talk, innocently ask Ivan whether they have had sufficient time
to discuss the negotiating parameters. Can you close a deal with the
Designated Negotiator? Does Ivan need to be alone with the Designated
Negotiator to talk out any more limitations before you and he go further?
You may not be negotiating, but the more you can do to close off this frustrat-
ing technique of an invisible authority figure doing you in at every turn, the
happier you are and the more smoothly the negotiation goes.
If you are not successful in meeting Ivan the Invisible, try insisting that the
invisible partner be in a nearby room or available by telephone during the
next negotiation session. Then, if a question arises that requires his or her
approval, the other side can’t use the absence as an excuse for prolonging
the negotiation. You need to prevent delays during the negotiation when you
reach the point of conclusion.
Finally, you can always treat the other side’s need to get approval from the
invisible partner like any other request in a negotiation. The other side usu-
ally presents this step as an unavoidable fact of life, but if the negotiation has
progressed to the very final stages, I view the invisible partner (or the boss
who suddenly needs to approve the deal) as a new request. I then state a sim-
ilar condition: “Okay, but be sure your partner (or boss) understands that
you and I have negotiated this deal to its conclusion. If she changes some-
thing, I will have to go back to my people, and they will undoubtedly want to
change something. Right now, this deal is acceptable. We have given up some
things, and you have given up some things. The deal is in balance. Changing
something at this late date could throw it out of whack. It would definitely
hold things up.”
Such a speech often stops the other party from ever going to Ivan the
Invisible. When the other side still insists on consulting with the invisible
partner even after my speech, the deal comes back unchanged more often
than not.
239
Chapter 15: When the Deal Just Won’t Seem to Close

The double message
Always stay in step with yourself. By this, I mean that your words and your
actions are consistent. Nothing, but nothing, is a bigger barrier to communi-
cation than the double message. Here are some common double messages
you may have received in your negotiating experience:
 The threat to break off a negotiation, but the negotiation continues 
uninterrupted. This behavior baffles the listener.
This inconsistency will throw into question every future statement the
person makes.
 Not mentioning an issue at all during the first negotiating sessions and
then making it the most important item on the table.
This double message is a quite common syndrome I call the “Wimp/
Monster.” Sometimes people are afraid or don’t have time to raise an
issue, so they “wimp out.” They fail to bring the issue to the table. When
they finally raise the issue, it’s not well received because it is put on the
table so late in the discussion, so they get very upset and turn into a
“monster.” The better practice is to get all the issues on the table as
early as possible.
A common double message occurs when the boss negotiates a task to be
done on an immediate, high-priority basis. The job is completed on time and
is on the boss’s desk at the requested moment — where it sits untouched for
the next two weeks. Whoever pulled off the miracle must be acknowledged
immediately. Otherwise, the person may be turned off the next time they are
told that a similar miracle is needed. After all, the last time a big deal was
made about a rush job, the project was not important enough to warrant a
comment, even though it was accomplished at breakneck speed. More bosses
should recognize these workplace situations for the negotiations they are.
This common mistake made with a subordinate would probably not be made
with an opponent in an important negotiation.
Children are taught this concept early in life when they are told “not to cry
wolf.” There is a fairy tale about a boy who kept crying out that a wolf was 
in the area. He had fun because he got a great deal of attention each time he
shouted the warning. But when a wolf was really coming and he tried to warn
the village, no one listened to him because he had falsely cried wolf too often.
We’re not sure what happens when these children grow into executives, but
some assistants wish that someone would tell them that story again.
Nickel and diming
Just when you thought that everything was settled, the person on the other
side wants just a few little concessions. Sometimes the requests come at the
240
Part III: Getting Past the Glitches to Close It Up 

end of the negotiating session. Sometimes the person asks in a phone call the
next morning. Whenever it happens, you’re bound to be annoyed. In many
cultures, such behavior is accepted, and in other cultures, it’s expected. But
in America, we think of this type of person as being cheap or chintzy. It is 
certainly not classy. You should not seek a few more things at the end of a
negotiation, and you certainly don’t want this to happen to you.
But sooner or later, someone will try to nickel and dime you. Here’s how you
can respond:
 Push your pause button (see Chapter 12). A quick count of 1-2-3 might
do the trick.
 Ask a polite question or two to help you find out why this is happening.
Your counterpart may be nickel and diming you because of
 Habit: This person likes to feel that he or she got something for nothing.
He asks for a free tie when he buys a suit, usually while the tailor is pin-
ning up the pants.
 Buyer’s remorse: After sleeping on it, the other person feels he or she
got a bad deal in some way and wants to make it up.
Your first response is to ask questions. Find out where the request is coming
from. Often a boss has chewed out the person on the opposite side of the
table for not getting some small item (probably the only thing his or her boss
knows anything about. Sometimes it is a forgotten item. You want to go over
this ground, so that you can ask the most important question of all: “Are sure
this is it? Are you positive you won’t be coming back for anything more.”
After you have all the information you can acquire, you can agree to the
request or deny the request.
 If the request seems legitimate, give the person what he or she
requested because it amounts to so little in relation to the entire deal.
But don’t forget that the person made the request because he or she will
probably do it to you again. When you agree to the request, make a big
deal out of giving what is asked, and be sure it closes the deal. Tell the
person, “It will be in the memo I send over for you to sign,” so he or she
understands that the concession is tied to closing the deal.
 If the request is made out of habit and is just an annoyance, turn it 
down with something like “Sorry, too late.” Meet a renewed request with
chuckle to underscore the humor in the situation and say something like
“Does this really work? Gee, I want to go shopping with you,” (without
agreeing to make the concession). I sometimes make some lame excuse
such as the initial paperwork has already been sent into the system and
can’t be retrieved, or I just keep repeating something like, “Nope, nope —
too late — we closed this up.”

Chapter 15: When the Deal Just Won’t Seem to Close

“Let’s split the difference and be done”
The concept of splitting the difference is one of the most seductive negotiat-
ing ploys, but if someone suggests it to you, measure the result. Sometimes
people begin a negotiation with a number that is unrealistically high just to
impress a counterpart with the size of the subsequent discounts as the bar-
gaining proceeds. If you have been more than fair in your approach, splitting
the difference is not necessarily equitable. If the result is unsatisfactory, you
need to say so. Don’t be afraid of being called a spoiler by the other side.
Here’s what you do:
1. Push the pause button (covered in Chapter 12).
2. Take time to evaluate the proposed compromise based on all the
other basics.
If splitting the difference means $125, figure out whether $125 is an
acceptable resolution to the negotiation.
3. If the number is not acceptable, explain why this seemingly fair
approach doesn’t work.
4. If the number is acceptable to you, point out why it is fair based on
the facts rather than on the mere fact that it was halfway between the
last two positions of you and the other party.
In the United States, our tremendous sense of fair play dictates that both
sides give equally. Following are some rules to live by the next time you’re
asked to “split the difference”:
 Don’t fall into the trap of thinking that splitting the difference is the fair
thing to do.
 Never offer to split the difference yourself. Instead encourage the other
person to offer to split the difference.
 By getting the other party to offer to split the difference, you put her in 
a position of suggesting the compromise. Then you can reluctantly agree
to her proposal, making her feel that she won.
The hidden agenda
One of the most maddening and puzzling experiences is negotiating with
someone who has a hidden agenda. The most common hidden agenda that I
have run into over the years is when the person on the other side of the table
242
Part III: Getting Past the Glitches to Close It Up 

has a competition with, an axe to grind with, or favors to curry with someone
else in the company. He or she wants to get even, do in, or to win favor with
this other person. Of course, you don’t know anything about that, so you are
negotiating the deal in a straight-ahead fashion, but you can’t figure out why
this person won’t agree to a certain reasonable point, no matter what you do.
Let me give you an example.
I recently had a negotiation in which I represented the producer of an inde-
pendent film. The agent for the director we were seeking to hire insisted that
her client have the right to hire the casting director. In an independent film,
the casting director has the main responsibility of convincing stars of certain
stature that the script and the director are worth the risk, even though the
budget is tight and they will not be paid anywhere near their usual salaries.
The most I would give her on this point was the somewhat standard, mutual
approval over the casting director. I struggled to figure out what was going
on. Finally, after a lot of probing, I determined that the director was a new
client to this agent. The director had asked the agency to switch agents
(rather than leave the agency all together) because she was unhappy with
her last deal when a casting director she did not like had already been hired
on the picture. The agent knew I was correct on the point, but she wanted to
show up the other agent and to curry favor with the boss that they shared.
After I knew that, I could help her out.
My client and I agreed to let the director hire the casting director through a
procedure we outlined. My client, the producer, would provide a list of
acceptable casting directors and the budget range for the casting director,
and the director would make the selection. The agent achieved her personal
goals on her hidden agenda, and we were guaranteed to get a casting director
we liked. I also called the agent’s boss and told him what a great job she did.
When you dissect this story, you find out how to deal with hidden agendas:
1. Ask a lot of probing questions to find out what is really going on.
Doing so requires patience and time. Sometimes, the person on the
other side of the tale isn’t entirely aware of why he or she is behaving in
a certain way.
2. Try to help the other party with his or her goals without jeopardizing
the deal you are after.
3. Be sure to follow through with whatever help you can provide.
You will make a friend for life at the same time that you close the 
negotiation on acceptable terms.
243
Chapter 15: When the Deal Just Won’t Seem to Close

Addressing Red Flags That Come 
Up When It’s Time to Close
Up to this point, I’ve been talking about trying to get the deal closed in spite
of a number of annoying tactics that might be thrown at you. What about the
situation where the other person has been pleasant to deal with and there
have been no real problems — you even have grown to trust the person —
but something tells you not to take the person up on his or her last sugges-
tion. The situations in the following sections should make you run for cover.
In some very special situations, signs may indicate that you should go forward
with the deal, but those situations are very rare. When you think you are in
such a situation, be sure to talk it over with others who will be affected. Never
decide to go forward in one of the following situations without getting a reality
check from someone you trust and who is knowledgeable in the field.
“If you accept this price, I’ll have a lot
more work for you in the future”
Well, isn’t that enticing. This offer implies more business to come and that
the future work will be at a price that is a bit closer to your asking price 
than this project. Yes, a volume of work usually comes with a discount, so 
it’s reasonable to provide goods or services at a lower price when more units
are being purchased. So this is an acceptable arrangement, and you should
go forward.
Wrong!
Agree to this deal only if the following points are true:
 You get the commitment to future business in writing. The last thing
you want to do is to give a big break on some initial work and never get
the payoff of future business that was so artfully dangled under your
nose.
 You know exactly how much future business there will be and exactly
how much of it will come your way. That’s the only way that you will
know exactly how big a discount to give off your normal price.
 You can afford to do the work or provide the goods at the lower rate. If
you lose money on a job, you can’t make it up on volume. You must have
a profit in each job you do. So no matter what, you have to go back to the
drawing board to be sure that you won’t lose money on the initial order.
244
Part III: Getting Past the Glitches to Close It Up 

“We’re in such a rush, why don’t 
we start without a contract?”
You have agreed on all the major points, and you trust this guy. Besides that,
everyone knows that legal eagles can take forever to get the paperwork out. If
you insist on a written contract before you start the project, you’re going to
come off as an untrusting jerk. So this arrangement will work out, and you
should take the plunge.
Wrong!
If the project or services are of any significance, you want, need, and deserve
something in writing. Nothing prevents future misunderstandings as much as
having things down on paper. The agreement doesn’t have to be long and
fancy. It doesn’t have to be prepared by lawyers. All you need is a simple
piece of paper that says, “This is the work I would like you to do” or “These
are the goods that I would like you to deliver at such and such a price.” You
only need a few minutes to prepare such a memo, but you’ll need hours or
months to untangle misunderstandings that arise when such details aren’t
clear from the start.
I could write from here to the end of the book about the misunderstandings
that arise from failing to make clear at the beginning both parties’ expecta-
tions. Sometimes unclear communication at the beginning of the negotiation
causes the misunderstandings. Sometimes a change of heart during the
process creates misunderstandings. Sometimes things don’t turn out as
expected, which leads to misunderstandings, and no one knows exactly 
how to handle the new situation.
What causes the misunderstandings really doesn’t matter. The important
thing is that most of them can be easily and quickly avoided. You simply need
to jot down what you think the deal is on a piece of paper and have the other
person read it carefully, ask any questions, make any changes, and then sign
or initial it. It’s a few minutes of your time, but it can save you hours of
headaches.
“We’re such good friends, let’s 
get started right away”
This is a particularly dangerous situation because no alarm bells go off. You
want to go forward. Your friend wants to go forward. What’s to stop all of this
from happening and happening in the most glorious burst of productivity
between friends that the world has ever seen?
245
Chapter 15: When the Deal Just Won’t Seem to Close

When you are dealing with friends — especially old friends — you don’t need
a written memo. You two have never had a cross word pass between you. You
have been through thick and thin. You know what your expectations are, and
your friend will always stick by you. In fact, if you mention that you want a
memo, it could affect the friendship, and you certainly wouldn’t want that to
happen.
Wrong again!
Nothing is worse than the misunderstandings that arise between friends who
decided to launch a business venture together. The misunderstanding is
quickly smothered by feelings of betrayal and loss. It is a mess. I hate to tell
you how many times folks have come into my office who started a creative
project together without a written agreement, and it turned sour because
each party didn’t know the other’s expectations. Don’t let this happen to you.
You don’t need to make a big deal of putting your agreement in writing. You
just say, “Let me just write this all out so I’m clear,” and then get the other
party to approve it. If the friend you are intending to work with, is reluctant
to sign such an informal, short form agreement, find out why and thank your
lucky stars that you took the time to do this before getting too far into the
business venture with him or her. Until you are both on the same page with
your expectations and your conceptions of what is and is not acceptable, you
shouldn’t be making an agreement.
If you two are really friends, don’t lay the friendship on the altar of expedi-
tiously making a business deal that is fundamentally flawed. Work out the
details up front or move on. It would be much better to keep the friendship
outside of a troubled business than to get started on a business venture that
is doomed from the beginning because the two founders have markedly dif-
ferent ideas about how things are going to work.
Dealing with a Bad Negotiating
Environment
A whole cluster of problems that are not caused by a counterpart can throw
a negotiation off track. More often than not, these environmental glitches are
as frustrating to the opposing party as they are to you, so I talk about them
first. You can often engage the other side in the solution, unless the problem
is bigger than both of you.
246
Part III: Getting Past the Glitches to Close It Up 

Sometimes glitches are not individuals but barriers that are characteristic of
certain businesses. It always takes longer to get a final decision out of a large
corporation than it does to get a final decision out of a sole proprietorship. It’s
just the way the world works. However, you can cure some of the glitches that
are a product of the corporate culture as opposed to the individual or division
that you are negotiating with. In time, you’ll know which circumstances you
just have to accept and which ones you can change. Here are a few examples
of frustrations that you can help to clear away, even though they may be an
inherent part of doing business with the company in question.
 Absent key people: You and your counterpart set a meeting, and another
key player has to participate. But just before the meeting is scheduled to
take place, something always comes up that keeps that person from
attending, so you have to reschedule — again and again and again.
Solution: See if you can go ahead without that person, and then create a
report so the person knows what discussions took place, even though
he or she wasn’t present at the meeting. Alternatively, see if that person
can attend by telephone. Don’t let somebody else’s calendar prevent
you from moving forward on a deal, even if that someone else happens
to be your boss.
 Missing information: Often co-workers put a lower priority than you would
like on a piece of work that you need for your negotiation. Sometimes the
information just isn’t available yet. In the film business, it is hard to negoti-
ate salaries until you get an approved budget. In a manufacturing concern,
you may need a production schedule to know when something is to be
delivered. Lacking key information can really hold things up.
Solution: Try to find details you and your counterpart can agree on
while waiting for the key piece of information. If your side is holding
things up, see how you can help pull the necessary information together.
I know. I know. It’s not your job. Guess what. Your job is to close the
negotiation. If that means helping someone else out so you can get the
necessary facts or figures in a timely fashion, so be it. It’s frustrating, but
better to give a hand than to lose a deal.
 Too much paper: So many completed forms are necessary that your
buyer turns off. Too many demands for duplicate information may irri-
tate the person to the point where he or she gets frustrated and wants
to deal with someone else.
Solution: Fill out as much of the paperwork as possible before you
arrive. Have the paperwork well organized. Carry a clipboard so signing
is as convenient as possible. Don’t solve the problem by having some-
one sign a blank form.
 Hidden policies: These directives are hidden from you — not from the
other person. What you don’t know can kill you — or at least kill your
deal. If the company’s policies are against you, all the persuasion in the
world won’t change things.
247
Chapter 15: When the Deal Just Won’t Seem to Close

Solution: Do your homework. Ask questions. Don’t ignore the situation.
You can spot this problem when you simply aren’t making any headway.
 Poorly designed tools and resources: If you reach for the contract to
close the negotiation and the document isn’t there, the delay may halt
the negotiation. Even if you do have the contract but it’s full of typo-
graphical errors or is outdated, the situation spells unprofessionalism,
and the negotiation is a no-go.
Solution: Check over all the materials you plan to use in your presenta-
tion in advance. Make sure that they are the best they can be, even if
you have to reach into your own pocket to improve them. Your commis-
sion or the advancement of your career is at stake. If the document is a
form that the company supplies, make the necessary corrections before
you start your negotiating session.
Sometimes these frustrations are present in your company, as well as in the
other person’s company. Be sure you try to soften the impact of these types of
problems no matter which company is the source of the problem. Your job is to
close the negotiation, not to play the blame game on corporate environments.
Managing Conflict When 
the Deal Won’t Close
The potential for conflict is an ever-present reality when trying to close a
deal. It can manifest itself in differences of views, opinions, personality, and
interests. But conflict doesn’t have to be destructive. If the right options are
chosen to handle conflict the result can be a huge benefit to both sides.
Following are four options that can really help you to manage conflict when
the deal won’t close and two options that will make things worse. Let’s start
with the two options that tend to exacerbate the situation:
 I Win, You Lose. You just dig in your heels and won’t budge. This
approach is risky because you come off as a bully to the other party,
causing him or her to harbor resentment. This negotiating strategy is
based on the belief that you are not responsible for the conflict and
therefore will not budge at all to the other side. You must be seen to 
win. When you use this approach on others, you encourage them to 
find ways to use “win-lose” back on you.
 I Lose, You Win. You just yield the point without getting anything in
return. Do not consider the “I lose, you win” approach to conflict as a
strategy. This approach is the route to letting others have their way.
Sooner or later they will come back for more, ruining the balance of 
the negotiation.
248
Part III: Getting Past the Glitches to Close It Up 

Let’s turn to some things that might work for you:
 Push the pause button. Here it is again — another instance to use the
pause button. Sometimes taking a breather during a heated situation is
the best advice. It helps cool the situation and keeps you from making
unrealistic concessions or demands.
 Finding a win-win solution. This is the best strategy to pursue to
manage conflict. When you think with a win-win mentality and act with a
win-win attitude, both parties can reach some accord. A win-win solution
to conflict encourages constructive conflict, which means you don’t
have to destroy the other party in order to come out on top.
 Mediation. This approach is recommended only if absolutely necessary.
Basically, you continue the negotiation with the help of a third party,
such as an attorney. It is often suggested to resolve a negotiation glitch,
especially in labor union talks. It never should be considered as an alter-
native to negotiations in the first place. It’s costly and time consuming.
Always try to settle matters yourself.
 No Deal. A no-deal outcome to a conflict means that nothing changes.
There is no advantage for you in continuing the negotiation, so you walk
away. The next section discusses walking away in depth. Make sure you
have alternatives to fall back when you choose not to make a deal.
The Ultimate Glitch: Someone 
Walks Away
No glitch presents quite the challenge as when someone walks away from the
negotiation. This ultimate glitch has the potential to be final. The sensitive
situation also raises questions about how to get things going again. Walking
away includes such modern equivalents as slamming the phone down or
sending a searing e-mail stating emphatically that the negotiations are over.
Obviously, the negotiation is over if the parties don’t start talking again.
This section deals with the three variations on the theme of walking away:
 The other party walks away.
 Someone else who is negotiating with the other party (in competition
with you) walks away from that negotiation with the other party.
 You walk away.
249
Chapter 15: When the Deal Just Won’t Seem to Close

If the other party walks away
If you believe that the other party is walking away impetuously or for effect,
don’t be afraid to make a lunge and pull him or her back. Shopkeepers have
held onto marginal sales for centuries by grabbing the arm of a departing
customer.
If your counterpart abruptly severs all contact with you by making a hasty
exit from the office, slamming down the telephone receiver, or refusing to
answer telephone calls, you may be unable to reestablish communications
immediately. If the person you’re negotiating with gets out of range, use the
time to your advantage. Consider the limits you set (see Part I). Go over all
the new information gathered since the start of the negotiation. If, upon
reflection, you believe that reopening the negotiation makes sense, do so.
Don’t stand on pride.
The important thing is to keep your eye on your own goals, needs, and limits.
If you didn’t prepare thoroughly or you skipped setting limits, it’s easy for
pride or panic to rear its ugly head at this point. Use this unplanned break to
evaluate, regroup, and prepare some more.
The breakdown of a negotiation is no time for emotion; it’s a time for enlight-
ened self-interest. DeToqueville, the French observer of American life, identi-
fied enlightened self-interest as one of the hallmarks of social and business
structure in America. Don’t let it fail you now. Keep a steely eye on what you
want in life. And never be too proud to pick up the phone and get things back
on track, if that’s what it takes to achieve your personal goals.
If the other party comes crawling back
If the other party calls, be open to finding new ground. If the other person
comes back to you, be sure to respect the opening comment, whatever it is.
The first comment could even be a negative remark about your own conduct.
You can honor the comment with an “I understand,” rather than argue over
who caused the blow-up. After all, the other party is calling to continue the
negotiation, and this is good news.
Even if the other party doesn’t come as far as you want, be sure to acknowl-
edge the willingness to make a first step. Under such circumstances, the small-
est step may involve a major effort — and may be the key to a final settlement.
When negotiations begin again in earnest, don’t dwell on the fact that you
went to extremes to enable it to happen. This is not a time for hard feelings
or for self-congratulations. Just go forward with the business at hand. Be glad
you managed your way through the rough waters.
250
Part III: Getting Past the Glitches to Close It Up 

Be cautious of your limits, which you have determined not to step over,
regardless of what’s being offered. If you reach the breaking point of your
limits, you must be able to walk away and evaluate your other options. If you
don’t walk away, you lose credibility, and both sides know it. But again, it all
boils down to what are you willing to accept, and do you have acceptable
alternatives that can carry you through the day? Only you can answer that
question.
If one of your competitors walks away
If you and one of your competitors are in negotiations to win the same pro-
ject and your competitor walks away from the negotiation, move swiftly to
close your own deal. Usually, the party on the other side of the negotiation is
a bit vulnerable at this time, so you have a good opportunity to obtain a
favorable result.
251
Chapter 15: When the Deal Just Won’t Seem to Close
Great negotiating in “Patterns”
“Patterns” was the January 12, 1955, broadcast
of the Kraft Television Theatre. The show was
performed live — no starting over if someone
made a mistake.
In “Patterns,” Ed Begley (the father of my client,
actor Ed Begley Jr.) plays a senior executive
who is unwillingly replaced by a character
played by a very young Richard Kiley. The late
Elizabeth Montgomery, my former client, plays
a young secretary who, at the end of the first
scene, proclaims, “Wow, you never know when
you are going to hit a nerve.” At that point, you
know you are off on a great ride as a student of
negotiation and communication.
This production demonstrates how important it
is to know all you possibly can about the person
with whom you are negotiating. The boss, Mr.
Ramsey, and the new executive, Mr. Staples,
don’t know each other very well at the beginning
of the film. You get to know them and all the other
well-drawn characters during their interaction in
the corporate world.
The film ends in one of the most incredible
negotiations you will ever witness. Like a fly on
the wall, you watch the powerful and ruthless
executive locked in verbal combat with a bright
and sensitive young executive. You see that
both men are well prepared and have set cer-
tain limits. They both drew lines that they are not
willing to cross. These lines seem to prevent
any kind of effective compromise.
The episode is a great lesson in effective nego-
tiation. This performance won an Emmy for the
brilliant and prolific television writer, Rod
Serling. It is available in many video stores
today as part of the series called The Golden
Age of Television.

Try to find out all you can about the recent events. Usually the opposing
party is your best source. “What the heck happened?” usually brings out
more information than you need. Listen. Be sympathetic, even if the person
speaking acted a bit unreasonably. Being a strong supporter of your counter-
part is one of the best ways to close your own deal.
In the course of listening, try to find out exactly what your counterpart
needed that your competitor didn’t provide. Find out what both parties had
on the table when things blew up. Be sure that the party you are courting is
willing to deal with you and won’t just use your offer as a club to close the
other deal. All of these things are better learned by sympathetic listening as
opposed to direct questions. Direct questions can feel too much like cross-
examination.
Another good source of information is the party that walked away, although
this strategy holds several risks. Most importantly, your call may just cause
that party to try and get back into the game. At this point, that person is
more your competition than the person across the table from you. In addi-
tion, the person you are now negotiating with may not like your getting too
cozy with the person who just walked away. Be careful about trying this
tactic.
Speed is often as important as thorough preparation in this situation. Move
quickly to establish communications. Try to listen lots and speak little until
you are ready. You already know what you are willing to do in the situation. If
you can do so comfortably, make an offer within the range that the other side
wants. Close your deal as quickly as possible.
If you’re the one walking away
When you negotiate for something, whether the transaction is purchasing a
new home or selling a script, think about the possibility of being unsuccess-
ful in the negotiation. Imagine reaching an impasse and deciding that your
best course of action is to terminate the discussion.
This exercise prepares you emotionally for the possibility of not reaching a
satisfactory conclusion. It also gives you a sense of walking away from the
negotiation and stimulation to think about what would happen next.
Walking away in a negotiation
Anytime that you feel that carrying out an agreement would compromise
your integrity or you distrust the other party, run — don’t walk — away from
the negotiation. Your reputation is the most important thing you have in life.
No deal is worth risking your reputation for honesty and integrity.
252
Part III: Getting Past the Glitches to Close It Up 

When you are giving up some long-range goal for a short-term gain, you need
to look very carefully at the trade-off. It is seldom worth it, and you should
think seriously about walking away unless you can build something into the
deal that preserves your ability to pursue your long-range goals.
Walking away in a relationship
In a long-term relationship, walking away is more difficult. Walking out of 
a parent-child relationship is impossible. The great search for the natural
family, even after years of separation, is a constant in modern life. You can,
however, walk out of specific negotiations temporarily and decide when to
take the matter up again. Make clear what you are doing by stating that you
are not walking out on the relationship.
Starting All Over Again
When you or the other party walks away from the negotiation, your first
instinct will probably be to keep walking. Unless you are a runner. Then 
your instinct will probably be to run.
But hold everything. Don’t burn any bridges. Don’t destroy a business rela-
tionship and a business opportunity over what just may be a temporary
hiccup between you and the person on the other side of the table.
Consider the broader context. In the big scheme of things, is it better or
worse for your company to have the deal that just fell apart? Consider the
other players involved in the negotiation. You’ve probably worked with them
before. Would you like to work with them again?
You may be able to complete what you originally intended if it’s something
worth doing. Push the pause button (see Chapter 12). Take a break and look
at the negotiation as objectively as possible. If that doesn’t provide a clear
answer to the question of whether to try to put the deal back together, ask a
friend or trusted colleague to help you see the different components of the
negotiation as you talk though them.
Only you and your inner circle can decide if you should go forward with the
deal or if you should let it go. It is a deeply personal decision.
If you decide to go forward, ask yourself a few pertinent questions before
rushing back into the fray. Did the previous negotiation fall apart because of a
particular sticking point? How would this negotiation differ from the one that
broke apart? How did you contribute to the problem?
253
Chapter 15: When the Deal Just Won’t Seem to Close

Before reaching out to the other side to start things up again, check yourself
on the six basic skills discussed in this book:
 Is there anything more you need to know about the other party or the
marketplace (or yourself, for that matter)? Find out before you launch
another round of talks. Prepare for this negotiation just as diligently as
you prepared the first time. Knowing that you are prepared allows you
to be present in the moment and be attentive to what is happening
during these new negotiating sessions.
 Are your goals and your limits appropriate? Don’t blame the other guy
100 percent. Maybe you were a bit off kilter with your own expectations.
 Did you listen to the needs and wants of the other side, or did you just
plow forward with what you wanted to get out of the deal?
 Were you clear in your presentation, or could the other side have 
misunderstood you?
 Did you use your pause button to take breaks when necessary, or did
you get a bit testy with the other party? If you voiced your frustration,
don’t forget to do a mea culpa or two. Keeping your emotions in check 
is particularly important when you are restarting something that has
already gone south once. Save your emotions for another time.
 Were you trying to close the deal along the way, or did you leave too
many items open, so that the other side was a bit overwhelmed? If you
jump back into this negotiation, wrap things up, bit by bit, moving
steadily toward a final solution.
When you first try to get things started again, propose one or more solutions.
Explain how you want to overcome the previous snag or what you need
others to do. Don’t spend a lot of time justifying what you need and want —
just ask for it. If questioned about your reasons, be prepared to explain them.
At the first session where you start negotiating again, appreciate the other
team and yourself. Recognize the fact that you are sitting in the same room
with the same party you were negotiating with before. You found a way to
ease a difficult situation and get the other party back in the room. Thank
those who accommodated your needs. Also take some time to appreciate
yourself for creating the circumstances that support your goals and values.
The process of breathing life into a dead negotiation, although difficult, 
may make you a stronger person. Everyone should learn from their mistakes. 
In this situation, you may be learning from others’ mistakes. Lucky you. The
opportunity to conclude a negotiation that has gone seriously off-track 
doesn’t come along that frequently, so take advantage of it.

Cross-Cultural 
and Complex
Negotiations

In this part . . .
E
very negotiation has its nuances, whether it’s the 
culture in which you’re negotiating or the particular
communication style of the person sitting across the table
from you. Sometimes the media sticks its microphone 
or notebook in your face seeking details about a highly
public or extremely complicated deal. Or maybe you can’t
negotiate a particular deal face to face, so you have to rely
on the telephone or Internet. This part helps you tackle
these and other issues and shows you how to apply the
six basic skills for the best outcomes.

f you’re involved in an international negotiation, you must prepare for a
whole host of issues. However, the same six basic skills apply whether
you’re negotiating overseas or here at home: prepare, set your goals and
limits, listen, be clear in all your communications, keep your pause button
handy, and close. What is different is the amount of special preparation that
goes on when you venture outside the comfort of your own culture.
Most people have some advance notice if their business is heading in the direc-
tion of an international negotiation. My business of representing independent
filmmakers often involves international negotiations. I know for sure that I 
will be going annually to the international film market in Berlin, Germany, in
February, in Cannes, France, each May, and in Santa Monica, California, in
November. If you have an inkling that international negotiations are in your
future, start early to gather as much information about the culture, laws, and
business practices of the nationality with whom you are negotiating.
The people who negotiate best in a culture other than their own have usually
had the good fortune to live in that culture for a part of their lives. If they are
really lucky, they were young at the time and could absorb the culture with-
out judgment. If you weren’t fortunate enough to have lived in the same cul-
ture as the person with whom you are negotiating, you have some extra prep
work to do.
It’s one thing to read a briefing paper about a culture that is different from
your own. It’s quite another thing to absorb that culture so you can move
comfortably with its rhythm and its rules. Learning to respect a culture takes
even longer. When you respect the culture and truly understand its people’s
roots, you advance a long way toward effectively dealing with the individuals
within that group. This chapter can be a good starting point for figuring out
what to know about and how to behave in other cultures.

Understanding “Culture” Before 
You Negotiate Across the Globe
Before you prepare to negotiate with someone from another culture, it’s best to
take a closer look at the meaning of culture. Culture is the unique combination
of beliefs, values, customs, and history of a distinct racial, religious or social
group of people. When negotiating across the globe, you need to understand
and respect the cultural divide between you and the person across the table.
Respecting cultural differences
Most people look at a different way of doing things as just plain wrong. On a
charitable day, they may modify their evaluation of the different way to weird.
But that’s about as good as it gets. If you have that reaction when you sit
down to negotiate, you are doomed before you ever get started.
Before you ever sit down to negotiate with someone from another culture,
consider the specific areas in which you two may differ in your approach to
the negotiation. Use these differences to challenge your own assumptions
about the “right” way of doing things and as a chance to learn new ways to
solve problems.
Consider the areas where your way might be different from the person across
the table.
 Time: Americans are in a hurry. They want to get everything done
quickly. Almost all other cultures take more time to get to the close. 
Be prepared for this difference.
 Conflict: Some cultures (China, for instance) are very uncomfortable with
direct confrontations, which can be absolutely devastating to a negotia-
tion between, say, someone from American and someone from China.
 Body language: This is wildly different around the world. Study up on
how people in the other culture use gestures so you don’t inadvertently
insult your opposite number.
 Manners: Another area of wild differences around the world is what 
constitutes good manners, especially at the dinner table. Sharing a meal
is a common part of many extended negotiations, so learn good manners
for the place where you’re negotiating. In Japan, you want to pick up the
soup bowl and make slurping sounds. In China, you want to be sure not
to clean your plate because that indicates you would like more food. In
France, sharing food in a restaurant is deeply frowned upon. These are
just different ways of eating and have nothing to do with right and
wrong, good or bad.
258
Part IV: Conducting Cross-Cultural and Complex Negotiations 

Speaking like a native when you aren’t
Culture is often at the root of communication challenges during a negotiation,
but you can overcome these challenges by understanding how various cul-
tural groups have related to each other. When you are more aware of cultural
differences, as well as cultural similarities, you communicate with others
more effectively.
To prepare for international negotiations, read books about the history, geog-
raphy, customs, and religion of the people with whom you plan to negotiate.
Such specialized knowledge makes your international negotiations much less
frustrating and more fulfilling. If your negotiations take place on your coun-
terpart’s turf, the knowledge you gain in preparing for the negotiation adds
immensely to your enjoyment of any free time you have on the trip.
259
Chapter 16: International Negotiating
Cultural differences in The New World
A good example of respecting cultural differ-
ences is the film The New World. The film strips
away all the lore from the story of Pocahontas
and her tribe and the English settlers at
Jamestown, and instead it imagines how new
and strange these people must have seemed to
one another. If the Indians stare in disbelief at
the English ships, the English are no less awed
by the beauty of the new land and its people.
The film depicts how the two civilizations meet
and communicate when they are utterly
unknown to one another. These people regard
one another in complete novelty. The Indians
live because they submit to the realities of their
land, and the English nearly die because they
are ignorant and arrogant.
The film is loaded with instances where the two
cultures, despite their differences, work together
in 
understanding 
each 
other. 
This 
is
Pocahontas’s (Q’Orianka Kilcher) story. She is
the bridge between the two peoples. When
Pocahontas meets John Smith (Colin Farrell), one
of the English settlers who is under sentence of
death for mutinous grumblings, they teach each
other simple words in their own languages —
words for sky, eyes, and lips. Smith is awed by
her dignity and strangeness. The scene is played
with a tender feeling of discovery.
Another wonderful scene comes later in the film
where Pocahontas, now abandoned by her tribe,
is forced to live with Englishman John Rolfe
(Christian Bale). They return to England, where
she meets the king. Wearing strange clothes and
speaking a strange language, Pocahontas
regally walks into the king’s court. It’s an inter-
esting scene not only because the meeting is
handled with aplomb by both cultures, but also
because the meeting shows two “new worlds”
discovering each other despite their differences
in language and culture.

The sources for your preparation are wide-ranging. Here are just a few:
 Talk to your friends and business associates who have experienced
the culture. Most people enjoy talking about their international travels.
Take folks who understand the culture out for a drink or invite them to a
family barbeque. If you spend some relaxing time with such experienced
friends, you will be more relaxed when you get there.
 Read books on travel, such as the commonly used Frommer’s. These
travel companions offer a wealth of information on a city’s culture,
restaurants, hotels, and attractions.
Some of the best books are not travel books so much as memoirs of
people who have been there. I am thinking of titles such as A Year in
Provence by Peter Mayle and Mr. China: A Memoir by Tim Clissold. Both
provide excellent and fun insight into French and Chinese culture,
respectively.
 Surf the Internet for information on other cultures. Thousands of Web
sites are devoted to international travel and advice about doing busi-
ness almost anywhere in the world.
 Watch movies for a visual example of international locales. Almost
every country has been beautifully photographed for a movie. It is often
a beautiful way to see a city. For example, discover Russia in Reds, China
in The Last Emperor, Vienna, Austria, in Before Sunrise, or Paris in The
DaVinci Code. Foreign films, in particular, provide you with the added
treat of listening to a foreign language while watching a film set in a for-
eign country. Any of the recent films nominated for an Academy Award
in the Best Foreign Language film category are a good starting point.
Here is a short list of titles to look for:
• The Official Story (Argentina)
• Babette’s Feast (Denmark)
• Cinema Paradiso (Italy)
• Antonia’s Line (Netherlands)
• Kolya (Czech Republic)
• Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (Taiwan)
• No Man’s Land (Bosnia)
• Nowhere in Africa (Germany)
• The Sea Inside (Spain)
• Totsi (South Africa)
260
Part IV: Conducting Cross-Cultural and Complex Negotiations 

 Visit a cultural center sponsored by the foreign government or expa-
triates from the country where you plan to travel. Found in larger
cities, these centers tend to have a distinct promotional feel to them,
but they are a good place to start.
 Dine at ethnic restaurants. Chat with the owners and waiters. This can
be a challenge, especially when talking to recent immigrants, but keep at
it. It’s all excellent preparation for your upcoming experience. You often
find out a wealth of information about your counterpart’s country while
learning firsthand about that country’s food.
 Learn a bit of the language. With so many prerecorded programs for
learning a new language, you have no good reason for not knowing how
to say “hello,” “goodbye,” and “how are you.” Citizens of most countries
(France being the infamous exception) appreciate your efforts to be
friendly in their native tongue instead of your own, even if you are a bit
off the mark. The smaller the country, the more appreciative they are.
Try the Lonely Planet series, which makes learning and speaking a new
language easy.
Particularly, spend time acquainting yourself with the nature of foreign gov-
ernment involvement in your transaction. Corporate executives in the United
States complain a great deal about business regulation. Many Americans
think that their own federal, state, and local governments are too involved 
in supervising businesses. Americans often have a tough time with the even
greater involvement of some foreign governments in individual business
deals. Americans are surprised when they see an official — often a high-level
member of a foreign government — right at the negotiating table on many
deals that would be considered purely private in the United States.
261
Chapter 16: International Negotiating
Clear and to-the-point
Harry Truman was so clear with the American
people that he became known as “Give ’em hell,
Harry.” Truman used simple language that every-
one could understand.
Truman was equally clear with the Russians. 
In April 1945, preparing for the Potsdam
Conference, he had his first personal exchange
with Vyacheslav M. Molotov, the Soviet foreign
minister, in Washington. The president used
one-syllable words to convey his view that
Poland had to be free and independent.
“I have never been talked to that way in my life,”
Molotov is reported to have said.
“Carry out your agreements, and you won’t get
talked to that way again,” Truman retorted.
Truman’s blunt style created great successes in
international negotiations.

The more you know about the level of government involvement, the less 
troublesome that involvement will be. You never help your cause by being
judgmental about such things. Life is different in every country in the world.
There is no abstract right or wrong, just different ways of doing things.
Research these variations before you leave so that you can return home 
with more of what you want.
Directing your research to the right 
culture, subculture, or individual
Before you dive into your cultural research, you must first be sure to identify
exactly what culture you are dealing with. I cringe when anyone asks about
negotiating in Asia, as though all of Asia is a single culture. The differences
among Japan, China, and Korea are enormous. You can’t lump them together
if you are going to prepare effectively. The Muslims and Christians who live
side by side in Malaysia have very different values, even though they have a
great deal in common by virtue of being Malaysian.
Various subcultures exist within cultures. The code of cab drivers seems to
be the same all around the world. Rickshaw drivers in the Orient, jitney dri-
vers in Manila, or taxi drivers anywhere all have a penchant for driving the
stranger along the strangest (and longest) route and charging whatever the
traffic will bear. If that happens to you, you are just paying the price for not
preparing. Always be ready to specify a surface route that is direct, cheap,
and pleasant.
As you gather specifics about the culture of the person with whom you plan
to negotiate, don’t forget that you must also prepare information about the
individual with whom you’ll be negotiating. Although a vendor at a roadside
stand may know only her own culture’s traditions, you can expect a highly
experienced international negotiator like Sheik Zaki Yamani, the former oil
minister of Saudi Arabia, to know your style and play to it.
Preparing for a Negotiating Session 
with Someone from Another Culture
In addition to all the standard preparations that precede any negotiation, you
must make some special considerations when you are negotiating with some-
one from another culture. Follow the tips in this section, but don’t shortchange
any of the other steps of preparation just because you are in an international
situation. In fact, a good rule for international settings is: When in doubt, be
polite and considerate according to your own culture.
262
Part IV: Conducting Cross-Cultural and Complex Negotiations 

Gather as much information as you can about a culture before you start a
negotiation with someone from that culture. You gain a real advantage over
the competition. It is naïve to assume that people from other cultures will
negotiate just like you do in the United States.
When you work in a culture other than your own, being sure that you have a
win-win solution takes a little extra effort. During a cross-cultural negotiation,
be thorough in your investigation of what is and isn’t acceptable.
Deciding whom to invite
Knowing whom to invite can be a very delicate matter — get the help of an
expert. Most big-city governments and every state have protocol officers that
can give you some tips. Read culture-specific books because practices vary
all over the world. In different countries, the role of women ranges from
purely secretarial to fully participating members. In some Asian countries,
women participate fully during the business portion of the meeting, and then
the men go out by themselves. If you aren’t sure, you can defer to the lead
negotiator from that culture. In fact, deferring to the lead negotiator from the
other side in such matters can help you build rapport.
Hiring an interpreter
If you think that you and the other party may need an interpreter to commu-
nicate with each other, say so before you start the negotiation. Hiring an
interpreter midstream could appear as a disparaging commentary on the
other party’s ability to be clear, or speak ill of your ability to understand 
what the other party is saying. If you have any doubt about understanding
the other party (and if you can afford it, and if the size of the deal merits the
expense), hire an interpreter early. After all, the other party won’t be insulted
if you later decide that you don’t need the interpreter.
Interpreters work in one of three ways: simultaneously, consecutively, 
and globally.
 Simultaneous translation: Working with simultaneous translators is
expensive, but it’s a heady experience. You feel as though you are at the
United Nations. You have to watch the speaker for the body language
and the facial expressions. For the words — usually delivered in a sort of
monotone — you listen to the translator who is about two beats behind
the speaker. As expensive as simultaneous translation is, the measure
does lend importance to the negotiation.
263
Chapter 16: International Negotiating

 Consecutive translation: Much more common is the consecutive transla-
tor (also called a delayed or sequential translator). This type of translator
listens to a response and then summarizes it for you in your language.
Never hire such a person unless you carefully check references, prefer-
ably with people you know well. You need loyalty, confidentiality, strong
technical skills, and a detachment from what is going on.
 Global translation: This is where the translator listens for a long time
and might even ask the speaker questions to clarify his or her meaning
before translating. When the translator has gathered the information, he
or she passes on the gist of what has been said. So you end up with the
translator’s impression of what the other party was trying to say. You
should avoid this situation. Global translation usually occurs with
unprofessional translators who are brought in because they are friends
or family — and usually free. It is better to spend the money and have
the job done right.
You may opt for the extra expense of a simultaneous translator if you need 
a translator. Having a simultaneous translator impresses the heck out of the
opposing party. One way to hire simultaneous translators is to contact the
local courthouse where such translators are common. You must work around
the courts’ schedules.
If you follow these simple guidelines, your first experience with a translator
should be positive.
 Never hire a translator with the other side. You save money but lose
control. Hire your own translator. He or she can translate both sides 
of the conversation, but that person needs to be on your team.
 Leave plenty of time to brief the translator before the negotiation begins.
Treat the translator like a professional.
 Be alert to the translator’s need for more breaks than you need.
 Never crack jokes for the interpreter to translate.
 Don’t use slang expressions.
 Speak in short sentences and use simple words.
 Never raise your voice.
Be alert to the possibility that the translator may be taking too big a role in
the meeting, sometimes rising to the position of some sort of broker or agent.
The biggest indicator that this may be happening is that the translator and
the other subject will be talking back and forth without including you. This 
is not good.
264
Part IV: Conducting Cross-Cultural and Complex Negotiations 

Usually, the situation can be immediately corrected by just telling the inter-
preter “not to get out in front” or “not to get ahead of you.” You hired this
person. A gentle reminder should do the trick.
A funny example is the film Bottle Rocket. The film is about a guy named
Anthony (Luke Wilson), who upon his release from a hospital after a mental
breakdown, meets up with his friend Dignan (Owen Wilson). Dignan hatches 
a hair-brained scheme for an as-yet unspecified crime spree that somehow
involves his former boss, the (supposedly) legendary Mr. Henry (James
Caan). With the help of their pathetic neighbor and pal Bob, Anthony and
Dignan pull off a job and hit the road, where Anthony finds love with a motel
maid named Inez.
In one scene, a translator is brokering a conversation between Anthony and
Inez — to humorous results. This translator is not a simultaneous translator.
Watch the transition from consecutive translating to global translating. See
this film if you plan to use a translator in your negotiations. You’ll laugh as
you learn.
How quick to the kill?
Be very sensitive about how quickly you turn the meeting from the informal
to the business at hand. Every culture has its subculture, and even within
that, individuals vary. Take the lead from the opposing party. Don’t launch
right into business unless you know that is what is desired. When in doubt,
follow your counterpart’s tempo.
In the United States, people tend to be eager to get down to business and
seem to be in a constant search for the bottom line. In Japan, on the other
hand, this kind of single-minded haste is considered disrespectful. For exam-
ple, jamming someone else’s business card into your pocket without looking
at it may be common in the United States, but is highly offensive in Japan. If
someone from Japan hands you a business card, look at it, read it, take it in,
and then put it respectfully into a safe place such as a wallet or pocket that
doesn’t have a lot of other things in it. Never write on a business card given
to you by someone from Japan.
Think of the films you watched in biology class about the mating ritual of 
certain animals: the gentle but definite dancing, singing, and investigating.
When all the preliminary ceremony is done, the final moments can be quite
brief. I keep this process in mind during negotiations across any cultural 
barrier. When it’s safe to talk about the deal, go right ahead. But don’t rush
the mating process; this ritual serves the valuable function of building com-
fort and trust.
265
Chapter 16: International Negotiating

This analogy has always struck me as particularly apt in the Middle East, where
the early negotiations often start with offers that are not given with any serious
expectation that they will be accepted. Rather, the offers are part of the dance
to see how you react. If you lose your temper during this stage, everything is
over. You lose the deal. Enjoy the dance or don’t come to the party.
If a meal is involved
There is no doubt that you, gentle reader, always remember your manners
when you go out for a meal. But if the meal is with a foreign guest, you may
have to learn new manners. This is especially true if the meal is on foreign
turf. For example,
 In what country do you eat with your hands, but licking your fingers is
rude? Ethiopia
 Where do you eat with your right hand, but never eat with your left
hand? Saudi Arabia
 Where do you insult the cook if you do not slurp your soup? Japan
266
Part IV: Conducting Cross-Cultural and Complex Negotiations 
Passage to India
I once negotiated with a producer from India in
my office. My client was out of patience with
this producer and, in anger, had said that this
would be the last offer. He told me not to waste
any more time. I shared his frustration. When I
reluctantly put in the call to set the meeting, I
had to listen to the producer complain about
how curt my client had been to him. Then he
complained about the last offer. I cut to the
chase and set the meeting. In closing, he com-
plained about how I had never accepted his
invitation to have tea.
As I returned the phone to its cradle, I understood
what he was saying for the first time.
Unfortunately, that is often when inspiration
dawns. In this case, however, it was not too late
to fix a terrible mistake. The producer lived just
outside of Pittsburgh, but he had immigrated to
the United States from India as a young man. He
brought much of his culture with him. Fortunately,
I had traveled in India, including his hometown.
When Amin arrived at my office, we sat on the
sofas in the corner. My assistant brought hot 
tea — steeped, not from a bag. We talked of
many things, but not one word about his film. I
must confess to getting a little antsy when we
hit the half-hour mark. Our time together was
almost up. We had verbally visited India, but we
had not advanced my client’s position — or so I
thought. As if to stir me from my fretful reverie,
Amin said, “You know, Michael, I could accept
the entire deal if it were for one year and not five.”
I was stunned. I took a deep breath, thanked
him, and explained why my client needed five
years. We went back and forth a few times.
Finally, I came up with a contract term based on
gross revenues, and everyone was satisfied.

 Where should you leave a morsel of rice on your plate to show that you
don’t want more food? China
 Where do you pass the fork back and forth between your hands depend-
ing on whether you are cutting or moving food to your mouth? the
United States
The point is that every country has its idiosyncrasies when it comes to
eating. Even different households begin a meal differently, from a prayer to 
a toast to everybody diving in! It never hurts, in such circumstances, to wait
a beat while the host leads the way. Follow the lead of the well-bred native.
Unless, of course, you are in China where the well-bred native will wait for the
honored guest to start the meal. Of course, you would know that in advance
because you would have read up on Chinese rules of etiquette.
Listening Around the World
Communication patterns differ around the world. In some cultures, listening
is more important than in others. The way people listen even varies from one
country to the next. The first rule of international negotiation is to keep in
step with the customs wherever you happen to be.
As soon as you have mastered all the generalities about the country or culture
in which you are about to negotiate, remember the second rule of international
negotiating: It ain’t necessarily so. Generalizations are just that; not everyone
conforms. You are negotiating with an individual, not a nation. The person with
whom you are negotiating may have played football at Duke University after
going to high school elsewhere in the United States. Don’t forget to find out
about the individual as well as the nationality.
If you need to hone your listening skills, flip back to Part II for more specifics
on this topic. You can never listen too much when you are negotiating —
whether at home or abroad.
Listening in Bali
Nowhere in the world do people listen the way they do in Bali. The practice
can be unsettling to visitors to the rural areas of Bali. The natives there stand
quietly and fix the focal point of their gaze at a point just behind your eyes.
You feel as though they are looking into your soul. They don’t exert any pres-
sure upon you to hurry up and finish what you are saying. When you do finish,
there is a slight pause before the other person starts to speak, lest you have
an afterthought.
267
Chapter 16: International Negotiating

I spent a week in a guest house in a village that is not even on the map. The
nearest phone was in the next village. Of all the beautiful sights and sounds
and smells that flooded over me that week, nothing impressed me more than
the way the natives of Bali drink in a person’s words. It is intoxicating.
Listening in America
Americans are decidedly on the other end of the listening spectrum from the
Balinese. Evelyn Waugh, the great English satirist, once noted, “Americans do
not so much listen as they stand around and wait for their turn to talk.”
Waugh’s observation is accurate, but it’s interesting also in that much of
America’s style is inherited from the British Empire. All indications are that
the Brits are not such great listeners either; they are just more polite about it.
Listening in Japan
In Japan, listening is more than ceremonial. Particularly at the early stages of
a negotiation, a great deal of listening takes place. Many writers comment on
the amount of time the Japanese want to spend getting to know you before
they do business with you. That’s true. They want to listen to what you have
to say — about yourself, about other deals you have made, about the people
you admire and why, and about the people you do not admire and why not.
The listening goes on so long that it is ultimately commented on by everyone
who does business in Japan.
If you are negotiating in Japan, you must listen particularly keenly for a no.
The Japanese rarely phrase rejection as bluntly and quickly as do Americans.
A more likely response is something like, “that is difficult.” To an American
accustomed to doing business in America, that phrase means that the door is
wide open. Yankees can do anything with a “that is difficult.” In Japan, the
same phrase means that the door is probably bolted shut.
Speaking to Foreigners
Sometimes, a language barrier can inhibit clear communication. When two
parties are having difficulty understanding one another, the first instinct is to
say the same thing at the same speed . . . only louder . . . and then LOUDER.
This ridiculous escalation never accomplishes anything more than embar-
rassing, or perhaps insulting, the participants.
268
Part IV: Conducting Cross-Cultural and Complex Negotiations 

If you are trying to negotiate with someone who is having trouble understand-
ing you, try the following instead:
 Drop your voice.
 Speak more slowly.
 Find simpler words to express the same idea you were trying to 
communicate. One syllable words are best.
 Don’t ask too many questions. Asking excessive questions puts the
other person on the defensive. You artificially raise concerns about 
communication, clarity, and camaraderie. If someone doesn’t under-
stand your question, that person has to reveal this confusion and 
may feel stupid.
A better way to gauge how well you are being understood is to ask an
occasional well-framed question.
 Engage your hands. Bring your hands to the level of your shoulders.
Keep them out in front and use them to illustrate your points. At the
same time, engage your face and your voice. Be as expressive as possi-
ble and be consistent; that is, make sure that your hands, face, and
words are expressing the same message.
 Be patient.
269
Chapter 16: International Negotiating
Cultural barriers to understanding
A group of native-born Japanese entrepreneurs
who owned businesses in southern California
organized a breakfast meeting, and they wanted
the speaker’s talk to be called “How to Manage
American Employees.” They knew that employ-
ees in the United States approach work differently
than employees in Japan do. The basic difference
is that Americans need to be told clearly what to
do; otherwise, in some employees’ minds, “We
don’t have to do it.” In Japan, high value is placed
on anticipating the superior’s wants and needs.
Being told directly what to do means a loss of
face; it means you were not clever enough to read
the manager’s thoughts and body movements and
anticipate the next need.
After a very traditional Japanese breakfast of
baked salmon and rice in a black lacquered box,
the attendees illustrated the point. As the leader
of the group began rising to his feet to make the
introduction, all 20 men fell silent instantly and
turned attentively to him. Their priorities are
group decorum and group purpose. When a
speaker rises to speak during an American meet-
ing, many are so focused on their individual con-
versations and agendas that the speaker needs
to rap on a glass with a spoon and yell “quiet.”
As this was all explained at the opening of the
speech, the attendees smiled politely; emitting a
little chuckle here and there. They were embar-
rassed for this hypothetical group of “barbaric”
Americans that was being described. They
thought it was quite natural to keep one eye on
the leader in anticipation of the meeting’s next
agenda item. Remember and follow this example
if you ever attend a meeting in Japan.

If you are unable to make yourself understood, apologize and then stop
trying until you can get some help. If your face and hands are fully engaged,
your apology will be understood, even if the words aren’t clear. You can usu-
ally find someone to help you with the communication problem. If you make
the other person feel bad for the communication snafu, no one can help you.
Accept the diversity as a pleasant fact of life.
Observing Body Language
Many expressions of the human body are the same throughout the world.
Facial expressions are especially similar. Smiles are an international greeting.
Laughing is an international expression of happiness. A person in deep thought
anywhere in the world looks like Rodin’s famous sculpture The Thinker. Crying
and anguish are universally understood and look the same on anyone’s face
regardless of race, sex, or national origin. These forms of body language seem
to be a natural part of the human condition.
Other gestures are learned; that is, some gestures are culturally and socially
determined. For instance, during World War II, British cooks working along side
American cooks were surprised to notice the way many Americans cracked
eggs with one hand. The Brits always used two hands to crack open eggs.
Here are some more examples of learned body language:
 In some societies in India, people shake their heads up and down to
mean “no” and from side to side to mean “yes.” In the Western world, 
the opposite is true.
 In Japan, people point to themselves by pressing their index fingers
against their noses. Americans convey the same meaning by pointing 
to their hearts using a finger, thumb, or hand.
 The only men in the world who prop a foot up on their opposite knee are
from America. Non-Americans who see this position for the first time are
taken aback. They are accustomed to men crossing their legs by putting
one knee over the other.
Some elements of body language are even admissible as evidence in the
courts of most states, under certain circumstances. For example, flight can
be considered evidence of guilt. If the courts are paying attention to these
acts, you can’t afford to do less.
The eyes are also an important part of body language. In some cultures, par-
ticularly in the United States, looking someone in the eye suggests honesty.
Other cultures, especially in the Middle East and Asia, see this behavior as
challenging or rude. In countries like the United Kingdom, some eye contact
is required, but too much makes many people uncomfortable.
270
Part IV: Conducting Cross-Cultural and Complex Negotiations 

The rules of body language differ around the world as dramatically as other
social norms. Be sure to acquaint yourself with a country’s gestures, as well
as its spoken language, before you travel too far from home.
See Lost In Translation for a look at observing body language in a negotiation.
The film tells the story of two lost souls, played by Bill Murray and Scarlett
Johansson. The characters meet in a Tokyo hotel and talk about their mar-
riages, their happiness, and the meaning of life. In one very funny scene,
Murray, who plays an actor in the film, arrives on set to film a whiskey 
commercial. The director and his crew are Japanese. Despite the presence 
of a translator, the director motions for Murray to move, position, and talk a
certain way. The translator doesn’t quite translate exactly what the director
wants. Watch how Murray studies the director’s motions, mimicking his
every move. Body language becomes more important in this scene than 
does the spoken word.
Overcoming Unique Issues in
International Negotiations
Besides understanding cultural differences and customs associated with nego-
tiating around the world, you have to be aware of factors that may not affect
your negotiation immediately but could in the future. You may not care today
if the contract is written in English or German, but down the road you don’t
want to be arguing over how something was translated. And if the contract

Respecting personal space when traveling
In a negotiation seminar in Milan, Italy, my
American teaching partner suggested not to
invade the personal space and not to touch the
opposite sex during a negotiation. Hands shot up
all around. The Italians let us know that they do
touch each other, and the custom is considered
acceptable by both sexes — it is not a man’s
domain, and it is not considered sexual harass-
ment by either gender. One woman said that
touching each other was a part of conversing,
and if she told a man not to touch her, she would
highly offend him. A man said dramatically, “It
would be as if she cut off my hand.”
Consider the environment in which you are nego-
tiating and assess the acceptable norms for
touching. Every culture has a traditional bit of
body language to mark the sealing of a deal. Most
commonly, a handshake is used. Sometimes a
hug, a slap on the back, or a “high-five” marks the
event. A physical connection is generally made.
Always — in every part of the world — make eye
contact and show your appreciation. Reinforce
the body language with words of encourage-
ment, support, and optimism. Each side needs to
feel good about the deal.

involves financial considerations, you need everyone to agree upfront to
terms that are fair for the duration of the deal. These topics, as well as the
challenges of negotiating across time zones, are covered in this section.
Choice of language
English has become the language of international commerce to such a great
extent that picking the language of the contract should not be a serious issue in
a negotiation. But be prepared for someone insisting on some other language
for some reason of national pride, especially when negotiating with Americans.
I have seen two parties who speak different languages — neither one of
which is English — agree easily to use the neutral language of English, and
yet these same people will resist the suggestion to draft the contract in
English when they negotiate with Americans. If this happens to you, under-
stand that the issue of national pride probably is at work. I have encountered
it once, and I deflected it by suggesting situations in which a third party, who
did not speak my counterpart’s language, might need to read the contract,
and English would be the only bridge to that party.
Occasionally, a party in a negotiation suggests a dual-language approach:
One copy of the contract appears in English, and one copy is prepared in the
other side’s native language. Try to avoid the dual-language approach to the
written contract. The idea sounds simple enough, but translations are often
so different that disputes can develop over the meaning of the two versions.
Interpretation disputes are common enough without having two languages to
consider. Think of the enormous differences between “may” and “shall.” A
dispute could develop over how a contract was translated as opposed to
what the agreement was.
Currency fluctuations
The value of your dollars goes up and down just like stocks on an exchange,
and the price that your dollar will pay for drachma, or any other currency,
changes frequently.
Imagine that I had a five-year contract to buy widgets from a French manufac-
turer at a fixed price. If the value of the dollar had dropped during the fifth
year of the contract, and the price were expressed in euros, that year would
have been a disaster for me because the very same widgets I had been buying
all along would suddenly cost me a lot more of my hard earned dollars. If the
price were expressed in U.S. dollars, the fifth year of that contract would have
been fine for me but a disaster for the Frenchman who would not have nearly
as many Euros, once he converted my dollars at the new rate. He would have
received money that was considerably less than he had bargained for.
272
Part IV: Conducting Cross-Cultural and Complex Negotiations 

Currency fluctuation is a high-risk element in a contract with a long term to 
it. When negotiating in other parts of the world, keep these currency fluctua-
tions in mind. You need an expert’s help to project what is best for you in any
given situation.
Be sure to think about currency fluctuations before you ever start negotiating.
Time differences
Whether you travel for a face-to-face meeting or use the telephone to commu-
nicate, you have to consider time differences, unless you are lucky enough to
be headquartered in Europe where foreign colleagues are commonly in the
same time zone. But even Europeans may have to communicate with people
in Japan or the United States.
If you are working by phone, fax, or e-mail across time zones, please know
what time it is in the place you are calling, and never, ever get it reversed.
Calling at the wrong hour is not fun for the other party, and it makes you look
stupid if the person on the other end of the line is in bed when you call ready
to talk business. If you aren’t sure exactly what time it is where you are call-
ing, you can always go to Google and type in “international clock.” Then you
can choose from one of the Web sites that allows you to see what time it is in
cities around the world.
When you travel across time zones, always take a moment to plan on ways to
reduce jet lag. The rules are simple:
 Eat light the night before your trip and on the plane.
 Don’t drink alcohol the night before you leave or on the plane.
 Drink plenty of water.
 Time your sleep against the length of time that you will be in the air so
you have a shot of getting your sleeping schedule on track quickly. For
instance, if I fly from New York to London, I take the red-eye and sleep all
the way, so that I arrive able to function, but more importantly, able to
sleep that night. A trickier example is L.A. to Tokyo. I leave Los Angeles
at 11 in the morning and arrive in Tokyo at 4 p.m. the next day. With
almost 12 hours in the air, I am careful not to sleep more than 5 or 6
hours while on the plane, and will try to keep it to even less than 8
hours. That way, I will be sleepy when it is evening in Tokyo. One of the
things that throws people’s systems out of whack is sleeping too much
on the plane.
 Set your watch to the time zone of your destination immediately upon
boarding the plane. The sooner you put your mind into the new time
zone, the sooner your body will follow.

jet lag. I take No Jet Lag, although I can’t say how much it contributes to my
lack of jet lag because I follow the above tips also.
Closing Around the World
The notion of closing a deal varies in different parts of the world. If you aren’t
familiar with the negotiating customs of another culture, your ignorance can
create hard feelings. Most people refuse to acknowledge that any way except
their own way of closing a deal makes sense. This section offers three exam-
ples of closing around the world that demonstrate three very different tradi-
tions of closing. Each one works for the culture that created the particular
closing tradition. When you are negotiating across cultures, be sure that you
understand your counterpart’s tradition of closing.
Good ol’ U.S. of A.
In the United States, closing a deal is a very formal occasion. A handshake 
or some other ceremonial moment ends the discussion. Then come the 
contracts. People in the United States write long contracts in an attempt to
anticipate every possible scenario, setting out each party’s rights, duties, 
and obligations.
In the United States, people close even common sense matters with enough
detail and formality to boggle the mind. Whether this practice is caused by 
or has produced more lawyers per capita here than anywhere else in the
world is a chicken-and-egg discussion. Citizens of the United States and their
lawyers are writing longer and more detailed contracts than anywhere else
on the planet.
A commercial lease for a simple office can run 30 pages and includes obvious
matters, such as the fact that the tenant does not have to pay rent if the land-
lord shuts the building down for a week. The lease also covers exactly what
happens if another tenant is moving in and blocks access for an hour, or if
construction is going on that is inconvenient for the tenants.
In part, such detailed contracts are a response to another feature of life in the
United States that has the rest of the world shaking its collective head — the
rush to sue. Americans face the likelihood of long and expensive litigation over
just about any issue. Most of these lawsuits can be initiated without risk to the
plaintiff. A new crop of contingent-fee lawyers hits the streets each year. When
an attorney renders services on a contingency fee basis, that means that the
attorney is not billing the client at an hourly rate. Instead, the attorney will take
274
Part IV: Conducting Cross-Cultural and Complex Negotiations 

a percentage of the amount the court awards to the client — the plaintiff — if
and when the case is won. Because filing a lawsuit on this basis means the
plaintiff has nothing to lose, you are probably better off not leaving the inter-
pretation of any legal point to goodwill or common sense if you want to avoid
future court battles.
In the United States, the rules are very strict for changing the deal after a 
contract is signed. You need to change written contracts in writing. You must
carry out oral modifications before they are binding.
Middle East
Across the spectrum from the United States is the tradition of the desert. The
spoken word and the handshake are the centuries-old traditions of the Middle
East. You make a deal in principle, and people start to carry out the terms of
the agreement. Changed circumstances allow for further discussions.
To an American, this custom can be very upsetting. The American thinks that
the deal has closed; the Arab thinks that the parties can revisit the deal if cir-
cumstances change or new information is acquired.
In the Middle East, almost any change in circumstances justifies looking again
at a deal. Think of the caravans, and you may understand better. A deal is
made for a caravan leader to provide a specific number of carpets to a buyer.
The caravan leader goes to the source of the carpets, buys them, and trans-
ports them back. But one of the camels died on the way, and the carpets cost
more than the caravan leader originally anticipated, so the price is subject 
to renegotiation. An American becomes irate. A fellow Arab engages in yet
another negotiation based on the changed circumstances. Not all the terms
are open for discussion; a basic price was already decided. Now the negotia-
tion is over the adjustment.
Japan
Closings in Japan are somewhere in between Arab and American tradition.
The Japanese have a history of negotiating written contracts containing the
basic terms of a deal, but their contracts are not as detailed as in the United
States. Room exists for the relationship of the parties to provide for adjust-
ments as circumstances change.
Because the Japanese leave room for adjustment to the events that occur
after a contract is signed, getting to know someone before talking business 
is important to the Japanese. In the United States, the relationship between
negotiators is less important because the contract as written at the time of
closing is final.

Making a culture’s customs work for you
When I sold my last house, the real estate agent
wanted to market the house directly to the Arab
community because of the growing influx of
Arabs into our particular neighborhood. I knew
of the custom in the Middle East to adjust agree-
ments as new facts surfaced. I also was well
aware of the new American custom of using a
home inspection service to look over a house for
any problem areas. Mine was a great little house,
but it was old. I figured that after the home
inspection, the buyer would want to reopen
negotiations — which I didn’t want to do.
When my real estate agent brought me a quick
offer from a Middle Eastern buyer, I used a tech-
nique that would be helpful in any negotiation. I
thought it would be particularly useful in avoid-
ing a renegotiation of the price. I obtained a
back-up offer. That is, I accepted the original
offer, provided that title transferred within 45
days. If the closing didn’t occur on or before this
date, the house would go to the back-up buyer,
as opposed to extending the deadline as usually
happens. To the back-up buyer, I provided a
document stating that by accepting a deposit —
to be returned if he didn’t buy the house — I
was bound to sell the house to him if the first
buyer failed to complete the title transfer within
the specified time.
As soon as the buyer received the inspection
report with its inevitable observations, he
wanted to renegotiate. This was not upsetting
to me because I expected it. This custom was
part of the cultural tradition of the people I had
chosen to sell to. I felt really good when my
technique of having a back-up worked, and I
didn’t have to make a major concession at that
point. He was unhappy and felt a bit cheated by
my hard-line unwillingness to reconsider the
terms of the agreement. He was used to a cer-
tain custom. Fortunately for me, I was experi-
enced in those customs, so I was able to come
up with a plan that helped me avoid the parts
that didn’t serve my interests.
He was finally able to make up his loss on the
eve of the day escrow was to close. There was
a minor, last-minute problem with the termite
report. I did not have enough time to fix the
problem before close of escrow, so I had to
make a generous settlement on that point. I felt
that I had some room to bargain from the previ-
ous round, and the buyer felt that he had made
up some of the ground he lost, so we were both
happy. Knowing the traditions of both of our cul-
tures really helped to avoid a major cultural
clash. The more you know about where the
other party is coming from, the easier it is to get
where you want to go.

I
t’s a fact: Men and women are different. Biology is not the only thing that
distinguishes the sexes. We are very different beings socially, which influ-
ences the way we communicate. These differences sometimes impact a nego-
tiation and can louse up the common goal of coming together and sealing the
deal. This chapter explores the differences in communication styles between
the sexes and offers strategies to help men and women listen to each other.
Conversing Between the Sexes
I always take a break in negotiating seminars to present material on the differ-
ent ways in which men and women communicate. (Obviously, lots of excep-
tions exist for any broad generalization.) Don’t theorize about whether these
differences result from culture, environment, social pressures, or the power
structure. Leave that deep thinking for the academics. Just focus on the
basics of how men and women communicate and what you as an individual
can do to get more of what you want in life — including better negotiations
with those you love and labor with.
As you read about the differences in how men and women communicate,
don’t forget that we live in a time and place that spawns a lot of examination
of these differences. All men and all women are not conditioned to speak and
listen the same way. Managers and employees, husbands and wives, and
friends are all trying to bridge the gaps that exist. You need to assess each
individual’s level of comfort as you follow the tips in this section.

Bridging the gap
Men and women are as different as fingerprints. And although I hate to 
generalize, some generalizations are both appropriate and necessary.
 Men think in linear terms, going from A to B to C to D, and then, if you’re
lucky, begin to expand from there. Men love logic and want a rational
explanation for any solution that is offered.
 Women start with the big picture and then focus in on the details. They
tend to be much more confident of their intuition.
Although these generalizations may not apply to you in particular, you need
to be aware of how differently most men and women communicate at work.
Men use a lot fewer words to express an idea and use a lot fewer words
during the course of the day than women.
Certainly the same differences apply outside of the office as well, but the 
distinctions are often more pronounced at work where women are asked to 
fit into what is often a male-dominated environment and where people are
typically less tolerant of the female communication styles.
Tips for women
Here are three tips for women when listening to men:
 Don’t talk when he’s talking. Many women think that because they are
marrying their “best friend,” they can talk to their husbands the same
way that they talk with their best friend. As their husbands talk to them,

The times are a changin’
It used to be that women read material about
communicating with men in the workplace with
a vengeance. They were entering the workforce
with new intention and higher ambition. They
were going to break the glass ceiling and
achieve their success. As a result, their role in
the economy started to change. Women became
the fastest growing segment of the small-busi-
ness sector of the economy. Today, according to
the Center for Women’s Business Research,
nearly half (48 percent) of all privately held U.S.
businesses are 50 percent or more women-
owned. This means that 10.6 million firms are at
least half owned by a woman or women. The
report also notes that 1 in 11 women is an entre-
preneur and that women-owned businesses are
just as financially strong and creditworthy as the
average U.S. firm. Times definitely have changed,
and now men are paying much more attention to
how they talk to, listen to, and treat women. They
have to. Their future depends on it.

they interject comments. Usually, the husbands abruptly stop talking.
The women, confused by this response, ask what’s the matter, and the
husbands accuse them of interrupting.
The women don’t think that they’re interrupting; they think that they’re
adding. Women allow each other to add to each other’s sentences.
However, most men need a space in which to enter a conversation, and
they want to keep their space until they’re finished talking.
Listen silently instead of vocalizing little affirmations such as “uh-huh,”
“oh, yes,” and “wow, yeah.” Women use these phrases to encourage the
speaker to keep talking. A female speaker interprets these comments the
way they are intended. A male speaker may view them as an interruption.
Another problem is that sometimes when you verbalize such affirma-
tions, a man thinks that you are agreeing with the content of what he is
saying, rather than letting him know that you understand what he means.
 Believe what he is saying. Women often say, “He said this, but here’s
what I think he meant.” Many women believe men speak on many levels,
and they try to find hidden meanings. Men usually say what they mean
and mean what they say. They don’t spend two minutes of their time
calling another guy to say, “Here’s what she said at breakfast this morn-
ing. What do you think she meant?”
 Be patient. A man’s pace may be different from yours. He may talk more
slowly or pause more often than you do. Let his thoughts flow. Don’t
speak during his pauses.
Tips for men
Here are three tips for men when listening to women:
 Listen to her all the way through. Sometimes, women talk to process
information or to figure out what they want to do, instead of thinking in
silence and then stating a conclusion. If you sense that this is the reason
for a woman’s conversation, just let her thoughts progress. Don’t rush
her. You will interrupt her thought-process and make her feel slighted.
Let it flow. Or as the saying goes, “Go with the flow.”
 Give her your full attention. Don’t just mute the TV; turn it off. Don’t just
look up from the sports page; put the newspaper down. Turn to her. Look
her in the eye. This response shows you care about what she is saying.
 Be patient. A woman’s pace may be different from yours. She may want
to cover more subjects in the same conversation than you do or tell you
more about a subject than you want to hear. Remember that men and
women communicate differently. Make an effort to accommodate those
differences.
279
Chapter 17: Negotiating with the Opposite Sex

Two excellent films that exemplify the differences in communication between
the sexes are Richard Linklater’s Before Sunrise and its sequel, Before Sunset.
Before Sunrise follows an American tourist, played by Ethan Hawke, who
meets a French woman, played by Julie Delpy, in Vienna, Austria. They
wander the city, conversing about parents, life and death, former lovers, and
music. In the process, the two fall in love, but decide to go their separate
ways by the end of the film. In Before Sunset, we see the pair reunited nine
years later, this time wandering through Paris in one of those rare sequels
that is better than the original film. Their characters are older and wiser,
their conversations deeper with meaning. Their love comes full circle, but by
the end of the film, the status of their union is left for the viewer to decide.
Watch these films and notice how the characters follow many of the tips
listed above. Pay particular notice to their verbal and nonverbal cues. Their
love develops because they are good listeners. In a negotiation, good commu-
nication between the sexes produces the same great results.
Four Strategies for Women Who 
Want Men to Hear Them
Because of antiquated social pressure to be “good girls” and “little ladies,”
women get the message that being confrontational isn’t acceptable. Often in a
negotiation, women hear their inner voice say “speak up,” but many squelch
these messages because of upbringing and the early lessons discouraging
complaint. Women have been socialized to avoid verbal confrontation more
than men and to speak more politely.
Everyone encounters these basic differences between men and women. Even
if you think you don’t fit the typical mold for your gender, you will negotiate
with men and women who do.
The following sections contain four strategies for women who want men to
hear them. If you practice one of these strategies each week, you’ll quickly
alter the way others perceive you. The prerequisite is to start listening to
yourself. Awareness is the first step to any behavioral change. Accept and
grow, or be left in the dust in this hardball world of negotiating. These strate-
gies are based on making yourself heard in present-day negotiations, in which
the successful role model has been, up to now, a no-nonsense, concise leader.
280
Part IV: Conducting Cross-Cultural and Complex Negotiations 

Strategy 1: Avoid apologies
Women tend to apologize more than men. Even assertive women sometimes
unwittingly use power-robbing devices in their speech. The words avoid cer-
tainties; hence, the speaker avoids risks. If you have something to say, don’t
apologize for saying it. Here are the specific devices under the general banner
of apologies:
Prefacing and tagging
Prefacing and tagging refer to those little extra words before and after a 
statement:
 Prefacing: Leading into a statement with a phrase that weakens it. 
For example, “I’m not sure about this, but . . .”
 Tagging: Adding a qualifying phrase at the end of a statement. For 
example, “We should take action, don’t you think?” “Don’t you think”
and “Am I right?” are common tags that weaken a statement.
Questioning tone
A questioning tone is an intonation that goes up a little at the end of a 
sentence. This tone takes the power right out of an otherwise declarative
sentence. To the listener, the speaker sounds like she is unsure and lacks 
self-confidence. What the tone communicates is, “Don’t you agree?” Or
worse: “Please agree quickly, so I know that what I just said has value.”
If you don’t have confidence in what you say, how can you expect anybody
else to have faith in you? Listen to yourself or ask a trusted friend. If you find
that you have this damaging habit, start practicing today to get rid of it. It will
take time. It will take effort. But it will add power to every conversation you
have. Remember, awareness is the first step to behavioral change, and you
are now aware.
Hedges or qualifiers
Some women tend to use many little words such as “kind of” and “sort of.”
These phrases are called hedges or qualifiers, and they steal power from
women’s statements. If you use these phrases, it is usually just a habit. You can
break this habit and bring more power into your speech right now by listening
to yourself and eliminating such phrases from your speech. A few examples are:
 “I kind of think that . . .”
 “We probably should really . . .”
 “It seems like a fairly good way to . . .”
 “I sort of want . . .”
 “You maybe need to . . .”
281
Chapter 17: Negotiating with the Opposite Sex

These phrases don’t just contain extra words, they contain unsure words.
Unsure words are weak words. Using these weak words makes you seem weak.
Perhaps you developed these speech patterns to cover your rear end. They
are non-risk-taking and may indicate that you’re reluctant to state issues
definitively. Beware of sounding indecisive and hesitant when you want to
convey certainty. You don’t need to banish these words from your repertoire
because you can use these words when you want to hedge your bets. The
point is to have a repertoire and be able to choose the right words to achieve
your goals.
Nonwords
Nonwords are all those little extras that get plugged into speech — those
words or sounds that replace silence and give you a pause to pull together
your next thought. Nonwords show up in the darndest places, and they
always slow down or divert an otherwise fine presentation. Here are just a
few examples:
 Really: As in, “Really, I really want this to go forward.”
 Like: As in, “Do you want this to go, like, forward?”
 Um: As in, “ummmmm,” or “uhhhhhh”
Use the silence to give power to your statements and opinions. Practice the
power of the pause in your very next negotiation. You don’t have to fill every
second with some audible sound.
Strategy 2: Be brief
Men don’t use a lot of words. Observe how men go to lunch when they’re on
break in a seminar. One guy turns to the other and says, “Lunch?” The other
guy says, “Sure.” That’s it. No wasted words. They don’t say, “Wanna go to
lunch?” “Yeah, it sounds like a great idea. Where shall we go?” “I don’t know —
where shall we go?” No. “Lunch?” “Sure.”
Women generally use more details in their conversations than men. The infor-
mation you want the male listener to hear may be lost in all those details.
During a negotiation, watch for signs that a male listener is glazing over and
cut down on the number of words immediately. In fact, tell men right at the
start how long the story will take and stay within the allotted time. Men feel
they are responsible for the energy they allot to a certain activity. So they feel
they need to “set their energy clocks” so they don’t run out of energy.
Running out of energy makes them feel out of control — a feeling they hate.
282
Part IV: Conducting Cross-Cultural and Complex Negotiations 

It has long been known that women use more words than men. Early studies
showed that women use an average of 25,000 words in a typical day. Men use
about 15,000 words in the same day. The problem is that by the time men come
home from work, they’ve used all 15,000 up. Many women haven’t even started
on their 25,000 because they have had to be concise all day. This difference in
word count between the sexes continues to be confirmed today, decades after
the original studies. Some researchers claim an even greater spread.
Women use talk to build relationships, so they tell stories. Men use talk to
exchange information, so they swap facts. They bond through competitive
mind games with their knowledge banks. They test each other with ques-
tions. “Who pitched the last game of the World Series in 1954?” one may ask.
If the other guy knows, he gets a point. And if he doesn’t, that’s fine, too,
because now the other guy is one up. And then the other guy will have to get
him back. That’s how men bond.
Women don’t bond through test questions. In fact, if a woman asks another
woman who pitched the last game of the World Series in 1954, the listener
may extend both arms and say, “Do you need a hug?” And she probably
would because that behavior isn’t normal for most women.
Women bond through stories. You walk up to a woman you hardly know and
say, “Gee, I love that pin. It’s beautiful.” She says, “Thank you,” and proceeds
to tell you the story behind the pin, because there is one. Women have a
story for everything. You find something in her story you can relate to and
tell her a story back. If you have enough stories in common, you will bond.
Most men view this as chatter — exhausting chatter. Such conversation is
certainly not a good way to start a negotiation with a man. Men may arm
wrestle to build a relationship. Women talk to build a relationship.
Take a look at the classic feminist film Thelma & Louise. The film, starring Geena
Davis as Thelma and Susan Sarandon as Louise, is about two women on the run
from the law. Louise is the reserved, more “conservative” of the two. Thelma, on
the other hand, is friendly, flirtatious, and loquacious. She loves to tell stories.
Her lack of brevity gets the two women into trouble. At a bar, Thelma charms
her way into the arms of a man who later attempts to rape her. Louise murders
the man, and the women flee from the scene, becoming fugitives.
Strategy 3: Be direct; don’t hint
Make sure that you are direct — even to the point of spelling something out.
Men, more so than women, require clear messages as well as brief ones.
Hinting around for what you want frequently stems from a fear of rejection. If
you ask directly, you will more likely than not be answered directly with a flat
“yes” or “no.” In a personal relationship, that may be hurtful. In the workplace,
that is a good thing. If the answer is “no,” you can either drop it or begin plot-
ting on how to get what you want from some other person (without ruining
your relationship with the first person you asked).

Strategy 4: Avoid emotional displays
Crying or other emotional displays in a negotiation can be more distracting
than a low-cut dress, and an outburst can be just as ruinous to a woman’s
position in a negotiation. Men have been socialized to be less emotionally
demonstrative. In fact, men have probably gone too far in the other direction,
but that’s another discussion. Women have not been socialized in the same
way as men. In fact, women cry four times more frequently than men, accord-
ing to a Minnesota-based study.
The place to start curtailing emotional displays is on the job. The crying
person seems to demand a sympathetic response from the listener. Someone
who is sobbing also signals to the listener and observers that — for the

Hinting is futile
Men and women are different regarding hinting.
Don’t give men hints. A woman may give a man
big hints over and over, such as, “I love flow-
ers.” When no flowers arrive, she will give him
bigger hints, such as (upon seeing someone
give another person flowers) saying to him, “Oh
look. I love flowers.” She waits, and no flowers
arrive. Finally, she decides to be direct.
“Honey,” she says one day, “Do you know what
I would really love you to do?”
He looks up attentively. That is a focusing state-
ment. It gives him hope that the next thing out of
her mouth will be specific. “What?” he asks.
She says, “I would love you to bring me flowers
sometime, when I least expect it, like on my
birthday.”
He gets the message. She can tell! It clicks. She
gets gorgeous flowers on her birthday. She is so
happy. Her women friends are livid. “You had to
tell him,” they say. “It’s not romantic,” they say.
“He should have known,” they say.
“Right!” she answers back, “but the flowers are
romantic.” On the one hand, you can say, “He
should have known.” On the other hand, you
can have flowers. Go for the flowers. You will be
glad you did.
When she debriefs him on this incident, she
may say, “What were you thinking for two years
when I said I loved flowers?” And he loves that
question; it’s analytical. He says, “I remember I
had a warm feeling, because it was so feminine;
and I also thought you should probably plant
some.” “I love flowers” means “I love flowers”
to men. They don’t search for hidden meanings.
They listen literally.
And it all has to do with the definition of
romance. Here is romance for women: “He read
my mind. He knew what I wanted before I asked
for it.” You know what that response means for
men? Work. Hard, energy-draining, hit-or-miss
work. If they are wrong, they hate it. They lose
face. Here is romance for a man: A woman tells
him exactly what she wants. He gets it for her.
She rewards him profusely. That’s romance for
a man.

moment at least — this person is not capable of handling a situation. Crying
also annoys and angers people who have shut off their own feelings. If they
don’t want to deal with their own feelings, they certainly don’t want to deal
with anyone else’s. Men may feel a woman who cries is being manipulative.
If you feel a cry coming on, excuse yourself, go to the bathroom, and cry your
eyes out. When you’re finished, check your makeup, take a deep breath, and
go back to the meeting. If you are prone to crying, work on reducing this
behavior. Learn to take a deep breath to calm yourself down, or carry some
chamomile teabags with you so you can create a soothing concoction with-
out drawing attention to yourself.
Again, using the film Thelma & Louise as an example, watch the scene where
Louise talks to Harvey Keitel’s cop character, Hal, over the phone. He attempts
to negotiate with her to stop running from the law in exchange for a less severe
penalty when arrested. He talks to her of her past, sharing with her his knowl-
edge that she was once a rape victim. Louise gets choked up in the scene, but
she suppresses her emotions and doesn’t cry. She remains strong and avoids
an emotional display. She reneges on Hal’s offer. She is brief and direct in the
scene, sealing her fate for the final, glorious act of the film where Thelma and
Louise have grown to the point where they are too big for the world. In the
words of the film’s writer, Callie Khouri, “They, literally, run out of the world.”
Four Strategies for Men Who 
Want Women to Hear Them
Some speech mannerisms, common among men, are so off-putting to women
that they rob men of the opportunity to be heard no matter how valuable the
words are. This concept is not just theory. Because women have become a
major force in the workplace, men need to alter their style to communicate 
successfully with women. Everyone is somewhat susceptible to these basic dif-
ferences. Some people are more likely to be tripped up, some people less. A rare
few are not at all. But even for those few, the differences are not irrelevant —
because they negotiate with men and women who do communicate differently.
The following sections contain four strategies for men who want women 
to hear them. If you can practice one of these strategies each week, you’ll
quickly improve the way others perceive you. The prerequisite is to start 
listening to yourself. Awareness is the first step to any behavioral change. It
isn’t right or wrong — it’s just true. Accept and grow or be left in the dust in
this ever-changing world of negotiating.
285
Chapter 17: Negotiating with the Opposite Sex

Strategy 1: Don’t be condescending
Don’t refer to someone as “honey,” “baby,” “sweetie,” or with other mala-
propisms. It’s the 21st century! That any American male can still be using
words such as these to address women in the workplace is shocking.
For a man to use these phrases when talking to a co-worker is inappropriate
because they say to a woman that you don’t see her as a valuable team
member, a contributing co-worker, or an important team member. You see her
in her personal role, just as you would a woman you were trying to pick up at
happy hour. Those terms may not work at happy hour either, but at least you
haven’t screwed up the workplace, stopped production, and created hostility.
You have just made a fool of yourself.
Men who fail to fully appreciate the contributions of their fellow workers
because they’re women instead of men stunt their own growth within a com-
pany. You cannot move up the old ladder of success without the uncompro-
mising support of everybody on your team. The receptionist can kill your
chances of promotion just as fast as your boss. Just imagine where you
would be if the receptionist didn’t deliver your messages when something is
urgent, or if she decided to report to your client that you are spending yet
another lunch hour with one his competitors.
Respect everyone you work with if you want them to respect you and do
their best for you. When your words flow from a place of respect, they don’t
contain such verbal pats on the head.
Strategy 2: Share before deciding
Sharing doesn’t come naturally to most men. They have been socialized in
the “strong, silent” stereotype. They must have everything figured out before
they say anything about a subject. If you’re negotiating with a woman, she
may want to know your thoughts partway through the process. The natural
way for a man to express his conclusions is at the very end of the process —
to announce his decision after he makes it.
If you are totally silent during the decision-making process, a woman may
think you are shut down. It may be hard for her to stay interested, and she
may become frustrated with the lack of feedback. Women love it when men
“open up to them.”
286
Part IV: Conducting Cross-Cultural and Complex Negotiations 

Strategy 3: Share something personal
This is not a suggestion to be intrusive or sexual. This approach is essentially
humanizing. Share stories of humankind with the woman on the other side of
the negotiating table. This approach may not seem natural for you at first.
Mention something about your family or what you did over the weekend. The
topic doesn’t have to relate to the negotiation. Provide some of the detail.
Most women love details.
Studies show that one of women’s biggest frustrations with men is their 
failure to open up. Nothing shows openness better than sharing something
about your family, background, or personal history with a woman.
Men are better off making personal comments about their own life, not about a
woman’s personal life and certainly not about a woman’s appearance. Because
of the history of sexual harassment in this country, men do not have the same
freedom that a woman has to comment on the clothing of the opposite sex. Not
fair, but true. If a man thinks a dress is attractive, he should keep that to him-
self or say only, “I like it because . . .”
If he likes an item that is personal, but not quite as personal as a dress, a man
can go ahead and comment on it. A beautiful fountain pen or an attractive
briefcase are particularly safe areas for compliments. Dresses and perfumes
are dangerous. Necklaces and necklines are absolutely verboten to mention in
the workplace environment today. The smart advice is “When in doubt, don’t.”
These suggestions are inhibiting and impose a somewhat artificial restraint in
today’s American workplace. They err on the side of causation. I have been
surprised and disappointed in the various ways that people can be sensitive
to remarks that come from a place of innocence, or perhaps an awkward
effort to reach out, but hurtful to the recipient nevertheless. Exercise great
care when you wander into a personal conversation with a co-worker of the
opposite sex, especially if that person is junior to you in salary, position, or
function.
The quiet opening of the two men in Ang Lee’s Brokeback Mountain is why
women loved the picture so much. Heath Ledger’s Ennis and Jake Gyllenhaal’s
Jack redefined the word taciturn. Ennis mumbled monosyllabically into his
chest to the point that the audience had a hard time understanding what he
said. Slowly he opened up to Jack. This Western, nominated for more awards
than any other movie in 2005, may not be for every man who is reading this
book, but marketing studies showed that women loved it. Women appreciated
how these guys finally opened up to each other.
287
Chapter 17: Negotiating with the Opposite Sex

Strategy 4: Avoid emotional displays
Yelling and other emotional displays in a negotiation can be more distracting
than a wrecking ball through the wall of the negotiating room. Such behavior
can ruin a man’s position in a negotiation. Men have been socialized to be
less demonstrative with all of their emotions except anger. Many men still
think yelling when they are frustrated or angry is acceptable behavior. In 
fact, men yell much more frequently than women in the office, according to 
a recent study. Not surprising?
Every Coen brothers (Joel and Ethan) film contains the stereotypical
“screamer,” usually sitting behind a big desk. In Blood Simple, the man 
behind the desk is M. Emmet Walsh, as a scheming, cowboy hat–wearing 
private detective. In Miller’s Crossing, it is Albert Finney’s over-the-top Irish
mob boss. In Barton Fink, it is Michael Lerner as a screaming, vituperative
Hollywood executive. Watch the men in these films. Are these characters 
fictional? Of course, although I bet you have encountered a screamer in 
your career. These characters show up in these films because they are
stereotypical, not because they are idiosyncratic.
288
Part IV: Conducting Cross-Cultural and Complex Negotiations 
Finding common ground
In business, when I am in a conversation with a
woman, I will sometimes let her know that I was
a single parent to my three daughters. Working
mothers usually love to know that. We exchange
stories about the perils and joys of raising
teenagers because most women with whom I
negotiate these days have teenagers or children
who will soon be teens.
I only share this information at appropriate times.
Forcing these asides into a conversation is haz-
ardous. When it is appropriate to do so, I find it
easy, even though I would not have shared such
single parenting stories at all before I met Mimi
Schwied. She was a dynamic keynote speaker
whom I dated and later married.
Mimi’s most successful speech was and is Men
and Women: Can We Talk. It is a hilarious and
instructive 45 minutes. She points out how
important stories are to women. She teaches
men to share personal stories with the women
in their business lives. In fact, most of the tips
and the strategies in this chapter come right out
of Mimi’s speech. She wrote the first draft of this
chapter in the 1990s for the first edition of this
book, and the words are still valid today. Times
may be changing, but people don’t change
much. Your grandchildren will be able to use the
tips in this chapter when they move into the
workplace.

The place to start curtailing this behavior is on the job. The person who yells
seems to demand a sympathetic response from the listener. He sends signals
to the listener and observers that — for the moment at least — he isn’t 
capable of handling a situation. Yelling also creates shame and resentment 
in those subjected to the outburst. If they are not able to yell back, they will
get even in other ways. Men and women feel that a man who yells is being
dominating and controlling.
If you feel a yell coming on, excuse yourself, get away from people, and yell
your lungs out. When you’re finished, splash some water on your face, take a
deep breath, and go back to the meeting.
A man who yells is perceived as a flawed individual. Many people know that
anger is a cover for fear or sadness, and hostility can mask vulnerability.
Most screamers continue their shouting down the chain of command. They
have real trouble shouting up the chain of command.
If you’re a screamer, you probably have learned how not to scream at those
above you or to a client. Note how you restrained yourself. Remember what-
ever technique you use to modify your instinct to yell up the chain of com-
mand, and use the same technique to keep yourself from yelling at those
below you on the chain of command.
Women and men can learn from each other. Respect the differences and alter
your style to be heard. You can be the world’s best negotiator, but if your
words are not heard, your message doesn’t matter. Nothing will keep you
from being heard like raising your voice in anger.
289
Chapter 17: Negotiating with the Opposite Sex
The truth at last
Over the years, during my seminars and lec-
tures, I’ve told women not to believe the myth
that “men are good losers.” Men claim they are.
They made up the phrase, “It’s not whether you
win or lose; it’s how you play the game.” That
principle hangs over every Olympic game and
is, allegedly, an American ideal.
Don’t believe it. Even at the Olympics, gracious
losing is not in vogue. Winning is the only goal
worth pursuing. Defeat causes men to lose face,
and they hate that most of all.
When you negotiate with anybody, but espe-
cially with men, the closing is the time to empha-
size what both parties are gaining — not what
they’re losing.

Negotiating with Your Spouse, Your Boss,
or Your Most Important Customer
At first glance, this may seem like an odd grouping of people to consider in
the same section. In reality, a negotiation with a spouse has a lot in common
with a negotiation with a really good customer or your boss. They are all
long-term relationships. In most situations, it is more important to maintain
the relationship than it is to win any small point. To put it another way, the
emotional and financial stakes are significantly higher in such negotiations
than they are in a negotiation with someone you are not likely to see again.
How negotiations within long-term 
relationships are different
Here are several significant ways that negotiating in the context of a valued
long-term relationship is different from negotiating a one-time agreement.
 You know this person very well. You know this person’s hot buttons,
and they know yours. When something is very important or when you
become really frustrated that you haven’t made any progress on a cer-
tain point, the urge to press one of those hot buttons seems overwhelm-
ing. Often, most people are much better at stifling those urges in the
workplace than they are at home. Not always, that’s for sure. But gener-
ally speaking, folks find it easier to control themselves at the office than
at home. In fact, exercising that control at the office sometimes triggers
an explosion at home. Sad, but true.
 You can’t just walk away from the situation. Negotiating within a long-
term relationship isn’t like buying a used car. If you don’t get what you
want, you can’t just walk down the street and talk to someone else. You
have to either find a solution or swallow hard — very, very hard. The
good part of the equation is that the same is generally true on the other
side also. Both parties are facing a disruptive, expensive, sad period if
they don’t find a solution that somehow works for both of them, even if
they have to agree to an interim solution while finding a better solution
for the long haul.
 You have baggage — life baggage. If your spouse, long-time customer,
or boss turns a phrase that reminds you of one of your parents, all of a
sudden you two can end up in a heated discussion over a bit of non-
sense. You’re no longer reacting to the other person; you’re reacting to a
memory from your childhood that was triggered by some word, posture,
or tone. This is a sad twist. The p eople who are closest to us are the
most capable of an inadvertent hurt just because they are important to
290
Part IV: Conducting Cross-Cultural and Complex Negotiations 

us. The casual negotiation with someone we don’t have to deal with
again doesn’t usually trigger any childhood flashbacks.
 They have baggage — life baggage. You can trigger a much stronger reac-
tion from someone with whom you have a long-term relationship than if
someone he or she didn’t know so well said the exact same words under
the same circumstances. If you see this happening, back off. Understand
that the person isn’t reacting to you or what you said. He or she is reacting
to old hurts, past history, early fears. Don’t fight it. Don’t try to correct it.
Don’t insist on being “right.” Let it pass, and then apologize for upsetting
him or her. You don’t have to apologize for your words but rather, for the
effect those words had on the listener.
Given these special circumstances, how do you keep your cool in an impor-
tant negotiation where there is a big difference between what you want and
what your boss or valued customer wants? Start with an agreement that
everything is negotiable, and that you will work things out. Start by develop-
ing some rules for fair fighting. This is called negotiating.
Tips for negotiating in 
long-term relationships
Develop your own set of rules for how to process your differences. On the
job, this may be difficult, but within the family these rules are essential. You
can draw from your workplace experience when you are at home, and you
can draw from your home life when you are at the office.
 Set a time to talk about your differences. It is common at home to say,
“Not after 10 p.m.” or “Not right when I walk through the door.” At work,
you want to set a time to talk through anything that may escalate. If you
know your boss feels strongly about something and you also feel
strongly about it, set aside a specific time to deal with it.
 Temporarily walk away. Take an announced time out when things 
get sticky.
 Resist the urge to make the other person wrong by quoting outside
experts. If you believe in your position, support it with primary data, 
not an arsenal of experts.
 Don’t be afraid to visit a counselor. This tip is very California.
California has a higher density of psychologists, psychiatrists, family
counselors, therapy groups, seminars, and support groups than any-
where in the country. “Sharing” has become a cottage industry in Los
Angeles. Still, a professional person can help guide a couple or an office
group into calm seas and give you tools you can use to navigate when
the waters get rough. A good counselor can help you build your own
style for resolving conflict.
291
Chapter 17: Negotiating with the Opposite Sex

 Find something to laugh about afterward. This suggestion is tough if it
doesn’t come naturally, but the results are worth the effort. If you can’t
see how ridiculous most of your arguments are, you are destined to con-
tinue having them forever.
 Speak up about the things that bother you before they build up to the
point at which you are a walking volcano. This is especially important in
the working world. An open and honest relationship between employee
and employer is important to maintain a productive work environment.
You must talk out such issues as pay, working hours, performance likes
and dislikes before the situation becomes severe. With loved ones, people
often wimp out of asking for what they want because they don’t want of an
emotional confrontation — usually an imagined emotional confrontation.
“Things are fine right now,” you think, so you let the little irritations go
unmentioned. However, by keeping these little issues bottled up inside,
you’re just prolonging (and intensifying) the inevitable.
Special preparations
Emotions can rise so quickly in some long-term relationships because people
fail to properly prepare. Emotions are less likely to flare if both partners pre-
pare. Solid preparation makes the whole process more logical and enables
you to devise alternative solutions. Many people don’t even think about
preparing for intensely personal negotiations. They know what they want or
need and feel that if the other party really values them, the other party will
fill those needs — sometimes without even being asked.
As important as preparation is to negotiations in general, preparation is espe-
cially important in any negotiation that takes place within the context of a
long-term relationship. Because you live with or work closely with a person,
you may assume you know the person. But this familiarity shouldn’t stop you
from asking questions about that person’s wants and needs. Remember that
people change. Curiosity is respectful; making assumptions is not.
At a minimum, ask questions to decide whether this is a good time to negoti-
ate. Chances are the person is not going anywhere, so relax. Find out how pre-
pared the other party is. Don’t ambush him or her. Setting an appointment
elevates the importance of the conversation. When the time is right, negotiate.

I
was really happy when the folks at John Wiley & Sons asked me to write a
second edition of Negotiating For Dummies because they wanted me to add
a chapter on complex negotiating. When I wrote the book that was to become
the first edition of Negotiating For Dummies, the material was drawn from my
own practice as an entertainment attorney in Hollywood representing actors,
writers, directors, and producers and from negotiating seminars I had given
for the Entertainment Division at UCLA Extension.
I had negotiated on larger motion pictures, but these contracts were not what
I would call complex. I had a list of issues I covered in these negotiations, and
our office always did a good job. We were careful to keep those negotiations
out of the public eye until they were completed, so we didn’t even have the
media as a complicating factor.
After Negotiating For Dummies was published, I was asked to consult on some
really complicated negotiations. I was a reluctant warrior. I knew that the six
basic skills worked for me in every negotiation. But a billion-dollar contract
that would take years to complete? I wasn’t so sure. I knew that I had all of
the skills I needed, but how would I help others organize things so that the
negotiation would go smoothly.
As I worked with teams that negotiated agreements for very complicated pro-
jects, I discovered that the numbers were larger, the issues were many, but
the skills needed were exactly the same for a large, complicated negotiation
as they were for the simplest, personal negotiation. The six skills never fail.
In this chapter, I explain what makes a negotiation complex and how you can
address those issues. One of the keys to negotiating a large agreement is to
have the right people working with you, so I also help you assemble the right
team. And sometimes situations change or the time comes to revise an agree-
ment, so I guide you through that process.

The Elements of a Complex Negotiation
Often a client will come into my office and say, “This is really complicated.”
After I hear the story or deconstruct the negotiation, it doesn’t seem so com-
plicated after all. But other negotiations can be complicated, either in reality
or in the minds of the participants, because they may involve factors such as
multiple parties participating in the talks or several issues up for discussion.
The following factors may make a negotiation complicated:
 The media is interested.
 You or your opposite number (or both) are very emotional about the
negotiation.
 The outcome needs the approval, usually by vote, of a membership
body, such as a union.
 Several parties are involved in the negotiation.
 A lot of issues must be decided.
I discuss each of these factors in more detail in the following sections.
Handling the media
When you are negotiating, the best press is no press. However, in our 
information-hungry society, the media will latch onto a potentially juicy story,
whether or not you like it. If the deal is big enough and the players are power-
ful enough, a negotiation often receives media coverage. For example, when
News Corp., the company run by media mogul Rupert Murdoch, bought
Intermix Media, owner of MySpace.com, for $580 million, and when the Walt
Disney Co. acquired animation giant Pixar for $7 billion, the media reported on
the deals with great fervor. Both deals were huge and involved companies that
the public was interested in. In these sorts of negotiation, press happens.
Media exposure has never helped move things along, in my experience. It cre-
ates an energy-draining, mind-numbing side game in which both sides usually
lose. The following sections offer a few tips about handling the media. Everyone
involved in complex negotiations should honor these guidelines.
Anticipate the possibility
In most situations, you will instinctively know whether media attention —
wanted or unwanted — is likely. Most people expect more interest from the
media than the media actually has. If you anticipate that the media may be
interested in your activities, deal with it as soon as you have such a hunch.
Trust your inner voice.
294
Part IV: Conducting Cross-Cultural and Complex Negotiations 

The first thing you should do is get your team together to discuss two things: 
 How to keep your negotiation out of the media.
 What to do if the media gets a hold of the story. (They almost always do.)
You should try to persuade your team to seek professional advice on your
media strategy before the media is interested. You will have more trouble
controlling information after the media is working on the story than if you lay
out your plans in advance.
Getting professional help
A public relations person who really understands how to handle the media
can be one of your most valuable players during the negotiation. If you are
working with someone you really trust, you will be able to focus on the nego-
tiation and not media inquiries. 
At the very least, have an introductory conversation with a PR representa-
tive, whether that person is someone already with your organization or an
outside agency. Talking to an outside agency doesn’t obligate you to hire it,
although you will quickly see the value in hiring someone. I tend to favor out-
side agencies because the internal people tend to have plenty to do with
their routine tasks without taking on this special, time-sensitive project.
Whether you hire someone to handle media inquiries for you or choose to
handle the hoopla yourself, keep these points (courtesy of Richard Laermer,
author of Full Frontal PR) in mind:
 Treat information as a commodity. A lot of people trade bits of informa-
tion back and forth. The minute you put a story out, you can count on it
being passed along — rapidly. So think about what you are going to say
before you open your mouth.
 Some people love to talk to the media. They think any press is good
press. You know somebody like this. If you are doing a deal that you
don’t want in the papers, be very, very careful of what you say to this
kind of friend about your business.
 And speaking of friends, members of the media are not friends when
it comes to gathering news. They are friendly, but that is different from
being a friend. They have a job to do: Gather information and report it to
the public. If you aren’t willing to give them what they want, they often
can find other people who will.
And Alan Mayer of Los Angeles, a publicist who specializes in handling the
corporate crises, adds this tip: Take control. Tell your story or somebody else
will. Think about how you want your side of the story presented and get it
out there before someone else does. You can set the tone of the discussion if
you act early.
295
Chapter 18: Complex Negotiations

Put the media on the agenda
You and your counterparts in a negotiation should discuss any likely media
interest and decide on a procedure for handling statements to reporters early
in the negotiation process, even at your first meeting, if possible. Three
common ways to handle the media are:
 Blackout: This means that no one — in the room, on the backup team,
or anyone associated in any way with either party — makes any state-
ments to the media, on or off the record. 
For this to work, the people in the room have to be able to control those
team members who aren’t present. Everyone has to maintain a great
deal of discipline so that no one is aware of the proceedings who doesn’t
need to know about them. Otherwise, the blackout is sure to be broken. 
It’s also good to publicize the fact of a blackout, both internally and
externally. In your internal notice, give a sentence or two that people
can use if and when they receive a call from a reporter. That way, no one
can say that they weren’t aware that they were supposed to keep their
lips zipped.
 Joint statements: This is a modified blackout in which you don’t com-
pletely shut the media out of the process. Instead, the media receives
periodic briefings in writing or verbally, but always with both sides 
represented.
 No agreement: This happens when the parties simply can’t agree on
how to handle the media. (Not a good sign for the negotiation.) Media
relations turn into a free-for-all. If you have already talked to a profes-
sional publicist about your particular situation, you will be prepared for
this. If you have hired a pro, so much the better.
What happens when the silence is broken
It is very upsetting to pick up your morning paper, switch on your TV, or pull
up your favorite news Web site and see something about a negotiation when
you thought you had a media blackout agreement. The truth is that if a nego-
tiation involves large corporations or well-known business people, the deal is
likely to leak into the public eye. Don’t panic. Instead, follow these steps:
1. Don’t assume that the other side broke the agreement.
People often think that the other side broke the agreement, and sometimes
that’s true. More often than not, a reporter worked hard and pieced
together a story from bits and pieces picked up from both sides. It is
also possible (even probable) that someone on your team may have con-
tributed a piece of information that he or she thought was innocent.
Take a moment to reinforce the rules to your own team and then do the
same with the other team.

2. Think through your reaction. Don’t react too quickly, and don’t let
your team members react too quickly.
Keep the agreement you made with the other side until you can meet with
him or her. Remember, the media is not a party to the negotiation. You
need to keep your agreement and maintain the trust of the other side. 
3. If you must respond to the media, respond appropriately. 
Most of the people who read about your dispute will either be with you
or against you. Those who are neutral are not interested in your criti-
cisms of the other side. Seldom do you create an advantage by going on
a public tirade. You will almost always be the one to lose. Give factual
responses with new information. Be calm and willing to explain yourself,

The screener ban
In 2004, Hollywood studios were exasperated
with the number of Academy Awards indepen-
dent films were winning. The studios believed
that because they started the tradition of doling
out Academy Awards, they ought to win most, if
not all of them. They considered it their show.
The reason for the shift was not that indepen-
dent films had suddenly become more interest-
ing or that the studios were grinding out
formulaic pictures. That had been true for a long
time. The invention of the DVD was causing the
problem. With the advent of inexpensive DVDs,
independent filmmakers could afford to send
copies of their films to all the voters. Then the
voters could see the independent films in the
comfort of their homes, even though the films
may have only been in the theaters for a short
period of time. These DVDs were called screen-
ers and were sent out during the award season
to all Academy members. The Hollywood stu-
dios thought that these DVD campaigns had to
be stopped if the independent films were to be
put back in their “rightful place.”
Using their anti-piracy campaign as an excuse,
the studios announced that no screeners would
be sent to the members of the Academy. The
uproar was immediate. My client, the Los
Angeles-based Film Independent comprised of
some 6,500 independent filmmakers with Dawn
Hudson as its executive director, tried mightily
to negotiate quietly with the studios’ represen-
tative, Jack Valenti. Several solutions were put
forward.
Unfortunately, the studios fought back in the
press. They tried to draw focus from Hudson’s
legitimate arguments by attacking those who
complained as whiners, weenies, and worse.
This made a settlement impossible, and eventu-
ally the independent film community filed an
anti-trust lawsuit in federal court, which it
quickly won. 
This experience shows how futile it is to nego-
tiate in the media. Premature press exposure
makes it more difficult to reach a settlement. If
you are serious about reaching an agreement
with another party, do your business in private.
You can always make a joint announcement
when you have reached agreement.

if the reporter doesn’t understand you. The person from the press has a
job to do, and it is not to serve your interests. It is to gather the facts
and write a story.
4. Always be painfully accurate. 
When you speak conversationally in a social situation, you are trying to
get a general idea across and have a good time. When you speak to the
media, your words will be recorded to be read and reread (or played and
replayed, in the case of television), evaluated, parsed, and otherwise
examined in a way that spoken words are rarely reviewed. Take great
care that the words you speak reflect what you intend with greater clar-
ity than usual.
Controlling your emotions
At some point in life, everybody is involved in a negotiation that triggers a lot
of emotion. The stakes are high; the pressure is on. It might be a very signifi-
cant business deal, a divorce, the care of a loved one with a serious illness, or
a financial crisis. You aren’t yourself, your mind is elsewhere, and you may
wish you could be anywhere but at the negotiating table. During these times,
the old pause button comes in really handy (see Chapter 12 for more about
using the pause button). Use it intensely. You won’t wear it out. In fact, the
more you use your pause button, the better it serves you.
Using your pause button doesn’t make the situation any less serious, but it
will help you to keep your own emotions from disrupting the negotiations
that have to take place around such events. Know that you are in a situation
that overwhelms folks from all walks of life. Take frequent breaks. Don’t try to
stay with a discussion any longer than you can handle. You are already under
stress. Making decisions in such circumstances is inherently tough. So be
gentle with yourself.
Be sure that you have someone in your life with whom you can talk about
your emotions, whether it is a spouse or partner or a professional therapist
or a longtime friend. The human body and mind weren’t designed to carry
around a lot of stress. Don’t even try. If you don’t have such a person in your
life, go to a quiet place and cry or scream or do whatever you do to get rid of
the pent-up emotions. They only get in your way during the negotiation.
Taking a vote
More often than not, the results of a complex negotiation have to be approved
by a board or committee other than the negotiating team. In the business
world, the approving body is also closely involved with the negotiations,
especially the planning stage. Often they will be down the hall, receiving 
298
Part IV: Conducting Cross-Cultural and Complex Negotiations 

periodic progress reports. Unions and international treaties are different.
Unions and legislatures have too many people with too many mouths to ever
keep the members closely informed of the negotiation’s progress. So the
negotiators reach the best agreement they can and then turn on a dime to
sell it to the members who have to approve it, usually by a majority vote.
Sometimes the negotiation to get everyone to agree to the results of a long
negotiation can be more difficult than the negotiation itself. Everyone wants
to show off. Whether it is a group of lawmakers or a labor union, the individu-
als or groups within the voting body have constituencies. Usually, one or
more groups within the voting body wants to discredit the negotiators, either
because they are from another political party or because they will have a
candidate who will be running for a leadership position in the union — or it is
just their nature to be cantankerous.
Don’t be blindsided. No matter how good a job you did with the other side,
you will have to sell the agreement to the approving body. That is a whole
other kettle of fish. Plan this sales pitch every bit as carefully as you did your
opening remarks at the first negotiating session with the other side.

Chapter 18: Complex Negotiations
Grandpa goes to Geneva
My grandfather, Ernest Greenwood, was
appointed by President Woodrow Wilson to be
the United States representative to the
International Labor Organization (ILO), which
had been organized by the League of Nations.
After World War I, President Wilson thought
that the League of Nations would help stabilize
the world. He never convinced Congress, but he
advised the Senate that he was sending my
grandfather to this important post. (This was the
closest that the U.S. ever came to joining the
League of Nations or sending a delegate to it.)
My grandfather lived in Geneva, Switzerland, for
two years and worked hard on a number of
labor issues. The crown jewel of his service
was a worldwide agreement that the 40-hour
week would be the standard for working men
and women around the world.
All the members of the League of Nations were
members of the ILO. They had to approve by 
consensus any action taken by the ILO. I stopped
by the headquarters of the ILO a couple of years
ago and looked at my grandfather’s papers that
were maintained in the ILO archives. Reams of
correspondence revealed how hard it was to
get approval for the 40-hour workweek that had
been negotiated. Everybody had their own
agenda. In fact, the U.S. Congress didn’t make
the 40-hour workweek official in America until
the late 1920s, even though my grandfather’s
service was from 1919 through 1921.
If you think it was hard to get the United States
to agree, just imagine how hard it was to get the
40-hour work week passed in some other parts
of the world. Interest groups work pretty much
the same the world over. For instance, when
India passed the 40-hour work week, workers in
service industries, farming, manufacturing, and
government were excluded.

When you face the group that needs to approve the deal, someone — or sev-
eral someones — will think that it is in their interest to sabotage your efforts.
Irrational, uninformed, and downright contrary arguments will be made against
acceptance of the deal you struck. If you arm yourself with facts and explana-
tions for how the two sides reached the final deal, you will increase the odds
of passage. Be prepared for the worst possible reception to all your good
work, and you may be pleasantly surprised. 
Dealing with multiple parties at the table
When a lot of people are in the room, you have to decide who is who and
what is what. Sometimes a lot of people represent the same team; sometimes
the different people actually represent different interests.
You deal with a lot of people who represent a single interest, say a labor
union, much the same way you deal with one person. The two team captains
control the meeting and others address their specific areas of expertise.
Sometimes subordinates will negotiate directly on a specific subset of issues,
but the team captains always have the final say before agreement is closed
on that subset of issues. Typically both sides have the right to go back and
open up a subset of issues, if needed, to close the larger negotiation.
When the negotiation is a true multi-party negotiation, you need to have one
of the most serious members of your team in charge of communications. You
will be involved in what I call shuttle diplomacy. When you use shuttle diplo-
macy, you have to allocate plenty of time for your team member to go back
and forth among the various groups who have a stake in the outcome. The
goal is to make sure that all of the groups understand the importance of the
larger goal, and that they all feel heard and understood.
Getting everyone on the same page, especially with regard to the details of
the negotiation, can be a huge task. It is a time-consuming task. A lot of
people get frustrated with the amount of time it takes and shrug off the task
because they would rather “get things done.” Take the task very seriously. 
Wading through multiple issues
Almost every negotiation has more than one issue. When I talk about complex
negotiations, however, I am talking about a dozen or more issues that may or
may not be interrelated except for the fact that they are being negotiated at
the same time. When the number of issues create a complex negotiation, you
need to use old-fashioned organizational and management skills. When a
negotiation has several facets, you should
300
Part IV: Conducting Cross-Cultural and Complex Negotiations 

1. Sort the issues into groups.
For example, lump all of the salary and benefit concerns together in one
group. Then make a group of issues that concern working conditions.
You might group organizational and administrative responsibilities into
a third group. 
2. Build teams to supply the information for each group of issues on the
table.
Different aspects of the negotiation require different expertise. In order
to have your entire team well prepared, it needs to do its homework on
each cluster of issues.

Chapter 18: Complex Negotiations
Kissinger and Nixon
The film Kissinger and Nixon, which originally
aired in 1995 on TNT, examines Henry
Kissinger’s efforts to negotiate a peaceful set-
tlement to the Vietnam War among people of
divergent personalities. Beau Bridges plays
President Richard Nixon; Ron Silver plays
Secretary of State Kissinger. This extraordinary
film is based on Kissinger’s biography and other
sources that aren’t necessarily consistent with
Kissinger’s diary.
You witness the face-to-face discussions be-
tween Kissinger and the North Vietnamese. You
see the more-difficult negotiations with U.S.
allies in South Vietnam, and then you watch the
toughest negotiations of all — those with the
president of the United States.
First, observe the negotiations between Kissinger
and the North Vietnamese. This is a classic,
well-tuned negotiation. Both sides were well
prepared. They set certain limits, listened, and
communicated clearly. They were able to agree
rather quickly.
Kissinger could not sell the agreement to the
South Vietnamese, and Nixon was furious.
Watch this conversation more than once to see
how difficult multisided negotiations can be.
This film shows first hand what is so true in
many real-life negotiations: Reaching an accord
with the opposing party can be easy; the most
difficult negotiations are often between people
on the same side of the table.
The other members of what was supposed to be
the same team outmaneuvered Kissinger at every
turn. In the White House, Kissinger was the odd
man out. He was valuable to the president, but
the president had a hard time bringing him into his
inner circle. Nixon had an even harder time with
those who trusted and respected Kissinger —
Nixon’s mortal enemies — the press. Nixon
believed Kissinger earned some of that trust and
respect by revealing confidential conversations.
South Vietnam presented different problems.
Kissinger underestimated the president’s
unwillingness to sell out the South. Nixon didn’t
think any more of the leadership of that country
than Kissinger did, but Kissinger was caught off
guard by what appeared to be Nixon’s loyalty to
the South. Nixon didn’t want to be seen by the
American public as abandoning our ally, no
matter how unworthy it may be or how practi-
cal it was for him to do so.
To seal the deal, Kissinger needed the presi-
dent’s personal assurance to the South
Vietnamese. Nixon had to sign secret side let-
ters to convince the South that the United
States would not abandon it. Of course, in the
end, America did.

3. Set clear deadlines to get the information to you, and make sure that
everybody agrees on the deadlines. 
If the people gathering some of this information do not normally report
to you, be sure that their bosses agree with the deadlines and the priori-
ties that are set. No one person can know everything. In a complex nego-
tiation you need all the help you can get. Also, having more people
building the case tends to broaden the support for the negotiating effort.
If you are on a negotiating team that is facing a lot of issues, do not second-
guess the leader. 
Being on such teams presents great opportunities for upward movement in a
company. Show that you are team player and do your part well — very well.
You will be rewarded in corporate heaven.
Putting Your Skills to Work 
in Complex Negotiations
It is very unusual for a complex negotiation to be complex for one reason
only. Many parties, many issues, press scrutiny, and the need for member
approval are all factors that are likely to be present in some union negotia-
tions. In the entertainment industry, the periodic contract negotiations for
the Screen Actor Guild (SAG) and the Writers Guild of America (WGA) rou-
tinely involve all these issues.
To check my own experience, I called David J. Young, the executive director
of the WGA. The WGA is the union that represents screenwriters for features,
television, documentaries — you name it, it writes it. For years I have been
general counsel to the Writers Guild Foundation, but it is the union that
wages the annual ritual of negotiating the wages and working conditions for
its 6,500 writer members working in film, television, and new media.
David had a lot to say about complex negotiations. He has vast union experi-
ence and knows that union negotiations are always complex. At WGA, there is
an additional complication because at any given time 40 percent of the mem-
bership is unemployed, giving these brilliant individuals a lot of time to focus
on issues that are important to them even though they may not be familiar
with the mechanics of negotiating a complicated deal. 
David uses the same six skills in these very complex negotiations that are the
basis of this book, while at the same time using all of his management and
organizational skills. This section focuses on how the six skills can be used in
conjunction with organization and management skills in a complex negotiation. 
302
Part IV: Conducting Cross-Cultural and Complex Negotiations 

Skill #1: Prepare
When you prepare, you must focus on three distinct areas. First you must
prepare about yourself (which includes your organization). David came from
traditional labor unions for carpenters and textile workers where people
worked shifts and were paid weekly, so wages and health benefits were the
central issues for those members. Professional writers are an incredibly
bright group of folks who are used to being paid sporadically as a film is
made or a script is sold. The issues that are important to them are credit, cre-
ative protection, and receiving additional payments as their material is
exploited by the studios in the wide variety of media. To understand this
aspect, David had to talk to a lot of writers to find out as much as he could
about their needs and wants.
The next thing to prepare about is the value of the thing being negotiated.
Because these negotiations contain so many issues, David can’t research
everything by himself. So he assigns various members of his staff to teams
with very specific areas to research. They brief him before a meeting, but the
hard work of researching the issues has to be left to others.
Finally, the negotiator has to prepare about the person on the other side of
the table. In David’s case, the person on the other side of the table is Nick
Counter, who has negotiated on behalf of all the studios for 20 years. I heard
David’s predecessors at the WGA characterize Nick as a mere messenger
without power. David had a much more complete picture of him; he thinks
Nick is a powerful and influential leader. Studios execs come and go with star-
tling suddenness. Nick is the constant. Because he is a good organizer, he has
held together in the collective bargaining environment these highly competi-
tive studios, led by men and women with giant egos. When Nick started, the
studios had lost their ability to cooperate. He got them to cooperate and has
been largely successful in dealing with a variety of unions. The unions in the
entertainment industry have not been as successful.
David had thought more intelligently and completely about the forces he was
up against than his predecessor. Take a tip from David. Do not brush off the
people you are facing in a negotiation. Find their strengths. Appreciate their
abilities.
Skill #2: Set goals, set limits
Every union member seems to have his or her pet goal. Managing these 
expectations in an honest and realistic manner is one of David’s main jobs. 
He lets all the goals be expressed and then artfully narrows the focus to a
manageable list of goals for any given negotiation. He uses consensus building
303
Chapter 18: Complex Negotiations

to help everyone agree on what the main points of the negotiation will be.
Most people who share common interests do have a consensus about the top
three or four goals, although the order might be different for different folk. Let
the consensus emerge from the membership. You need to have the patience to
listen carefully to what people are saying and then have them organize and
express it back to you.
Of course, you have read the goal-setting chapter and know that you have to
narrow the number of issues to a manageable number. I loved David’s insight
on this subject. He said that one of the beauties of negotiating on behalf of a
union is that unions can be more unreasonable. If management is too dracon-
ian, they help the union by alienating their own employees and uniting them
behind the union position. The union can ask unreasonable amounts, and
management won’t bat an eye. Unions can be more unrealistic about what
they demand.
It is also important to allow some of the members to be present for the real
give and take of the negotiation. Bargaining committee members need to be
present to hear from management why X, Y, or Z is impossible. People begin
to understand what the other side’s position is. hey can observe the process
as broad demands are narrowed down.
Skill #3: Listen
You have already seen how David listens during preparation and then again
in setting the goals of the union. In a complex negotiation, your listening skills
are really important because you have to listen to so many different voices.
Point to a person who successfully leads negotiating teams dealing with mul-
tiple parties and multiple issues, and I will show you a good listener.
Skill #4: Be clear
“To me the first piece of the puzzle is to be honest. As a negotiator, never pre-
tend to know that you know something that you do not know. First admit what
you don’t know.” David lets others with more knowledge on a particular sub-
ject present the union position on that item. He controls the show, but doesn’t
hog it. The negotiator for a union is always talking to management across the
table and to the members of the union present in the room. David’s advice:
“Never exceed your trust.” In other words, never say anything that is not
authorized. Never say anything that would make the members in the room
uncomfortable. He would never ask his people to let him do something that
he isn’t prepared to do. Such an approach could mean longer and more
tedious negotiating sessions. “There is no such thing as doing the right thing
for someone who does not want you to do it,” he says. The more experienced
you are, the more you want to cut to the chase. You can’t let that happen.
304
Part IV: Conducting Cross-Cultural and Complex Negotiations 

Skill #5: Push the pause button
Union negotiations are scheduled to start and stop at specific times, so there
are built-in pauses. However, frequent breaks to huddle and confer go on all
the time. Usually the leaders of the two teams are highly experienced and call
for a break whenever tempers begin to flair.
305
Chapter 18: Complex Negotiations
A pal breaks all negotiating records
David Frohnmeyer, the president of the Univer-
sity of Oregon, was a law school buddy of mine
long before he was the lead negotiator in the
Stripper Well litigation that resulted in a settle-
ment that exceeded $4 billion, the largest set-
tlement in American legal history at the time.
The negotiations took place in some 15 loca-
tions over a period of four years. 
Keep in mind that David, along with California’s
Attorney General John Van de Kamp and
Massachusetts’ Attorney General Frank Bellotti,
was leading a group made up of the 50 states
and four U.S. territories. They were seeking fair
redress for overcharging by gas companies
according to the federal regulations that had
been issued over a decade before.
Each state and territory wound up in one of
three groups. The states represented by private
law firms broke into two groups with very dif-
ferent views of the case. The states not repre-
sented by private counsel soon became known
as the nonaligned states.
In order to reach a settlement, all 50 states and
four territories had to agree on the settlement —
no holdouts. David (and Frank and John) took a
moderating stand and balanced out the parties.
The three were selected in part because of their
backgrounds and experience. Frank was presi-
dent of the Attorney General Association. David
had argued more cases before the U.S. Supreme
Court than any other attorney general at the
time and had represented the group in court. He
had won two very big cases, including the
Exxon case in which it was stipulated that the
states could receive the revenues from the gas
companies. John was from the largest state to
benefit from the settlement. The three leaders
represented both coasts — two Democrats and
a Republican — the largest states and one of
the smaller states.
So, here is Lesson #1: When you have a lot of
parties at the table, choose a leader or leaders
who are well respected and represent the com-
peting interests within the group.
In the course of the 21⁄2 year-period that it took to
settle the case, many of the 43 elected attorney
generals would change. Fortunately, senior
assistant attorney generals stood in for many of
their bosses. Even if the principals are not likely
to change, they are likely to be busy. Supporting
staff members are essential in a complex, multi-
party negotiation.
Lesson #2: Plan for continuity in the group.
Even more important than the continuity that the
assistant attorney generals provided was the
persistence and the leveling effect that they
brought to the proceedings. Since each attor-
ney general was a highly visible public figure in
his or her state, they sometimes got distracted
by political pressures, had election agendas,
and otherwise would drift off message. The
assistants focused on the ultimate goals and
tended to provide solutions when their bosses
(continued)

Skill #6: Closing
All the normal tips on closing apply. Ask for agreement. As soon as you have
tentative agreement on an issue, move on. However, a union agreement has
to be approved by a vote of the members. This is what David calls, “Landing
the plane. It requires communication throughout the process and continu-
ously managing expectations. You have to have the skin to know that you
won’t please everyone. The members have to know that you care and that
you are not manipulating them. You are representing them.” That is also true
306
Part IV: Conducting Cross-Cultural and Complex Negotiations 
might not be able to. This subgroup could keep
things moving with a helpful nudging toward the
group’s goals even when the principals seemed
deadlocked.
Lesson #3: Pick the best and the brightest to
carry the laboring oar on such negotiations and
empower them to keep going through all the
noise. Let them make nonbinding statements
and nonbinding offers and set agendas.
As the parties neared a settlement, the federal
government stepped in to claim half of the pro-
ceeds with a threat of taking all of it if the states
did not agree. That unified the states. There is
nothing like an external threat to knit a group
together.
Lesson #4: Always have a good reason for
everyone to put aside their squabbles to stay
focused on the real goals.
Of course, the oil companies also had to work
together throughout the negotiation. Just as 
the states had their differences, the oil compa-
nies probably had their differences too. The divi-
sions among the states were more obvious
because of the public nature of the principals.
Occasionally the oil companies tried to exploit
those differences but more often they did not.
Lesson #5: When working with multiple parties,
differences among them are inevitable. But be
very cautious in any effort to exploit the differ-
ences. It must be done with the greatest deli-
cacy or it will backfire. Divide and conquer can
be very dangerous. 
A lawyer named Joe Kennedy represented a
small oil company in Kansas City. He was
essential in keeping this negotiation alive. He
never let it get personal and never forgot the
possibility of finding common ground or gaining
some new insight. He was a good listener.
Lesson #6: Identify the reasonable folks on the
other side who will keep the dialogue going
even when things seem the darkest. There is
almost always one such person on each side of
the table.
Toward the end of the negotiating, it became
clear that the oil companies were going to
agree to a settlement with a handsome total. At
that point, the states agreed to a division before
they had the settlement amount. After that, the
negotiation moved fairly easily, but not quickly.
That was a magic moment because the basic
structure was there.
Lesson #7: Instead of wrestling with how a spe-
cific amount of money will be divided, try to deter-
mine how things will be divided up, no matter
what the number is. Greed and avarice are less
likely to settle in when you are talking about prin-
ciples of fairness rather than specific dollars.
And in closing David had this to say: “It’s going
to be messy until it is tidy. You must be able to
tolerate some looseness when there are a lot of
parties at the table. And be prepared to spend a
lot of time making everyone feeling included.”
And yes, the six basic skills are the foundation
of success.
(continued)

on the management side. In your business environment, you will have the
same issue with those you work with and for. They have to know that you are
looking out for their interest.
This may seem like a lot of space to devote to one, somewhat idiosyncratic,
union. But the lessons apply to any complex negotiation and this rendition
provides a good overview of how to organize and manage a complex negotia-
tion. In summary, David says that a lot of what he does is on instinct (see
Chapter 9 about the importance of listening to your inner voice). He then
adds that union negotiations involve “a lot of preparation, a lot of control of
message, and a lot of anticipation and thought about what the majority of
members really want.” To me, that sounds like a recipe for success in any
complex negotiation.
Building Your Team
The more complex a negotiation, the bigger the team you need, especially
during the preparation stage. You can’t do everything yourself as you get
ready for a negotiation with multiple issues or lots of parties or both. Don’t
even try.
Organize your negotiating team just like a football team. Like a football team,
the critical work will be done before the team hits the field for a game. The
opposing team will be thoroughly researched. You probably won’t have films
of the opposing team, but you should have a lot of information about them.
You will have your own plays worked out with each person’s role well defined
and you will be aware of where the deal is most likely to land up on various
issues. Here are your key team members:
 Your linemen are the folks who are going to be in the room, negotiating
the deal. They are not alone. They don’t necessarily design the plays.
But they lead them. They execute. Each one has his or her job and will
be called upon to carry the conversational ball when the time is right. In
the preceding example, the 50 state attorneys general selected three
leaders. In a union negotiation, there is usually a committee representing
the membership of the unions.
 Your blockers are the critical analytical types who figure out what is
wrong with the other side’s proposals and come up with the plan and
the figures to block their schemes. These folks should be part of the
research team who worked so hard getting everyone ready for the nego-
tiation. They provide the hard data so you can shoot holes in the argu-
ments of the side and will be able to suggest compromises when that is
appropriate. 
 The quarterback is the on-field boss, calling the shots but not doing all the
work. Whomever you appoint as team leader assumes this responsibility.
307
Chapter 18: Complex Negotiations

 Off-field, a coach gives final approval to what is happening on the field.
In your organization, this person is usually the boss who never sits
down at the negotiating table, but those conducting the talks always feel
his or her presence. Sometimes, it is the entire membership of a union
or congress who have to approve what has been done in the room.
Of course, your side won’t be the only one using the team concept. The other
side will also have a team approach to its work. One of the first things you
normally do in such situations is to have introductions all around. Use this
opportunity to learn more about the role of each person. See if you can draw
an organization chart of the opposing team. The lead negotiator will almost
always be identified right up front (usually ahead of time), but the role of
others may have to be ferreted out. 
Inevitably, you will notice that there are areas where team members don’t
appear to agree. If there is any dissension within the group, you’ll see it in the
form of nonverbal cues — a questionable glance, a hand gesture, a shrug of
the shoulders. This information will help you know about points where there
may be an opportunity to push your agenda a bit harder.
But be very cautious about any effort to overtly exploit the differences on the
other side of table. That can quickly backfire. Nothing unifies a unit like an
attack from outside.
Watch the film October Sky. Jake Gyllenhaal stars in this true story of Homer
Hickam Jr., a young man growing up deep in West Virginia’s coal mining coun-
try. He wants to become a rocket scientist. His father and his school principal
think his ideas are ridiculous, even destructive, and need to be blocked. Note
how young Homer builds his secret team of kids who share his vision. He
applies their energy and intellect to the project, and ultimately the team pre-
vails over the many obstacles thrown their way. Note how Homer leaves out
some people who should have been naturals (like his father), doesn’t involve
people who could compromise the operation (like his mother), and leans
heavily on those who can guide him to success (like his teacher, played by
Laura Dern). Hickam not only builds his rocket, he goes on to become a
senior official at NASA.
Going Back for More: The Renegotiation
Renegotiations come up in different ways. Each one presents different issues,
but the idea is the same. You have a deal, or at least you think that you have
a deal, and you or the other party wants to change it. In this section, I look at
the renegotiation based on whether it is scheduled as part of an original agree-
ment (such as annual salary review), conditionally scheduled (such as a
change in child support if circumstances change, or unscheduled (such as “I
don’t like the deal I made.”). 
308
Part IV: Conducting Cross-Cultural and Complex Negotiations 

Whichever category your negotiation fits into, you need to prepare yourself. To
negotiate successfully, you must be calm, rested, and clear about your goals
and objectives. Preparation allows you to be attentive during the renegotiation.
A scheduled renegotiation
Many agreements have built-in renegotiation periods. The annual salary review
is the most common (see Chapter 21). Sometimes they exist in long-term
supply contracts. The reason for scheduling a renegotiation is because the
relationship is going to last a long time, and everyone knows at the outset
that circumstances will change. Usually this means that one side will need
more money. It really helps the working relationship to know that compensa-
tion will be addressed at a certain time in the future without either side
having to bring it up.
Just as you prepared for the original negotiation, you need to prepare for a
renegotiation. Most people know to do that. Unfortunately, many people
refuse to take charge of a renegotiation in the first place, especially a salary
renegotiation. Many people are reluctant to identify their needs and acknowl-
edge that they need a change. If you struggle with creating better circum-
stances for yourself, ask yourself, “What about this situation is not working
for me?” or “What needs to change?”
In the case of asking for a raise, people usually wait for the boss to bring it
up. Bosses are often no better at addressing the annual salary review than
the people who work for them, especially in a small organization where the
review process is not so structured. Don’t hesitate to mention the issue if it is
scheduled and then follow the tips in Chapter 21.
An unscheduled renegotiation
An unscheduled renegotiation occurs when someone’s unhappy with the deal
she made or the contract she signed. Often called buyer’s remorse, the feeling
sets in sooner or later on many deals for some people and hardly ever for
other people. Frequently, the person should be unhappy with himself or her-
self, but because no one can independently adjust a contract, a person has to
seek a renegotiation.
In the entertainment business, the most common unscheduled renegotiation
occurs when a television series is a hit and the cast is still earning very good
salaries, but their earnings are a pittance compared to what the network is
earning from its weekly broadcast. So the cast members seek major raises
from the producers. The renegotiation that ensues is sometimes long and
protracted and can, on occasion, turn ugly. The ritual is almost expected
309
Chapter 18: Complex Negotiations

when a show is a huge success. Friends, Frasier, and Everybody Loves Raymond
are examples of popular television series whose ensemble casts renegotiated
their contracts.
Whether renegotiating is accepted behavior within your industry or a sur-
prising anomaly, keep these points in mind if you want to renegotiate a
signed contract:
 You have a signed contract. A written contract imposes certain legal
obligations upon you. Never threaten to quit or not perform. If you say
you are not going to perform, that is called anticipatory breach of con-
tract. The person on the other side does not have to wait for you to
carry out your threat. He or she can take your word for it and convert
your threat into an existing breach of contract action.
 Request the opportunity to renegotiate. Don’t ask if you and the other
party can renegotiate a contract and then go right into your demands.
Even if the other side asks you what you want, put off your speech until
you and your counterpart have agreed on a time and place where you
can make your case. Another way to think about it: Never ambush some-
one with a renegotiation. Set an appointment to talk about it.
 Find out what your peers think of your position. You don’t have to tell
your peers what action you are taking, but ask their opinion about the
situation. If the folks who are similarly situated don’t share your feeling
that the situation is unfair, you may want to re-examine before you 
renegotiate.
 Show courtesy and respect for the person with whom you are renego-
tiating. You are asking someone to modify something that he or she
does not have a legal requirement to do. Treat him or her the way you
would want to be treated in the same situation.
 Be patient. You’ve had some time to think about your request. All of 
this information may be new to the other party, and surely it will need
approval from others. Be sure that you understand the authority and
structure of the other side so you can track your request through the
hierarchy. You want to be sure that the other side is not just stringing
you along.
Whichever way your renegotiation lands, be appreciative and recognize that
you found a way to address a difficult situation. Don’t forget to thank those
who accommodated your needs.
A conditionally scheduled renegotiation
Many agreements give one party or the other the right to renegotiate if cer-
tain conditions occur. The renegotiation based on changed circumstances is
called a conditionally scheduled renegotiation and is really two negotiations:
310
Part IV: Conducting Cross-Cultural and Complex Negotiations 

 First, you have to convince the other side that circumstances have
indeed changed.
 Secondly, you argue for maximum benefits based on an equitable formula.
When circumstances change and you want to renegotiate, make sure you 
 Have accurate and complete records from the date of the original
agreement. Don’t think you can reconstruct the data several years later
with greater accuracy than you will if you do it on the date that you
enter the agreement. The more you have in the way of written proof, the
better off you will be.
 Know the time period in which you can conduct the renegotiation.
Determine the dates within which you must act very accurately and
mark your calendar accordingly. If you miss the dates that you can
cancel or modify the agreement, you have missed your window.
 Know what terms can be renegotiated. For example, if you have a 
child support agreement that calls for an increase if the party paying the
support earns more money, try to stay focused on that issue. It is tempt-
ing to try to negotiate a shift in visitation also, but doing so isn’t helpful
if you are representing yourself. If you have to hire a lawyer for the rene-
gotiation, you might want to combine the issues to save fees for both
sides.
But I like the contract and I think it’s fair 
What do you do if someone wants to renegotiate a contract you like and you
think is fair? There are two schools of thought on this issue:
 Take a hard line and point out the existence of the contract that gives
you substantial rights and refuse to negotiate.
Or
 Always listen and be sympathetic and flexible when it comes to such
requests.
My recommendation is to base your response on the facts of the situation.
First you have to consider the issue of fairness to both sides. If you know that
the person on the other side is really getting screwed because of the way things
are working out, you should listen and see what can be done to make the con-
tract work for both sides. If the person coming to you is a well-known whining
ingrate who will never be happy no matter what you do, you have no reason
to spend much time on the matter.
Most renegotiation situations fall in between the two extremes. In the vast
majority of cases, the person coming to you will honestly believe that things
311
Chapter 18: Complex Negotiations

are working out in a way that is unfair. So if you receive a request to renegoti-
ate, set an appointment to talk. When the time comes, listen. Listen very care-
fully. Try to understand why the other person feels the way he or she does.
Don’t worry about solutions or changes until you understand what caused
the person to come to you with a request to renegotiate.
Be very persistent about your need to understand the underlying problem
before discussing solutions. You don’t want to go through another renegotia-
tion in a few months. Remember, the other person has been thinking about
this for some time. He may have even built up a head of steam about it. Let
him vent. Insist on it. You want to clear away all the emotion during this stage
so that when you talk about solutions, the person is calm and rational.

and Internet
In This Chapter
 Getting through to the right person
 Negotiating tips for the phone and the Internet
N
egotiating over the telephone or Internet is never as good as negotiat-
ing in person. Unless you are very careful and very clever, telephone
conversations rob you of much of the data that comes to you almost auto-
matically during a face-to-face meeting. The gestures, the facial expressions,
the sidelong glances between members of the other party — all these are lost
in the telephone negotiation.
Negotiating over the Internet is even more difficult. You have no human inter-
action. Your computer prevents you from hearing a voice or seeing a facial
expression. It is also a distraction as you read other e-mails in your inbox or
surf your favorite Web site. Regardless, negotiating over the Internet is fast
and saves time, so people do it anyway. If you fall into that category, at least
be aware that as good as the Internet is for finding or sending information, it
is terrible as a tool of persuasion.
This chapter covers some special considerations you must remember when
you use the telephone or Internet to negotiate. All the other aspects of nego-
tiation are still in play, so don’t ignore the rest of the book just because you
are using the telephone or the Internet. If anything, those other parts become
more important.

Putting in the Call
The higher up a person is on the corporate ladder, the more his or her time is
protected by others. You may have to get past various staff members who
screen calls. Sometimes, all the skills of negotiating the deal are necessary to
get a screener to let you through or at least put you at the top of someone’s
call-back list.
Getting past the gatekeeper
Often, you are unable to get through to the right person on the first call. If you
want to enjoy maximum success on the phone, you should treat gatekeepers —
the assistants who take your calls — with the same respect that you treat
their bosses. When you are on the phone with an assistant, the assistant is
every bit as important as the person he or she works for.
By and large, after the switchboard operator or receptionist, the assistant
you talk to first has the support and confidence of the person you want to
contact. Give the assistant the same respect and confidence you would give
the person you’re trying to reach. You get through the screening process
more often, and you can make progress even when you speak only to the sup-
port staff. You don’t always have to talk to the boss to get things done.
 Don’t wear out your welcome. You find that you get much more accom-
plished by working as much as possible with assistants and support 
personnel. Always recognize that until you have established your rela-
tionship with the boss and the gatekeeper, the gatekeeper is unable to
respond to any of your requests without approval from the boss.
 See if the assistant can answer minor questions before you ask the boss.
You don’t need to talk to the boss for every single thing that is going on
in your negotiation, especially if the negotiation is protracted. If you
want to know when to expect a report that was promised yesterday, you
can ask the assistant — nicely. If the boss has completed his or her
work, the assistant probably knows better than the boss when you can
expect the finished product.
 Don’t get cute, coy, or flirtatious with the gatekeeper. This sleazy
approach demeans both parties in the conversation. Respect carries you
further in the work-a-day world than all the sexual charm you may think
you exude over the phone.
 Be businesslike in all your dealings. Using the name of the assistant,
especially to the assistant, is very positive. Always write down the
names of key support staff. The calendar system on my computer has
several spaces for phone numbers for each person, so I use one of these
spaces to fill in the assistant’s name.
314
Part IV: Conducting Cross-Cultural and Complex Negotiations 

One of the best movies about turning the gatekeeper into an ally is Oliver
Stone’s Wall Street. Charlie Sheen’s character successfully gets through to an
executive many levels above him. Watch the first ten minutes of the movie for
everything you need to know about how to get past a gatekeeper: persistence
(he called 59 days in a row in a way that was not annoying), preparation (he
knew about the executive’s family, birthday, and preferences), and most of
all, respect for the gatekeeper. If you want the boss’s respect, you need to
respect the boss’s assistant.
Leaving a message
Always leave a message, even if it’s just your name and phone number. Let
the other person know that you cared enough to call. If someone is taking
down the message for you, make your comments brief. If you are recording
the message on voice mail, you can include more detail, but still be concise.
Pack in the information in as few words as possible and be logical.
You are most likely not the only caller on the voice mail. Getting through a
string of messages is time-consuming. Getting through a string of long, wordy,
and detailed messages is plain annoying. If you happen to ramble, all is not
lost. These days, most messaging systems have a feature that allows you to
erase and rerecord your message. You usually don’t hear that instruction
315
Chapter 19: Blind Negotiating: Telephone and Internet
A little respect opens the door
Many people get really frustrated with the gate-
keepers of the world. This attitude puzzled me a
great deal because I never had that problem.
Then I stumbled on the answer accidentally. A
well-known writer client of mine was trying to
reach Steven Bochco, the well-known creator
of television classics from L.A. Law to NYPD
Blue. My client was frustrated and railing about
Bochco’s failure to call him back. “Does he
know why you are calling?” I asked. “No” was
the impatient reply. “I have not been able to talk
to him.”
“But what did you tell his assistant?” I could hear
my client’s impatience rising steadily as he said,
“I don’t want to talk about this to his assistant; I
want to talk to Bochco. Could you call him?”
“Sure. I’ll be glad to do that for you.” Then I had
to pick my words carefully. We had already dis-
cussed the advantages of my client pitching his
idea himself. “Okay. Here’s my theory. If you
want to talk to Steve Bochco, you have to talk
to the assistant. Tell him who you are, who your
dad was, why Steve knows you, and the general
nature of your call. Bochco is busy. There has
to be a darn good reason to call you back.”
An hour later, my client called to tell me that 
he had just had a half-hour conversation 
with Steven Bochco. He was very happy.
Interestingly, my client’s career has taken off
since he learned how to get past the gatekeep-
ers with respect.

until you have left such a long message that you have exceeded the system’s
time limit. If you realize you’re rambling, wait until the recording time runs
out, when the instructions on how to rerecord your message will come on
automatically. Don’t apologize for rambling. Fix it!
To add importance to your message and avoid playing phone tag, you may
inquire when you can call back. If that doesn’t work, give two or three times
when you can be reached. One of these approaches is almost certain to work.
Arranging a time for the next call elevates your importance and engages 
the assistant in making the next call the one that connects with the boss.
Remember, no one can be more helpful or harmful to you than a seasoned
gatekeeper.
With state-of-the-art wireless technology now readily available, many busi-
ness people can be reached anytime, anywhere. Wireless gadgets, such as
cell phones and PDAs (personal digital assistants that can be used as cell
phones, Web browsers, personal organizers, and latte makers — okay, that
last one’s not true . . . yet), make leaving a message, either by voice or by
text, a simple task.
Hitting “O”
After you have left your nice succinct message, don’t just hang up. Hit “0.”
This action usually transfers you to a receptionist who can tell you if the
person is even in that day or to an assistant who may be able to help you.
The most time-consuming part of a phone call is getting yourself ready to
exchange information and then initiating the call. The phone conversation
lasts only a few moments, so you need to make every call worthwhile. Make
the best use of the time as you can.
Wording your voice mail greeting
You’ve left a message, and now the person is calling you back. If you aren’t in
the office, what is the other party going to hear, and is it going to be helpful?
How many times have you heard, “I’m either away from my desk or on the
other line”? In today’s world, no one wants to wait for much of anything. Even
if you don’t have an imaginative message, at least eliminate the obvious. I’m
always impressed with the tailored message. Most of the people who work on
the For Dummies series change their messages frequently. “Today is _______,
and I will be in meetings most of the day, so I probably won’t get back to you
until tomorrow. Please leave a message.” Now that’s a big help.

Assembling the Participants 
for a Telephone Chat
Deciding who participates in a telephone negotiation is as important as
choosing whom to invite to an in-person meeting. Conference calling no
longer reduces you to one-on-one negotiations over the phone. Not everyone
has had face-to-face conversations with each other. Voices will not always be
easily identifiable, so the fewer people, the better.
After you decide on the participants, choose the best way to gather these
people together. The following sections describe the three basic choices.
Gathering in front of the 
telephonic campfire
If one or two other people within your organization need to be included in the
conference, invite them into your office and use the speakerphone. That way, at
least the two or three of you who are together don’t lose the benefit of sharing
gestures, documents, and facial expressions. Be sure to read the section in this
chapter on equipment, although I can summarize my advice here: Get the best.
Depending on the size and style of your office, conferencing capabilities will
vary. Larger companies with high-tech offices often have the most recent,
state-of-the-art conferencing equipment, such as Polycom conference phones
and Web cam video conferencing. A Polycom conference phone allows two
people to talk at the same time, so participants can make overlapping com-
ments as they would during a normal, face-to-face conversation. On a regular
speakerphone, only one side can talk at a time. For smaller offices, a good
conference phone is essential and may not need to be as elaborate.
You need not go to the expense of building your own room-based video-
conferencing system. AT&T (www.business.att.com), for example, offers
video-conferencing capabilities right from your own computer, as long as you
have a high-speed computer system. Don’t automatically assume this choice
is out of your reach.
Conferencing with your own equipment
These days, almost all office phones have conferencing capabilities that allow
you to add a third party into a conversation no matter what instrument you
317
Chapter 19: Blind Negotiating: Telephone and Internet

are using. Don’t miss out on your phone’s conference feature just because the
procedure seems like too much trouble. This is one feature you should know
how to use.
Using conference calling saves you the time of having one conversation and
then calling someone else to repeat the same message. Conferencing also
maximizes accuracy of communications and prevents delays. Because all par-
ties are hearing the same thing, everyone’s confidence level in the negotia-
tion is at its highest.
Very often, the volume on your phone will drop markedly when adding a
fourth party to the call. Resist the urge to do so. It may seem helpful to have
that extra person, but more often than not, loss of power ends the ability to
clearly communicate. Also, if one person accidentally falls off the call, the call
often needs to be reinitiated. That disruption breaks the continuity of your
negotiation.
Hiring outside help
When you don’t want to deal with the hassle of connecting several parties
through your own private phone system, arrange a formal conference call
through the telephone company. You can do this through a private provider
or, in many large companies, through a dedicated conference line. These
approaches are especially useful if the participants are to be on the line the
entire time rather than for just a small portion of the conversation. You can
be confident that the call will be well coordinated and all participants will be
clearly heard.
Local telephone companies allow you to establish a conference calling
account. Costs vary according to your location and the services you choose.
Private conferencing systems now make multiparty conferencing very inex-
pensive. If you need this feature a lot, it is worth it to bring it in-house.
Making the Most of Your 
Telephone Negotiation
The biggest disadvantage of telephone negotiation is that the convenience of
the telephone can cause people to devalue the importance of the negotiating
session. In a face-to-face meeting, the parties gather all the materials they
could possibly need during the conversation, drive across town, battle the
parking problem, find their way to a particular office or conference room,
318
Part IV: Conducting Cross-Cultural and Complex Negotiations 

take time to pour a cup of coffee, find a seat, and begin the conversation.
After this effort, everyone knows the meeting is important.
Frequently, when negotiators save time by using the telephone, instead of
putting some of that time back into the actual discussion, they hurry through
the conversation as if it were less important than if they had spent unproduc-
tive time commuting and getting settled in. You can restore importance to the
conversation by making a formal appointment to talk rather than calling the
person out of the blue. What you have to say is important. Do not let the
importance of what you have to say be scuttled on the shoals of time. Take
the necessary time to let the other party know that you have something to
contribute.
Never lose sight of the fact that every communication is important during a
negotiation, whether by telephone, letter, or face-to-face discussion. Take
care of the conversational niceties and then some, even if you don’t have to
drive across town to have the meeting.
Crisp beginnings
Before you go into an important meeting, you take a beat to be sure that you
look your best. You automatically check your hair, your collar, or your teeth
(especially if you had spinach for lunch). Do the same on the phone. If all you
do is take a deep breath and put a smile on your face, you feel more pre-
pared, and the telephone session begins much better.
Always put your best foot forward, even if no one can see your feet. When you
start a telephone negotiation, give the same attention to a good first impres-
sion that you give to a face-to-face meeting. How you answer the phone or ini-
tiate the call is important. Too many people just pick up the phone and say
“Yeah?” or some other perfunctory greeting. Don’t be rude. Start with a posi-
tive greeting, “Good morning,” “Good afternoon,” or “Thanks for calling.” It
sets a positive tone. If you don’t have time to talk, ask the caller if you can
arrange another convenient time. If you are the caller, ask if the time is conve-
nient. Arranging another time shows respect. And you must give it to get it.
When the meeting starts
If time or circumstances force you to conduct important negotiations over the
telephone, try your best to compensate for the lack of face-to-face interaction
with careful listening and pointed questions. Keep in mind the disadvantage
of the phones as not having the visual cues that are inherent in a face-to-face
conversation. You can turn the telephone into a negotiating instrument
319
Chapter 19: Blind Negotiating: Telephone and Internet

almost as effective as the face-to-face meeting by tuning into the tone and
tempo of the other person’s speech. This awareness gives you a powerful
advantage in a day in which the telephone is probably used more frequently
than face-to-face meetings in business negotiations.
The person on the other end of the line can’t see you either, so give lots of
auditory feedback. In a face-to-face meeting, looking out the window and con-
templating your next thought is perfectly acceptable. However, on the tele-
phone the people on the other end of the line can’t see what you’re doing.
They’re likely to think that you’ve been disconnected or that you are distracted.
They may ask, “Are you still there?” If someone asks you that, you know that
she was concerned enough to stop what she was saying to check on you. That
interrupts her train of thought. Maintain your presences with verbal cues,
but don’t fall back on “Uh-huh, uh-huh.” Simply acknowledge periodically that
you are listening and understanding what the other person is saying.
Speaking with authority
Because you only get one chance to make a first impression, develop your
vocal personality. The first impression you make over the phone depends
entirely on how you speak. Begin to listen to yourself by working with a voice
recorder. Pay attention to these characteristics:
 Volume: Others must be able to hear you clearly. You don’t want the lis-
tener straining to hear your soft voice or holding the phone away
because you are irritatingly loud.
 Pronunciation: Others must be able to understand you. The word “five”
cannot sound like the word “fine.” Speak clearly. Speak slowly. Never
mumble — especially not over the telephone. Mumbling can be corrected
by putting energy and lip motion into your voice. If you’re not excited or
enthusiastic about what you are saying, fake it.
 Rate: Speak at a moderate pace — not too fast or too slow.
 Intonation: Avoid a monotone. Let your voice rise on important words
and lower on the not-so-important ones. You don’t need to be sing-
songy, but a variety of inflection adds interest to your speech.
 Nonwords: Look out for the “ums” and “uhs.” These fill silence, but a
short pause is so much better. Don’t be afraid of the silence.
 Emotion or tone: This element is hard to define, but you know it when
you hear it. It’s the emotion or attitude in your voice — the edge you put
on certain words. When you say, “I’ve told you before,” your tone can
convey that you are angry, condescending, or defensive. Saying the words
differently (“I’ve told you before”) can convey that you are friendly, happy,
or nonjudgmental. Put a smile on your face to put a smile in your voice.

Look at the scene in Jerry Maguire where Jerry, played by Tom Cruise, des-
perately tries to retain his clients after being fired from his sports agency. He
calls each client and clearly states his objective: He wants each player to
come with him to his independently owned agency. Most of his clients ulti-
mately desert him for a rival sports agent, and the scene culminates in Jerry
loudly and authoritatively wooing one last client — Rod Tidwell, played by
Cuba Gooding Jr. — by professing to him that he will “show him the money.”
Watch the scene not only for its take on cutthroat negotiating, but also for
the way these expert negotiators make their intentions clearly and loudly
heard. Listen to the emotion in their voices.
Questions to ask on the telephone
Some good questions are designed to close the sensory gap imposed by the
phone. The questions are easy; you have probably heard them before. If you
thought they were polite inquiries, you were only partly correct.
Add these questions to your telephone routine:
 “How are you doing today?” and “Is this a good time to talk?”
These two classic inquiries serve one purpose: Taking the temperature
of the person with whom you are speaking. Don’t rush right into a nego-
tiation — find out whether the person you want to negotiate with is
ready. If you poke your head into someone else’s office, you can see
whether the person is on the phone or otherwise preoccupied. Do the
same when you initiate a discussion on the phone.
 “Do you have a half hour or should we schedule a phone appointment?”
This inquiry is a more-sophisticated version of the first two questions. If
you know the phone session is going to be long, check with the other
person’s schedule first. Don’t draw someone unwittingly into a long ses-
sion. Also, scheduling a phone appointment elevates the importance of
the conversation and allows for better preparation.
 “Do you have the file on your desk?” and “Do you need to get any-
thing else before we go ahead?”
If you refer to a document, find out whether the other party has the doc-
ument in hand. Be sure that you are both working with the same version
of the document. If a question exists, try to fax or e-mail the version
under discussion during the conversation. Faxing or e-mailing any miss-
ing documents while you are on the phone is essential for clarity. It also
gives you a certain authority and power. Making sure everyone has the
necessary paperwork tells other party that you are in charge because
you want to make sure this session is as productive as possible.
321
Chapter 19: Blind Negotiating: Telephone and Internet

 “I hear a change of tone. Is everything okay?” and “You sound down
today.”
These are two classic ways to articulate what you suspect is true. Go
ahead and put words to what you hear. Do the same if you hear that
someone has become distracted or started munching a late lunch.
Noting such a distraction permits the person on the other end of the line
to ask you to repeat whatever was missed — and surely something was
missed. It acts as a bridge back into the negotiation. These comments
also dissuade such conduct. People aren’t likely to turn away from the
conversation if they know that you are aware each time they do so.
As your listening skills improve, you may find that you can hear some of the
facial expressions you don’t see. My friend Tom Sullivan — who is a speaker,
composer, writer, actor, and anchorman — has been blind since birth. His lis-
tening skills are extraordinary. Sometimes when we’re talking, he stops and
says to me, “You sound a little stressed out.” He has never been wrong. If you
are that good at listening, let the other person know. Your insight is flattering
to them and helps confirm the information you are receiving.
Shaking hands over the phone
At the end of a negotiating session, you wrap it up. If the deal has not closed,
you walk the person to the door and arrange the next session. Finally, you
look the person in the eye, say good-bye, and shake hands.
You cannot shake hands on the phone, but you can use words as though you
are shaking hands. Recall the walk to the door at the end of your last face-to-
face session. You almost always have a mini-conversation about something
other than the business you were discussing. Try to do the same thing on the
phone.
Too often, the efficiency of the phone works against using closing pleasantries.
Fight that instinct. Take the extra moment. Try to end on a personal, positive,
or forward-looking note. The specific communication is a function of your
personality and your relationship with the other person. Whatever closure
you use face to face at the end of a negotiating session, you should try to use
at the end of a telephone negotiation.
Negotiating via E-Mail
The Internet and e-mail have revolutionized communication. For better or
worse, the Internet is a fast and easy way to gather and transmit information,
322
Part IV: Conducting Cross-Cultural and Complex Negotiations 

so it is very good for communicating facts. Sending e-mail across the Internet
is not nearly as useful for persuading people to do something or to agree to
something or to get out of your way so you can do something. Therefore,
e-mail is best used to transmit documents and other information. Use a more
personal approach to change minds.
Negotiating through e-mail is iffy for many of the same reasons that apply to
negotiating over the telephone (see the earlier section, “Making the Most of
Your Telephone Negotiation”). For instance, you can’t hear the tone of the
person you are negotiating with, and you can’t read body language or facial
expressions. Add to that the ease of forwarding information that you’d rather
keep under wraps, and you could have a real problem on your hands.
Of course, e-mails have a role in modern negotiating. E-mails are an incredibly
efficient way to be sure everyone with a need to know receives all the informa-
tion in a timely fashion. You can organize a meeting rapidly using e-mails. And
what a joy it is to knock out some of these communications during the dark
of the night instead of watching infomercials. But be wary of trying to persuade
someone using e-mail. It will work sometimes, but it’s always better to pick
up the phone when it’s time to change someone’s mind about something.
Also, when you pick up the phone, you know who are dealing with. Many offices
(mine included) have set up a system where e-mails are filtered through an
assistant. My assistant Katheleen comes in early to sift and sort and take care of
as many messages as she can, and no one in the ether world is the wiser.
The most annoying feature of trying to negotiate through e-mail is that some-
times a lot of people chime in with their opinions when they really have no
business participating in the conversation. When you see that happening,
you can use either one of these strategies:
 You can simply bow out of the conversation until it gets a bit further
along when you can contribute to the solution rather than the chatter.
 You can tailor your response. Instead of replying to everyone who
received the message, reply only to the person or people who most need
to hear your comments.
The following sections present some effective ways to negotiate using e-mail:
Plan
Before you begin an e-mail communication, think about the purpose of the
e-mail. What’s your agenda? Reading through dozens (or hundreds) of e-mails
is time consuming, therefore you should strive to be as brief as possible.
Summarize your objectives and be direct. Don’t bore your reader with long-
winded messages.
323
Chapter 19: Blind Negotiating: Telephone and Internet

In today’s day and age, the average person has a pile of e-mails to catch up
on each morning. Lengthy messages stall the process of getting through
these e-mails fast and efficiently and frustrate the recipient.
Keep these questions in mind when planning an e-mail communication:
 What information do you want to share?
 Who needs to know? Be sure you have the proper name(s) and e-mail
address(es) for the person(s) you e-mail. There is nothing worse than
sending confidential information about a deal to an unintended recipi-
ent. You also don’t want the message to bounce back to your inbox as
undeliverable.
 Are you sending the e-mail internally (to someone within the office) or
externally (to someone outside the office)? Internal e-mails, usually
between colleagues, tend to be less formal. Niceties are not necessarily
required. External e-mails usually require more thought and careful 
planning.
Organize
An e-mail’s organization is equivalent to your appearance before a meeting.
First impressions make all the difference. For instance, a strangely formatted
e-mail is an immediate turnoff. It shows lack of preparation and hints that the
crux of the e-mail is probably not important. Here are some things to con-
sider when organizing an e-mail message:
 Start with a meaningful subject line. In an e-mail, the subject line sum-
marizes the point of your message. It’s the first thing the reader sees. A
good subject line will allow your reader to properly sort and prioritize
his or her e-mails. Make sure your subject line is short and informative.
If you are negotiating about more than one project, put the project name
first, and then use signal words in your subject line, such as:
Request for . . .
Agenda for . . .
Highlights of . . .
Procedures for . . .
Suggestions for . . .
Information about . . .
 Use bullet points to highlight main points. This makes your e-mail mes-
sage easy to scan and gets your message across.
 Be concise and to the point by keeping sentences and paragraphs
short.
324
Part IV: Conducting Cross-Cultural and Complex Negotiations 

 Consider the look of your e-mail. Avoid fancy, colorful backdrops for
your e-mails. Instead, use a white background. Make the message easy
on the eyes. Keep in mind that negotiating via e-mail does not require
any artistic talent.
 Watch the color and size of your fonts, again making sure both are
consistent and straightforward. Nothing is more distracting than having
some words appear larger or smaller than others or color coordinating
your paragraphs.
 Be sure not to overuse CAPITALS. Remember, tone is difficult to gauge
in an e-mail, and using capital letters shifts the weight of words and
meanings into something unintended. Additionally, if you write a mes-
sage using all uppercase letters, it seems as if you are shouting. This
may trigger an unwanted response from your reader.
 Avoid abbreviations and e-mail lingo. Common e-mail abbreviations,
such as “btw” (by the way), “lol” (laugh out loud), “ttyl” (talk to you
later), “fyi” (for your information) and so on, are okay between friends
or during a quick chat. In a negotiation, they are usually viewed as unpro-
fessional and can be distracting. And, btw, they take away from the for-
mality of your e-mail . . . as do emoticons. : )
 Always reread your message before sending, and always check for
spelling and grammatical errors. A well-written e-mail signifies 
preparedness.
Exercise “reply” principles
Replying to an e-mail is equally as important as initially composing and send-
ing out an e-mail. Be as thorough and direct as you are with messages that
you initially compose. Here are some other things to consider when replying
to an e-mail message:
 Are you responding with emotion or with fact? Pay close attention to
your e-mailed response before sending. If the initial e-mail was written
with formality, respond with similar care and thoughtfulness. Don’t
respond in a flippant manner to an e-mail that was carefully written and
planned. Doing so is disrespectful.
 Have you answered all questions asked? Stick to the topic of the mes-
sage and answer questions that you are asked. Sometimes, when a lot of
information is sought or many questions are asked, it is better to go into
the body of the e-mail and answer them in the order that they are posed
by the sender. You can distinguish your answers with subtle colors or
italics. I like colors, but pick them carefully. For instance, I avoid red
because it’s too reminiscent of corrected homework.
 Is the message thread still intact? A message thread is the way each
e-mail is added to all the preceding e-mails so that anyone receiving the
325
Chapter 19: Blind Negotiating: Telephone and Internet

very latest e-mail can check over the entire communication history, if
need be. Breaking a message thread and responding to an e-mail by cre-
ating a new thread only causes confusion because you don’t have the
trail of e-mails to reference. More importantly, leaving the message
thread in tact saves the recipient time and frustration in searching for
related e-mails. If the thread is maintained, you can delete the prior
e-mail each time a new one comes in. 
 Is this e-mail urgent? Try to avoid writing “Urgent” in your subject line
unless your message truly is urgent. The high-priority tab on most e-mail
systems is enough to note the urgency of a message.
Automatic reply, out-of-office messages are increasingly arcane as the ability
to access e-mail has less and less to do with being in the office. And most of
them don’t tell the recipient what they should do if they really need to con-
tact someone else in the office. The consistently best out-of-office messages
are written by Evan Shapiro, the head of the Independent Film Channel. Here
is a typical message from him:
I am in Los Angeles today working real hard. I am not playing around, so
Erica will probably be getting back to you. Trust her. I do.
Pick up the phone
When all else fails and an e-mail negotiation stalls, pick up the phone.
Communicating via the Internet can sometimes serve as an impasse in a
negotiation. For one, you are not physically present in a room with another
party, so you are prone to procrastinate and not respond to e-mail. Also, if
frustration sets in during a stalled e-mail negotiation, you can’t gauge the
level of frustration. Is the other party turning red with anger? Is the other
party slamming a fist on the table? Is the other party screaming in their
office? Or maybe the other party is simply ignoring your messages. Pick up
the phone and find out.
You also want to pick up the phone at the beginning of a negotiation. It’s
really hard to establish rapport with someone solely through e-mail contact.
Even with a significant time difference that will favor greater e-mail use, start
with the phone to introduce yourself to the other person.

Chapter 20
Ten Personality Traits
of Top Negotiators
In This Chapter
 Recognizing the qualities of a great negotiator
 Developing those qualities yourself
A
t the beginning of my negotiating seminars, I ask participants what
results they want to achieve after the course. Invariably, respondents
say they need to be more self-confident, more assertive, or more patient.
Many times, in relating specific incidents, it becomes apparent that they feel
they were bested or beaten up in a recent negotiation. They don’t want to
imitate the bully or the screamer, but they saw that person get results. They
ask what personality traits they need to develop to attain more positive out-
comes. So here is a list.
Nobody has all the traits listed in this chapter. As you look over the list, find
those that apply to you and develop them further. Find those qualities that
you feel are completely absent from your personality and work on them to
improve your negotiating style and your life.
You can use all the personal qualities in this chapter, whether you’re a shy
person or an outgoing person, a nervous person or the calmest person in the
world. Fast talkers, slow talkers, and all the talkers in between can benefit
from developing these traits. You can develop these qualities as fully as you
like, at your own pace, and in your own way.
It’s never too late to work on yourself. You won’t get anywhere by blaming
your parents or your upbringing or your environment. Awareness is the first
step. You can nurture yourself and absorb life’s lessons, no matter what your
age. As parents, you can consciously set goals for your children. You can
model behavior, encourage practice, and reinforce positive behavior. In
short, you can train your own kids to be great negotiators.

Empathy
Empathy is listed as the first trait for a reason. Empathy is the ability to par-
ticipate in another’s feelings or ideas, to put yourself in another’s shoes. This
is the bedrock of all successful communication and a necessary trait for great
negotiators. The ability to show empathy when someone else is hurt devel-
ops and is observable by age 3. But without teaching or reinforcement, the
ability will not be retained or used. The bully or the screamer in your negotia-
tion may not be a mean person. The screamer may never have developed the
capacity for understanding how a person feels when he or she is on the
receiving end of the screaming. You can improve your empathetic response
by writing out a list of behaviors, values, and goals that you can’t possibly
agree with, but you can acknowledge that others feel that way. Next to each
behavior, write “but I understand that they feel that way.”
Some of the traits listed in this chapter are virtually impossible to develop
without first honing your sense of empathy. Empathy is the bedrock of win-
win negotiating (discussed in Chapter 14). Being empathetic also helps you
maintain your own identity as you experience the views and emotions of
others, because it enables you to recognize the differences between you and
the person you are talking to. You maintain your own feelings and views while
understanding the feelings and views of the other person.
Respect
Respect follows closely on the heels of empathy. First, you must have respect
for yourself and the limits you set. Only then will you be able to respect or
consider worthy other people and the limits they set. Respect for yourself is
another, more specific way of saying self-confidence. Often, one can exude
self-confidence when the butterflies are fluttering furiously inside. Self-
respect is a prerequisite for motivating yourself. You want to achieve for your
own satisfaction — not to please anyone else.
Respect is reciprocal in negotiations: If you give it, you are much more likely
to get it. If necessary, be the first to show respect. A good way to improve
your respect for people is to listen to people, looking them straight in the
eyes. Listen for good ideas and thoughts that make sense to you, and pay a
compliment to the source. Frequently, respect follows knowledge. The more
you know about a person, the more likely you are to respect that person.
330
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Personal Integrity
By personal integrity, I mean honesty and trustworthiness. “Honesty is the
best policy” is really true in all areas of life. Keep in mind the humorous
adage, “If you don’t lie, you don’t have to remember what you said.” Honesty
and trustworthiness are necessary for others to trust you and place their
confidence in you in a negotiation. You then are considered a dependable
person. How can you begin to develop integrity right now?
 Follow the rules of society — even the smallest ones.
 Keep agreements with yourself and others. If you promise to send along
a pile of information, send it along. And do it without delay and without
a reminder.
 Never misrepresent anything in a negotiation. Not replying to a certain
question or divulging certain information is completely acceptable; 
lying is not.
Honest and trustworthy people take full and complete ownership for their
lives, their choices, thoughts, feelings, and actions, without blaming or fault-
ing others. They know their deepest values without hesitation and don’t
depend on their position for power.
Fairness
Fairness is another trait based on empathy. You must believe that the needs
and wants of other people are worth considering, along with your own.
Fairness doesn’t mean treating people equally or the same. If you have raised
children or managed employees, you already know that what is fair in the
interests of one is not always fair to the other. One person may need only a
stern glance to know what you want; another may need things spelled out
with lots of clear words and repetition to even start paying attention.
To develop fairness, consider what your goals are and what the goals are of
the other party. Delineate areas of agreement and areas that need compro-
mise. Always keep in mind the ability and experience of the person with
whom you are dealing.
331
Chapter 20: Ten Personality Traits of Top Negotiators

Patience
Patience means bearing pains or trials calmly without complaint. It’s the ability
to tolerate frustration and adversity on the way to reaching your goals — and
not give up. This trait allows you to persevere in the face of adversity. You must
know that disappointment and setbacks are part of the process of succeeding.
Everyone grew up hearing, “If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again.” It’s
absolutely true — collecting the “no’s” is part of getting a “yes,” whether your
field is sports, music, science, or whatever. All successful people know that 
getting knocked down, refused, denied, and blocked is part of life. Success
comes to those who are steadfast and keep going.
To develop more patience, look into your past and see how much patience 
or perseverance you have exhibited. Recall a goal you had years ago that you
thought would be impossible to reach. Acknowledge that now you’ve reached
it, or surpassed it. The goal may be a specific yearly income, a healthy rela-
tionship, or stature in your community.
If you read biographies of famous people, you’re sure to be surprised at how
often they were pegged not to succeed. Patience is what allowed these indi-
vidual to persevere against the odds.
Responsibility
Being responsible means exhibiting reliability or dependability. Being respon-
sible means that you accept the consequences when tasks are completed or
neglected.
Being responsible doesn’t mean that you won’t make mistakes; it does mean
that you will correct them when you realize you’ve made a mess. One way 
to improve in this area is to engage in “clearing the decks.” This exercise
enables you to come to terms with all the little (or big) problems for which
you are responsible, so you have a clear space to get on with achieving goals.
Examples may include:
 Apologizing for speaking rudely to a co-worker, employee, spouse, or child
 Scheduling traffic school and/or paying the fine when you have an out-
standing traffic ticket
 Completing a form or application you’ve been putting off
 Clearing that pile of papers you’ve been meaning to file
 Keeping every appointment on your calendar
332
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Flexibility
Flexibility is the ability to deal skillfully and promptly with new situations and
difficulties. If one approach doesn’t work, you can try another. Life’s prob-
lems and the problems of a negotiation are seen as challenges to overcome.
When you are in the midst of a problem, brainstorm all possible solutions.
Brainstorming means listing all the possibilities, without editing. Ignore the
little voice in the back of your head that says, “Oh, you can’t do that.” Then
decide the consequences of each action. Choose the solution with positive
consequences that leads you closer to your goal.
Flexibility is at the heart of closing a deal in a way that satisfies each side and
is workable in the real world. You must be flexible in a negotiation to fit your
goals and needs with the goals and needs of the other party.
Sense of Humor
Having a sense of humor involves looking for the comic quality in a seemingly
serious situation — the ability to perceive, appreciate, or express what is
amusing or comical. A great teacher once said, “Enlightenment is lightening
up” — looking for humor in adversity in order to get on with finding solutions
rather than blaming others. A prerequisite is self-respect and the flexibility to
take a creative view of an imperfect situation.
The University of Maryland Medical Center did a study (universities love to
do studies). It showed that having a good laugh boosts your mood and your
immune system. It lowers your blood pressure, improves your brain function,
helps you become relaxed, and makes you feel good. Any one of those things
will give you an edge in the negotiating room. So lighten up already.
To develop a sense of humor, start thinking of the last mistake you made in a
negotiation — with your spouse, co-worker, client — and step back from it,
lighten up, and try to see any aspect that could be interpreted as amusing.
Self-Discipline
Self-discipline is at the heart of the ability to lead a self-reliant, self-sufficient
life. If you are self-disciplined, you don’t need someone “on top of you” to
motivate you. You have internal forces that drive you toward your goals, and
333
Chapter 20: Ten Personality Traits of Top Negotiators

your rewards come from within you, rather than from people externally rein-
forcing you. This is another way of expressing the trait of diligence: attacking
things in a serious manner, without glumness and humor. If you want to
become a great negotiator, take on the task with joy, optimism, energy, and a
plan — be serious about accomplishing your goals even as you maintain, and
use, your sense of humor.
Make your own plan and follow that plan. That is the quality of self-discipline.
To improve this trait, live your life as though your life depended on it, because
it does. Marcus Aurelius said, “Do every act of your life as if it were your last.”
Stamina
Stamina is the ability to keep going when others have dropped by the wayside.
Former President Richard Nixon once called Henry Kissinger the greatest nego-
tiator in the world. He called Kissinger a genius and a strategic thinker, and
then he launched into a long discussion about Kissinger’s stamina. Kissinger
was indefatigable in his globe-trotting and deal-making in pursuit of peace.
To increase your stamina, do the following:
 Eat right.
 Take your vitamins.
 Sleep enough and well.
 Try to find balance in your life between work and play.
 Meditate.
Needless to say, stamina is a hallmark of all great negotiators. You can’t win
the game if you don’t have the stamina to stay in the game.

Ten Key Negotiations of Your Life
In This Chapter
 Negotiating at home and on the job
 Getting fair deals on important transactions
H
ere are some helpful insights into handling various highly stressful 
situations in your life. Some of the emotional fallout from the negotia-
tions listed here can cause permanent damage within families. This chapter
guides you through these times in a way that minimizes damage to your rela-
tionships, while enabling you to stay true to yourself and to your personal
values, needs, and wants.
Asking for a Raise
Everybody asks for a raise at least once in their lives. Use the six basic skills
outlined in this book to achieve better results:
1. Prepare (Chapters 3 and 4).
Before approaching your manager for a raise, prepare yourself internally.
This is the only aspect of your salary negotiation that you can completely
control. Invest as much time and energy as possible during your prepara-
tion. You must know that you have earned the right to ask for a raise and
that you are valuable to your employer. Gather documentation to prove
that you have made important contributions to the organization and that
your absence would be detrimental. If you don’t believe that you deserve
a raise, no one else will.
After you are emotionally prepared for the negotiation, prepare your
case on the merits:
• Know how much your company’s budget can afford. Get a feel for
how well the company is doing.

• Know the going rate for your services. The Department of Labor
issues statistics each year about pay rates for a large number of
categories. Visit the department’s Web site regarding statistics
(http://www.bls.gov/ncs/ocs/compub.htm) and click on
your state. After you have your state, click on your area within the
state to view statistics for individual industries. To win a salary
negotiation, you should know what a top salary is in your particu-
lar position. Search Web sites like www.monster.com and
www.salary.com to see what people in positions similar to yours
typically make. You can also ask friends, check the classified ads,
and even go out on some job interviews to get this information.
When you’ve gathered your data, tell your boss that you want to sched-
ule a meeting about your salary. Don’t ambush your boss. Say, “I’d like to
talk with you about my salary. I need about 20 minutes of uninterrupted
time in your office. When would it be convenient?”
Be sure that you know who makes the final decision about who receives
raises (and the size of those increases) in your company. If your boss
isn’t the final decision maker, gain his or her trust and then ask your
boss to represent your situation to the proper person.
2. Set limits and goals (Chapters 5 and 6).
Aim high, but be realistic. You want to suggest ideas to which your boss
can realistically say yes. Decide on the minimum amount you are willing
to accept and the maximum figure you can hope to receive. Also, decide
what you will do if the company does not meet your minimal expecta-
tions. In the event that you can’t persuade your boss to agree to your
request, you need a Plan B. Brainstorm ideas before your meeting. Here
are some possibilities:
• You may bide your time as you look for another job.
• You may quit on the spot.
• You may just stay with the program . . . and be a less cheerful
worker.
3. Listen (Chapter 7).
You may have to let your boss vent about shrinking budgets, executive
compensation, and even personal problems. Letting your boss empty
out will clear a space for you when you talk. Ask about your own perfor-
mance. Listen carefully to be sure that you both view your performance
the same way; if you don’t, clear up that discrepancy immediately. Going
on to talk about more money when the company thinks that you’re not
performing up to snuff is futile.
336
Part V: The Part of Tens 

4. Be clear (Chapter 11).
Be persuasive without coming off overly forceful. You don’t want to
damage your relationship with your boss. Avoid ultimatums, threats and
other coercive actions. Simply set forth what you think is fair and why.
Spend plenty of time on the why. Let your boss know about the research
you’ve done and present all the evidence of the value that you bring to
the company. Take a list of your accomplishments to the meeting. But
more importantly, present the goals you plan to achieve to earn your
proposed salary. Show your boss that you deserve a raise based on 
your past and future contributions to the company. Don’t think about
your compensation only in terms of salary. Think about other types of 
compensation you can ask for, such as profit sharing, stock options,
bonuses, vacation, and overtime. One of those options may be more
acceptable to you and the company.
5. Push the pause button (Chapter 12).
Keep your emotions in check. Never resort to an emotional plea about
putting food in your kids’ mouths. Most companies have stacks of evi-
dence that they are in line with the norm. You need to build your case on
objective evidence. Make sure that the management knows that keeping
you around and keeping you happy will pay off.
6. Close the deal (Chapter 14).
This may be the first time your boss has been made aware of your worth
to the company. Your boss may have to think about the issue. That’s
fine, but be sure to set a date for a final decision. You don’t want your
manager’s legitimate need to think about the matter to turn into an
excuse to keep you from the salary you deserve.
Where, when, and how you seat yourself when you discuss a pay raise with
your boss can impact the entire negotiation. For some helpful hints on how
to physically set up the negotiation in your manager’s office, read Chapter 2.
Chapter 9 discusses the body language of such meetings.
Buying a Used Car
Any car you are likely to buy came off an assembly line. The day the car was
built, many other cars just like it were made. Don’t fall in love with a car —
especially one you have only driven around the block. Another car is always
around the corner.
337
Chapter 21: Ten Key Negotiations of Your Life

Here are the key points to remember when buying a used car:
 Know generally what kind of car you want.
 Don’t fall in love with any particular car until you buy it.
 Know what you can afford to pay and don’t spend more.
 Don’t buy a car until a mechanic you know has looked it over — for a
price, not as a favor. (You want the mechanic’s best professional opinion.)
 Negotiate the price from knowledge of the marketplace.
The most easily available source for pricing information is the classified
advertising in newspapers or those nifty little magazines (common in most
big cities) devoted exclusively to advertising things that private parties want
to sell. The next most common source is the Kelley Blue Book Auto Market
Report. This book reflects a national survey of prices on used cars by manu-
facturer, year, and model. It has a section in the front that provides tables so
you can add or subtract for the optional features of the car and the car’s
mileage. Visit Kelley Blue Book’s Web site at www.kbb.com.
Real insiders use the Black Book (www.blackbookusa.com) published on 
a state-by-state basis by the National Auto Research Division of Hearst
Business Media Corp. of Gainesville, Georgia. The people who buy automo-
biles for used-car lots use the Black Book’s pricing information when they
purchase vehicles for their lots. If you can get your hands on a current copy
of one of these little books or access to the subscriber area on the Web site,
you have the single most reliable information about what the car lot paid for
the car you are buying. Add the cost of commission, overhead, and operating
expenses, and you have the minimum price for which the car lot can afford to
sell the car to you.
See Chapter 2 for a story about how your three-year life plan impacts what
kind of a car you should consider. Also read Chapter 14 on closing, so you’ll
be aware of the continued efforts of the car-lot personnel to close the sale
from the moment you express interest in a particular car.
Buying Engagement and Wedding Rings
Fortunately for the world’s betrothed, the simple gold band remains the stan-
dard symbol of love and commitment whether you are Buddhist, Christian,
Hindu, Jewish, or Muslim. The price of the ring is mostly based on the
amount of gold it contains. Unless you happen to be a jeweler, you can’t test
the karat (or purity) of the gold on your own. Work with a professional jew-
eler whom you know. If you don’t know a jeweler and you can’t get any great
recommendations from friends, at least be sure that you’re dealing with
someone who has been in business for a while.
338
Part V: The Part of Tens 

The most pure gold is 24-karat gold, which is 99.9 percent pure. By compari-
son, 18-karat gold is 18/24ths pure gold, and the rest is alloy. The standard in
the United States is 14-karat gold, which has a little more alloy and slightly
less gold. Be sure 14k is stamped inside the ring, followed by the logo of 
the manufacturer of the ring. The logo is registered with the Jeweler’s
Association. In many other countries, including England, Italy, and Israel, 
the government supervises the gold industry. This is your protection against
purchasing anything less than the indicated purity. When you negotiate for a
wedding ring, the important thing is to be sure that you are negotiating for
the real thing.
In the United States, the use of some decoration on the ring is increasing.
Such decoration adds only a relatively small charge to the cost of the band,
and considering the cost of the overall ceremony, honeymoon, and homemak-
ing, this is one area where you should get what you want. This advice is quite
different from the restraint you should exercise when you shop for the
engagement ring.
Practices surrounding engagement rings vary widely around the world. It’s
great if you can use a family ring to mark the connection of this new life with
the past. Most people are not that lucky. The diamond trade relies on the
Rapaport Diamond Report (www.rapaportdiamondreport.com). This
report organizes information by size and quality of the diamond. You can 
get the best deal by purchasing an unmounted stone for cash (subject to a
formal appraisal) and then having the stone mounted by a local merchant.
You can buy a substantially larger and better quality diamond for your
budget this way than if you go blindly into a fancy jewelry store. If you use
the Rapaport Diamond Report, remember that it represents the cash asking
price in New York for single diamonds, meaning that the true price should be
lower. Also, be sure to check the date of the report.
Planning a Wedding
Wedding planning has become a lucrative industry, especially in big cities.
Depending on the size of your wedding, be prepared for some stressful
months prior to the big day. Because of the level of detail involved, you may
become overwhelmed when you look at the total amount of preparation
required. Don’t go it alone; get a recent issue of any of the magazines on the
subject. Two popular ones are The Knot and Modern Bride. These magazines
usually include a checklist and sample calendar that cover every aspect of
wedding planning working backward from the wedding date.
339
Chapter 21: Ten Key Negotiations of Your Life

Stop now. Before you write anything on the calendar, decide on your total
budget and stick to it. Break down the big categories into smaller, less-
threatening chunks. Create a line-by-line entry for each element of the 
event and stick to each category. Then begin to prepare for the various 
negotiations, using the line items in the budget as your absolute limit.
The real challenge is agreeing on who will take part in the wedding and what
role each person will fulfill. Negotiating with your immediate family, your
spouse-to-be, and in-laws-to-be can be intense. Use the six skills in this book
to stay as objective as you can. Because this is such a personal event, you
need to keep your pause button firmly in your grip (see Chapter 12 for a
refresher).
Be sure to involve your soon-to-be spouse in the preparation process.
Remember, it takes two to wed, so participation from both mates is key. It’s
also a chance for the two of you to lend support to each other during the
stressful months leading up to your wedding day.
One special consideration is the role of the children in the ceremony (if you
or your spouse-to-be is a parent). Give them important roles. Each of them
will be in various stages of accepting the new person, and this will be an
important step in building relationships.
Buying a Home
Buying a home is the most important buying decision that most people make
in the course of their lives. Most people comparison shop a great deal for a
house. You search until you find what you want. When you find it, you make
an offer and, if the offer is accepted, apply for a loan.
This order of doing things is a bit backwards. Your efforts to get a good deal
on the money you borrow should be as complete as your efforts to get a good
deal on the house you buy. Most people put off applying for a loan because it
seems so daunting. It also involves the possibility of rejection. Egad!
Your best bet is to prequalify for your loan before you choose your house.
Prequalification means you fill out all the forms and get a commitment from a
lender that it will lend you a certain amount of money on prescribed terms as
long as you pick out your house within a designated period of time.
Prequalifying can be a great help for the following reasons:
340
Part V: The Part of Tens 

 You know what you can afford.
 You can tell the seller that you are prequalified, which makes you a
more-attractive buyer. The seller doesn’t have to worry about whether
you are going to be able to get a loan.
 You get to shop for the loan and fill out the forms without the time 
pressures involved when you’re afraid someone else will snatch up 
the house you want.
Going to a bank and asking for a loan is not something most folks enjoy
doing. However, the terms on which you borrow money for your home pur-
chase are a significant part of the package. Enter the mortgage loan broker. A
mortgage loan broker is a professional person who assists you in finding the
right loan for your circumstance and helps you fill out the forms. Generally,
these brokers are paid by the lending institution that grants the loan.
You may think that you could get a better deal going directly to the lending
institution, but that is not often true. Using a professional loan broker offers
definite advantages:
 Good brokers know the best rates.
 Good brokers know how to translate all that loan jargon into plain 
language.
 Good brokers know which lenders are most receptive to a person in
your circumstance.
 Unlike most people, good brokers enjoy doing all this paperwork. That’s
why they do it. This fact alone should begin and end the conversation
on whether to use a broker.
After you have your loan and have picked out your house, try to find out why
the house is on the market. In an ideal world, you would be able to ask the
seller, but the real estate market usually works with one or two agents sepa-
rating the buyer and the seller. If you’re lucky, you’ll be able to ask the seller’s
agent. If not, ask yours, but realize that the answer you hear will be third-
hand from the seller to the seller’s agent to your agent. Next, find out if the
asking price for the house is fair given the market, the neighborhood, and
other recent sales. Your agent will help you with this step. Armed with this
information, you are ready to make your offer. Your real estate agent will help
you with this step also, but keep in mind that your agent’s interests have
shifted from finding you a home to closing this deal. Your real estate agent
will steer you away from an offer that is too low. Listen to your agent, absorb
what he or she has to say, and then make the offer you want to make. If you
lose this house, there are always other houses. Don’t be pushed into a deal
that makes you uncomfortable.
341
Chapter 21: Ten Key Negotiations of Your Life

When you make your offer, be sure to include the right to inspect the house
with a professional inspector who will check everything over objectively and
systematically. He or she will find things that you and I would typically miss
because such folks are trained to spot evidences of problems (a water stain
or a moldy smell) that can be fairly subtle. They are also trained to spot code
violations and construction that was done without a building permit.
Never close a deal to buy a home until you are fully satisfied that the house 
is in the shape that you think it is in and the financial terms are acceptable to
you. A home is a terrible thing to hate. For more information on home buying,
look for Home Buying For Dummies, 3rd Edition, by Eric Tyson and Ray Brown
(Wiley). It’s packed with helpful tips.
Buying a home isn’t easy, but with careful planning and good organization,
the process can actually be a pleasurable one.
Negotiating a Home Improvement
Contract
I have very little sympathy for 90 percent of the horror stories I hear about
home improvement projects. I listen politely, but I think that most of the
tellers of such tales are blaming the contractor for things that are really a
result of their own lack of clarity.
Specifically, I’m always hearing about how the contractor didn’t show up.
Yes, many people in the home improvement business are small operators,
who overbook themselves and spend too much time working on the job sites
and not enough time planning the work ahead of time. But solutions exist:
 Know your contractor before you commit to the project.
 Find out exactly what other jobs are scheduled and where your job falls
on the contractor’s list of job priorities. Also find out where the other
jobs are so you can verify the excuses if things begin to unravel.
 Build penalties and bonuses into your builder’s contract to reward 
and punish the company for completing work under or over the 
scheduled time.
The second big complaint I hear is that the project went over budget. Usually,
the size of the complaint seems to magically relate to the differences between
the project as first envisioned by the homeowner and the final result.
342
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Follow these tips to avoid spending more than you want to spend:
 Know your contractor before you commit to the project.
 Obtain a detailed written bid of the work before you agree to have 
it done.
 Agree that no charges will be assessed unless you sign off on them first.
 Always hold a portion of the payment until the work passes final 
inspection.
Note that the first solution for every problem you can imagine with a contrac-
tor starts with the admonition “Know your contractor before you commit to
the project.” In addition, don’t be a stranger while the project is underway. Be
on the job site with a cup of coffee for the crew every morning. It takes a little
extra effort, but that friendly rapport will make your project first priority
over a less pleasant one almost every time.
Most people tell you to check references. But smart workers only give refer-
ences who are happy with their work. A better approach is to ask a friend
who has been through the process of home improvement for recommenda-
tions. You will hear the good, the bad, and the ugly, but you will know what
you are getting. 
The importance of knowing the person you are negotiating with is well 
documented in Chapter 3. The home improvement project underscores 
this important lesson like none other.
Negotiating a Divorce Settlement
The trouble with negotiating a divorce settlement is that the laws intended 
to guide you through this difficult time are, by necessity, based on monetary
values, not human values. California law requires couples to divide assets 
up fifty-fifty. This rule sounds neat and reasonable, but if both parties decide
that they want the same painting, another painting of equal value may not do
the trick.
The key to dealing with these issues is putting together your support team.
The lead person is your attorney. Sometimes, other experts (such as an
accountant) are part of that team. If you have children, you may want to
include a family counselor. Finally, include the inevitable friend or friends.
343
Chapter 21: Ten Key Negotiations of Your Life

Be careful whom you use as your friendly ear during this process. You are
very vulnerable at this time. The person to whom you spill your guts  can just
as easily steer you in a destructive direction  as keep you focused on the
long-range goal of a better life for you and your kids (if you have any). 
Be equally careful when choosing a divorce lawyer. Rates charged by these
lawyers vary widely. Ask friends and acquaintances who have been through
this process to recommend a lawyer. Ask any lawyers you know to recommend
a divorce lawyer for you — even if your lawyer friend also handles divorces.
Always interview at least two or three lawyers before picking one to use for
your divorce. Divorce is a difficult process at best. You want someone who is
affable, available, and able.
When children are involved, divorce negotiation is different than most other
negotiations. In this special case, you and your soon-to-be ex will have a con-
tinuing relationship. Remember the advice flight attendants give you before
your airplane takes off. In case of an accident, put the oxygen mask over your
face first and then give the oxygen mask to your child. This is sound advice.
You can’t help the kids while you are emotionally untethered. Keep your
needs and wants in mind at all times so you and your situation remain as
healthy as possible while you tend to your kids’ needs.
Never include the children in the financial aspects of the divorce. Divorce 
has an adverse effect on children; don’t aggravate the situation by adding
financial stress to your child’s emotional stress. 
If you have children who will be affected by your divorce, be sure to choose a
lawyer who is a specialist in the areas of child support and visitation rights.
In every divorce, emotions run high, and anger and resentment tend to
bubble over. Add one or more children to the mix, and the situation is even
more complicated and emotionally difficult. That’s why you should read and
reread Chapters 12 about the pause button and handling hot button issues.
This chapter will be part of your support system during the entire process.
Negotiating about Naptime, Curfew,
Dessert, and Other Childhood Necessities
The six steps of negotiating are essential in negotiating with children. The 
following sections show you how these steps can help you.
344
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Preparing to negotiate with your kids
Preparing involves knowing what’s fair to expect from a child at each age.
Ideally, children’s responsibility and freedom should increase with age. You
get into trouble when you expect too much too soon, or expect too little too
late. You need to explore some general characteristics of children at each age
by reading books on human development or checking with your pediatrician.
In addition, thoroughly understand your own values and priorities so you can
pass these on to your kids.
Setting limits for minors
You should sharply define your limits. Telling your children that they may
stay out a little past curfew, but not too much, is inviting trouble. Vague 
statements leave teens without a clear criterion for making decisions.
Instead, state the limit firmly, in a way that says you mean business. And
state consequences along with the limit. Setting the stage for success means
giving your children advance warning and reminders. Of course, the limits
you set depend on the age of the child.
Don’t let your warnings and reminders turn into nagging. Make your limits
clear and then avoid repeating them unnecessarily. If your child crosses your
clearly stated limits, you need to implement consequences. Merely repeating
the limit again and again numbs your child to the importance of the limit.
Give children a voice in setting limits and tell them the reasons behind 
the rules.
Listening to your kids
Listening to your children means paying attention. Remember the following
tips to create a healthy atmosphere of clear communication between yourself
and your children:
 Don’t do other things while your children are talking to you. Give your
kids the same respect you give your spouse and co-workers.
 Avoid the “Mommy, MOMMY, MOMMY!!” syndrome by answering your
children the first time they call you. Acknowledging your child (even if
simply by saying “Just a minute, dear” or “Mommy’s talking to someone
else right now”) shows respect and fosters a sense of empowerment.
 Don’t jump to conclusions. Listen to everything your child is telling you,
from start to finish, before responding.
345
Chapter 21: Ten Key Negotiations of Your Life

Parenting with clarity
Being clear with children means describing the situation — not evaluating
the child’s character. Avoid blaming. Restate negative remarks positively.
Emphasize what your children can do, rather than what they cannot do.
Praise your children whenever you can. Describe the specific event that
pleases you and your specific feelings; then let your children draw conclu-
sions about their character.
Praise: “Thank you for being early on curfew. I know I don’t have to 
worry about you.”
Child’s inference: “My parent loves and cares about me. I am 
trustworthy.”
Pushing the parental pause button
Knowing when and how to push the pause button (covered in Chapter 12) is
the most important skill when dealing with children. Everyone carries around
a lifetime of baggage. Until you become a parent, you may not realize how
many things can make you angry. Often parents express their worry about
their kids as anger. And the sometimes overwhelming responsibilities of 
parenting can cause angry outbursts as well. 
Instead of trying to suppress anger, express it in nondestructive ways, 
without insult. Describe what you see, how you feel, and what needs to 
be done, without attacking the child’s character. Instead of saying, “You 
are such a slob, leaving wet towels on the floor,” say, “When I see towels 
on the floor, I get angry. I think towels belong on the rack.” Express your
anger responsibly, with “I” statements followed by a respectful request for 
a solution.
Closing with kids
Closing the deal is as challenging with children as it is in business. You must
make sure that both you and your children understand the final agreement
the same way. Don’t assume that your children automatically understand
what you expect of them.
After a negotiation, write the agreement down. Have the kids write it down,
too, if they are old enough to print letters. Keep the agreement handy in case
the situation resurfaces.
346
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Choosing Medical Care for 
an Incapacitated Parent
Choosing how to care for an incapacitated parent is a tragic circumstance
that visits all too many families. The person who has provided leadership 
in the family is too ill to make decisions or articulate desires. The loss puts
everybody in emotional upheaval. Decisions must be made. At a time when
everybody needs love and support, family members begin to argue.
Whatever you do, avoid the “Mama woulda wanted . . .” syndrome. Unless
Mama (or Papa) has clearly and uniformly expressed a preference on the 
subject in a way that applies unmistakably to the situation at hand, don’t 
presume to know what Mama or Papa would have wanted. Even living wills
that purport to give guidance are often phrased in such general terms as to
leave families without the clear guidelines needed.
With rare exception, those people claiming to know what an incapacitated
parent would want are really expressing their own feelings about the subject,
as you can see in Table 21-1.
Table 21-1
What’s Said vs. What’s Meant
People Often Say Something Like . . .
When They Really Mean . . .
“Mama wouldn’t have wanted to be 
“I’m hurting. It causes me pain to see 
helpless like this. At least let her keep

her dignity.”
suffering.”
“Dad always put up the good fight. 
“I can’t stand the thought of being 
He would want every chance to beat 
without Dad. I want to hang on to him 
this thing.”
with everything that medical science has
to offer.”
Stick with the phrases on the right. By making “I” statements, you get your
honest feelings out in the open. By saying “Mama woulda wanted . . .” you
mask your honest feelings. If someone else tries to tell you what a parent
would have wanted, listen carefully. In 99 times out of 100, what you’re hear-
ing is exactly how this person feels about the situation. Let the person speak,
pause for a moment, and then verify the true source of the feelings. Say, “Now
tell me how you feel.”
347
Chapter 21: Ten Key Negotiations of Your Life

Understand that some people are uncomfortable expressing their own feel-
ings about the sick parent. That’s why “Mama woulda wanted . . .” statements
flourish. A good question that can help pull out the true feeling is: “In an ideal
world, knowing the medical information we have, how would you like to
handle this situation?”
There is no right or wrong approach to deciding how to care for an incapaci-
tated parent. The key is to get through this crisis in a way that brings the
remaining family members closer, instead of pushing them apart. The impor-
tant skills here are listening with respect and love to the other members of
the family and being clear about your own feelings. I discuss listening in Part
II of this book.
Buying Funeral Services
Good news! Gone are the days when everything about funeral arrangements
was a big and baffling negotiation. The Federal Trade Commission now
requires morticians and cemeteries to issue written, itemized price lists.
They can no longer offer a flat rate and require you to negotiate for the 
products and services included in the final price.
Funeral homes in California must provide written price lists. It’s the law!
Because written price lists are easy to compare, you commonly find a mortu-
ary’s lowest prices printed right along with the prices for the fanciest form of
service. You also find that the price of specific goods and services holds true
to the printed price list.
The biggest single item in most funeral services is the casket, which can
range in price from $500 to over $25,000. An ambitious funeral director may
try to gently persuade you that you want the very best (as in the most expen-
sive). So the toughest negotiation you face is with yourself. This is your last
opportunity to display your love and affection for the departed; you may
have an understandable tendency to overdo it. Restrain yourself.
The most important expression of respect you can offer the departed is the
continued love and warm feelings of yourself and other loved ones. Spend
your time, energy, and money in getting all the friends and relatives together
and sharing memories. That is the heart of the funeral.
Because a little emotional distance from the decision-making process is
important during a time of personal loss, carry your own personal pause
button with you to the funeral home. If you have time, look over Chapter 12.
Don’t forget that people who cared about you while they lived wouldn’t want
you to go into debt over their deaths.
