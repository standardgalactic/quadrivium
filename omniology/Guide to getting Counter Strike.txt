Guide to getting Counter Strike: Source 
Beta Edition after closing date 
Game link: http://store.steampowered.com/app/260/ 
All you need is a working steam account and it does not need any games on it. 
 
1) Start up steam and sign into your account. 
 
2) Open up your internet browser, not the steam store or community 
browser. 
 
3) In the browser bar enter the following: steam://validate/260 
 
4) It will bring up a menu saying validating counter strike source beta, wait 
for this to finish. 
 
5) Once that has finished then proceed to enter this:                                
steam://install/260 
 
6) The steam store should open up on the beta page and your download 
will start now. 
 
7) By this time your counter strike source beta should be on download and 
you will be playing it in no time.
