  Introduction      1
Introduction
I
f you’ve already bought this book or are thinking about buying it, it’s probably too late — too 
late, that is, to change your mind and get the heck out of calculus. (If you’ve still got a chance 
to break free, get out and run for the hills!) Okay, so you’re stuck with calculus; you’re past 
the point of no return. Is there any hope? Of course! For starters, buy this gem of a book and my 
other classic, Calculus For Dummies (also published by Wiley). In both books, you find calculus 
explained in plain English with a minimum of technical jargon. Calculus For Dummies covers 
topics in greater depth. Calculus Workbook For Dummies, 3rd Edition, gives you the opportunity to 
master the calculus topics you study in class or in Calculus For Dummies through a couple hundred 
practice problems that will leave you giddy with the joy of learning . . . or pulling your hair out.
In all seriousness, calculus is not nearly as difficult as you’d guess from its reputation. It’s a 
logical extension of algebra and geometry, and many calculus topics can be easily understood 
when you see the algebra and geometry that underlie them.
It should go without saying that regardless of how well you think you understand calculus, you 
won’t fully understand it until you get your hands dirty by actually doing problems. On that 
score, you’ve come to the right place.
About This Book
Calculus Workbook For Dummies, 3rd Edition, like Calculus For Dummies, is intended for three 
groups of readers: high school seniors or college students in their first calculus course, students 
who’ve taken calculus but who need a refresher to get ready for other pursuits, and adults of 
all ages who want to practice the concepts they learned in Calculus For Dummies or elsewhere.
Whenever possible, I bring calculus down to earth by showing its connections to basic algebra 
and geometry. Many calculus problems look harder than they actually are because they contain 
so many fancy, foreign-looking symbols. When you see that the problems aren’t that different 
from related algebra and geometry problems, they become far less intimidating.
I supplement the problem explanations with tips, shortcuts, and mnemonic devices. Often, a 
simple tip or memory trick can make it much easier to learn and retain a new, difficult concept.
This book uses certain conventions:
»
» Variables are in italics.
»
» Important math terms are often in italics and defined when necessary.
»
» Extra-hard problems are marked with an asterisk. You may want to skip these if you’re 
prone to cerebral hemorrhaging.

2      Calculus Workbook For Dummies
Like all For Dummies books, you can use this book as a reference. You don’t need to read it cover 
to cover or work through all problems in order. You may need more practice in some areas than 
others, so you may choose to do only half of the practice problems in some sections or none at all.
However, as you’d expect, the order of the topics in Calculus Workbook For Dummies, 3rd Edi-
tion, follows the order of the traditional curriculum of a first-year calculus course. You can, 
therefore, go through the book in order, using it to supplement your coursework. If I do say so 
myself, I expect you’ll find that many of the explanations, methods, strategies, and tips in this 
book will make problems you found difficult or confusing in class seem much easier.
Foolish Assumptions
Now that you know a bit about how I see calculus, here’s what I’m assuming about you:
»
» You haven’t forgotten all the algebra, geometry, and trigonometry you learned in high school. 
If you have, calculus will be really tough. Just about every single calculus problem involves 
algebra, a great many use trig, and quite a few use geometry. If you’re really rusty, go back to 
these basics and do some brushing up. This book contains some practice problems to give 
you a little pre-calc refresher, and Calculus For Dummies has an excellent pre-calc review.
»
» You’re willing to invest some time and effort in doing these practice problems. As with any-
thing, practice makes perfect, and, also like anything, practice sometimes involves struggle. 
But that’s a good thing. Ideally, you should give these problems your best shot before you 
turn to the solutions. Reading through the solutions can be a good way to learn, but you’ll 
usually learn more if you push yourself to solve the problems on your own — even if that 
means going down a few dead ends.
Icons Used in This Book
The icons help you to quickly find some of the most critical ideas in the book.
Next to this icon are important pre-calc or calculus definitions, theorems, and so on.
This icon is next to — are you sitting down? — example problems.
The tip icon gives you shortcuts, memory devices, strategies, and so on.
Ignore these icons and you’ll be doing lots of extra work and probably getting the wrong answer.

Getting Down to Basics: 
Algebra and Geometry
I
 know, I know. This is a calculus workbook, so what’s with the algebra and geometry? Don’t 
worry; I’m not going to waste too many precious pages with algebra and geometry, but these 
topics are essential for calculus. You can no more do calculus without algebra than you can 
write French poetry without French. And basic geometry (but not geometry proofs) is critically 
important because much of calculus involves real-world problems that include angles, slopes, 
shapes, and so on. So in this chapter — and in Chapter 2 on functions and trigonometry —  
I give you some quick problems to help you brush up on your skills. If you’ve already got these 
topics down pat, you can skip to Chapter 3.
In addition to working through the problems in Chapters 1 and 2 in this book, you may want to 
check out the great pre-calc review in Calculus For Dummies, 2nd Edition.
Fraction Frustration
Many, many math students hate fractions. I’m not sure why, because there’s nothing especially 
difficult about them. Perhaps for some students, fraction concepts didn’t completely click when 
they first studied them, and then fractions became a nagging frustration whenever they came 
up in subsequent math courses. Whatever the cause, if you don’t like fractions, try to get over it. 
Fractions really are a piece o’ cake; you’ll have to deal with them in every math course you take.

8      PART 1  Pre-Calculus Review
You can’t do calculus without a good grasp of fractions. For example, the very definition of the 
derivative is based on a fraction called the difference quotient. And, on top of that, the symbol for 
the derivative, dy
dx
, is a fraction. So, if you’re a bit rusty with fractions, get up to speed with the 
following problems — or else!
Q.	 Solve: a

Geometry: When Am I Ever Going to Need It?
You can use calculus to solve many real-world problems that involve two- or three-dimensional 
shapes and various curves, surfaces, and volumes — such as calculating the rate at which the 
water level is falling in a cone-shaped tank or determining the dimensions that maximize the 
volume of a cylindrical soup can. So the geometry formulas for perimeter, area, volume, surface 
area, and so on will come in handy. You should also know things like the Pythagorean Theorem, 
proportional shapes, and basic coordinate geometry, like the midpoint and distance formulas.

8
, which equals zero.
Here’s a great way to think about this problem and fractions in general. Consider the follow-
ing simple division or fraction problem: 8
2
4. Note the multiplication problem implicit here: 
2 times 4 is 8. This multiplication idea is a great way to think about how fractions work. So in 
the current problem, you can consider 5
0
____, and use the multiplication idea: 0 times ____ 
equals 5. What works in the blank? Nothing, obviously, because 0 times anything is 0. The 
answer, therefore, is undefined.
Note that if you think about these two fractions as examples of slope rise
run
, 5
0
 has a rise of 5 
and a run of 0, which gives you a vertical line that has sort of an infinite steepness or slope 
(that’s why it’s undefined). Or just remember that it’s impossible to drive up a vertical road, 
so it’s impossible to come up with a slope for a vertical line. The fraction 0
8
, on the other 
hand, has a rise of 0 and a run of 8, which gives you a horizontal line that has no steepness at 
all and thus has the perfectly ordinary slope of zero. Of course, it’s also perfectly ordinary to 
drive on a horizontal road.

When you’re working a problem and can’t remember the algebra rule, try the problem with 
numbers instead of variables. Just replace the variables with simple, round numbers and 
work out the numerical problem. (Don’t use 0, 1, or 2 because they have special properties 
that can mess up your test.) Whatever works for the numbers will work with variables, and 
whatever doesn’t work with numbers won’t work with variables. Watch what happens if you

5.	 You may also want to express the answer symbolically.
Because x can equal a number in the left region or a number in the right region, this is an

course, because zero squared equals zero. And you know that the absolute value of –1 is 1; 
you just have to be careful not to goof up with all those negative signs and subtraction signs.

to a root:

Make sure you know this factoring rule (and the corresponding FOILing rule, which is the fac-

you can rewrite the binomial as

something else squared. If you can, then the first blank is your a, and the second blank is your b.

10

The pentagon has five sides, so the perimeter is 5 5 2, or 25 2.
25	 Compute the area of the parallelogram. The answer is 20 2.
The height of the parallelogram is 4
2 , or 2 2, because its height is one of the legs of a  
45°-45°-90° triangle. The parallelogram’s base is 10. So, because the area of a parallelogram

29	 What’s the length of altitude of triangle ABC? 2 3.
There are a few ways to solve this problem, all of which use your knowledge of 30°-60°-90° 
triangles. Here’s a quick and easy way. Triangle ABC is a 30°-60°-90° triangle, and the short 
leg of a 30°-60°-90° triangle is half as long as its hypotenuse, so BC is 4. Triangle BCD is 
another 30°-60°-90° triangle, so its short leg is half as long as its hypotenuse. That gives DC  
a length of 2. Then, because BD is the long leg of 30°-60°-90° triangle BCD, it’s 3 times its 
short leg. That gives you the answer of 2 3, for altitude BD.

22      PART 1  Pre-Calculus Review
30	 What’s the perimeter of triangle ABD? 6
6 3 .
Triangle ABD is yet another 30°-60°-90° triangle, so its hypotenuse is twice as long as its 
short leg, BD. That gives you a length of 4 3 for AB. Next, AD is 8 – 2, or 6. The perimeter 
of triangle ABD is therefore 6
2 3
4 3, or 6
6 3.
31	 What’s the area of quadrilateral PQRS? 27
9 3.
Piece o’ cake. Begin with triangle QRS, which you can see is a 45°-45°-90° triangle. The legs 
of a 45°-45°-90° triangle are equal, so QR is 6, and the hypotenuse of a 45°-45°-90° triangle 
is 2 times either leg, so QS is 6 2.
Now you see that the hypotenuse of triangle TQS is twice as long as its short leg, QT , which 
tells you that triangle TQS is a 30°-60°-90° triangle. That makes TQS  60°, and you also  
get the length of TS , which, since it’s the long leg of 30°-60°-90° triangle TQS, has to be  
3 times as long as its short leg, QT . So TS  is 3 6.
Next, since PQR is 150°, and angles TQS and SQR are 60° and 45°, respectively, you subtract 
to get 45° for PQT . That makes triangle PQT a 45°-45°-90° triangle, and thus PT , like QT , 
is 3 2.
Now you have everything you need to figure the area of the quadrilateral. The area of a right 
triangle equals half the product of its legs, so here’s the final math:

Make sure you know your 30°-60°-90° and 45°-45°-90° triangles!
32	 What’s the perimeter of triangle BCD? 10 1
3
.
To do this problem and the next one, you first have to establish that the two triangles are 
similar (the same shape). Because segments BD and AE are parallel, angles BDC and AED are 
corresponding angles and are therefore congruent. And the two triangles share angle C. Thus, 
by the AA (angle-angle) theorem, triangles BCD and ACE are similar.
To get the length of BC, you could use similar triangle proportions, but it’s a little bit quicker 
to use the side-splitter theorem, which tells you that BC
AB
4
8
. Since the ratio equals 4
8
, you 
can set BC equal to 4x and AB equal to 8x. They add up to 13, so you have 4
8
13
x
x
, or 
x
13
12
. Plugging that into 4x gives you 13
3
 for the length of BC.
Now all you need to finish is the length of BD. Did you fall for the nasty trap in this problem? 
When you see the 4 and the 8 along the right side of triangle ACE, it’s easy to make the mis-
take of thinking that BD and AE will be in the same 4-to-8 or 1-to-2 ratio and conclude that 
BD therefore equals 3. But BD and AE are not in a 1-to-2 ratio. To get BD, you have to use a 
similar triangle proportion like the following:

Cross multiplication gives you a length of 2 for BD.
Adding up the three sides (4, 13
3
, and 2) gives you the perimeter.
33	 What’s the ratio of the area of triangle BCD to the area of triangle ACE in the figure for 
Problem 32? 1
9  or 1 : 9. 
If you know the appropriate theorem for this problem, the problem’s a snap. If you don’t 
know the theorem, the problem’s very hard. You could also get tripped up if you thought you 
needed the areas of the two triangles (you don’t), and you could be thrown off by the trap 
referred to in Problem 32.
All you need is the theorem that tells you that the ratio of the areas of similar figures is equal 
to the square of the ratio of any of their corresponding sides. For this problem, the theorem 
tells you that

(Note that you did not need to know the altitudes of the triangles or their areas in order to 
compute the ratio of their areas.)
In plain English, the idea is simply that if you take any 2-D shape and blow it up to, say,  
4 times its height, its area will grow 42, or 16 times. By the way, if you blow up a 3-D shape, 
say, 4 times its height, its volume will grow 43, or 64 times.
34	 What’s the area of parallelogram PQRS? 3
2 xy. 
When you see a 60° angle in a problem, one of the first things you should consider is the 
30°-60°-90° triangle. Sure enough, that’s the key to this problem.
All you need to do is to drop an altitude from Q straight down to base PS , making a right 
angle with PS . Call the point where the altitude meets the base point T. Triangle PQT  
contains a 60° angle and a 90° angle, so it has to be a 30°-60°-90° triangle. The short leg of a 
30°-60°-90° triangle is half as long as its hypotenuse, so PT  is half of PQ, or 1
2 y. Then, 
because the long leg of a 30°-60°-90° triangle is 3 times as long as its short leg, altitude 
QT  is 3 1

Now that you have the altitude and the base of the parallelogram, you just plug them into the

I
n Chapter 2, you continue your pre-calc warm-up that you began in Chapter 1. If algebra 
is the language calculus is written in, you might think of functions as the “sentences” of 
­calculus. And they’re as important to calculus as sentences are to writing. You can’t do 
calculus without functions. Trig is important not because it’s an essential element of calculus —  
you could do a great deal of calculus without trig  — but because many calculus problems 
­happen to involve trigonometry.
Figuring Out Your Functions

ing calculator in “y =” or graphing mode. The line y

something (unless you write y
something
 
, which 
doesn’t count).
You can determine whether or not the graph of a curve is a function with the vertical line test. If 
there’s no place on the graph where you could draw a vertical line that touches the curve more 
than once, then it is a function. And if you can draw a vertical line anywhere on the graph that 
touches the curve more than once, then it is not a function.

Trigonometric Calisthenics
Believe it or not, trigonometry is a very practical, real-world branch of mathematics, because 
it involves the measurement of lengths and angles. Surveyors use it when surveying property, 
making topographical maps, and so on. The ancient Greeks and Alexandrians, among others, 
knew not only simple SohCahToa stuff, but a lot of sophisticated trig as well. They used it for 
building, navigation, and astronomy. Trigonometry comes up a lot in the study of calculus, so 
if you snoozed through high school trig, WAKE UP! and review the following problems. (If you 
want to delve further into trig and functions, check out Calculus For Dummies, 2nd Edition, also 
written by me and published by Wiley.)

Solutions to Functions and Trigonometry

Which of the four relations in the figure represent functions and why? A and D.
The circle and the S-shaped curve are not functions because they fail the vertical line test: 
You can draw a vertical line somewhere on their graphs that touches the curve more than 
once. These two curves also fail the algebraic test: A curve is a function if for each input  
value (x) there is at most one output value (y). The circle and the S-shaped curve have some x’s 
that correspond to more than one y, so they are not functions. Note that the reverse is not 
true: You can have a function where there are two or more input values (x’s) for a single 
output value (y).

­following figure. Note that q x  contains “x plus 3,” but the horizontal transformation is  
3 to the left — the opposite of what you’d expect. The “+5” in q x  tells you to go up 5.
Horizontal transformations always work opposite the way you’d expect. Vertical 
­transformations, on the other hand, go the normal way — up for plus and down for minus.

a.	 What’s the domain of g x

? x
4.
You can’t take the square root of a negative (not for calculus, anyway, which deals with 
real numbers) so. . .
4
0
4
x
x
That’s all there is to it. Don’t forget, there’s nothing wrong with the square root of zero, 
which equals zero. So 4 is in the domain of g.
b.	 What’s the range of g? g x
0.
Range questions are usually a bit harder than domain questions. With domain questions, 
you just have to figure out what x cannot be, and the domain is everything else. With 
range questions, there’s no method quite that straightforward.
To tackle a range question, you can experiment with different input values and see what 
happens with the output. And, of course, you can graph the function to actually see the 
range, though that won’t always give you the precise answer. Sometimes, like in Problem 8, 
you can’t get the precise answer without doing some calculus.
You can solve the current problem easily by just looking at the graph of the function. But 
it’ll also come in handy to familiarize yourself with the following approach.
You can answer the current range question if you know what the graph of y
x  looks 
like. If you don’t remember the graph, you should graph it now on your calculator. You’ll 
see the top half of a sideways parabola that begins at 0 0
, 
 and goes up and to the right 
forever. Because it begins at a height of zero and goes up forever, the range is y
0.
The current function, g x
x
4
, is a transformation of the parent function, y
x . 
There are two transformations: the 4 and the minus sign, which is the same as multiply-
ing x by –1. Because both transformations occur “inside” the function and change the 
input of the function, they are both horizontal transformations. (To transform the parent 
function, y
x , into g x
x
4
, you’d first slide it 4 to the left and then flip it over 
the y axis.) Horizontal transformations change the domain but have no impact on the 
range, so the range of g x
x
4
 is the same as the range of y
x , namely, y
0.

5
?

or
5,


x
x
.
Just ask yourself what x is not allowed to be. x can’t equal zero because that would make the 
denominator zero. And x can’t equal –5 because that would give you the square root of zero, 
which is zero, so, again, the denominator would equal zero. That takes care of the zero 
denominator issue. Then there’s the issue of no negatives under the square root. So x can’t be 
less than –5. That does it. The domain is everything else — everything except what we just 
excluded.

That’s it for the math, but one issue remains. The domain of a function equals the range of 
its inverse, and the range of a function equals the domain of its inverse. The range of f is 
0, 
, so that must become the domain of its inverse. So you have to restrict the domain  
of f
1 to 0, 
. That does it.

19	 What’s sec 11

? 2 3

Of course, you can just look at the unit circle to get your answer. Secant is the reciprocal of 
cosine. The unit circle tells you that cos 11
6
 (or 330 degrees) is 3
2
. Flip that upside down 
for your answer: 2
3
, or 2 3
3
.
But if you’re ambitious and want to try this one in your head, you first notice that 330 
degrees doesn’t end in a 5, so you have a 30 60 90
-
-
 triangle, not a 45 45 90
-
-
 triangle. 
Then you just picture where 330 degrees is — it’s in the 4th quadrant close to 360 degrees 
(the x axis). So your 30 60 90
-
-
 triangle has to be wide and short, which has a big x coordi-
nate, 3
2
, and a small y coordinate, 1

. Because secant is the reciprocal of cosine, you care 
about the x coordinate, 3
2 . Flip it upside down for your answer.
20	 What’s csc 4

The unit circle gives you your answer. Cosecant is the reciprocal of sine. The unit circle tells 
you that sin 4

. Flip that upside down for your answer: 
2
3
,  
or 2 3

To do this one in your head, you first notice that 240 degrees doesn’t end in a 5, so you have 
a 30 60 90
-
-
 triangle, not a 45 45 90
-
-
 triangle. Then you just picture where 240 degrees 
is — it’s in the 3rd quadrant close to 270 degrees (the y axis). So your 30 60 90
-
-
 triangle  
has to be narrow and tall, which has a small x coordinate, 1
2
, and a big y coordinate, 
3
2
 
(note that in this context, when I talk about a big or small coordinate, I’m ignoring the  
positive/negative issue). Because cosecant is the reciprocal of sine, you care about the y coor-
dinate, 
3
2
. Flip it upside down for your answer.

CHAPTER 2  Funky Functions and Tricky Trig      39
21	 What’s tan
cot
3
3
? Undefined.
This problem is a bit tricky because there’s a catch (actually two catches). But other than 
that, it’s actually short and simple. An angle of 3  radians is the same as  radians, so you 
just use the coordinates from the unit circle at  radians or 180 degrees — namely, 
1 0
, 
. 
Tangent equals sin
cos
, or y
x
, so tan 3
0
1
0. Cotangent is the reciprocal of tangent, so 
cot 3
1
0
, which is undefined. (Don’t forget, you can’t divide by zero!) Thus, your answer 
for tan
cot
3
3
 is zero times undefined, which is undefined.
Here are the two catches: First, you might think that zero times undefined is zero because 
zero times anything is zero. But it doesn’t work that way. If any piece of a problem is unde-
fined, the answer is undefined. The second catch is that you could mistakenly conclude that 
since tangent and cotangent are reciprocals, their product would be 1. That is generally true 
of reciprocals, but not here because, again, one of them is undefined. The two values you get 
here, zero and undefined, are sort of, but not technically, reciprocals. So you can’t multiply 
them to get 1. No matter how you look at it, the answer is undefined.
22	 What’s sin

You should be able to picture in your head that the coordinates on the unit circle at 30, 45,

, respectively. So, sin 30

and 
cos 45

.
For the tangent piece of the problem, here’s a tip. Tangent equals y
x
, but when doing tangent 
problems on the unit circle, you don’t have to bother dividing the y fraction by the x fraction. 
The denominators of these fractions always cancel, so you only have to put the y numerator 
over the x numerator, thus: tan 60
3

.

A Graph Is Worth a 
Thousand Words: Limits 
and Continuity
Y
ou can use ordinary algebra and geometry when the things in a math problem aren’t 
changing (sort of) and when lines are straight. But you need calculus when things are 
changing (these changing things are often represented as curves). For example, you need 
calculus to analyze something like the motion of the space shuttle during the beginning of its 
flight because its acceleration is changing every split second.
Ordinary algebra and geometry fall short for such things because the algebra or geometry 
formula that works one moment no longer works a millionth of a second later. Calculus, on 
the other hand, chops up these constantly changing things — like the motion of the space 
shuttle — into such tiny bits (actually infinitely small bits) that within each bit, things don’t 
change. Then you can use ordinary algebra and geometry.
Limits are the “magical” trick or tool that does this chopping up of something into infinitely 
small bits. It’s the mathematics of limits that makes calculus work. Limits are so essential to 
calculus that the two bedrock ideas of calculus — the formal definitions of the derivative and 
the definite integral — both involve limits.
If — when your parents asked you, “What do you want to be when you grow up?” — you 
responded, “Why, a mathematician, of course,” then you may want to spend a great deal of 
time studying the deep and rich subtleties of continuity. For the rest of you, the concept of

continuity is a total no-brainer. If you can draw a graph without lifting your pen or pencil 
from the page, the graph is continuous. If you can’t — because there’s a break in the graph —  
then the graph is not continuous. That’s all there is to it. By the way, there are some subtle and 
technical connections between limits and continuity (which I don’t want to get into), and that’s 
why they’re in the same chapter. But, be honest now, did you buy this book because you were 
dying to learn about mathematical subtleties and technicalities?
Digesting the Definitions: Limit and Continuity
This short section covers a couple formal definitions and a couple other things you need to 
know about limits and continuity. Here’s the formal, three-part definition of a limit:
For a function f x  and a real number a, lim
x
af x  exists if and only if
1.	
lim
x
a f x  exists. In other words, there must be a limit from the left.
2.	
lim
x
a f x
 
exists. There must be a limit from the right.
3.	
lim
lim
x
a
x
a
f x
f x
 
The limit from the left must equal the limit from the right.
(Note that this definition does not apply to limits as x approaches infinity or negative infinity.)
And here’s the definition of continuity: A function f x  is continuous at a point a if three con-
ditions are satisfied:
1.	 f a  is defined.
2.	 lim
x
a f x
 
exists.
3.	 f a

Taking a Closer Look: Limit  
and Continuity Graphs
In this section, you get more practice at solving limit and continuity problems visually. Then 
in Chapter 4, you solve limit problems numerically (with your  calculator) and symbolically 
(with algebra).
Use Figure 3-2 to answer Problems 5 through 10.

Solutions for Limits and Continuity

At which of the following x values are all three requirements for the existence of a limit sat-
isfied, and what is the limit at those x values? x = –2, 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, and 11.
At 0, the limit is 2.
At 4, the limit is 5.
At 8, the limit is 3.
At 10, the limit is 5.
To make a long story short, a limit exists at a particular x value of a curve when the curve is 
heading toward some particular y value and keeps heading toward that y value as you continue 
to zoom in on the curve at the x value. The curve must head toward that y value (that height) 
as you move along the curve both from the right and from the left (unless the limit is one 
where x approaches infinity). I emphasize heading toward because what happens precisely 
at the given x value isn’t relevant to this limit inquiry. That’s why there is a limit at a hole 
like the ones at x
8 and x
10.
2	
For the rest of the x values, state which of the three limit requirements are not satisfied. If one 
or both one-sided limits exist at any of these x values, give the value of the one-sided limit.
At –2 and 5, all three conditions fail.
At 2, 6, and 11, only the third requirement is not satisfied.
At 2, the limit from the left equals 5 and the limit from the right equals 3.
At 6, the limit from the left is 2 and the limit from the right is 3.
Finally, at 11, the limit from the left equals 3 and the limit from the right equals 5.
3	
At which of the x values are all three requirements for continuity satisfied?
The function in Figure 3-1 is continuous at 0 and 4. The common-sense way of thinking 
about continuity is that a curve is continuous wherever you can draw the curve without 
taking your pen off the paper. It should be obvious that that’s true at 0 and 4, but not at any 
of the other listed x values.
4	
For the rest of the x values, state which of the three continuity requirements are not satisfied.
All listed x values other than 0 and 4 are points of discontinuity. A discontinuity is just a 
highfalutin calculus way of saying a gap. If you’d have to take your pen off the paper at 
some point when drawing a curve, then the curve has a discontinuity there.
At 5 and 11, all three conditions fail.
At –2, 2, and 6, continuity requirements 2 and 3 are not satisfied.
At 10, requirements 1 and 3 are not satisfied.
At 8, requirement 3 is not satisfied.

of a solid one — when you arrive at the gap. But the hollow dot at 5, 6
 
 is irrelevant to the 
limit question — just as in Problem 8 where the hole was irrelevant.
11	
List the x coordinates of all discontinuities of f, state whether the discontinuities are remov-
able or nonremovable, and give the type of discontinuity — hole, jump, or infinite.
At x
–7, the vertical asymptote, there is a nonremovable, infinite discontinuity.
At x
5, there’s a nonremovable, jump discontinuity.
At x
13 and x
18, there are holes which are removable discontinuities. Though infinitely 
small, these are nevertheless discontinuities. They’re “removable” discontinuities because 
you can “fix” the function by plugging the holes.
12	 lim sin
x
x does not exist. There’s no limit as x approaches infinity because the curve oscillates — 
it never settles down to one precise y value. (The three-part definition of a limit does not apply 
to limits at infinity.)
13	 lim

0. In contrast to sin x, this function does home in on a single value; as you go out 
farther and farther to the right, the function gets closer and closer to zero, so that’s the limit.

Of course, you can graph f with your graphing calculator, but it’s a good idea to graph func-
tions by hand now and then. It helps you understand why the function looks the way it does. 
All you need to do to sketch this one by hand is to plug a few negative and positive numbers 
into x. You’ll soon see that whenever the input is negative, the output is –1, and whenever 
the input is positive, the output is 1. And you need the hollow dots on the y axis at –1 and 1 
because f 0  is undefined. Your sketch should look something like the following figure.

problems, what actually happens to the function (namely, whether it exists and, if it exists, 
what it equals) when x gets to the limit number doesn’t affect the limit answer. All that mat-
ters is what’s happening to the function as x gets closer and closer to the limit number. As x 
gets closer and closer to zero from the left, y is staying precisely at –1, so that’s the limit.

CHAPTER 4  Nitty-Gritty Limit Problems      53
Nitty-Gritty Limit 
Problems
I
n this chapter, you practice two very different methods for solving limit problems: using 
algebra and using your calculator. Learning the algebraic techniques are valuable for two 
reasons. The first, incredibly important reason is that the mathematics involved in the alge-
braic methods is beautiful, pure, and rigorous; and, second — something so trivial that perhaps 
I shouldn’t mention it — you’ll be tested on it. Do I have my priorities straight or what? The 
calculator techniques are useful for several reasons: 1) You can solve some limit problems on 
your calculator that are either impossible or just very difficult to do with algebra, 2) You can 
check your algebraic answers with your calculator, and 3) Limit problems can be solved with a 
calculator when you’re not required to show your work — like maybe on a multiple-choice test.
But before you get to these two major techniques, a little rote learning is in order. A few limits 
are a bit tricky to justify or prove, so to make your life easier, simply commit them to memory. 
Here they are:

» lim
x

(y
c is a horizontal line, so the limit equals c regardless of the arrow-number — the  
constant after the arrow.)

Solving Limits with Algebra
You can solve limit problems with several algebraic techniques (discussed later). But before 
you try any algebra, your first step should always be to plug the arrow-number into the limit 
expression. If the function is continuous at the arrow-number (which it usually will be) and if 
plugging in results in an ordinary number, then that’s the answer. You’re done. For example, 
to evaluate lim
x
x
x
5
2
10
, just plug in the arrow-number. You get 5
10
5
3
2
. That’s all there is to 
it. Don’t forget to plug in!
You’re also done if plugging in the arrow-number gives you a number or infinity or negative 
infinity over zero, like 3
0
, or 0
; in these cases the limit does not exist (DNE).
When plugging in fails because it gives you 0
0
, you’ve got a nontrivial limit problem and a bit of 
work to do. You have to convert the fraction into some expression where plugging in does work. 
Here are some algebraic methods you can try:
»
» FOILing
»
» Factoring
»
» Finding the least common denominator
»
» Canceling
»
» Simplification
»
» Conjugate multiplication
A few of these methods are illustrated in the following examples. You’ll practice all the meth-
ods in the practice problems.

Pulling Out Your Calculator: Useful “Cheating”
Your calculator is a great tool for understanding limits. It can often give you a better feel for 
how a limit works than the algebraic techniques can. A limit problem asks you to determine 
what the y value of a function is zeroing in on as the x value approaches a particular number. 
With your calculator, you can actually witness the process and the result. You can solve a limit 
problem with your calculator in three different ways:
»
» Method I: First, store a number into x that’s extremely close to the arrow-number, enter 
the limit expression in the home screen, and hit enter. If you get a result really close to a 
round number, that’s your answer — you’re done. If you have any doubt about the answer, 
just store another number into x that’s even closer to the arrow-number, get back to the 
limit expression, and hit enter again. This will likely give you a result even closer to the same 
round number — that’s it; you’ve got it. This method can be the quickest, but it often doesn’t 
give you a good feel for how the y values zero in on the result. To get a better picture of this 
process, you can store three or four numbers into x (one after another), each a bit closer to 
the arrow-number, and look at the sequence of results.

60      PART 2  Limits and Continuity
»
» Method II: Enter the limit expression in graphing or “y
” mode, go to Table Setup, set 
Tblstart to the arrow-number, and set ΔTbl to something small like 0.01 or 0.001. When you 
look at the table, you’ll often see the y values getting closer and closer to the limit answer 
as x homes in on the arrow-number. If it’s not clear what the y values are approaching, try a 
smaller increment for the ΔTbl number. This method often gives you a good feel for what’s 
happening in a limit problem.
»
» Method III: This method gives you the best visual understanding of how a limit works. Enter 
the limit expression in graphing or “y
” mode. (If you’re using the second method, you may 
want to try this third method at the same time.) Next, graph the function, and then go into 
the window and tweak the xmin, xmax, ymin, and ymax settings, if necessary, so that the part 
of the function corresponding to the arrow-number is within the viewing window. Use the 
trace feature to trace along the function until you get close to the arrow-number. You can’t 
trace exactly onto the arrow-number because there’s a little hole in the function there, the 
height of which, by the way, is your answer. When you trace close to the arrow-number, 
the y value will get close to the limit answer. Use the ZoomBox feature to draw a little box 
around the part of the graph containing the arrow-number and zoom in until you see that 
the y values are getting very close to a round number — that’s your answer.

This gives you a result of ~7.01, 
suggesting that the answer is 7.
3.	
Repeat Steps 1 and 2 with 6.001 
stored into x.
This gives you a result of 
~7.001.
4.	
Repeat Steps 1 and 2 with 6.0001 
stored into x.
This gives you a result of 
~7.0001.
Because the results are obviously 
homing in on the round number of 7, 
that’s your answer.

1.	
Enter x

3.	
Go to the Table and you’ll see 
the y values getting closer and 
closer to 7 as you scroll toward

So 7 is your answer.

these three window options works 
very well, but ZoomStd is the best.

Making Yourself a Limit Sandwich
The sandwich or squeeze method is something you can try when you can’t solve a limit problem 
with algebra. The basic idea is to find one function that’s always greater than the limit function 
(at least near the arrow-number) and another function that’s always less than the limit func-
tion. Both of your new functions must have the same limit as x approaches the arrow-number. 
Then, because the limit function is “sandwiched” between the other two, like salami between 
slices of bread, it must have that same limit as well. See Figure 4-1.
4.	
Trace near x
6 on this zoomed-
in graph until you get very near to 
x
6.
5.	
Repeat the Zoombox process  
maybe two more times and you 
should be able to trace extremely 
close to x
6.
(When I did this, I could trace to 
x
6 0000022
.
, y
7 0000023
.
.)
The answer is 7.

You should be able to solve this 
limit problem with some 
simple algebra. Do you see 
how? But say you tried and 
failed, so now you’re going to 
try the sandwich method.
2.	
Graph the function.
Looks like the limit as x 
approaches 0 is 0.
3.	
To prove it, try to find two bread 
functions that both have a limit of 
0 as x approaches 0.

It’s easy to show that the function 
is always positive (except perhaps 
at x
0), so you can use the simple 
function y
0 as the bottom slice of 
bread. Of course, it’s obvious that 
lim
x

0. Finding a function for the 
top slice is harder. But say that for 
some mysterious reason, you know 
that y
x  is greater than x
x
3
 
near the arrow-number (the only 
place that matters for the sandwich 
method). Because lim
x
x

0, 
y
x  makes a good top slice.
You’re done. Because x
x
3
 is 
squeezed between y
0 and 
y
x , both of which have limits 
of 0 as x approaches 0, x
x
3
 must 
also have a limit of 0.

CHAPTER 4  Nitty-Gritty Limit Problems      63
Into the Great Beyond: Limits at Infinity
To find a limit at infinity lim
x
 or lim
x
, you can use the same techniques from the bulleted list 
in the “Solving Limits with Algebra” section of this chapter in order to change the limit expres-
sion so that you can plug in and solve.
If you’re taking the limit at infinity of a rational function (which is one polynomial divided by 
another, such as 
3
8
12
5
4
2
2
3
2
x
x
x
x
x
), the limit will be the same as the y value of the function’s 
horizontal asymptote, which is an imaginary line that a curve gets closer and closer to as it goes 
right or left toward infinity or negative infinity. Here are the two cases where this works:
»
» Case 1: If the degree of the polynomial in the numerator is less than the degree of the 
polynomial in the denominator, there’s a horizontal asymptote at y = 0, and the limit as x 
approaches  or 
 is 0 as well.
»
» Case 2: If the degrees of the two polynomials are equal, there’s a horizontal asymptote 
at the number you get when you divide the coefficient of the highest power term in the 
numerator by the coefficient of the highest power term in the denominator. This number is 
the answer to the limit as x approaches infinity or negative infinity. By the way, if the degree 
of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator, there’s no horizontal 
asymptote and no limit.
Consider the following four types of expressions: x 10, 5 x, x! , and x x . If a limit at infinity 
involves a fraction with one of them over another, you can apply a handy little tip. These four 
expressions are listed from “smallest” to “largest.” (This isn’t a true ordering; it’s only for 
problems of this type; and note that the actual numbers don’t matter; they could just as eas-
ily be x 8 , 30x , x! , and x x .) The limit will equal 0 if you have a “smaller” expression over a 
“larger” one, and the limit will equal infinity if you have a “larger” expression over a “smaller” 
one. And this rule is not affected by coefficients.
For example, lim ,
!
x
x
x
1 000
3
0
100
 and lim
x
x
x
x

A.	 The limit is 0.
This is an example of a “smaller” 
expression over a “larger” one, so the 
answer is 0. Perhaps this result sur-
prises you. You may think that this 
fraction will keep getting bigger and 
bigger because it seems that no matter 
what power 1.01 is raised to, it will 
never grow very large. And, in fact, if 
you plug 1,000 into x, the quotient is 
big — over 47,000. But if you enter

 in graphing mode and then set 
both tblStart and Δtbl to 1,000, the table 
values show quite convincingly that the 
limit is 0. By the time x

answer is about 0.00293, and when

resembles the one in Problem 10. Still stuck? Okay, here you go:
1.	 Multiply numerator and denominator by 3.
You have a 3x in the denominator, so you need 3x in the numerator as well (to make 
the fraction look more like the one in Problem 10).

This probably seems like an odd problem, because there’s no x in the limit expression for you 
to plug the 5 into. Think of it this way. The 8 represents the function y
8, which is a hori-
zontal line at a height of 8. The limit problem asks you to determine what y is getting closer 
and closer to along the function as x gets closer and closer to 5. But, since the function is a 
horizontal line, y is always equal to 8 regardless of the value of x. Thus,

 (k is a constant).
Don’t forget that for all calculus problems, constants behave like ordinary numbers. In 
Problem 14, the 8 represented the horizontal line y
8, so in this problem, the k represents 
the horizontal line y
k. So, y is always at a height of k regardless of the value of x. Thus, the 
limit equals k.

The calculator’s answer is –11.0001. Because this is near the round number –11, your answer 
is –11. By the way, you can do this problem easily with algebra as well.

tblStart. When you scroll through the table near x
0, you’ll see the y values getting closer 
and closer to the round number 1. That’s your answer. This problem, unlike Problem 17, is not 
easy to do with algebra.

Here are three ways to do this. First, common sense should tell you that this limit equals 0. 
lim
x
x

 is 0, of course, and lim sin
x
x

21
 never gets bigger than 1 or smaller than –1. You could 
say that lim sin
x
x
0
21
, therefore, is “bounded” (it’s bounded by –1 and 1). Then, because 
zero
bounded
zero, the limit is 0. Don’t try this logic with you calc teacher — he won’t 
like it.
Second, you can use your calculator: Store something small like 0.1 into x and then input 
x
x
sin 1
2  into your home screen and hit enter. You should get a result of ~
.0 05. Now store 0.01 
into x and use the entry button to get back to x
x
sin 1
2  and hit enter again. The result is ~ .0 003. 
Now try 0.001, then 0.0001 (giving you ~
.0 00035 and ~ .0 00009), and so on. It’s pretty 
clear — though probably not to the satisfaction of your professor — that the limit is 0.
The third way will definitely satisfy those typically persnickety professors. You’ve got to 
sandwich (or squeeze) your salami function, x
x
sin 1
2 , between two bread functions that have 
identical limits as x approaches the same arrow-number it approaches in the salami function.
Because sin 1
2
x
 never gets greater than 1 or less than –1, x
x
sin 1
2  will never get greater than 
x  or less than 
x . (You need the absolute value bars, by the way, to take care of negative 
values of x.) This suggests that you can use b x
x  for the bottom piece of bread and 
t x
x  as the top piece of bread. Graph b x
x , f x
x
x
sin 1
2 , and t x
x  at the 
same time on your graphing calculator and you can see that x
x
sin 1
2  is always greater than or 
equal to 
x  and always less than or equal to x . Because lim
x

x

because x

tions. (You should confirm this by looking at their graphs; use the following window on your 
graphing calculator — Radian mode, xMin = –0.15625, xMax = 0.15625, xScl = 0.05, yMin = 
–0.0125, yMax = 0.0125, yScl = 0.005.) Because lim

According to the “larger” over “smaller” tip, this answer must be infinity. Or you can get 
this result with your calculator. If you set the table (don’t forget: fork on the left, spoon on 
the right) with something like tblStart = 100 and Δtbl = 100, and then look at the table, you 
may see “undef” for some or all of the y values, depending on your calculator model. You 
have to be careful when trying to interpret what “undef” (for “undefined”) means on your 
calculator. It often means infinity, but not always, so don’t just jump to that conclusion. 
Instead, make tblStart and Δtbl smaller, say, 10. Sure enough, the y values grow huge very 
fast, and you can safely conclude that the limit is infinity.

It may seem strange, but infinity minus infinity does not equal 0.

2  does not exist (DNE).
The best approach to this limit problem is to simply sketch or picture the graph of the 
cosine function (or graph it on your graphing calculator). As x moves left toward negative 
infinity, the cosine curve oscillates between heights of –1 and 1. The curve never 
approaches a single height; the oscillation goes on forever. This tells you that lim cos
x
x 
does not exist (and, by the same reasoning, limcos
x
x DNE). The function in this problem, 
lim cos
x
x 2 , has a different shape than cosx, but it oscillates forever in the same way 
between heights of –1 and 1 (it oscillates faster and faster the further out you go toward 
infinity or negative infinity). Thus, cos x 2  does not exist (DNE).

Like limcos

x
x DNE because the sine function oscillates forever between heights of –1 
and 1 as x gets larger and larger. But it doesn’t follow that the answer to the current problem 
is also DNE. The function, sinx
x
, does oscillate forever as x gets larger and larger, but the 
amplitude of the oscillation gets damped more and more as x gets larger. Near x
100, for 
example, the amplitude of the oscillation gets divided by about 100, so sinx
x
 oscillates 
between heights of about –0.01 and 0.01. Near x
1000, sinx
x
 oscillates between about –0.001 
and 0.001, and so on. The crests and troughs of the oscillating wave get smaller and smaller 
and closer and closer to a height of zero. That’s the limit: zero.

No work required here. This is one of the handful of limits you should just memorize.
Since the number e came up here, I can’t resist mentioning what some say is the most ele-
gant equation in mathematics — one short, simple equation that contains the five most 
important numbers in mathematics: 0, 1, , e, and i (the square root of –1). Here it is:
ei

For this problem, keep in mind the solution to Problem 29: lim

e

. The idea for the 
current problem is to manipulate the limit with the 3x in it until you get something that 
resembles the solution from Problem 29. Here’s what you do:
First, set the limit in question equal to y; then cube both sides:
lim

See how this limit resembles the limit from Problem 29? You’re almost there. The next step 
is to set u equal to 3x so you can replace each 3x with a u. And, because u

infinity, so does u; thus, you can replace the x below the lim symbol with a u:
lim
u

Finally, this limit is mathematically identical to the one from Problem 29, which equals e. 
Therefore
e

But you need y, not y 3, because you set the limit you wanted equal to y. Cube root both sides, 
and you’re done:
e

Getting the Big Picture: 
Differentiation Basics
D
ifferentiation is the process of finding derivatives. The derivative is one of the most 
important inventions in the history of mathematics and one of mathematics’ most 
powerful tools. I’m sure you will feel a deep privilege as you do the practice problems 
below — and also a keen sense of indebtedness to the great mathematicians of the past. Yeah, 
yeah, yeah.
The Derivative: A Fancy Calculus Word 
for Slope and Rate
The derivative of a function tells you how fast the output variable (like y) is changing compared 
to the input variable (like x). For example, if y is increasing 3 times as fast as x — like with the 
line y
x
3
5 — then you say that the derivative of y with respect to x equals 3, and you write 
dy
dx
3. This, of course, is the same as dy
dx
3
1 , and that means nothing more than saying that 
the rate of change of y compared to x is in a 3-to-1 ratio, or that the line has a slope rise
run  of 3
1 .
The following problems emphasize the fact that a derivative is basically just a rate or a slope. 
So to solve these problems, all you have to do is answer the questions as if they had asked you 
to determine a rate or a slope instead of a derivative.

A.	 The answer is 4. You know, of course, that 
the slope of y
x
4
5 is 4, right? No? Egad! 
Any line of the form y
mx
b has a slope 
equal to m. I hope that rings a bell. The deriv-
ative of a line or curve is the same thing as its 
slope, so the derivative of this line is 4.
You can think of the derivative dy
dx  as  
basically rise

Draw a function containing three points 
where — for three different reasons — you 
would not be able to determine the slope and, 
thus, where you would not be able to find a 
derivative.
The Handy-Dandy Difference Quotient
The difference quotient is the almost-magical tool that gives us the slope of a curve at a single 
point. To make a long story short, here’s what happens when you use the difference quotient. 
(If you want an excellent version of the long story, check out Calculus For Dummies, 2nd ­Edition.) 
Look again at the figure in Problem 3. You can see that the slope of the parabola at (7, 9) equals 
3, the slope of the tangent line. But you can’t calculate that slope with the algebra slope ­formula 
m
y
y
x
x
2

1
, because no matter what other point on the parabola you use with (7, 0) to plug 
into the formula, you’ll get a slope that’s steeper or less steep than the precise slope of 3 at (7, 9).
But if your second point on the parabola were extremely close to (7, 9) — like 7 001 9 0029996
.
,
.
 
 — 
your line would be almost exactly as steep as the tangent line. The difference quotient gives the 
precise slope of the tangent line by sliding the second point closer and closer to (7, 9) until its 
distance from (7, 9) is infinitely small.
Enough of this mumbo jumbo; now for the math. Here’s the definition of the derivative based 
on the difference quotient:
f
x
f x
h
f x
h

As with most limit problems, plugging the arrow-number in at the beginning of a difference 
quotient problem won’t help because that gives you 0
0. You have to do a little algebraic mojo 
so that you can cancel the h and then plug in. (The techniques from Chapter 4 also work here.)
Now for a difference quotient problem.

Solutions for Differentiation Basics
1	
If you leave your home at time = 0, and speed away in your car at 60 miles
hour , what’s dp
dt , the 
derivative of your position with respect to time? The answer is dp
dt
60.
A derivative is always a rate, and (assuming we’re talking about instantaneous rates, not 
average rates) a rate is always a derivative. So, if your speed, or rate, is 60 miles
hour , the 
derivative, dp
dt , is also 60.
2	
Using the information from Problem 1, write a function that gives your position as a function 
of time. p t
t
60  or p
t
60 , where t is in hours and p is in miles.
If you plug 1 into t, your position is 60 miles; plug 2 into t and your position is 120 miles. 
p
t
60  is a line, of course, in the form y
mx
b (where b
0 because you started your trip at 
your home where your position is zero). So the slope is 60 and the derivative is thus 60. And, 
again, you see that a derivative is a slope and a rate.

What’s the slope of the parabola y
x
x
1
3
23

85
3

 at the point 7 9

? The slope is 3.

x
x
1
3
23
3
85
3
2
, at the 
point 7 9
, 
. You know from y
mx
b that the slope of y
x
3
12 is 3. At the point 7 9
, 
, the 
parabola is exactly as steep as the line, so the derivative (that’s the slope) of the parabola at 
7 9
, 
 is also 3.
Although the slope of the line stays constant, the slope of the parabola changes as you climb 
up from 7 9
, 
, getting less and less steep. Even if you go to the right just 0.001 to x
7 001
.
, 
the slope will no longer be exactly 3.
4	
What’s the derivative of the parabola y
x 2
5 at the point 0 5
, 
? The answer is 0.
The point 0 5
, 
 is the very top of the parabola, y
x 2
5. At the top, the parabola is neither 
going up nor down — just like you’re neither going up nor down the moment when you walk 
across the crest of a hill. The top of the parabola is flat or level in this sense, and thus the 
slope and derivative both equal zero.
The fact that the derivative is zero at the top of a hill (and at the bottom of a valley) is a 
critically important point which you’ll return to time and time again.
5	
With your graphing calculator, graph both the line y
x
4
9 and the parabola y
x
5
2. 
You’ll see that they’re tangent at the point 2 1
, 
.
a.	 What is the derivative of y
x
5
2 when x
2? The answer is –4.
The derivative of a curve tells you its slope or steepness. Because the line and the parabola 
are equally steep at 2 1
, 
, and because you know the slope of the line is –4, the slope of 
the parabola at 2 1
, 
 is also –4 and so is its derivative.
b.	 On the parabola, how fast is y changing compared to x when x
2? It’s decreasing 4 times 
as fast as x increases.

CHAPTER 5  Getting the Big Picture: Differentiation Basics      85
A derivative is a rate as well as a slope. Because the derivative of the parabola is –4 at 
2 1
, 
, that tells you that y is changing 4 times as fast as x, but because the 4 is negative,  
y decreases 4 times as fast as x increases. This is the rate of y compared to x only for the one 
instant at 2 1
, 
 — and thus it’s called an instantaneous rate. A split second later — say at 
x
2 000001
.
 — y will be decreasing a bit faster.
6	
Draw a function containing three points where — for three different reasons — you would 
not be able to determine the slope and thus where you would not be able to find a derivative.
Your sketch of a function should contain
1.	 Any type of gap or discontinuity. There’s no slope and thus no derivative at a gap in a 
function because you can’t draw a tangent line at a gap (try it).
2.	 A sharp, pointy turn in the function (like the one in the second graph of Figure 7-1 in 
Chapter 7 where the absolute minimum is; that type of pointy turn is called a corner by the 
way; a super pointy turn — kind of like the tip of a needle — is called a cusp). It’s impos-
sible to draw a tangent line at a corner or a cusp because a line touching the function at 
such a sharp point could rock back and forth like a teeter-totter. So there’s no slope and 
no derivative at a cusp.
3.	 A vertical inflection point. Although you can draw a tangent line at a vertical inflection 
point, the derivative there is undefined because the slope of a vertical line is undefined.

In Problem 4, you see that the top of this parabola y

 and that 
the derivative is zero there because the parabola is neither going up nor down at its peak. 
That explanation was based on common sense. But now, with the result given by the differ-
ence quotient, namely y

Problem 8 gives you the derivative of this parabola, f

problem is the same except for different variables, so its derivative is s t

Plug in 4 for t, and you get s 4
24 miles

11 get closer and closer to 24 miles
hour  as the total travel time gets less and less and the ending 
time homes in on t
4. That’s precisely how the difference quotient works as h shrinks to 
zero.

Giving It Up for the Product and Quotient Rules
Now that you’ve got the easy stuff down, I’m sure you’re dying to get some practice with 
advanced differentiation rules. The product rule and the quotient rule give you the derivatives 
for the product of two functions and the quotient of two functions, respectively and obviously.
The product rule is a snap. The derivative of a product of two functions, first
second , equals 
first
first
second
second
.
The quotient rule is also a piece of cake. The derivative of a quotient of two functions, 
first
second
, 
equals first
second
first
second
second
2
.
Here’s a good way to remember the quotient rule. When you read a product, you read from left 
to right, and when you read a quotient, you read from top to bottom. So just remember that the 
quotient rule, like the product rule, works in the natural order in which you read, beginning 
with the derivative of the first thing you read. For some mysterious reason, many textbooks 
give the quotient rule in a different form that’s harder to remember. Learn it the way I’ve writ-
ten it above, beginning with first
. That’s the easiest way to remember it. Also note that when 
the two rules are written as they are above, the numerator of the quotient rule looks exactly like 
the product rule, except that there’s a minus sign instead of a plus sign.

Linking Up with the Chain Rule
The chain rule is probably the trickiest among the advanced rules, but it’s really not that bad 
at all if you focus clearly on what’s going on. Most of the basic derivative rules have a plain old 
x as the argument (or input variable) of the function. For example, f
x
x
, sinx, and y
e x 
all have just x as the argument.
When the argument of a function is anything other than a plain old x, such as y
x
sin
2  or 
ln10 x (as opposed to lnx), you’ve got a chain rule problem.
Here’s what you do. You simply apply the derivative rule that’s appropriate to the outer func-
tion, temporarily ignoring the not-a-plain-old-x argument. Then multiply that result by the 
derivative of the argument. That’s all there is to it.

With chain rule problems, 
never use more than one

most function, don’t touch the 
inside stuff! Only in the next 
step do you multiply the 
outside derivative by the 
derivative of the inside stuff.

What to Do with Y’s: Implicit Differentiation
You use implicit differentiation when your equation isn’t in “y
” form, such as sin y
x
y
2
3
3
5
, 
and it’s impossible to solve for y. If you can solve for y, implicit differentiation will still work, 
but it’s not necessary.
Implicit differentiation problems are chain rule problems in disguise. Here’s what I mean. You 
know that the derivative of sinx is cosx, and that according to the chain rule, the derivative of 
sin x 3  is cos x
x
3
3
. You would finish that problem by doing the derivative of x 3, but I have 
a reason for leaving the problem unfinished here.
To do implicit differentiation, all you do (sort of) is every time you see a “y” in a problem, you 
treat it like the x 3 is treated above. Thus, because the derivative of sin x 3  is cos x
x
3
3
, the 
derivative of sin y is cos y y . Then, after doing the differentiation, you just solve for y  so that 
you get y
something.
By the way, I used “y” in the preceding explanation, but that’s not the whole story. Consider 
that y
x
20
3 is the same as dy
dx
x
20
3. It’s the variable on the top that you apply implicit dif-
ferentiation to. This is typically y, but it could be any other variable. And it’s the variable on 
the bottom that you treat the ordinary way. This is typically x, but it could also be any other 
variable.

Getting High on Calculus: Higher  
Order Derivatives
You often need to take the derivative of a derivative, or the derivative of a derivative of a deriva-
tive, and so on. In the next two chapters, you see a few applications. For example, a second 
derivative tells you the acceleration of a moving body. To find a higher order derivative, you 
just treat the first derivative as a new function and take its derivative in the ordinary way. You 
can keep doing this indefinitely.

Don’t forget that even though  sort of looks like a variable (and even though other Greek 
letters like θ, α, and ω are variables),  is a number (roughly 3.14) and behaves like any other 
number. The same is true of e

.
. And when doing derivatives, constants like c and k also 
behave like ordinary numbers.
Because  is just a number, 
3 is also just a number. g x

with a slope and a derivative of zero.

Note that the derivative of plain old t or plain old x (or any other variable) is simply 1. In a 
sense, this is the simplest of all derivative rules, not counting the derivative of a constant. 
Yet for some reason, many people get it wrong. This is simply an example of the power rule: 
x is the same as x1, so you bring the 1 in front and reduce the power by 1, from 1 to 0. That 
gives you 1x0. But because anything to the 0 power equals 1, you have 1 times 1, which of 
course is 1.

When doing this derivative, you can deal with the “5” in two ways. First, you can ignore it 
temporarily, do the differentiating, then multiply your answer by 5. (If you do it this way, 
don’t forget that the “5” multiplies the entire derivative, not just the first term.) The second 
way is probably easier and better: Just make the “5” part of the first function. To wit:

To remember the derivatives of the inverse trig functions, notice that the derivative of each 
co-function (arccosine, arccotangent, and arccosecant) is the negative of its corresponding 
function. So, you really only need to memorize the derivatives of arcsin, arctan, and arcsec. 
These three have a 1 in the numerator. The two that contain the letter “s,” arcsin and arcsec, 
contain a square root in the denominator and also a subtraction sign: d

This problem involves both the product rule and the chain rule. Which do you do first? Note 
that the chain rule part of this problem, sin3 x, is one of the two things being multiplied, so it 
is part of — or sort of inside — the product. And, like with pure chain rule problems, with 
problems involving more than one rule, you work from outside, in. So here you begin with 
the product rule. The following tip gives you another way to look at it.
If you’re not sure about the order of the rules in a complicated derivative problem, imagine 
that you plugged a number into x in the original function and had to compute the answer. 
Your last computation tells you where to start. If, for example, you plugged 2 into x
x
4
3
sin
, 
you would compute 24 then sin2, then you’d cube that to get sin3 2, and, finally, you’d multi-
ply 24 by sin3 2. Because your final step was multiplication, you begin with the product rule.

Use the chain rule to solve sin3 x

and that’s stuff 3. The derivative of stuff 3 is 3

You need the slope at

0, so plug those numbers in to the derivative. Actually, 
you can save yourself some work if you notice that the numerator will equal zero (because 
cos 5 10
0
2
) and the denominator will equal 1 (because y
0). Thus, the slope of the 
curve at this point is zero. (A tangent line with a zero slope is horizontal, and because this 
tangent line touches the curve where y
0, the tangent line is the x axis.)

CHAPTER 7  Analy zing Those Shapely Curves with the Derivative      117
Analy zing Those 
Shapely Curves with 
the Derivative
T
his chapter gives you lots of practice using the derivative to analyze the shape of curves 
and their significant features and points. Don’t forget: The derivative tells you the slope 
of a curve, so any problem involving anything about the slope or steepness of a curve is 
a derivative problem.
The First Derivative Test and Local Extrema
One of the most common applications of the derivative employs the simple idea that at the top 
of a hill or at the bottom of a valley, you’re neither going up nor down — at a peak or a val-
ley, the terrain is horizontal. Thus, there’s zero steepness there, and the slope — and thus the 
derivative — equal zero. You can therefore use the derivative to locate the top of a “hill” and 
the bottom of a “valley,” called local extrema, on just about any function by setting the deriva-
tive of the function equal to zero and solving for x.

If f is defined at a number c and the derivative at x
c is either zero or undefined, 
then c is a critical number of f.

CHAPTER 7  Analy zing Those Shapely Curves with the Derivative      119
3.	 Plot the three critical numbers on a number line, noting that they create four 
regions (see the figure in Step 5).
4.	 Plug a number from each of the four regions into the derivative, noting whether the 
results are positive or negative.
If you’ve already factored the derivative (see Step 2), it’s usually best to use the 
factored form of the derivative in this step. And all you need to do is note whether 
the results are positive or negative. There’s no need to compute the exact results.

function, g 1  must equal g
1  and g
4  must equal g
4 .
5.	 Draw a “sign graph.” Take your number line and label each region — based on 
your results from Step 4 — positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing). See the 
following figure.
© John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
This sign graph tells you where the function is increasing (rising as you go from 
left to right) and where it is decreasing (falling as you go from left to right).
6.	 Use the sign graph to determine whether there’s a local minimum, local maximum, 
or neither at each critical number.
Because g goes down on its way to x
3 and up after x
3, it must bottom out at 
x
3, so there’s a local min there. Conversely, g peaks at x
3 because it rises until 
x
3, and then falls. There is thus a local max at x
3. And because g climbs on its 
way to x
0 and then climbs further, there is neither a min nor a max at x
0.
7.	 Determine the y values of the local extrema by plugging the x values into the 
original function.

The Second Derivative Test and Local Extrema
With the second derivative test, you use — can you guess? — the second derivative to test for 
local extrema. The second derivative test is based on the absolutely brilliant idea that the crest 
of a hill has a hump shape 
 and the bottom of a valley has a trough shape 
.

CHAPTER 7  Analy zing Those Shapely Curves with the Derivative      121
After you find a function’s critical numbers, you have to decide whether to use the first or the 
second derivative test to find the extrema. For some functions, the second derivative test is the 
easier of the two because 1) the second derivative is usually easy to get, 2) you can often plug 
the critical numbers into the second derivative and do a quick computation, and 3) you will 
often get non-zero results and thus get your answers without having to do a sign graph and 
test regions. On the other hand, testing regions on a sign graph (the first derivative test) is also 
fairly quick and easy, and if the second derivative test fails (see the warning), you’ll have to do 
that anyway. As you do practice problems, you’ll get a feel for when to use each test.
If the second derivative equals zero at a particular critical number, the second derivative test 
fails and you learn nothing about whether there’s a local extremum there. When this happens, 
you have to use the first derivative test to determine whether or not you have a local extremum.
Q.	 Take the function from the example in the previous section, g x

time find its local extrema using the second derivative test.
A.	 The local min is at x

Now all you do is plug in the critical numbers of g from Step 2 of the example in the 
preceding section:
g
g
g
3
270
0
0
3
270
The fact that g
3  is positive tells you that g is concave up 
 at x
3, and thus that 
there’s a local min there. And the fact that g
3  is negative tells you that g is concave 
down 
 at x
3, and, therefore, that there’s a local max there. And, while it may seem 
that g
0
0 confirms what you figured out previously (that there’s neither a min nor a 
max at x
0), you actually learn nothing when the second derivative is zero; you have to 
use the first derivative test instead.
If, like here, you only have one critical point between a local min and a local max (and no dis-
continuities), it has to be an inflection point. And if you have a single critical number between 
two known maxes (see Problem 7), the only possibility for the middle critical number is a local 
min (and vice versa). So in these cases, it really doesn’t matter if the second derivative test fails 
with the middle critical number. If this not-by-the-book reasoning doesn’t work for your calc 
teacher, you might say (with just a touch of sarcasm in your voice), “Oh, so in other words, 
you’ve got something against logic and common sense.”

Finding Mount Everest: Absolute Extrema
The basic idea in this section is quite simple. Instead of finding all local extrema as in the pre-
vious sections (all the peaks and all the valleys), you just want to determine the single highest 
point and single lowest point along a continuous function in some closed interval. These absolute 
extrema can occur at a peak or valley or at an edge(s) of the interval. (Note: You could have, say, 
two peaks at the same height so there’d be a tie for the absolute max; but there would still be 
exactly one y value that’s the absolute maximum value on the interval.)
Before you practice with some problems, look at Figure 7-1 to see two standard absolute extrema 
problems (continuous functions on a closed interval) and at Figure 7-2 for four strange functions 
that don’t have the standard single absolute max and single absolute min.

A.	 The absolute max is 2 and the abso-

1.	 Get all the critical numbers.
The first step is to determine the 
derivative, set it equal to zero, 
and solve, but before you can 
get the derivative, you have to 
split the function in two to get 
rid of the absolute value bars:

Now, determine whether the 
derivative is undefined any-
where.
The derivative is undefined at x
0 
because the denominator of the 
derivative can’t equal zero. (If you 
graph this function [always a good 
idea], you’ll also see the sharp 
corner at x
0 and thus know 
immediately that the derivative is 
undefined there.) The critical 
numbers are therefore 0 and 1
4 .
2.	 Compute the function values (the 
heights) at all the critical numbers.

It’s just a coincidence, by the way, 
that in both cases the input equals

4.	 The highest of all the function values 
from Steps 2 and 3 is the absolute 
max; the lowest of all the values from 
Steps 2 and 3 is the absolute min.
Thus, 2 is the absolute max and 0 
is the absolute min.
Note that finding absolute extrema 
involves less work than finding 
local extrema because you don’t 
have to use the first or second 
derivative tests — do you see why? 
(This particular problem was more 
involved than usual because of that 
extra twist in Step 1 involving the 
absolute value bars.)

Smiles and Frowns: Concavity  
and Inflection Points
Another purpose of the second derivative is to analyze concavity and points of inflection. (For a 
refresher, look at Figure 7-3: The section of curve between A and B is concave down — like an 
upside-down spoon or a frown; the sections on the outsides of A and B are concave up — like a 
right-side up spoon or a smile; and A and B are inflection points.) A positive second derivative 
means concave up; a negative second derivative means concave down. And where the concavity 
switches from up to down or down to up (like at A and B), you have an inflection point, and the 
second derivative there will (usually) be zero.
All inflection points have a second derivative of zero (if the second derivative exists), but not all 
points with a second derivative of zero are inflection points. This is no different from “all ships 
are boats but not all boats are ships.” (For example, y
x 4, which resembles a parabola, has a 
second derivative equal to zero at the point 0 0
, 
, but that point is not an inflection point — it’s 
a local minimum.)
Finally, note that you can have an inflection point where the second derivative is undefined. 
This occurs when the inflection point has a vertical tangent and in some bizarre curves that you 
shouldn’t worry about that have a weird discontinuity in the second derivative.

Because the concavity switches 
(from down to up or up to down) at 
all three “critical numbers” and 
because the second derivative exists 
at those numbers (from Steps 2 
and 3), there are inflection points at 
those three x values. (If the concav-
ity switches at a point where the 
second derivative is undefined, you 
have to check one more thing before 
concluding that you have an 
inflection point: whether you can 
draw a tangent line there. This is the 
case when the first derivative is 
defined or there’s a vertical tan-
gent.) All cases are covered by a 
simple rule: If the concavity switches at 
a point where the curve is smooth, you 
have an inflection point there.

The Mean Value Theorem: Go Ahead,  
Make My Day
The Mean Value Theorem is based on an incredibly simple idea. Say you go for a one-hour drive 
and travel 50 miles. Your average speed, of course, would be 50 mph. The Mean Value Theorem 
says that there must be at least one point during your trip when your speed was exactly 50 mph. 
But you don’t need a fancy-pants calculus theorem to tell you that. It’s just common sense. If 
you went slower than 50 mph the whole way, you couldn’t average 50. And if you went faster 
than 50 the whole way (this assumes you’re going faster than 50 at your starting point), your 
average speed would be greater than 50. The only way to average 50 is to go exactly 50 the 
whole way or to go slower than 50 sometimes and faster than 50 at other times. In the former 
case, the theorem is obviously satisfied because you’re driving at exactly 50 at every point in 
time. And in the latter case, the theorem is also satisfied because when you speed up or slow 
down from going slower than 50 to going faster than 50 (or vice versa), you have to hit exactly 
50 mph at some point — you can’t jump, say, from 49 mph one moment to 51 mph the next 
moment — your speed has to slide up (or down) and hit precisely 50 mph at some point in time.
With the Mean Value Theorem, you figure an average rate or slope over an interval and then 
use the first derivative to find one or more points in the interval where the instantaneous rate 
or slope equals the average rate or slope. Here’s an example:
Q.	 Given f x

So 
2 and 2 are two critical numbers of s.
t
0 is a third important number because t
0 makes the derivative’s denominator 
equal zero, so you need to include zero on your sign graph in order to define test 
regions. Note, however, that t
0 is not a critical number of s because s is undefined at  
t = 0. And because there is no point on s at t
0, there can’t be a local extremum at t
0.

values of the local extrema, and you only consider the sign graph, you would incorrectly 
conclude — using the current problem as an example — that there’s a local min at t
0. 
So you should always check where your function is undefined.

The second derivative test fails at x
0, so you have to use the first derivative test for 
that critical number. And this means, basically, that the second derivative test was a 
waste of time for this function.
If — as in the function for this problem — one of the critical numbers is x
0, and you can 
see that the second derivative will equal zero at x
0 (because, for example, all the terms of 
the second derivative will be simple powers of x), then the second derivative test will fail for 
x
0, and it will likely be a waste of time. You should use the first derivative test instead.
However, because this problem involves a continuous function and because there’s only one criti-
cal number between the two maxes you found, the only possibility is that there’s a min at x
0. 
(Try this streetwise logic out on your teacher and let me know if it works.)

The second derivative test fails where the second derivative is undefined (in addition to 
failing where the second derivative equals zero).
To pick, look at the first derivative of each function:

Do you see the trouble you’re going to run into with y x ? The first derivative is undefined at 
x
2 2 . And the second derivative will also be undefined at those x values, because when 
you take the second derivative with the quotient rule, squaring the bottom, the denominator 
will contain that same factor, x 2
8 . The second derivative test will thus fail at 2 2 , and 
you’ll have to use the first derivative test. In contrast to y x , the second derivative test 
works great with s t :

The derivative is never undefined, so these are the only critical numbers.
If you divide both sides of an equation by something that can equal zero at one or more 
x values (like you do above when dividing both sides by cosx), you may miss one or 
more solutions. You have to check whether any of those x values is a solution. In this 
problem, cosx
0 at 2  and 3
2 , and it’s easy to check (in Line 4 of Step 1 above) that 
sinx does not equal cosx at either of those values, so there’s no problem here. But if 
sinx did equal cosx at either of those values, you’d have one or two more solutions and 
one or two more critical numbers. (Note that you have to check any such values in the 
line of the solution above where you do the dividing — the way you just used Line 4 —  
you couldn’t use Line 5 for the check.)

Whoops, I guess this algebra’s kind of messy. Better get the zeros on your calculator: Just 
graph and find the x intercepts. There are two: x

 and x

. So you have two 
“critical numbers,” right? Wrong! Don’t forget to check for undefined points of the second 
derivative. Because q

Thus the concavity goes down, up, down, up. Because the second derivative is zero at –0.085 
and 0.085 and because the concavity switches there, you can conclude that there are 
inflection points at those two x values. But because both the first and second derivatives 
are undefined at x
0, you have to check whether there’s a vertical tangent there. You can 
see that there is by just looking at the graph, but if you want to be rigorous about it, you 
figure the limit of the first derivative as x approaches zero. Since that equals infinity, you 
have a vertical tangent at x
0, and thus there’s an inflection point there.
Now plug in –0.085, 0, and 0.085 into q to get the y values, and you’re done.

Using Differentiation 
to Solve Practical 
Problems
N
ow that you’re an expert at finding derivatives, I’m sure you can’t wait to put your 
expertise to use solving some practical problems. In this section, you find problems 
that actually come up in the real world — problems like how a cat rancher should 
use 200 feet of fencing to build a three-sided corral next to a river (he only needs three sides 
because the river makes the fourth side and cats hate water) to maximize the grazing area for 
his cats.
Optimization Problems: From Soup to Nuts
Optimization problems are one of the most practical types of calculus problems. You use the 
techniques discussed below whenever you want to maximize or minimize something, such as 
maximizing profit or area or volume or minimizing cost or energy consumption, and so on.

Problematic Relationships: Related Rates
Related rates problems are the Waterloo for many a calculus student. But they’re not that bad 
after you get the basic technique down. The best way to get the hang of them is by working 
through lots of examples, so let’s get started.
After working each problem, ask yourself whether the answer makes sense. Asking this ques-
tion is one of the best things you can do to increase your success in mathematics and science. 
And while it’s not always possible to decide whether a math answer is reasonable, when it’s 
possible, this inquiry should be a quick, extra step of every problem you do.
Q.	 A homeowner decides to paint his 
home. He picks up a home improve-
ment book, which recommends that 
a ladder should be placed against a 
wall such that the distance from the 
foot of the ladder to the bottom of 
the wall is one third the length of 
the ladder. Not being the sharpest 
tool in the shed, the homeowner 
gets mixed up and thinks that it’s 
the distance from the top of the 
ladder to the base of the wall that 
should be a third of the ladder’s 
length. He sets up his 18-foot ladder 
accordingly, and — despite this 
unstable ladder placement — he 
manages to climb the ladder and 
start painting. (Perhaps the foot of 
the ladder is caught on a tree root or 
something.) His luck doesn’t last 
long, and the ladder begins to slide 
rapidly down the wall. One foot 
before the top of the ladder hits 
the ground, it’s falling at a rate of 
20 feet/second. At this moment, 
how fast is the foot of the ladder 
moving away from the wall?
A.	 Roughly 1.11 feet/second.
1.	 Draw a diagram, labeling it with 
any unchanging measurements 
and assigning variables to any 
changing things.
See the following figure.
© John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
You don’t have to draw the house — 
the basic triangle is enough. But 
I’ve sketched a fuller picture of this 
scenario to make clear what a bone-
head this guy is.
2.	 List all given rates and the rate you’re 
asked to figure out. Write these rates as 
derivatives with respect to time.
You’re told that the ladder is falling at 
a rate of 20 ft/sec. Going down is 
negative, so

?
h is the distance from the top of the 
ladder to the bottom of the wall; b is 
the distance from the base of the 
ladder to the wall.

CHAPTER 8  Using Differentiation to Solve Practical Problems      151
3.	 Write down the formula that con-
nects the variables in the problem, 
h and b.
That’s the Pythagorean Theorem, 
of course: a

5.	 Substitute known values for the

from Step 4, and then solve for the 
thing you’re asked to determine.
You’re trying to determine db
dt , 
so you have to plug numbers 
into everything else. But, as 
often happens, you don’t have a 
number for b, so use a formula 
to get the number you need. This 
will usually be the same formula 
you already used.

6.	 Ask yourself whether your answer is 
reasonable.
Yes, it does make sense. Hold a 
yardstick against a wall so the 
bottom of it is on the floor and the 
top of it is on the wall about 4 or 
5 inches from the floor. Then push 
the top of the yardstick 4 or 
5 inches down to the floor. You’ll 
see that the bottom would barely 
move farther out from the wall. 
Right triangles with a fixed hypot-
enuse like this one always work like 
that. If one leg is much shorter than 
the other, the short leg can change 
a lot while the long leg barely 
changes. It’s a by-product of the 
Pythagorean Theorem.

A farmer’s hog trough is 10 feet long, and its 
cross-section is an isosceles triangle with a 
base of 2 feet and a height of 2 feet 6 inches 
(with the vertex at the bottom, naturally). 
The farmer is pouring swill into the trough 
at a rate of 1 cubic foot per minute. Just as 
the swill reaches the brim, her three hogs 
start violently sucking down the swill at a 
rate of 1
2 cubic foot per minute for each hog. 
They’re going at it so vigorously that another 
1
2 cubic foot of swill is being splashed out of 
the trough each minute. The farmer keeps 
pouring in swill, but she’s no match for her 
hogs. When the depth of the swill falls to 
1 foot 8 inches, how fast is the swill level 
falling?

A pitcher delivers a fastball, which the batter 
pops up — it goes straight up above home 
plate. When it reaches a height of 60 feet, 
it’s moving up at a rate of 50 feet per second. 
At this point, how fast is the distance from 
the ball to second base growing? Note: The 
distance between the bases of a baseball dia-
mond is 90 feet.

A 6-foot tall man looking over his shoulder 
sees his shadow that’s cast by a 15-foot-tall 
lamppost in front of him. The shadow 
frightens him so he starts running away 
from it — toward the lamppost. 
Unfortunately, this only makes matters 
worse, as it causes the frightening head of 
the shadow to gain on him. He starts to panic 
and runs even faster. Five feet before he 
crashes into the lamppost, he’s running at a 
speed of 15 miles per hour. At this point, how 
fast is the tip of the shadow moving?
8	
Salt is being unloaded onto a conical pile at a 
rate of 200 cubic feet per minute. If the 
height of the cone-shaped pile is always 
equal to the radius of the cone’s base, how 
fast is the height of the pile increasing when 
it’s 18 feet tall?

A Day at the Races: Position,  
Velocity, and Acceleration
The most important thing to know about this type of problem is that velocity is the derivative 
of position, and acceleration is the derivative of velocity. The following points about position, 
velocity, and acceleration with regard to the chariot race in Figure 8-1 provide some keys to 
approaching these problems.
FIGURE 8-1: 
A 200- 
palameter 
chariot race. 
© John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
»
» The finish is 100 palameters from the start as the crow flies, so 100 palameters is the total 
displacement. (A palameter is a little-known unit of distance used in ancient Rome equal to 
the length of Julius Caesar’s palace — roughly 380 feet.) Say the start is at 0 0
, 
 on a coordi-
nate system and the finish is at 100 0
, 
. It’s 100 from 0 to 100, of course, so 100 is the total 
displacement.
»
» Distance is different. You can see that the charioteers backtrack 50 palameters in the middle 
of the race. Because there are two extra 50-palameter legs, the total length of the race is 
200 palameters — that’s the distance. Distance is always positive or zero.
»
» Displacement to the left is negative (in other problems, down would be negative). When, 
say, Maximus passes Atlas, his position is 75 palameters from the start. At Aphrodite, he’s 
back to only 25 palameters from the start as the crow flies. Displacement equals final posi-
tion minus initial position, so from Atlas to Aphrodite is a displacement of 25
75, or –50 
palameters.
»
» Velocity is related to displacement, not distance traveled. Velocity has a special meaning in 
calculus and physics so forget the everyday meaning of it. Like displacement, if you’re going 
left (or down), that’s a negative velocity. And here’s a critical point: When you switch direc-
tions, your velocity is zero. Think of a ball thrown straight up. At its peak, for an infinitesimal 
moment, it is motionless, so its velocity is zero.

154      PART 3  Differentiation
»
» Average velocity is defined as total displacement divided by total time. Say Glutius completes 
the race in half an hour. Because he travels 200 palameters, his average speed is 400 palam-
eters per hour. But because the total displacement is only 100, his average velocity is a mere 
200 palameters per hour (roughly 14 miles per hour).
»
» Speed is regular old speed, and, unlike velocity, it’s always positive (or zero). If Maximus picks 
up speed to make the jump over the lion pit, his speed, naturally, increases. Note, however, 
that his velocity is decreasing — even though you see him speeding up — because his veloc-
ity is negative and is becoming a larger and larger negative.
»
» And here’s the deal with acceleration (for calculus and physics): A positive acceleration means 
the velocity is increasing, and a negative acceleration means the velocity is decreasing. When 
you apply this definition to motion to the right or up, it seems sensible. But when you’re 
dealing with motion to the left or down, it seems strange. When Glutius speeds up to jump 
over the lion pit, you would say, in day-to-day speech, that he’s accelerating. But because 
he’s going left, his velocity is negative, and — since he’s speeding up — his velocity is becom-
ing a larger and larger negative. His velocity, therefore, is decreasing, and that means his 
acceleration is negative. Again, he’s speeding up, but his acceleration is negative — seems 
weird, but that’s the way it works. For calculus (and physics), because of this issue concerning 
motion to the right or up versus motion to the left or down, it’d probably be best to avoid the 
use of the terms accelerating and decelerating. Instead, use the following terms: positive accel-
eration, negative acceleration, positive velocity, negative velocity, speeding up, and slowing down.
For Problems 9, 10, and 11, a duck-billed platypus is swimming back and forth along the side 
of your boat, blithely unaware that he’s the subject for calculus problems in rectilinear motion. 
The back of your boat is at the zero position, and the front of your boat is in the positive direc-
tion (see the following figure). s t  gives the platypus’s position (in feet) as a function of time 
(seconds). Find his a) position, b) velocity, c) speed, and d) acceleration, at t
2 seconds.

For Problems 12, 13, and 14, a three-toed sloth is hanging onto a tree branch and moving 
right and left along the branch. (The tree trunk is at zero and the positive direction goes out 
from the trunk.) s t  gives his position (in feet) as a function of time (seconds). Between t = 0 
and t
5, for each problem, find a) the intervals when he’s moving away from the trunk, the 
intervals when he’s moving toward the trunk, and when and where he turns around; b) his 
total distance moved and his average speed; and c) his total displacement and his average 
velocity.

What are the dimensions of the soup can of greatest volume that can be made with 50 square 
inches of tin? What’s its volume? The dimensions are 3 1 4 inches wide and 3 1 4 inches tall. 
The volume is about 27.14 cubic inches.

and would thus fit perfectly into a cube. Geometric optimization problems frequently have 
results where the dimensions have some nice, simple mathematical relationship to each 
other.
By the way, did you notice that I skipped evaluating the volume at the endpoints of the 
domain? Can you guess why I did that? Hint: What’s the volume for the smallest and larg-
est value of the radius?

When the depth of the swill falls to 1 foot 8 inches, how fast is the swill level falling? It’s 
falling at a rate of 9 10 inches per minute.
1.	 Draw a diagram, labeling the diagram with any unchanging measurements and assigning 
variables to any changing things.
See the following figure.
© John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
Note that the figure shows the unchanging dimensions of the trough, 2 feet by 2 feet 6 
inches by 10 feet, and these dimensions are not labeled with variable names like l (for 
length), w (for width), or h (for height). Also note that the changing things — the height 
(or depth) of the swill and the width of the surface of the swill (which gets narrower as 
the swill level falls) — do have variable names, h for height and b for base (I realize it’s at 
the top, but it’s the base of the upside-down triangle shape made by the swill). Finally, 
note that the height of 1 foot 8 inches — which is the height only at one particular point 
in time — is in parentheses to distinguish it from the other unchanging dimensions.

164      PART 3  Differentiation
2.	 List all given rates and the rate you’re asked to figure out.
Express these rates as derivatives with respect to time. Give yourself a high-five if you 
realized that the thing that matters about the changing volume of swill is the net rate of 
change of volume.
Swill is coming in at 1 cubic foot per minute and is going out at 3 1
2 cubic feet per minute 
(for the three hogs) plus another 1
2 cubic feet per minute (the splashing). So the net is 1 
cubic foot per minute going out — that’s a negative rate of change. In calculus language, 
you write:
dV
dt
1 cubic foot per minute
You’re asked to determine how fast the height is changing, so write:
dh
dt
?
3.	 a.	 Write down a formula that involves the variables in the problem: V, h, and b.
The technical name for the shape of the trough is a right prism. And the shape of the 
swill in the trough — what you care about here — has the same shape. Imagine tipping 
this up so it stands vertically. Any shape that has a flat base and a flat top and that goes 
straight up from base to top has the same volume formula: Volume
area
height
base
.
Note that this “base” is the entire swill triangle and totally different from b in the 
figure; also this “height” is totally different from the swill height, h.
The area of the triangular base equals 1
2 bh and the height of the prism is 10 feet, so 
here’s your formula: V
bh
bh
1
2
10
5
.
Because b doesn’t appear in your list of derivatives in Step 2, you want to get rid of it.
b.	 Find an equation that relates your unwanted variable, b, to some other variable in the 
problem so you can make a substitution and be left with an equation involving only  
V and h.
The triangular face of the swill is the same shape of the triangular side of the trough. If 
you remember geometry, you know that such similar shapes have proportional sides. So,

Now substitute 0.8h for b in the formula from Step 3a:

CHAPTER 8  Using Differentiation to Solve Practical Problems      165
In all related rates problems, make sure you differentiate (like you do here in Step 4) 
before you substitute the values of the variables into the equation (like you do in the next 
step when you plug 1 foot 8 inches into h).
5.	 Substitute all known quantities into this equation and solve for dh
dt .
You were given that h
1 8  (you must convert this to feet), and you figured out in Step 2 
that dV

Thus, when the swill level drops to a depth of 1 foot 8 inches, it’s falling at a rate of 9 10 
inches per minute. Mmm, mmm, good!
6.	 Ask whether this answer makes sense.
Unlike the example problem, it’s not easy to come up with a common-sense explanation 
of why this answer is or is not reasonable. But there’s another type of check that works 
here and in many other related rates problems.
Take a very small increment of time — something much less than the time unit of the 
rates used in the problem. This problem involves rates per minute, so use 1 second for your 
time increment. Now ask yourself what happens in this problem in 1 second. The swill is 
leaving the trough at 1 cubic foot/minute; so in 1 second, 1 60 cubic foot will leave the 
trough. What does that do to the swill height? Because of the similar triangles mentioned 
in Step 3b, when the swill falls to a depth of 1 foot 8 inches, which is 2 3 of the height of the 
trough, the width of the surface of the swill must be 2 3 of the width of the trough — and 
that comes to 11 3 feet. So the surface area of the swill is 11
3
10 feet.
Assuming the trough walls are straight (this type of simplification always works in this 
type of checking process), the swill that leaves the trough would form the shape of a very, 
very short box (“box” sounds funny because this shape is so thin; maybe “thin piece of 
plywood” is a better image).
The volume of a box equals length width height, thus
1

0 00125
height
height
.
This tells you that in 1 second, the height should fall 0.00125 feet or something very close 
to it. (This process sometimes produces an exact answer and sometimes an answer with a 
very small error.) Now, finally, see whether this number agrees with the answer. Your 
answer was 9 10 inches/minute. Convert this to feet/second:

When it reaches a height of 60 feet, it’s moving up at a rate of 50 feet per second. At this 
point, how fast is the distance from second base to the ball growing? The distance is growing 
at about 21.3 feet per second.

Five feet before the man crashes into the lamppost, he’s running at a speed of 15 miles per

A somewhat unusual twist in this problem is that you never had to plug in the given dis-
tance of 5 feet. This is because the speed of the shadow is independent of the man’s 
position.

Even More Practical 
Applications of 
Differentiation
I
n this chapter, you see more ways to use differentiation to solve real-world problems. The 
three general topics here — tangent line and normal line problems, linear approximation, 
and business and economics problems — all involve lines tangent to a curve. This shouldn’t 
surprise you, because you’re dealing with differentiation here, which is all about the slope of 
a curve (and that’s the same thing as the slope of the line tangent to the curve). The problems 
in this chapter are all “practical” applications of differentiation in a sense, but some of them 
are — to be honest — much more likely to be found in a math book than in the real world. But 
at the other end of the spectrum, you find problems here like the economics problem of finding 
maximum profit. What could be more practical than that?
Make Sure You Know Your Lines:  
Tangents and Normals
In everyday life, it’s perfectly normal to go off on a tangent now and then. In calculus, on the 
other hand, there is nothing at all normal about a tangent. You need only note a couple points 
before you’re ready to try some problems:

» At its point of tangency, a tangent line has the same slope as the curve it’s tangent to. In 
calculus, whenever a problem involves slope, you should immediately think derivative. The 
derivative is the key to all tangent line problems.
»
» At its point of intersection to a curve, a normal line is perpendicular to the tangent line drawn 
at that same point. When any problem involves perpendicular lines, you use the rule that 
perpendicular lines have slopes that are opposite reciprocals. So all you do is use the deriva-
tive to get the slope of the tangent line, and then the opposite reciprocal of that gives you 
the slope of the normal line.
Ready to try a few problems? Say, that reminds me. I once had this problem with my carburetor. 
I took my car into the shop, and the mechanic told me the problem would be easy to fix, but 
when I went back to pick up my car . . . Wait a minute. Where was I?

This tells you that — to approxi-

add (or subtract) 1 48 to 4 for each 
increase (or decrease) of one from 
64. For example, the cube root of 
65 is about 4 1 48, the cube root of 66 
is about 4 2 48, or 4 1 24, the cube root 
of 67 is about 4 3 48, or 4 1 16, and the

the right side of the equation

reasons. First, because doing so 
makes this equation jibe with the 
explanation at the end of Step 2 
about starting at 4 and going up 
(or down) from there as you move 
away from the point of tangency. 
And second, to make this equation 
agree with the explanation at the 
end of Step 4. You’ll see how it all 
works in a minute.

Linear approximation is easy to do, and once you get the hang of it, you can impress your 
friends by approximating things like 70

it? Look at Figure 9-1 and then at the example to see how I did it.

Calculus in the Real World:  
Business and Economics
This chapter concerns practical applications of differentiation. But the topics of the first two 
sections of the chapter — tangent and normal lines and linear approximation — though cer-
tainly applications of differentiation, are not exactly practical. So, in this section, you finally 
see honest-to-goodness practical problems about business and economics. Specifically, you 
see problems about marginals: marginal cost, marginal revenue, and marginal profit.
Marginals work exactly like linear approximation. In the example in the previous section on 
linear approximation, you take the derivative of y
x
3
 to find that the slope of the tangent line 
to y
x
3
 at 64 4
, 
 is 1 48. And that tells you that if you go one to the right (from 64 to 65) along 
y
x
3
, the curve goes up approximately 1 48 (from 4 to about 4 1 48). In economics problems, that 
extra bit that you go up (or down) — like that 1 48 — is called a marginal.
Marginal cost tells you the approximate increase in the cost function as you go one to the right 
along the function. It thus tells you the approximate cost of producing one more item. Marginal 
revenue and marginal profit work the same way. (Marginal cost and marginal revenue are almost 
always positive; marginal profit can be positive or negative.)
Marginal cost equals the derivative of the cost function.
Marginal revenue equals the derivative of the revenue function.
Marginal profit equals the derivative of the profit function.

The marginal revenue at x
125 is $8.00, and that represents the approximate extra 
revenue generated for the firm by the sale of the 126th thingamajob. (By the way, 
strange as it may seem, this is not the same amount as the price of the 126th thing-
amajob. Don’t sweat this; it has to do with the fact that if 126 thingamajobs are sold, 
the price for all 126 thingamajobs would be, in theory, a bit less than if only 125 thing-
amajobs are sold.)

You just subtract marginal cost from marginal revenue to get marginal profit.

est paths (compared to other points in their respective vicinities). The other two normals are 
longest paths. This is curious: When a curve is concave away from a point, a normal to the 
curve can only be a local shortest path, so you might think that in the current problem, 
where y
x 4 is everywhere concave toward 0 1
, 
, you could get only locally longest paths. But 
it turns out that when a curve is concave toward a point, you can get either a local shortest or 
a local longest path.

 because both denominators 
become zero? However — promise not to leak this to your calculus teacher — this is okay 
here because both sides of the equation become non-zero number

. (Actually, they’re both 1

but something like 5

undefined slope. So the 1

It’s a bit tricky to find the x intercepts for this hairy function. You have to play around 
with your calculator’s window settings a bit. And don’t forget that your calculator will 
draw vertical asymptotes that look like zeros of the function, but are not. Now, it turns 
out that this function has an infinite number of x intercepts (I think). There’s one 
between x
18 and –19 and there are more at bigger negatives. And there’s one 
between x
97 and 98 and there are more at bigger positives. But these zeros represent 
points on the river so far away that they need not be considered. Only three zeros are 
plausible candidates for the closest trip to the river. To see the first candidate zero, set

This negative profit for the 1,601st widget tells you that the firm would lose money if it were 
to produce and sell that widget. Therefore, it will obviously want to produce and sell fewer 
widgets than that. See the solution to the next problem.
12	 a.	How many widgets should be manufactured and sold to maximize the firm’s profit?  
974 widgets.

Thus, the firm should produce and sell 974 widgets to maximize profits. (It’s kind of obvi-
ous in this problem that the profit function hits a maximum at this x value; but, if you 
want to be more rigorous, you should show that this x value is indeed where a maximum 
occurs, as opposed to a minimum or a horizontal inflection point.) I did this problem like 
any maximization problem, without mentioning marginals. But, as you know, the first 
derivative of the profit is the marginal profit. So, the preceding math shows that the mar-
ginal profit is zero when 974 widgets are sold. Do you see why the maximum profit should 
occur where the marginal profit equals zero?
b.	What is the maximum profit? $143,877.52.
Determine the profit function and evaluate it at x

CHAPTER 10  Getting into Integration      193
Getting into Integration
I
n this chapter, you begin the second major topic in calculus: integration. With integration 
you can find the total area or volume of weird shapes that, unlike triangles, spheres, cones, 
and other basic shapes, don’t have simple area or volume formulas. You can use integra-
tion to total up other things as well. The basic idea is that when you have something (like a 
weird shape, say, an hourglass that doesn’t have a volume formula) that you can’t calculate 
directly, you use the magic of limits to sort of cut up the thing into an infinite number of tiny, 
infinitesimal pieces; you then calculate the volume of each tiny piece, and finally you add up 
the volumes of all the tiny pieces to get the total volume. But before getting into integration, 
you’re going to warm up with some easy stuff: pre-pre-pre-calc — the area of rectangles.
By the way, despite the “kid stuff” quip, much of the material in this chapter and the first section 
of Chapter 11 is both more difficult and less useful than what follows it. If ever there was a time 
for the perennial complaint — “What is the point of learning this stuff?” — this is it. Now, some 
calculus teachers would give you all sorts of fancy arguments and pedagogical justifications for 
why this material is taught, but, let’s be honest, the sole purpose of teaching these topics is to 
inflict maximum pain on calculus students. Well, you’re stuck with it, so deal with it. The good 
news is that this material will make everything that comes later seem easy by comparison.
Adding Up the Area of Rectangles: Kid Stuff
The material in this section — using rectangles to approximate the area of strange shapes —  
is part of every calculus course because integration rests on this foundation. But, in a sense, 
this material doesn’t involve calculus at all. You could do everything in this section without 
calculus, and if calculus had never been invented, you could still approximate area with the 
methods described here.

Sketch f

ln x and divide 
the interval from 1 to 6 into ten

Each increment will have a 
length of 1 2, of course. See the 
figure in Step 2.

Draw a right rectangle for each 
of the ten increments.
You’re doing right rectangles, 
so put your pen on the right end 
of the base of the first rectangle 
(that’s at x
1 5. ), draw straight 
up till you hit the curve, and 
then straight left till you’re 
directly above the left end of 
the base (x
1). Finally, going 
straight down, draw the left 
side of the first rectangle. See 
the following figure. I’ve 
indicated with arrows how you 
draw the first rectangle. Draw 
the rest the same way.

Sigma Notation and Riemann Sums: Geek Stuff
Now that you’re warmed up, it’s time to segue into summing some sophisticated sigma sums. 
Sigma notation may look difficult, but it’s really just a shorthand way of writing a long sum.
In a sigma sum problem, you can pull anything through the sigma symbol to the outside except 
for a function of the index of summation (the i in the following example). Note that you can use 
any letter you like for the index of summation, though i and k are customary.

1.	 Create the argument of the sigma 
function.
The jump amount between terms in 
a long sum will become the coeffi-
cient of the index of summation in a 
sigma sum, so you know that 10i is 
the basic term of your argument. 
You want to cube each term, so that 
gives you the following argument.

2.	Set the range of the sum.
Ask yourself what i must be to make the 
first term equal 503: That’s 5, of course. 
And ask the same question about the last 
term of 1503: i must be 15. Put the  
5 and the 15 on the sigma symbol like 
this:

Close Isn’t Good Enough: The Definite  
Integral and Exact Area
Now, finally, the first calculus in this chapter. Why settle for approximate areas when you can 
use the definite integral to get exact areas?
The exact area under a curve between a and b is given by the definite integral, which is defined 
as follows:
f x dx
f x
b
a
n
a
b
n
i
i
n
lim

In plain English, this simply means that you can calculate the exact area under a curve between 
two points by using the kind of formula you got in Step 10 of the previous example and then 
taking the limit of that formula as n approaches infinity. This gives you the exact area because 
it sort of uses an infinite number of infinitely narrow rectangles. (Okay, so maybe that wasn’t 
plain, but at least it was English.)
The function inside the definite integral is called the integrand.

the definition of the definite integral

Finding Area with the Trapezoid  
Rule and Simpson’s Rule
To close this chapter, I give you two more ways to approximate an area. You can use these 
methods when finding the exact area is impossible. (Just take my word for it that there are 
functions that can’t be handled with ordinary integration to get an exact area.) With the  
trapezoid rule, you draw trapezoids under the curve instead of rectangles. See Figure  10-1, 
which shows the same function I used for the first example in this chapter.
Note: You can’t actually see the trapezoids, because their tops mesh with the curve, y
x
ln
. But 
between each pair of points, such as A and B, there’s a straight trapezoid top in addition to the 
curved piece of y
x
ln
.
The Trapezoid Rule: You can approximate the exact area under a curve between a and b with a 
sum of trapezoids given by the following formula. In general, the more trapezoids, the better 
the estimate.

where n is the number of trapezoids, x0 equals a, and x1 through x n are the equally spaced  
x coordinates of the right edges of trapezoids 1 through n.
Simpson’s Rule also uses trapezoid-like shapes, except that the top of each “trapezoid” —  
instead of being a straight, slanting segment, as “shown” in Figure 10-1 — is a curve (actually 
a small piece of a parabola) that very closely hugs the function. Because these little parabola 
pieces are so close to the function, Simpson’s Rule gives the best area approximation of any of 
the methods. If you’re wondering why you should learn the Trapezoid Rule when you can just 
as easily use Simpson’s Rule and get a more accurate estimate, chalk it up to just one more 
instance of the sadism of calculus teachers.

b.	 How is this approximation related to the area obtained with 10 right rectangles?  
The only difference is that the sum for left rectangles has a 0 at the left end and the 
sum for right rectangles has a 1.792 at the right end. The other 9 numbers in both 
sums are the same. Look at the second line in the computation in Step 4 above. Note 
that the sum of the 10 numbers inside the parentheses includes the first 9 numbers in 
the computation for right rectangles, which you see in Step 4 of the answer to the first 
example in this chapter. The only difference in the two sums is the left-most number 
in the left-rectangle sum and the right-most number in the right-rectangle sum.
If you look at the figure in Step 2 of the example and at the figure in Step 3 of the solution 
to 1(a), you’ll see why this works out this way. The first rectangle in the example figure is 
identical to the second rectangle in the solution 1(a) figure. The second rectangle in the 
example figure is identical to the third rectangle in the solution 1(a) figure, and so on. The 
only difference is that the solution 1(a) figure contains the left-most “rectangle” (the one 
with a height of zero) and the example figure contains the tall, right-most rectangle.
A left-rectangle sum and a right-rectangle sum will always differ by an amount equal 
to the difference in area of the left-most left rectangle and the right-most right rect-
angle. (Memorize this sentence and recite it in class — with your right index finger 
pointed upward for effect. You’ll instantly become a babe [dude] magnet.)

Approximate the same area again with 10 midpoint rectangles. The approximate  
area is 5.759.
1.	 Sketch your curve and the 10 subintervals again.
2.	 Compute the midpoints of the bases of all rectangles.
This should be a no-brainer: 1.25, 1.75, 2.25, . . . , 5.75.

Rank the approximations from the example and Problems 1 and 2 from best to worst and 
defend your ranking. The midpoint rectangles give the best estimate because each rectangle 
goes above the curve (in this sense, it’s too big) and also leaves an uncounted gap below the 
curve (in this sense, it’s too small). These two errors cancel each other out to some extent. 
By the way, the exact area is about 5.751. The approximate area with 10 midpoint rectangles, 
5.759, is only about 0.14% off.
It’s harder to rank the left versus the right rectangle estimates. Kudos if you noticed that 
because of the shape of f
x
x
ln
, right rectangles will give a slightly better estimate 
(technically, it’s because ln x is concave down and increasing). It turns out that the right-
rectangle approximation is off by 7.48%, and the left-rectangle estimate is off by 8.10%. If 
you missed this question, don’t sweat it. It’s basically an extra-credit type question.

Use 8 left, right, and midpoint rectangles to approximate the area under sinx from 0 to . 
The approximations are, respectively, 1.974, 1.974, and 2.013.
Let’s cut to the chase. Here are the computations for 8 left rectangles, 8 right rectangles, and

The exact area under sinx from 0 to  has the wonderfully simple answer of 2. The error of 
the midpoint rectangle estimate is 0.65%, and the other two have an error of 1.3%. The left 
and right rectangle estimates are the same, by the way, because of the symmetry of the sine 
wave.

I
n this chapter, you really get into integration in full swing. First you look at the annoying 
area function, then the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, and then two beginner integra-
tion methods.
The Absolutely Atrocious and  
Annoying Area Function
The area function is both more difficult and less useful than the material that follows it. With 
any luck, your calc teacher will skip it or just give you a cursory introduction to it. Once you 
finish this section and get to the next section on the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, you’ll 
have no more use for the area function. It’s taught because it’s the foundation for the all- 
important Fundamental Theorem.
The area function is an odd duck and doesn’t look like any function you’ve ever seen before:

214      PART 4  Integration and Infinite Series
The input of the function (its argument) is the x on top of the integral symbol. Note that f t  
is not the argument. The output, A
x
f
, tells you how much area is swept out under the curve, 
f t , as you sweep along the horizontal axis from left to right from some starting point, s, up to 
the x value. (Note that the horizontal axis is called the t axis in these problems.) For example, 
consider the simple horizontal line g t
10 and the area function based on it, A
x
dt
g
x10
3
.
This area function tells you how much area is under the horizontal line (which is at a height of 
10) between vertical lines at 3 and at the x value. When x
4, the area is 10 because you have a 
rectangle with a base of 1 (from 3 to 4) and a height of 10. When x
5, the rectangle’s base is 
now 2, so it’s area and the output of the function is 20; when x
6, the output is 30, and so on. 
(For an excellent and thorough explanation of the area function and how it relates to the Fun-
damental Theorem, check out Calculus For Dummies, 2nd Edition.) The best way to get a handle 
on this weird function is to see it in action, so here goes.
Don’t forget that when using an area function (or a definite integral — stay tuned), area below 
the horizontal axis counts as negative area.
Q.	 Consider f t , shown in the following 
figure. Given the area function 
A
x
f t dt
f

, approximate Af 4 , 
Af 5 , Af 2 , and Af 0 . Also, is Af 
increasing or decreasing between x
5 
and x
6? Between x
8 and x
9?
© John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
A.	 Af 4  is the area under f t  between 2 
and 4. That’s roughly a rectangle with 
a base of 2 and a height of 3, so the area 
is about 6. (See the shaded area in the 
figure.)
Af
5  adds a bit to Af 4  — the added 
shape is roughly a trapezoid with 
“height” of 1 and “bases” of 2 and 3 
(along the dotted lines at x
4 and x
5)  
that thus has an area of about 2.5 — so 
Af
5  is roughly 6 plus 2.5, or 8.5.
Af 2  is the area between 2 and 2, 
which is zero.
Af 0  is another area roughly in the 
shape of a trapezoid. Its height is 2 
and its bases are 2 and 3, so its area is 
about 5. But because you go backward 
from 2 to zero, Af 0  equals about –5.
Between x = 5 and x = 6, Af is 
increasing. Be careful here: f t  is 
decreasing between 5 and 6, but as 
you go from 5 to 6, Af sweeps out 
more and more area so it’s increasing.
Between x = 8 and x = 9, while f t  
is increasing Af is decreasing. Area 
below the t axis counts as negative 
area, so in moving from 8 to 9, Af 
sweeps out more and more negative 
area, and it thus grows more and 
more negative. Af is therefore 
decreasing.
For Problems 1 through 4, use the 
area function A

 and 
the following figure. Most answers

Sound the Trumpets: The Fundamental 
Theorem of Calculus
The absolutely incredibly fantastic Fundamental Theorem of Calculus — some say one of or 
perhaps the greatest theorem in the history of mathematics — gives you a neat shortcut for 
finding area so you don’t have to deal with the annoying area function or that rectangle mumbo 
jumbo from Chapter 10. The basic idea is that you use the antiderivative of a function to find the 
area under it.
Let me jog your memory on antiderivatives: Because 3
2
x  is the derivative of x 3, x 3 is an antide-
rivative of 3
2
x . But so is x 3
5 because its derivative is also 3
2
x . So anything of the form x
C
3
 
(where C is a constant) is an antiderivative of 3
2
x . (Technically, you say that x
C
3
 is the family 
of antiderivatives of 3
2
x , not that it is the antiderivative of 3
2
x ; but you can say that x
C
3
 is 
the indefinite integral of 3
2
x .)
The Fundamental Theorem comes in two versions: the easy, more useful version and the diffi-
cult, less useful version. You learn the difficult, less useful version for basically the same reason 
you studied geometry proofs in high school, namely, “just because.”
The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (the difficult, less useful version): Given an area function 
Af that sweeps out area under f t , A
x
f t dt
f
s
x
, the rate at which area is being swept out is 
equal to the height of the original function. So, because the rate is the derivative, the derivative 
of the area function equals the original function: d
dx A
x
f x
f
. Because A
x
f t dt
f
s
x
, 
you can also write the previous equation as follows: d
dx
f t dt
f x
s
x
.

The argument of an area function is 
the expression at the top of the inte-

Because the argument of this area 
function, 3

than a plain old x, this is a chain rule 
problem. Thus,

Finding Antiderivatives: The Guess- 
and-Check Method
Your textbook, as well as the Cheat Sheet in Calculus For Dummies, 2nd Edition, lists a set of anti-
derivatives that you should memorize, such as the antiderivatives of sinx, 1
x , or 
1
1
2
x
. (Most 
of them are simply the basic derivative rules you know written in reverse.) When you face a 
problem that’s similar to one of these — like finding the antiderivative of sin 5x  or 1
8x  — you 
can use the guess-and-check method: Just guess your answer and check it by differentiating; 
then if it’s wrong, tweak it till it works.
Q.	 What’s sin 3x dx?
A.	
1
3
3
cos
x.
You’ve memorized that the antideriv-
ative of sinx is cosx. (You get that 
by considering the basic derivative 
rule. The derivative of cosx is sinx, 
which gives you, of course, that the 
derivative of cosx is sinx. Now 
reverse that to produce the antideriv-
ative rule.) So a good guess for this 
antiderivative would be cos 3x . 
When you check that guess by taking 
its derivative with the chain rule, you 
get 3
3
sin
x , which is what you want 
except for that first 3. To compensate 
for that, simply divide your guess by 3: 
cos 3
3
x . That’s it. If you have any 
doubts about this second guess, take 
its derivative and you’ll see that it 
gives you the desired integrand, 
sin 3x .

The Substitution Method: 
Pulling the Switcheroo
The group of guess-and-check problems in the previous section involves integrands that ­differ 
from the standard integrand of a memorized antiderivative rule by a numerical amount. The 
next set of problems involves integrands where the extra thing they contain includes a variable 
expression. For these problems, you can still use the guess-and-check method, but the tradi-
tional way of doing such problems is with the substitution method.

This is the same as the previ-
ous Step 1 except that at the 
same time as setting u equal to

of integration and turn them 
into u indices of integration.
This is how it’s done:

So 0 and  are the two u indices of

Steps 2–3 are identical to Steps 
2–3 in the previous example 
except that you happen to be 
dealing with a definite integral 
in this problem.
4.	
Pull the switcheroo. This time, 
in addition to replacing the 
x
3 and the 3

x dx with their u 
equivalents, you replace the x 
indices with the u indices:

If you prefer, you can skip deter-
mining the u indices of integra-
tion; just replace the u with x 3 like 
you did in Step 6 of the first 
example problem, and then evalu-
ate the definite integral with the 
original indices of integration. 
(Your calc teacher may not like 
this, however, because it’s not the 
book method.)

Solutions to Reverse Differentiation Problems

Where (from x
0 to x
8) does Ag equal 0? At about x
2 or 2 1 2 and about x
6.
Ag equals zero twice between x
0 and x
8. First, somewhere between x
2 and x
2 1 2 
where the negative area beginning at x
1 cancels out the positive area between x
1 2 and 
x
1. The second zero of Ag is somewhere between x
5 1 2 and x
6. After the first zero at 
about x
2 1 4, negative area is added between 2 1 4 and 4. The positive area from 4 to, say, 5 3 4 
roughly cancels that out, so Ag returns to zero at about x
5 3 4.
2	
Where (from x
0 to x
8) does Ag reach
a.	 its maximum value? Ag reaches its max at about x
8. After the zero at about x
5 3 4, Ag 
grows by roughly 3 1 4 square units by the time x gets to 8.
b.	 its minimum value? The minimum value of Ag is at x
4 where it equals something like 
11 2. Note that this minimum occurs at the point where all the negative area has been 
added (minimums often occur at points like that) and that when you move to the right 
past x
4, the area crosses above the t axis and the area begins to increase.
3	
In what intervals between 0 and 8 is Ag
a.	 increasing? Ag is increasing from 0 to 1 and from 4 to 8.
b.	 decreasing? Ag is decreasing from 1 to 4.
4	
Approximate Ag 1 , Ag 3 , and Ag 5 .
Ag 1  is a bit bigger than the right triangle with base from x
1 2 to x
1 on the t axis and 
vertex maybe at 1 2 4
, 
, which has an area of 1. So the area in question is slightly more than 1.
There’s a zero at about 2 1 4. Between there and x
3 the area is very roughly –1, so Ag 3  is 
about –1.
In Problem 2b, you estimate Ag 4  to be about 11 2. Between 4 and 5, there’s sort of a trian-
gular shape with a rough area of 1 2. Thus Ag 5  equals about 11 2
1 2 or roughly –1.

You’ll get a math ticket if you put an equal sign in front of the last line because it is not equal 
to the line before it. When you don’t change the limits of integration, you get this mixed-up 
integral with an integrand in terms of u, but with limits of integration in terms of x (s in this 
problem). This may be one reason why the preferred book method includes switching the 
limits of integration — it’s mathematically cleaner.
Now just antidifferentiate, switch back, and evaluate:

Integration Rules for 
Calculus Connoisseurs
I
n this chapter, you work on some complex and challenging integration techniques. The 
methods may seem quite difficult at first, but, like with anything, they’re not that bad at all 
after some practice.
Integration by Parts: Here’s How u du It
Integration by parts is the counterpart of the product rule for differentiation (see Chapter 6), 
because the integrand in question is the product of two functions (usually). Here’s the method 
in a nutshell. You split up the two functions in the integrand, differentiate one, integrate the 
other, and then apply the integration-by-parts formula. This process converts the original 
integrand — which you can’t integrate — into an integrand you can integrate. Clear as mud, 
right? You’ll catch on to the technique real quick if you use the following LIATE acronym and 
the box method in the example. First, here’s the formula:
For integration by parts, here’s what u du: u dv
uv
v du.
Don’t try to understand that until you work through an example problem. Your first challenge 
in an integration-by-parts problem is to decide what function in your original integrand will 
play the role of the u in the formula. Here’s how you do it.

1.	 Pick your u function.
The integrand contains a logarith-
mic function (first on the LIATE 
list), so ln x is your u. Everything 
else in the integrand — namely 
x dx
2
 — is automatically your dv.
2.	 Use a box like the following one to 
organize the four elements of the 
problem.
© John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
To select your u function, just go down the following list; the first function type from this list 
that’s in your integrand is your u. To remember the list, just remember the acronym LIATE:
»
» Logarithmic (like lnx)
»
» Inverse trigonometric (like arcsinx)
»
» Algebraic (like 4
10
3
x
)
»
» Trigonometric (like sinx)
»
» Exponential (like 5 x)
I wish I could take credit for this LIATE method, but credit goes to Herbert Kasube (see his 
article in American Mathematical Monthly 90, 1983). I can, however, take credit for the follow-
ing brilliant mnemonic device to help you remember the acronym: Lilliputians In Africa Tackle 
Elephants.
Put your u and your dv in the appro-
priate cells, as the following figure 
shows.

3.	 Differentiate the u and integrate the 
dv, as the arrows in the next figure 
show.

Your original integral equals the

uct of the cells on the diagonal.

Transfiguring Trigonometric Integrals
Don’t you just love trig? I’ll bet you didn’t realize that studying calculus was going to give you 
the opportunity to do so much more trig. Remember this next Thanksgiving when everyone 
around the dinner table is invited to mention something that they’re thankful for.
This section lets you practice integrating expressions containing trigonometric functions. The 
basic idea is to fiddle with the integrand until you’re able to finish with a u-substitution (see 
Chapter 11). In the next section, you use some fancy trigonometric substitutions to solve inte-
grals that don’t contain trig functions.

a
2
2 , 
u
a

u
2
2 , as well as powers of those roots. To solve these problems, you use a 
SohCahToa right triangle, the Pythagorean Theorem, and some fancy trigonometric substitu-
tions. I’m sure you’ll have no trouble with this technique — it’s even easier than string theory.

Because 1

3 , you could have taken it apart — or “unadded” it — 
and arrived at 1

rational functions instead of simple fractions.

5.	 Equate coefficients of like terms.
Because Step 4 only gave you one 
term, take a different tack. If you mul-
tiply (FOIL) everything out in the Step 
3 equation, the right side of the equa-
tion will contain a constant term and 
terms in x, x 2, x 3, x 4, x 5, and x 6. This 
equation is an identity, so the coeffi-
cient of, say, the x 5 term on the right 
has to equal the coefficient of the x 5 
term on the left (which is 0 in this 
problem). So set the coefficient of each 
term on the right equal to the coeffi-
cient of its corresponding term on the 
left. Here’s your final result:
Constant term: 1
C
x term: 2
B
x 2 term: 0

x 3 term: 0

You can quickly obtain the values of all 
seven unknowns from these seven 
equations, and thus you could have 
skipped Step 4. But plugging in roots 
is so easy, and the values you get may 
help you finish the problem faster, so 
it’s always a good thing to do.
And there’s a third way to solve for 
the unknowns. You can obtain a 
system of equations like the one in 
this step by plugging non-root values 
into x in the equation from Step 3. 
(You should use small numbers that 
are easy to calculate with.) After doing 
several partial fraction problems, 
you’ll get a feel for what combination 
of the three techniques works best for 
each problem.

Using the Integral to 
Solve Your Problems
N
ow that you’re an expert at integrating, it’s time to put that awesome power to use to 
solve some . . . ahem . . . real-world problems. All right, I admit it — the problems you 
see in this chapter won’t seem to bear much connection to reality. But, in fact, inte-
gration is a powerful and practical mathematical tool. Engineers, scientists, and economists, 
among others, do important, practical work with integration that they couldn’t do without it.
Finding a Function’s Average Value
With differentiation, you can determine the maximum and minimum heights of a function, 
its steepest points, its inflection points, its concavity, and so on. But there’s a simple question 
about a function that differentiation cannot answer: What’s the function’s average height? To 
answer that, you need integration.

Finding the Area between Curves
In elementary school and high school geometry, you learned area formulas for all sorts of 
shapes like rectangles, circles, triangles, parallelograms, kites, and so on. Big deal. With inte-
gration, you can determine things like the area between f x
x 2 and g x

Volumes of Weird Solids: No, You’re  
Never Going to Need This
Integration works by cutting something up into an infinite number of infinitesimal pieces and 
then adding the pieces up to compute the total. In this way, integration is able to determine 
the volume of bizarre shapes that don’t have volume formulas: It cuts the shapes up into thin 
pieces that have ordinary shapes that can be calculated with ordinary geometry formulas. This 
section shows you three different methods:
»
» The meat slicer method: This works just like a deli meat slicer — you cut a shape into flat, 
thin slices. You then add up the volume of the slices. This method is used for odd, some-
times asymmetrical shapes.
»
» The disk/washer method: With this method, you cut up the given shape into thin, flat disks 
or washers. This method is used for shapes with circular cross-sections.
»
» The cylindrical shell method: Here, you cut your volume up into thin nested shells. Each 
one fits snugly inside the next widest one, like telescoping tubes or nested Russian dolls. 
This method is also used for shapes with circular cross-sections.

CHAPTER 13  Who Needs Freud? Using the Integral to Solve Your Problems      259
Q.	 What’s the volume of the shape shown in the following figure? Its base is formed by the 
functions f x
x  and g x
x . Its cross-sections are isosceles triangles whose 
heights grow linearly from zero at the origin to 1 when x
1.
© John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
A.	 The volume is 2
5
 cubic units.
1.	
Always try to sketch the figure first (of course, I’ve done it for you here).
2.	
Indicate on your sketch a representative thin slice of the volume in question.
This slice should always be perpendicular to the axis or direction along which 
you are integrating. In other words, if your integrand contains, say, a dx, your 
slice should be perpendicular to the x axis. Also, the slice should not be at either 
end of the three-dimensional figure or at any other special place. Rather, it 
should be at some arbitrary, nondescript location within the shape.
3.	
Express the volume of this slice.
It’s easy to show — trust me — that the height of each triangle is the same as its 
x coordinate. Its base goes from 
x  up to x and is thus 2 x . And its thickness 
is dx.
Therefore, Volumeslice

Q.	 Using the disk/washer method, what’s the volume of the glass that makes up the vase

First, here’s how the vase is “created.” The light-gray shaded area shown in the 
figure lies between x and 0 75

shape is generated by revolving the shaded area about the x axis.
1.	
Sketch the 3-D shape (already done for you).
2.	
Indicate a representative slice (see the dark-gray shaded area in the figure).
3.	
Express the volume of the representative slice.
A representative slice in a washer problem looks like — can you guess? — a 
washer. See the following figure.
© John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
The large circle has an area of R 2, and the hole an area of r 2. So a washer’s 
cross-sectional area is R

R

is

4.	
Add up the washers by integrating from 0 to 9.
But wait; did you notice the slight snag in this problem? The “washers” from 
x
0 to x
1 have no holes, so there’s no little-r circle to subtract from the big-R 
circle. A washer without a hole is called a disk, but you treat it the same as a 
washer except you don’t subtract a hole.

Add up the disks from 0 to 1 and the washers from 1 to 9 for the total volume.

Q.	 Now tip the same glass vase up vertically. This time find the volume of its glass with 
the cylindrical shells method. See the following figure.
© John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
A.	 The volume is 45
2 .
Again, this is the same vase as in the disk/washer example, but this time it’s repre-
sented by different functions. In a random act of kindness, I figured the new functions 
for you.

262      PART 4  Integration and Infinite Series
1.	
Express the volume of your representative shell.
To figure the volume of a representative shell, imagine taking the label off a can 
of soup — when you lay it flat, it’s a rectangle, right? The area is thus 
base height, and the base of the rectangle comes from the circumference of the 
can. So the area is 2 rh. (r equals x and h depends on the given functions.) The 
thickness of the shell is dx, so its volume is 2 rh dx
 
.
Wait! Another snag — a bit similar to the snag in the previous example. The 
smaller shells, with right edges at x
0 up to x
3 2
2
, have heights that measure 
from f x  up to g x . But the larger shells, with right edges at x
3 2
2
 to x
3, 
have heights that measure from f x  up to 9. So you have to integrate the two 
batches of shells separately.

Amazing! This actually agrees (which, of course, it should) with the result from 
the washer method. By the way, I got a bit carried away with these example 
problems. Your practice problems won’t be this tough.

Use the meat slicer method to derive the for-
mula for the volume of a pyramid with a 
square base (see the following figure). Hint: 
Integrate from 0 to h along the positive side 
of the upside-down y axis. (I set the problem 
up this way because it simplifies it. You can 
draw the y axis the regular way if you like, 
but then you get an upside-down pyramid.) 
Your formula should be in terms of s and h.

Arc Length and Surfaces of Revolution
You can use integration to determine the length of a curve by sort of cutting up the curve into 
an infinite number of infinitesimal segments, each of which is basically the hypotenuse of a 
tiny right triangle. Then your pedestrian Pythagorean Theorem does the rest. The same basic 
idea applies to surfaces of revolution. Here are two handy formulas for solving these problems:

you cut the triangle into two triangles — corresponding to Steps 3 and 4 above — you 
can get the total area with simple coordinate geometry.

The volume of your representative square slice equals its cross-sectional area times its thick-

CHAPTER 14  Infinite (Sort of) Integrals      277
Infinite (Sort of) 
Integrals
T
he main topic of this chapter is really amazing when you stop and think about it: cal-
culating the area (or volume) of shapes that are infinitely long. The word infinity comes 
up in mathematics so often that perhaps we become jaded about the concept and forget 
how truly incredible it is. It’s about 93 million miles from the earth to the sun. That distance 
is so great that it’s nearly impossible to wrap our minds around it, but it’s nothing compared 
to the distance to Alpha Centauri A (the nearest star), which is 4.24 light-years away — about 
268,000 times as far as the distance to the sun. Our Milky Way Galaxy is about 100,000 light-
years across, and it’s about 4½ million light-years to our nearest spiral galaxy neighbor, the 
Andromeda Galaxy. Go out about 10,000 times that far and you reach the “edge” of the observ-
able universe at about 46 or 47 billion light-years away. That’s definitely quite a ways out 
there, but it’s nothing compared to infinity.
The shapes you deal with in this chapter are not just bigger than the entire universe; they’re so 
big that they make the universe seem like a speck of dust by comparison. And, yet, using the 
powerful tools of calculus (including L’Hôpital’s Rule), we’re able to compute the area of these 
gargantuan shapes. And some of them turn out to have nice, manageable areas like, say, 10 
square inches! It’s time to get started.

Getting Your Hopes Up with L’Hôpital’s Rule
This powerful little rule enables you to easily compute limits that are either difficult or impos-
sible without it.
L’Hôpital’s Rule: When plugging the arrow-number into a limit expression gives you 0 0 
or 
, you replace the numerator and denominator with their respective derivatives and 
do the limit problem again — repeating this process if necessary — until you arrive at a limit 
you can solve.
If you’re wondering why this limit rule is in the middle of this chapter about integration, it’s 
because you need L’Hôpital’s Rule for the next section and the next chapter.
Q.	 What’s lim log

but just what you want for

fraction with their respective 
derivatives.

If substituting the arrow-number 
into x gives you 
0, 
, 1
, 00, 
or 
0 — the so-called unaccept-
able forms — instead of one of the 
acceptable forms, 0
0 or 
, you have 
to manipulate the limit problem to 
convert it into one of the accepta-
ble forms.
Q.	 What’s lim

A.	 The limit is 0.

You get

ceptable forms.
2.	 Rewrite e

? Tip: When plugging in 
gives you one of the exponential forms, 00,

, set the limit equal to y, take the 
natural log of both sides, use the log of a 
power rule, and take it from there.

Disciplining Those Improper Integrals
In this section, you bring some discipline to integrals that misbehave by going up, down, left, 
or right to infinity. You handle infinity, as usual, with limits. The first example’s an integral 
that goes up to infinity.
Q.	 Evaluate

A.	 The area is infinite.
1.	 Check whether the function is 
defined everywhere between and at 
the limits of integration.
You note that when x
0, the 
function shoots up to infinity. So 
you’ve got an improper integral. 
In a minute, you’ll see what 
happens if you fail to note this.
2.	 Break the integral in two at the 
critical x value.

Therefore, this limit does not 
exist (DNE).
If you split up an integral in 
two, and one piece equals  and 
the other equals 
, you cannot 
add the two to obtain an answer 
of zero. When this happens, the 
limit DNE.
Now, watch what happens if you 
fail to notice that this function is 
undefined at x

CHAPTER 15  Infinite Series: Welcome to the Outer Limits      287
Infinite Series: Welcome 
to the Outer Limits
L
ike Chapter 14, this chapter deals with the infinite. In Chapter 15, you investigate lists of 
numbers that never end. And, quite remarkably, you discover that some of these infinitely 
long lists of numbers (that wouldn’t even fit in the entire universe if written out com-
pletely) can actually be added up — summing to a nice, ordinary finite number! These lists of 
numbers that can be added up are called convergent series. The lists of numbers you can’t total 
up are called divergent series. Your task in this chapter is to decide which are which.
The Nifty nth Term Test
One of the easiest tests you can use to help you decide whether a series converges or diverges 
is the nth term test. This test sort of looks at what’s happening way out toward the “end” of 
an infinite list of numbers. (Of course, there isn’t actually an end of an infinite list.) You might 
say that the nth term test looks at what’s happening to the numbers in the list the farther and 
farther you go out along the list. Before defining the test formally, I go over a couple terms.
A sequence is a finite or infinite list of numbers (this chapter deals only with infinite sequences). 
When you add up the terms of a sequence, the sequence becomes a series. For example,
1 2 4 8 16 32 64
,
,
,
,
,
,
,...
 
 
 
 
 
 
 is a sequence, and
1

 is the related series.

The nth term test: If lim
n
n
a
0, then 
an diverges. In English, this says that if a series’ under-
lying sequence does not converge to zero, then the series must diverge.
It does not follow that if a series’ underlying sequence converges to zero, then the series will 
definitely converge. It may converge, but there’s no guarantee.
Q	
Does 
1
1
1
n
n
n
 converge or diverge?
A.	 It diverges.
You can answer this question with 
common sense if your calc teacher 
allows such a thing. As n gets larger 
and larger, 1
1
n
 increases and gets 
closer and closer to one. And when you 
take any root of a number like 0.9, the 
root is larger than the original 
number — and the higher the root 
index, the larger the answer is. So 
1
1
n
n
 has to get larger as n increases, 
and thus lim
n
n
n
1
1  cannot possibly 
equal zero. The series, therefore, 
diverges by the nth term test.
If your teacher doesn’t like that 
approach, you can do the following: 
Plugging  into the limit produces 
1
1
1
, which is 10, and that 
equals 1 — you’re done. (Note that 
10 is not one of the forms that gives 
you a L’Hôpital’s Rule problem — 
see Chapter 14.) Because lim
n
n
n
1
1  
equals 1, 
1
1
1
n
n
n
 diverges by the 
nth term test. (If your teacher is a 
real stickler for rigor, he or she 
might not like this approach either 
because, technically, you’re not 
supposed to plug  into n even 
though it works just fine. Oh, 
well. . . . )

convergent or divergent.

» Geometric series: If 0

r

ar n
n 0
 converges to a
r
1
.
If r
1, the series diverges. Have you heard the riddle about walking halfway to the wall, 
then halfway again, then half the remaining distance, and so on? The lengths of those steps 
make up a geometric series.

so I don’t make you practice any problems.

ing a series by a constant never affects whether it converges or diverges. For example, if

un

Apples and Oranges . . . and Guavas:  
Three Comparison Tests
With the three comparison tests, you compare the series in question to a benchmark series. If 
the benchmark converges, so does the given series; if the benchmark diverges, the given series 
does as well.
»
» The direct comparison test: Given that 0
a
b
n
n for all n, if 
bn converges, so does 
an, and if 
an diverges, so does 
bn.
This could be called the well, duh test. All it says is that a series with terms equal to or 
greater than the terms of a divergent series must also diverge, and that a series with terms 
equal to or less than the terms of a convergent series must also converge.
»
» The limit comparison test: For two series 
an and 
bn, if an
0, bn
0, and lim
n
n
n
a
b
L, 
where L is finite and positive, then either both series converge or both diverge.

» The integral comparison test: If f x  is positive, continuous, and decreasing for all x
1 
and if a
f n
n
, then 
an
n 1
 and f x dx
1
 either both converge or both diverge. Note that 
for some strange reason, other books don’t refer to this as a comparison test, despite the 
fact that the logic of the three tests in this section is the same.
Use one or more of the three comparison tests to determine the convergence or divergence of 
the series in the practice problems. Note that you can often solve these problems in more than 
one way.
Q.	 Does 
1
2 lnn
n

A.	 It diverges.
Note that the nth term test is no 
help because lim ln

from the p-series rule that 
1

1
2 n

, of course, also 
diverges. The direct comparison 
test now tells you that

diverge as well because each term 
of

n
 is greater than the 
corresponding term of

Ratiocinating the Two “R” Tests
Here you practice the ratio test and the root test. With both tests, a result less than 1 means that 
the series in question converges; a result greater than 1 means that the series diverges; and a 
result of 1 tells you nothing.
»
» The ratio test: Given a series 
un, consider the limit of the ratio of a term to the previ-
ous term, lim
n
n
n
u
u
1 . If this limit is less than 1, the series converges. If it’s greater than 1 (this 
includes ), the series diverges. And if it equals 1, the ratio test tells you nothing.
»
» The root test: Note its similarity to the ratio test. Given a series 
un, consider the limit 
of the nth root of the nth term, lim
n
n
n u . If this limit is less than 1, the series converges. If 
it’s greater than one (including ), the series diverges. And if it equals 1, the root test says 
nothing.
The ratio test is a good test to try if the series involves factorials like n! or where n is in the 
power, like 2n. The root test also works well when the series contains nth powers. If you’re not 
sure which test to try first, start with the ratio test — it’s often the easier one to use.

He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not:  
Alternating Series
Alternating series look just like any other series except that they contain an extra 
1
n or 
1
1
n . 
This extra term causes the terms of the series to alternate between positive and negative.
An alternating series converges if two conditions are met:
1.	
Its nth term converges to zero.
2.	
Its terms are non-increasing.
In other words, each term is either smaller than or the same as its predecessor (ignoring 
the minus sign).
For the problems in this section, determine whether the series converges or diverges. If it 
­converges, determine whether the convergence is absolute or conditional.
If you take a convergent alternating series and make all the terms positive and it still con-
verges, then the alternating series is said to converge absolutely. If, on the other hand, the series 
of positive terms diverges, then the alternating series converges conditionally.

A.	 The series is conditionally 
convergent.
If you make this a series of positive 
terms, it becomes a p-series with 
p
1
2
, which you know diverges. Thus, 
the above alternating series is not 
absolutely convergent. It is, however, 
conditionally convergent because it 
obviously satisfies the two conditions 
of the alternating series test:
1.	 The nth term converges to zero.
lim
n
n
1
0
2.	 The terms are non-increasing.
The series is thus conditionally 
convergent.
For problems 21 and 22, determine whether the 
series converges or diverges. If the series converges, 
determine whether the convergence is absolute or 
conditional.

zero, neither does the underlying sequence of the series. And, therefore, the nth term test 
tells you that the series must diverge.

bad news for you. The bad news is that you’re wrong — you have to use the p-series test to 
find out whether this converges or not (check out the solution to Problem 5). The good news 
is that you made this mistake here instead of on a test.
Don’t forget that the nth term test is no help in determining the convergence or divergence 
of a series when the underlying sequence converges to zero.

Thus, this is not a geometric series, and therefore the geometric series rule does not apply. 
And you can’t actually finish this problem with the ideas presented in this section — sorry 
about that. But can you guess whether this series converges or not (assuming the pattern  
4, 8, 12, 16, 20 continues)? To finish the problem, you need to use the limit comparison test 
covered in the “Apples and Oranges . . . and Guavas” section. You can prove that this series 
diverges by comparing it to the divergent harmonic series.
This is a bit tricky. You first have to notice — ignoring the first term (1/2 ) — that the rest of 
the denominators make a simple pattern of multiples of four: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20. . . . This allows 
you to rewrite the series — again, ignoring the first term — as 
1
4
1 n
n
. Now you’re ready to 
finish with the limit comparison test, using the divergent harmonic series, 
1

benchmark series:

result, and, therefore, the original series diverges.

between 0 and 1.

Ten Things about 
Limits, Continuity, 
and Infinite Series
I
n this very short chapter, I give you two great mnemonics for memorizing a great deal about 
limits, continuity, derivatives, and infinite series. If I do say so myself, you’re getting a lot 
of bang for your buck here.
The 33333 Mnemonic
This mnemonic is a memory aid for limits, continuity, and derivatives. First, note that I’ve put 
the word “limil” under the five threes. That’s “limit” with the t changed to an l. Also note the 
nice parallel between “limil” and the second mnemonic in this chapter, the 13231 mnemonic — 
in both cases, you have two pairs surrounding a single letter or number in the center.

First 3 over the “l”: 3 parts to the  
definition of a limit
You can find the formal definition of a limit in Chapter 3. This mnemonic helps you remember 
that it has three parts. And — take my word for it — just that is usually enough to help you 
remember what the three parts are. Try it.
Fifth 3 over the “l”: 3 cases where  
a limit fails to exist
The three cases are
»
» At a vertical asymptote. This is an infinite discontinuity.
»
» At a jump discontinuity.
»
» With the limit at infinity or negative infinity of an oscillating function like limcos
x
x, where the 
function keeps oscillating up and down forever, never homing in on a single y value.
Second 3 over the “i”: 3 parts to  
the definition of continuity
First notice the oh-so-clever fact that the letter i can’t be drawn without taking your pen off 
the paper and, thus, that it’s not continuous. This will help you remember that the second and 
fourth 3s concern continuity.
The three-part, formal definition of continuity is in Chapter 3. The mnemonic will help you 
remember that it has three parts. And — just like with the definition of a limit — that’s enough 
to help you remember what the three parts are.
Fourth 3 over the “i”: 3 cases where  
continuity fails to exist
The three cases are
»
» A removable discontinuity — the highfalutin calculus term for a hole.
»
» An infinite discontinuity.
»
» A jump discontinuity.

CHAPTER 16  Ten Things about Limits, Continuity, and Infinite Series      313
Third 3 over the “m”: 3 cases where  
a derivative fails to exist
Note that m often stands for slope, right? And the slope is the same thing as the derivative. The 
three cases where it fails to exist are
»
» At any type of discontinuity.
»
» At a sharp point along a function (there are two types, corners and cusps). These sharp 
points only occur in weird functions you won’t see very often.
»
» At a vertical tangent. (A vertical line has an undefined slope and thus an undefined 
derivative.)
The 13231 Mnemonic
This mnemonic helps you remember the ten tests for the convergence or divergence of an infi-
nite series covered in Chapter 15. 1

10 total tests.
First 1: The nth term test of divergence
For any series, if the nth term doesn’t converge to zero, the series diverges.
Second 1: The nth term test of convergence  
for alternating series
The real name of this test is the alternating series test. But I’m referring to it as the nth term test 
of convergence because that’s a pretty good way to think about it for three reasons: because it 
has a lot in common with the nth term test of divergence, because these two tests make nice 
bookends for the other eight tests, and, last but not least, because it’s my book.
An alternating series will converge if 1) its nth term converges to 0, and 2) each term is less 
than or equal to the preceding term (ignoring the negative signs).
Note the following nice parallel between the two nth term tests: With the nth term test of diver-
gence, if the nth term fails to converge to zero, then the series must fail to converge, but it is not 
true that if the nth term does converge to zero, then the series must converge. With the alter-
nating series nth term test, it’s the other way around (sort of). If the test succeeds, then the 
series must converge, but it is not true that if the test fails, then the series must fail to converge.
First 3: The three tests with names
This “3” helps you remember the three types of series that have names: geometric series (which 
converge if r
1), p-series (which converge if p
1), and telescoping series.

314      PART 5  The Part of Tens
Second 3: The three comparison tests
The direct comparison test, the limit comparison test, and the integral comparison test all work 
the same way. You compare a given series to a known benchmark series. If the benchmark con-
verges, so does the given series, and ditto for divergence.
The 2 in the middle: The two R tests
The ratio test and the root test make a coherent pair because for both tests, if the limit is less 
than 1, the series converges; if the limit is greater than 1, the series diverges; and if the limit 
equals 1, the test tells you nothing.

Ten Things You Better 
Remember about 
Differentiation
I
n this chapter, I give you ten important things you should know about differentiation. Refer 
to these pages often. When you get these ten things down cold, you’ll have taken a not-
insignificant step toward becoming a differentiation expert.
The Difference Quotient
The formal definition of a derivative is based on the difference quotient: f
x
f x
h
f x
h
hlim
0
; 
this says basically the same thing as slope
rise
run .
The First Derivative Is a Rate
A first derivative tells you how much y changes per unit change in x along a line tangent to a 
function. For example, if y is in miles and x is in hours, and if at some point along the function

316      PART 5  The Part of Tens
(on the tangent line), y goes up 3 when x goes over 1, you’ve got 3 miles per 1 hour, or 3 mph. 
That’s the rate and that’s the derivative.
The First Derivative Is a Slope
In the previous example, when y goes up 3 (the rise) as x goes over 1 (the run) on a line tangent 
to the function, the slope (rise/run) at that point of the function would be 3 over 1, or 3 of course. 
That’s the slope and that’s the derivative.
Extrema, Sign Changes, and the First Derivative
When the sign of the first derivative changes from positive to negative or vice versa, that means 
that you went up and then down (and thus passed over the top of a hill, a local max), or you went 
down and then up (and thus passed through the bottom of a valley, a local min). In both of these 
cases (called local extrema), when you hit the very max or min, the first derivative will usually 
equal zero, though it may be undefined (if the local extremum is at a cusp or a corner). Also, note 
that if the first derivative equals zero, you may have a horizontal inflection point rather than a 
local extremum.
The Second Derivative and Concavity
A positive second derivative tells you that a function is concave up (like a spoon holding water 
or like a smile). A negative second derivative means concave down (like a spoon spilling water 
or like a frown).
Inflection Points and Sign Changes  
in the Second Derivative
Note the nice parallels between second derivative sign changes and first derivative sign changes 
described in the section above.
When the sign of the second derivative changes from positive to negative or vice versa, that 
means that the concavity of the function changed from up to down or down to up. In either 
case, you’re likely at an inflection point (though you could be at a cusp or a corner). At an inflec-
tion point, the second derivative will usually equal zero, though it may be undefined if there’s 
a vertical tangent at the inflection point. Also, if the second derivative equals zero, that does not 
guarantee that you’re at an inflection point. The second derivative can equal zero at a point 
where the function is concave up or down (like, for example, at 0 0
, 
 on the curve y
x 4 where 
the second derivative equals zero but the curve is concave up).

CHAPTER 17  Ten Things You Better Remember about Differentiation      317
The Product Rule
The derivative of a product of two functions equals the derivative of the first times the second 
plus the first times the derivative of the second. In symbols, d
dx uv
u v
uv .
The Quotient Rule
The derivative of a quotient of two functions equals the derivative of the top times the bot-
tom minus the top times the derivative of the bottom, all over the bottom squared. In symbols, 
d
dx
u
v
u v
uv
v 2
.
Note that the numerator of the quotient rule is identical to the product rule except for the sub-
traction. For both rules, you begin by taking the derivative of the first thing you read: the left 
function in a product and the top function in a quotient.
Linear Approximation
Here’s the fancy calculus formula for a linear approximation: l x
f x
f

If trying to memorize this leaves you feeling frustrated, flabbergasted, feebleminded, 
­flummoxed, or fit to be tied, consider this: It’s just an equation of a line, and its meaning is 
identical to the point-slope form for the equation of a line you learned in algebra I (tweaked a 
bit): y

m x

“PSST,” Here’s a Good Way to Remember  
the Derivatives of Trig Functions
Say you’re taking a test and you can’t remember the derivative of cosecant. You lean to the 
guy/gal next to you and whisper: “PSST, what’s the derivative of cosecant?” (I hope it goes 
without saying that I’m not recommending this.) Now, take the last three letters in PSST and 
write down the trig functions that begin with those letters: secant, secant, tangent. Below these 
write their co-functions, cosecant, cosecant, cotangent, and add a negative sign in front of the 
csc in the middle. Then add arrows. The arrows point to the derivatives. For example, the arrow 
after secant points to its derivative, sec tan; and the arrow next to tangent points backward 
to its derivative, sec2. This mnemonic may seem a bit convoluted, but it works. Here you go:
sec
sec
tan
csc
csc
cot

About the Author
A graduate of Brown University and the University of Wisconsin Law School, Mark 
Ryan has been  teaching math since 1989. He runs the Math Center in Winnetka, Illinois 
(www.themathcenter.com), where he teaches junior high and high school math courses, 
including an introduction to calculus. In high school, he twice scored a perfect 800 on the math 
portion of the SAT, and he not only knows mathematics, he has a gift for explaining it in plain 
English. He practiced law for four years before deciding he should do something he enjoys and 
use his natural talent for mathematics. Ryan is a member of the Authors Guild and the National 
Council of Teachers of Mathematics.
Calculus Workbook For Dummies, 3rd Edition, is Ryan’s 11th math book. Everyday Math for Everyday  
Life was published in 2002 and Calculus For Dummies (Wiley) in 2003; eight more books  
published by Wiley followed. His books have sold over half a million copies.
Ryan lives in Evanston, Illinois. For fun, he hikes, skies, plays platform tennis, travels, plays on 
a pub trivia team, and roots for the Chicago Blackhawks.
Author’s Acknowledgments
For the First Edition (2005):
My agent Sheree Bykofsky of Sheree Bykofsky Associates, Inc., has represented me now on 
three successful books. Her ability to make connections in the publishing world and to close 
deals — and to see the forest when I might be looking at the trees — has made her invaluable.
Many thanks to my bright, professional, and computer-savvy assistants, Benjamin Mumford, 
Randy Claussen, and Caroline DeVane. Josh Dillon did a meticulous review of the mathemat-
ics in the book. He knows calculus and how to communicate it clearly. And a special thanks to 
the multi-talented Amanda Wasielewski, who did everything from typing the book’s techni-
cal equations to creating diagrams to keeping the project organized to checking the calculus 
content.
Gene Schwartz, President of Consortium House, publishing consultants, and an expert in all 
aspects of publishing, gave me valuable advice for my contract negotiations. My friend, Beverly 
Wright, psychoacoustician and writer extraordinaire, was also a big help with the contract 
negotiations. She gave me astute and much needed advice and was generous with her time. I’m 
grateful to my consultant, Josh Lowitz, Adjunct Associate Professor of Entrepreneurship at the 
University of Chicago School of Business. He advised me on every phase of the book’s produc-
tion. His insights into my writing career and other aspects of my business, and his accessibility, 
might make you think I was his only client instead of one of a couple dozen.
This book is a testament to the high standards of everyone at Wiley. Special thanks to Joyce 
Pepple, Acquisitions Director, who handled our contract negotiations with intelligence, honesty, 
and fairness, and to Acquisitions Editor Kathy Cox, who deftly combined praise with a touch 
of gentle prodding to keep me on schedule. Technical Editor Dale Johnson did an excellent and 
thorough job spotting and correcting the errors that appeared in the book’s first draft — some 
of which would be very hard or impossible to find without an expert’s knowledge of calculus. 

The layout and graphics team did a fantastic job with the book’s thousands of complex equa-
tions and mathe­matical figures.
Finally, the book would not be what it is without the contributions of Project Editor Laura 
Peterson-Nussbaum. She’s an intelligent and skilled editor with a great sense of language 
and balance. And she has the ability to tactfully suggest creative changes — most of which I 
adopted — without interfering with my idiosyncratic style. It was a ­pleasure to work with her.
For the Second Edition (2015) and Third Edition (2018):
I’ve worked for many years with acquisitions editor Lindsay Sandman Lefevere. She’s intel-
ligent, professional, down-to-earth, and has a great sense of humor. And she has a special 
way of dealing with my oh-so-minor personality foibles with patience, skill, and finesse. It’s 
always a pleasure to work with her. I’ve done four books with project editor Tim Gallan. He’s 
a very talented and experienced editor who has a deft touch with the many aspects of taking 
a book from start to finish. He understands the forest, the trees, when to edit, and when not 
to edit. Editor Danielle Voirol did a great job with the painstaking task of creating the liter-
ally thousands of mathematical equations and symbols in the book. Christine Pingleton did a 
thorough and meticulous job with the copy editing for the book. Finally, Dr. Jason J. Molitierno, 
technical reviewer, did an excellent job reviewing all the calculus content in the book. He’s 
a calculus expert with a great eye for spotting errors, and he made valuable suggestions for  
improving the mathematics exposition. This book is a testament to the high standards of 
­everyone at Wiley.
