Config-Reg 
RXBOOT (diagnostics mode, use ‘b’ to continue booting 
Config-reg 0x2000 
Boot to ROM, use NVRAM (upgrade flash in run-from 
flash routers) 
Config-reg 0x2101 
Boot to ROM, skip NVRAM (disaster recovery) 
Config-reg 0x2141 
Boot to Flash, use NVRAM (normal operation) 
Config-reg 0x2102 
Boot to Flash, skip NVRAM (password recovery) 
Config-reg 0x2142 
 
 
Auto-Install 
Router broadcasts to get its own TCP/IP address using 
BOOTP 
Router broadcasts again to locate the file server IP address using 
TFTP 
Router attempts TFTP to get the IP-to-Hostname mapping file 
Network-confg 
  If above fails, fallback to 8.3 DOS compatible filename convention 
Cisconet.cfg 
Router attempts TFTP to get its specific Hostname running-config 
{Hostname}-confg 
  If above fails, fallback to 8.3 DOS compatible filename convention 
{Hostname}-cfg 
Note:{hostname} is determined by parsing network-confg file and checking all Hostnames listed against own IP 
address 
 
 
Password Recovery 
Step 1, halt router bootup on console port (requires physical access) 
CTRL-BREAK 
Step 2, enter RXBOOT command to set config-reg bits & stop 
NVRAM 
o/r 0x2142 
Step 3, bypassing NVRAM startup allows Enable mode without pwd 
Enable 
Step 4, once in Enable mode, copy NVRAM startup to RAM 
Copy startup-config running-config 
Step 5, change Enable and all other password as desired 
Enable password whatever 
Step 6, save RAM back into NVRAM, but now with new password 
Copy running-config startup-config 
Step 7, change config-reg bits back, so router boots normally 
Config-reg 0x2102
