Introduction
I
f I had a dime for every time I wrote “Organize Photos” on my to-do list,
only to leave it undone, I’d have enough cash to retire to some tropical
hideaway and do nothing but photograph coconuts all day. Unfortunately, no
dimes came my way, and I find myself here. The good news, however, is that
Adobe has given me, and you, Photoshop Album. Within this inexpensive
piece of software lies all of the tools you need in order to import, organize,
and manage your collection of photos. And it doesn’t stop there. Album is
also capable of handling video and audio clips and, as an added bonus, lets
you flex your creative muscles with the capability to create fun and interest-
ing projects — all with simplicity and ease. 
Because of Album I finally crossed “Organize Photos” off my to-do list for good.
About This Book
For some people, me included, launching a new program for the first time is
like driving in a strange city with no road map. Sure, you could drive around
and probably find where you need to go — eventually. But you would waste a
lot of time going down the wrong streets, stopping and asking for directions,
and pulling over to call people for help. You get the picture. Armed with a
map, on the other hand, you’re a virtual road warrior. 
That’s how it is with Album. Even though it’s a user-friendly program, it’s not
without its quirk or two. Sure, you could figure it out — eventually. Consider
this book your handy road map to Album. Armed with it, you don’t have to
worry about driving in circles.
What’s in This Book and How to Use It
This book is divided into several parts that correlate to the feature you’ll find
in Album. If you’re brand new to Album, you may want to start at the begin-
ning and continue forward somewhat linearly. If you’ve already got your
images into Album and are wondering what to do next, feel free to check out
the chapters on organizing, managing, and creations. If you’ve been working
in Album awhile and have a specific topic or a problem you want help with,
flip to the index to find what you need, read up, get out, and move on with
your business. Here’s a brief overview of what you’ll find within the spine.

Part I: Getting Started with
Photoshop Album
In these first chapters, I introduce Album and its features. This part is the
place to start if you have just installed the program and haven’t a clue as to
what Album can do for you. I cover the basics, like the Album interface, set-
ting your preferences, and getting help if you find yourself lost. The most
important chapter in this part is Chapter 3. Here’s where you’ll find the low-
down on working with resolution, color modes, and file formats. These topics
pop up throughout the book because understanding resolution and formats
is key to working with digital images. If those topics are new to you, don’t
skip this chapter. 
Part II: Importing, Organizing, and
Managing Photos
Before you can really reap the benefits Album has to offer, you need to
import and organize your files. These chapters show you how to import your
files from a variety of sources, such as your digital camera and your Photo
CDs. The info in this part also shows you how to create and use tags, cap-
tions, and notes for optimum identification and organization. Finally, I show
you how to work with different versions of your photos and how to create
new and backup copies of catalogs — the database backbone of your collec-
tion of files.
Part III: Finding, Viewing, and
Editing Photos
The chapters in this part deal with locating and looking. Album has numer-
ous ways to find your images and clips quickly and efficiently, so you don’t
waste time scrolling thorough endless numbers of thumbnails. Find out how
to change your viewing options — from various thumbnail sizes to creating
instant slide shows. Discover how to sort your images, by date, folder, media
type, and more, depending on what’s most meaningful and efficient for your
purpose at the time.
In this part I also give you details on repairing and enhancing your images. 
I offer some advice on setting up your editing environment, and I show you
how adjusting contrast, eliminating red eye, and fixing color casts are just a
mouse-click away. And I give you some tips in how to seamlessly integrate an
outside image editor, like Photoshop Elements, into your imaging repertoire
so that you can take care of digital fixes that Album can’t handle.

Part IV: Sharing and Printing Photos
Part IV describes all the ways you can spread the love with your photos,
clips, and creations. Album makes it quick and easy to e-mail attachments,
print, and even post images online. In fact, sharing images in a variety of
ways with Album is so fool-proof that you’ll end up recommending the pro-
gram to even the most computer-challenged of your family and friends.
Part V: Creating Larger Projects 
with Photos
After importing, organizing, and editing your inventory of files, you’ll want 
to check out these chapters. Here you can find how to make all of the great
creations Album is capable of — slideshows, photo books, calendars, eCards,
and much more. Before you know it, you’ll be a creations addict and will have
made enough personalized gifts to last until the year 2010.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
These three chapters are chock-full o’ tips. If you find that people are nod-
ding off when you show them your vacation slideshow, maybe a few tips in
composing better images will help remedy the situation. And, if you’re look-
ing to add to your repertoire of digital camera goodies, take a gander at
Chapter 20. Here you’ll find a brief description of some practical and fun
camera accessories. Finally, if you encounter the occasional snafu, look at
Chapter 21. You may find that the cure to your problem lies in these few
pages.
Conventions Used in This Book
If you’ve worked on a computer even a short time, you’ve probably discov-
ered that sometimes commands require using the mouse along with the key-
board. Working in Album sometimes involves that keyboard/mouse combo.
For example, “To select more than one item, press the Ctrl key and click on
additional items.”
When you see a command arrow (➪) in the text, it means that you should
select a command from the menu bar. For example, “Choose Edit➪Preferences”
means to click on the Edit menu and choose Preferences from the list of 
commands.

Introduction

Icons Used in This Book
The icons you see in this book aren’t here just because they’re cute. Their
purpose is to alert you that something noteworthy is coming your way.
You know it’s a law in most states that you can’t have a computer book with-
out a sprinkling of computer-geek tech talk. Even though Album is more 
user friendly than most computer programs, a few explanations required 
the presence of this nerdy icon.
Whenever you see a target, look for a tidbit that hits the spot, making your
time spent in Album a little easier.
This icon is a gentle reminder of things I’ve already mentioned and want to
make sure you haven’t already tossed out of your memory banks.
Don’t skip the information that appears next to the Warning icon. The infor-
mation here is stronger than a gentle reminder — ignore what I’m saying and
the consequences could be permanent, like lost files.

In this part. . .
I
f you just recently tore the shrink wrap on your Album
package, this is a good place to start. I guarantee that 
Part I will prevent you from staring blankly at the screen
or timidly poking about at unknown buttons. The chapters
in the ﬁrst part introduce you to Album and get you over
the new software jitters. I cover the basics in Chapters 1
and 2 — what Album does and how it works. You’ll ﬁnd
useful information about the user interface and about 
setting your preferences. And very importantly, you’ll ﬁnd
out where and how to ﬁnd other sources of help, should
you ﬁnd yourself either lost or pulling out your hair.
Chapter 3 is an important chapter that helps you work
with resolution, ﬁle formats, and color modes. By the time
you’re done with the chapters in Part I, you and Album
will have gone beyond the awkward introduction and
should be nicely acquainted.

Chapter 1
Introducing Album
In This Chapter
 The growth of digital photography
 What Album does and why you need it
O
wning and using Photoshop Album is like having the world’s best 
personal assistant — organized, efficient, always at your beck and call,
saves you time, money, and frustration and just makes your life easier. I admit
it. Before Album came into my life, I was a closet photo “shoeboxer.” Well,
actually, more like a “33-gallon storage toter.” Maybe you’re the same way.
Album and Organization
I bet that you love photos — taking them, looking at them, and sharing them.
I bet that you love knowing that you’ve captured and preserved the memory
of special events, milestones and moments of your life and those of your
family and friends.
And maybe you’re like me because the thing you don’t love is the time-
consuming task of organizing, labeling, and placing the photos into albums.
That task always seemed to stay permanently affixed to my to-do list.
When I switched to a digital camera, things improved some. I didn’t need any
more storage totes or garage space. But, digital images bring on a whole new
set of problems. Does this scenario sound familiar? Do you have a clutter of
inconsistently named folders and unintelligible alpha-numerically named files
scattered all over your hard drives or burned haphazardly onto CDs?
Enter Album — your photo organizing personal assistant phenom. Album
quickly (and with a miniscule learning curve), enables you to import, orga-
nize, find, manage, fix, and share your photo collections. 

Sure, there’s an initial time investment. And Album doesn’t turn lazy people
into efficient organizers (I still have to scan my analog prints). But because 
of its ease of use, you might find yourself (like me) full of renewed enthusi-
asm for the task of organizing your images. The proof, as they say, is in the
pudding, or in this case, in the albums. I have seen how efficient Album is at
transforming unorganized clutter into an ordered, streamlined system. I have
seen the best organizational system since the Dewey Decimal system at work.
I have seen the light!
And the bonus is that after you’ve gotten your images organized and manage-
able, you can relax and use those images in some creative and expressive
ways. And Album is there to help you with that as well, allowing you to make
wonderful creations. So Album not only makes your life easier, it makes it
more fun, too. It’s the best 50 bucks I ever spent.
What Album Does and Why You Need It
The bottom line is that when you save time you save money. And the program
that’s going to save you both time and money is downright dirt cheap. I mean,
for the cost of a cheap dinner and a couple of movie tickets, you probably
just purchased a program that can make you more organized, more produc-
tive, and even get some creative juices flowing. 
You may have thought when you first bought your camera that the software
that came bundled with the camera was all you needed. Now you may see
that the features of those programs are limited and really intended to just
facilitate the importing of images onto your computer. 
Album allows you to import, identify, organize, export, manage, edit, and
share your photos, as shown in Figure 1-1. About the only thing it can’t do is
make you a latte while you enjoy all the free time you gain from Album doing
all the work. Here’s a quick glance at Album’s multiple features:
 Import: After you take photos, you can move (or import) them into
Album. It only takes a few minutes, and your camera and memory card
are ready for the next outing or event. In addition to a digital camera or
card reader, you can import images directly from your scanner, hard
drive, or CDs. After they’re imported, your images are stored in what
Album calls a catalog. If you’re short on hard drive space, you can even
store your images offline, while retaining a proxy (low-resolution copy)
in your catalog. You also can import video and audio clips.

Chapter 1: Introducing Album
For the two readers who don’t already 
have a digital camera
Not too long ago if you had a digital camera, 
you were considered to be on the technological
cutting edge. Now it is just as common to see a
digital camera as it is a film camera. Some esti-
mates predict that, worldwide, consumers will
buy 10 million digital cameras in 2003. 
The digital trend has steadily escalated for
many reasons. Anytime a product offers conve-
nience, immediate satisfaction, and a time and
cost savings, it is bound to be embraced by the
masses. If you haven’t jumped on the digital
bandwagon yet, here are a few reasons why
you may want to make the switch:
 Immediacy: There’s nothing like being able
to correct your mistakes immediately after
you make them, instead of regretting it later.
Shooting digitally allows you to take a
photo, view it in the LCD (Liquid Crystal
Display), monitor attached to your digital
camera, and, if you like what you see, great.
On the other hand, if the exposure, lighting,
or composition is a little off, delete the photo,
make your adjustments and reshoot right
then and there. And, as an added bonus,
because you can make instant adjustments,
you can improve your photographic skills
more quickly.
You can try different angles and composi-
tions. If they don’t work, you just delete
them from the memory card. You also can
really test your camera’s features and get to
know how it ticks by taking shots using dif-
ferent settings. Hey, and no more streaked
or fogged film from airport x-ray machines!
 Convenience and time savings: Here are
four nice words for you: No more photo 
processing. No more driving to the photo
lab, filling out the order, waiting for the
development, and picking up the order. You
also find that the time you spend scanning
steadily declines. Going digital means simply
cabling up the camera or card reader to
your computer, making a couple of mouse
clicks and the photos are on your hard
drive, ready for action.
 Less expense: Just like time isn’t wasted
with photo processing, neither is money
wasted paying for processing. Just print
(and pay for) only the photos you really
want. Invest the savings from paying for film
and processing toward accessories for
your digital camera (see Chapter 20).
Some people argue that a high-quality digi-
tal camera is more expensive than a
comparable film camera. This may be a true
statement now, but is becoming less so.
Because the technology is still evolving,
quality cameras are becoming less expen-
sive and will continue to do so.
 Less clutter, and less retouching: Going dig-
ital means not having to store negatives,
slides, or prints. Storing all that output not
only consumes precious storage space, but
keeping track of it all is tedious. And
because there is no film or prints involved,
you’ll spend less time retouching dust, dirt,
or scratches.
 Flexibility: Digital images allow you to
share your images in different ways. Print
them, e-mail them as attachments, burn
them onto CDs, or post them online.

 Identify, view, and export: After your images are imported into your
catalog, you can view them in one location — any time, all the time, as
shown in Figure 1-2.
Album provides you with a tagging system that enables you to attach
keywords or phrases to your images to make sorting and locating them
a breeze. You can locate and view your images by tags, dates, folders,
and other criteria. It doesn’t matter where the images reside, whether on
your computer or on other external media. Album also keeps a history
of each image, details such as if you e-mailed or printed the photo. And
you can even export images in a variety of file formats for use in other
applications.
 Edit: If you didn’t quite get your images perfect during the shooting
process, Album lets you edit your images using cropping, red-eye
removal, and color and contrast tools, all of which require only a mouse
click or two. Album also provides seamless integration with many exter-
nal image editors, such as Photoshop Elements, for those images that
require extra-strength editing.

10
Part I: Getting Started with Photoshop Album 

 Create: Keep it simple and just e-mail or print your images. Or be a little
more innovative and make projects, called creations, such as albums,
slide shows, cards, calendars, photo books (shown in Figure 1-3), and
more in just five easy steps.
 Share: After your images have been cleaned up and enhanced, Album
makes sharing your files a snap. You can e-mail images and creations as
attachments, post them online via a photo sharing Web site like Shutterfly.
com, or view them as a Web gallery.
You can print the images, or burn them to CD or DVD. Album can save
your files as PDFs (Portable Document Format), which means that
anyone, anywhere with just a computer and free Acrobat reader can
view your images and creations.
 Preserve: Album makes it quick and easy to back up your catalog or
archive your images to CD or DVD. Store the media in a safety deposit
box or other offsite location to ensure your memories are safe from 
disaster — natural or man-made.

Performing Basic Tasks
In This Chapter
 Getting to know Album
 Getting started in the Quick Guide
 Checking out the interface
 Setting preferences
 Getting help
A
fter you’ve successfully installed Album, you’re ready to get started
using it. Often, even with the most user-friendly programs, launching it
for the first time can be a little overwhelming. You sit staring at the screen,
not quite knowing where to start first. To get over that awkward hump, this
chapter introduces the main elements of the interface to give you a feel for
how Album works. You discover how to set your preferences so the program
works the way you want it to. You also find out where to go for assistance,
both within Album and outside of it. After going through this chapter, you’ll
be ready to dive in and start wrangling your files into Album.
Using the Quick Guide
When you first launch Album, the Quick Guide window appears, as shown in
Figure 2-1. The Quick Guide is an easy place for you to get started if you’re
new to Album. Think of it as the “Getting Started Wizard.” Using the Quick
Guide, you can execute just about task. Here are your options:
 Get photos
 Organize
 Fix photos
 Find photos

 Make photo creations
 Share photos
You also can use the menus, palettes, and bars to execute all of these tasks,
as discussed later in this chapter.
The Quick Guide appears by default when you first launch Album. You also
can access it at anytime by any of these methods:
 Choose Help➪Quick Guide.
 Press Shift+F1.
 Click the Quick Guide button in the Shortcuts bar (it’s the icon that
looks like a book and a stopwatch). For more on the Shortcuts bar, stay
tuned.

Part I: Getting Started with Photoshop Album 

Here’s how to use the Quick Guide:
1. From the Quick Guide Overview window, click the icon or the tab for
the task you want to execute.
Most likely, if you’re new to Album, the first thing you’ll be doing is get-
ting, or importing, photos.
2. Depending on which icon or tab you selected, click the task you want
to execute.
For example, if you click the Get Photos icon, you’re presented with all
the ways to import photos, as shown in Figure 2-2. For intricate details
on how to import files, see Chapter 4.
If you need more information about a particular task, click the Help button in
the bottom, right corner of the Quick Guide window. For more on using Help,
see the section, “Using Help,” later in this chapter.

Chapter 2: Performing Basic Tasks

After you become comfortable using Album, you may not want the Quick
Guide to appear when you launch Album. If so, uncheck the Show This
Window at Startup button in the bottom, left corner of the Quick Guide
window.
What You Can Do in Album
Album enables you to do a variety of tasks, as discussed in the next few sec-
tions. In order to perform most of the tasks, however, you first have to get
your photos into Album. Once you’ve imported your files, you can then orga-
nize them, edit them and share them with others in a variety of fun and cre-
ative ways.
Getting photos
Album lets you import photos, video clips, and audio clips from your
hard drive, camera, card reader, scanner, CDs or DVDs, and external media
such as Zip disks. When you import items into Album, it creates links to your
files so it knows where the photo is located, what the file format is, and other
information.
Here’s how this linking works. Album keeps track of your files in a database
of information called the catalog. Album automatically creates a catalog
(appropriately named My Catalog.psa) when you first launch the program
and brings in your photos and clips. The catalog keeps track of your files,
whether they are on your computer’s hard drive or reside on other media
such as CDs or DVDs.
The catalog collects information (called metadata) about each photo, but it
doesn’t contain the actual photos themselves. Album retains the metadata
and a proxy, which is a low-resolution copy of the image, a kind of file body
double. For full details on importing photos, see Chapter 4.
Organizing, managing, and finding photos
When you import photos and clips into Album, they are, by default, orga-
nized in the Photo Well, the main display area for your files, by the date and
time of the photo. The date and time could be when the photo was taken by
your digital camera or when the image was scanned. You also can arrange your
photos by folder location, import batch, color similarity, media type, or tags.
16
Part I: Getting Started with Photoshop Album 

Tags are keywords that you attach to your images to further identify and
locate them. They could be based on people’s names, certain events, or spe-
cific locations, as shown in Figure 2-3. Tags give you much more control when
it comes to identifying, organizing, and locating your photos. You can further
identify your images with written captions, audio captions, and notes.
Album allows you to use a variety of tools and criteria to find your images.
For example, you can use the timeline (described later in this chapter) to
specify a date range. Or you can search for specific images based on a
common history, such as which photos have been printed. For lots of info
on organizing, managing, and finding images, see Chapters 5, 6, 7, and 8.
Viewing photos
All of your files — photos, video clips, audio clips, and creations — appear
in the Photo Well arranged in a grid of thumbnails, small display versions of
your images. You can select from various size thumbnails, or you can choose
to see your selected file in a single photo view.
Figure 2-3:
Attaching
tags to your
images is a
great way to

and locate
them.
17
Chapter 2: Performing Basic Tasks

The buttons in the Options bar help you organize and sort your files in the
Photo Well. And you’re not restricted to viewing your images as static photos
in the Photo Well. You also can select images and view them in an instant
slide show, which provides a more enriching viewing experience. For details
on viewing photos, see Chapter 9.
Editing photos
Album provides you with a slew of easy-to-use editing tools to clean up and
enhance your images. You can rotate, crop, get rid of red eye, and adjust
color, contrast and lighting — all from the Fix Photo dialog box, shown in
Figure 2-4.
Album divides these editing tools into two categories — Single Click fixes and
manual adjustments.
Album saves your edited file as a copy, thereby preserving the original. That
way, you can revert to the original later if you desire.
For hard-core editing that goes beyond Album’s capability, the program 
provides seamless integration with many external image editors, such as
Photoshop Elements and Photoshop. For more on editing images, see
Chapters 10, 11, and 12.
Sharing and printing photos
If you like taking photos, you probably like sharing them, too. You’re in luck.
Album makes it easy to share your photos in a variety of ways:
 E-mail: You can e-mail your photos as image attachments. Or you can
e-mail your photos after you’ve incorporated them into creations, such
as albums, slide shows or eCards.
 Online: Album allows you to share your images online in a couple ways.
You can create galleries that you can then upload onto the Web. Or you
can post your photos on a photo sharing Web site such as
Shutterfly.com.
 Print: If you or your recipients want hard copies, you also can print your
photos at home. Album gives you choices between printing individual
images, contact sheets, and picture packages. Of course you also can
18
Part I: Getting Started with Photoshop Album 

print several types of creations, such as greeting cards and calendars.
Or if you want a professional print job, you can order photo lab-quality
prints and hard-bound photo books from online service providers using
the Online Wizard in Album.
If you need to export your images to a certain file format, Album can handle
that as well. Check out Chapters 13, 14, and 15 for details on e-mailing, print-
ing, and using online services.
Creating with photos
Another great feature of Album is its Creations feature. In a mere five steps,
Album’s Creation Wizard lets you create a variety of great creations: albums,
slide shows, greeting cards (see Figure 2-5), eCards, calendars, photo books,
Video CDs, a Web gallery, and an Adobe Atmosphere 3D gallery. You’ll also
discover that you can use your photos and your digital camera in a variety of
ways, besides just in Album’s creations. See Chapters 16, 17, and 18 for all
you need to know about making creations and more.

Chapter 2: Performing Basic Tasks

Checking Out the Album Interface
The Album work area is chock full of bars, panes and areas to work in. I make
a lot of references to these features in the book, so it would good to get an idea
of where they reside and what they do. Here is a brief synopsis of each com-
ponent of Album’s work area. To get the details on each, see the referenced
chapter.
Working with the Photo Well
All of your files — photos, video clips, audio clips, and creations — are
imported and displayed in the Photo Well, organized in a grid of thumbnails,
shown in Figure 2-6. The size of the thumbnails depends on your selected
viewing option, which you can change at any time. You also can view your
images as single photos. How your photos are organized depends on how
you’ve sorted your files. By default, files are sorted by date, newest files being
first. But you also can sort by folder location, import batch, color similarity
Figure 2-5:
Album’s
creations

and fun, and
only take
five steps 
to make.
20
Part I: Getting Started with Photoshop Album 

or media type. The easiest way to change the viewing options, both in size
and sorting criteria, is to click the icons in the Options bar, located below the
Photo Well. Video clips are displayed by the first frame of the clip. Audio clips
are displayed with a generic audio icon. Depending on the size of your thumb-
nails, date, time and tags will also appear on or around your thumbnails. When
you search for images, the Photo Well displays all search results. For more on
working with Photo Well, see Chapters 4 and 5.
Using the Workspace
The Workspace is a separate window, shown in Figure 2-7, which you use pri-
marily when you select items to use in a creation (a special project such as a
slide show or greeting card). To access the Workspace, you select your desired
items in the Photo Well and then click the Create button on the Shortcuts bar
(described later in this chapter). The items are copied to the Workspace
window, where you can rearrange their order, if necessary. If no items are
selected, an empty Workspace appears. You can then drag and drop items
from the Photo Well into the Workspace. In the Workspace, you can edit and
remove items, as well.

21
Chapter 2: Performing Basic Tasks

You also can use the Workspace to attach tags, play a slide show, export,
archive, e-mail, print, or create a Web photo or Adobe Atmosphere 3D
Gallery. To access the Workspace for these tasks, choose View➪Workspace
and drag your desired files into the window. For more on the using the
Workspace, see Chapter 16.
Using the Menu bar
The Menu bar, shown in Figure 2-8, contains commands for executing most
tasks. The menus are organized according to the kind of task you perform.
For example, the View menu contains commands for viewing slide shows, for
choosing the size and arrangement or your Photo Well thumbnails and for
accessing panes and other Album components. The Create menu contains
commands for making all sorts of projects with your images.
Saving time with the Shortcuts bar
The Shortcuts bar, located just below the Menu bar, displays buttons for
commonly used commands (refer to Figure 2-8). Those buttons with black
down-pointing triangles next to their names have drop-down sub-menus that
contain additional commands. With just a couple clicks with the mouse, you

other 
tasks, like

can execute commands such as printing, creating slide shows or sharing your
photos with others. Because the Shortcuts bar is so multifaceted, details on
using it are sprinkled throughout the book.
Instead of using the Menu bar, save yourself a few seconds and click
these buttons. If you’re not sure what a button does, hover your mouse over
the button. The handy tool tip appears, describing what the button does.
Working with the Options bar
The Options bar is located below the Photo Well. The buttons in the Options
bar allow you to change your viewing and sorting options of your files in the
Photo Well. It also has buttons to that enable you to quickly show and hide
the Properties pane and Workspace. And finally, you can rotate your images
clockwise and counter-clockwise with one click of the rotate buttons, located
on the far-right side of the Options bar. For more on the Options bar, see
Chapter 9.

Using the Find bar
The Find bar comes into play when you are searching for images based on
various criteria. If you drag one or more tags onto the bar, for example, Album
gathers up all images containing those tags and displays them in the Photo
Well. To start a new search, just click the Clear button.
When you’re not searching, the Find bar takes a break and is represented by
the small, horizontal blue bar above the Photo Well (refer to Figure 2-8). When
you’re searching for files, the Find bar expands, and the Search Criteria field
opens within the Find bar so you can see the tags you’ve chosen for the
search, shown in Figure 2-9. For details on the Find bar, see Chapter 8.
Getting to know the timeline
The timeline, located just below the Menu bar, allows you find photos by the
date, folder location, or import batch, depending on the option you chose in
the Options bar.
The timeline shows how items are distributed, and bars in the timeline repre-
sent the images. The height of each bar is proportional to the number of
images.
Figure 2-9:
The Find bar
allows you
to perform
quick
searches of
specifically
tagged
images.
24
Part I: Getting Started with Photoshop Album 

Using the timeline to find images by date is probably the most common usage
for this tool. You designate a range of time or select a specific date in the time-
line, and all files that were created or saved with applicable date(s) display in
the Photo Well.
The timeline is divided into years and months. Hover your mouse pointer
over a bar in the timeline, and the name of the month appears. For more
information on using the timeline, see Chapter 8.
Viewing info in the Properties pane
The Properties pane, shown in Figure 2-10, contains oodles of information
about your files. To display the Properties pane, choose View➪Properties or
click the Show or Hide Properties button in the Options bar. Select a file to
view the following information:
 The filename
 Any captions or notes you’ve added to the image
 The date you imported or modified the file
 Any creations it’s been used in
 Any tags
 Metadata (like digital camera details)
 The file’s location on your computer
You also can record or listen to audio annotations attached to photos by
clicking on the Audio icon in the Properties pane.
The Properties pane allows you rename a file, add a caption or notes, and
adjust the date and time of the photo file. For details on using the Properties
pane, see Chapter 6.
Working with the Tags pane
Tags offer you an excellent way to identify, organize, and quickly find your
photos. You can create, edit, attach, and remove tags by using the Tags pane.
To display the Tags pane (see Figure 2-11), choose View➪Tags or click the
Organize button in the Shortcuts bar. For everything you need to know about
tags, see Chapter 5.

Because your list of tags can get extensive, you can expand or collapse the list
of tags by clicking the gray triangles in the pane. To quickly find and view
specifically tagged images, simply click in the square in the first column. The
Find icon (which looks like a pair of binoculars) appears in the square, and
your tagged images appear in the Photo Well. You can’t get any more efficient
than that.
Setting Your Preferences
Most computer applications enable you to set preferences to establish the
way your application works in various circumstances. Album’s no different.
When you first install Album, it comes equipped with default preferences.
The defaults remain intact until you change them. Choose Edit➪Preferences
to bring up the huge Preferences dialog box. Album has a few different areas
where you can set your preferences.
Setting general preferences
These preferences, shown in Figure 2-12, allow you customize Album to suit
your needs. Here are the specifics on each:

 Display Options: Here are your options:
• Show Closely Matching Sets for Searches: Select this option to
have Album find not only exact matches, but any photos that are

the EXIF data. You can choose to import EXIF captions or use the modifi-
cation date of a file if lacks EXIF data.
 Offline Media: You can choose a proxy file size for files that will be
stored on offline media, such as CDs and DVDs. For more on storing
images offline, see Chapter 7.
Setting other preferences
Here is a brief description of the other preferences. Check out specific chap-
ters for more details:
 E-mail: Before you e-mail photos for the first time, you should set your
e-mail preferences. You also can set these preferences when you send
your first e-mail. For full details on setting e-mail preferences, see
Chapter 13.
 Editing: These settings have to do with which external image editor
you want to automatically launch when you choose Edit➪Edit with . . .
Command in Album. For more on using external editors, see Chapter 12.
 Camera or card reader: The default settings for cameras and card read-
ers will be fine for most users. But you also can adjust them to fit your
particular camera or card reader. Choose the name of your camera, or
the drive letter that indicates your camera, from the Camera pop-up
menu. You also can choose to delete the photos from your camera
after you’ve imported them.

Getting a Helping Hand
Album, being the benevolent, user-friendly program that it is, provides you
with a host of ways to get help while you’re working. You can access the
built-in Help menu, use context-sensitive menus and tool tips, and perform
tasks using the Quick Guide. You also can find some Portable Document
Format (PDF) files on the Album Install CD, which include late-breaking news,
undocumented features, and other useful information. You can read these
PDFs using the free Adobe Acrobat Reader, which is included on the CD and
also downloadable from www.adobe.com.
Using Help
Album includes a user guide via a built-in, HTML-based Help system. This
system contains information and illustrations on using Album commands,
features, and tools. When you launch Help, the Help page is displayed in your
Web browser.
29

Your best friends: The Undo/Redo commands
One of the best friends you can have in the
world of software programs is Ctrl+Z. That just
happens to be the keyboard shortcut for the
Undo command. This command does what you
think it does. Make a mistake, and choose Edit
Undo, or press Ctrl+Z, and your operation is
undone. If you didn’t mean to choose Undo, you
also can then choose Edit Redo, or press Ctrl+Y,
which reapplies the last operation.
You also can use Undo and Redo from the Fix
Photo dialog box. So if you don’t like the color or
contrast adjustment you applied, or you cropped
someone’s head off, choose Undo.

There are three ways to launch Help:
 Choose Help➪Adobe Photoshop Album Help.
 Click the Help button in the lower-right corner of the Quick Guide
window.
 Press the F1 key.
There are several ways you can use the Help system. Here they are:
 Index: The index contains keywords followed by links to the online loca-
tions where the topics are discussed. Click Index at the top of the
Navigation frame. Then click a letter in the alphabet that corresponds
with the Help topic you’re looking for information about. For example, if
you want to find out about cropping, click C.
Select the entry you’re interested in and click one of the numbered links
after the entry to see more information.
If you’re using Internet Explorer 5 or Netscape 6, you can display the
title of a link’s target by just hovering your mouse over a numbered link.
 Site Map: The Site Map contains links to all topics in Help and all entries
in the Index. Click Site Map at the top of the Navigation frame. Scroll
through the Site Map until you spot your desired topic or index entry.
Click the title or the numbered link at the after the index entry.
 Contents: The Contents contains links to chapter titles in Help. Click
Contents at the top of the Navigation frame. Then click a title. The topic
appears in the Topic frame, equipped with links to all related subtopics.
Click a subtopic link.
 Search: Click Search to look for topics containing a keyword.
Here are a few tips to help navigate around the Topic frame:
 Click Previous to display the previous topic.
 Click Next to display the next topic.
 Click Top to go to the top of a topic.
 Click the cross-references to other topics to go to that referenced topic.
 Click the parent topic links at the top and bottom of the topic to move
back in the structure of Help topics.
 Click the related subtopics, if there are any at the end of the topic.

Checking out the Adobe Web site
I am assuming you have an Internet connection. But if you don’t, you really
should consider getting one. It will allow you to share your photos via e-mail
or on the Web. It will also allow you to access resources for working in Album.
Visit Adobe’s Web site, shown in Figure 2-14, by using one of the following
methods:
 Click the Go to Adobe.com button in the top-right corner of the Album
window. Click the Go to the Adobe Web site (www.adobe.com) button
near the top-right corner of the application window.
 Choose Help➪Adobe Online.
 Go to www.adobe.com in your Web browser.
At the site, you’ll find the goodies, such as
 Album software updates (called patches)
 Tutorials
 User-to-user forum
 Support Knowledgebase database of commonly reported problems and

Using Context-Sensitive 
Menus and Tool Tips
Album makes use of context-sensitive menus that can save you time by 
allowing you to quickly execute commands with a single mouse click. These
context-sensitive menus display different commands and options and dynami-
cally change according to what you’ve already selected or where you are
within Album. To display a context-sensitive menu, position your mouse
pointer over an image or item in a pane (mini-window) in Album. Right-
click your mouse. If a context-sensitive menu doesn’t appear, no menu
is available for that tool, pane, or item.
You may have noticed while taking a breather and resting your mouse that
if you position your mouse pointer and pause over almost any item on the
screen — a tool, a button, or an icon — that a name, keyboard shortcut or
explanation appears. That name or explanation is known as a tool tip and is
a handy feature, especially when you’re first learning the ropes of Photoshop
Album.
You can access the helpful Quick Guide window if you need some visual guid-
ance in executing a task in Album. See the earlier section, “Using the Quick
Guide.”

Working with Resolution, Color
Modes, and File Formats
In This Chapter
 Understanding resolution
 Getting familiar with color modes
 Working with different file formats
D
igital images come in two flavors: pixel based and vector based. Pixel-
based images, also called raster or bitmap images, usually are photo-
graphic in nature, although they also can be comprised of artwork, objects,
or even miscellaneous parts of the body that have been scanned on a scanner. 
Vector-based images, also called object-oriented images, are mathematically
defined by lines, curves, and points. The vector format is perfect for illustra-
tions such as logos and line art. Adobe Illustrator, CorelDRAW, and Macromedia
Freehand are examples of popular vector drawing programs. Because you will
be dealing primarily with raster images in Photoshop Album, this chapter
focuses on the characteristics of that type of digital image.
Before delving into the heart and soul of Photoshop Album, I think it’s useful
to cover some of the more general and technical aspects of the digital imag-
ing world. Don’t worry. I’ll try not to get too eggheady. It’s just that to prop-
erly size images (both in dimension and file size), display or print images at
their optimum quality, and choose the appropriate image format for their
intended usage, you should have a basic understanding of resolution, color,
and format. Although the information may not make for the most exciting
leisure reading, it will be beneficial in the long run. Think of the information
in this chapter as a dose of preventive medicine.

Getting a Handle on Resolution
Resolution can take on many meanings depending on what you’re referring to.
For example, when people discuss resolution, they may be referring to image
resolution, which describes the number of pixels per linear inch (a line 1 inch
long). Or they may be discussing the resolution of certain devices such as
printers, cameras, scanners, and monitors. All are entwined and interrelated,
and comprehending the differences can be somewhat confusing.
Introducing pixels
Raster images, such as digitized photographs, are made up of a grid of
squares called pixels (short for PICture Element). Each pixel lives in a specific
location on that grid and contains a single color. When you edit a raster
image, you’re editing one or more of those pixels.
Think of a grid of pixels as a mosaic. When viewed from afar, the mosaic looks
like a painting. But up close, you see the individual square tiles that comprise
the image. 
Although it doesn’t seem like it when you’re viewing an image that fits nicely
inside your monitor window, your entire image can be broken down into a
grid of square pixels — which becomes very evident when you try to zoom
waaay in on the image. Suddenly, that photo leaves the realm of reality and
looks like stacks of colored building blocks. Even round, curvy shapes have
to fit within this grid of squares. 
Raster images try to fake a curve by mimicking the overall shape with square
pixels, as shown in Figure 3-1. Amazingly, this con job is virtually impercepti-
ble at high resolutions viewed at full size (100 percent). But when you zoom
in at high magnifications, those square pixels are plain as day. 
Figure 3-1:

36
Part I: Getting Started with Photoshop Album 

Understanding the pixel-resolution
connection
Image resolution refers to the number of pixels along the total width and
height of the image, known also as pixel dimensions. For example, if the pixel
dimensions of a photo are 640 x 480, the image contains 640 pixels in its
width and 480 pixels in its height. 
The pixel dimensions, in turn, correspond to the image’s file size. The larger
the pixel dimensions, the more data (and therefore the larger the file size).
Every image has a set number of pixels. How does it get these pixels in the
first place? You establish the number by the capture setting on your digital
camera or the resolution setting on your scanner (see the sections “Working
with Camera Resolution” and Working with scanner resolution” later in this
chapter).
To see the pixel dimensions and file size of an image in Photoshop Album,
choose View➪Size➪Single Photo. The file size and pixel dimensions appear
below the photo and also in the Properties pane, as shown in Figure 3-2. If
your Properties pane isn’t visible, choose View➪Properties.

Chapter 3: Working with Resolution, Color Modes, and File Formats
Resolution in a nutshell
If you’re to the point where you’re going to tear
this book into smithereens if you read the word
resolution one more time, the information here
may help to lower your blood pressure a bit.
Keep it simple by following these few points:
 If you want to make images available on
the Web for the general public, keep your
camera’s setting at 640 x 480. Use 800 x 600
if your audience is middle of the road in
sophistication. Reserve 1024 x 768 only for
the snobby techno-lusters. Remember, the
smaller the size of your graphics, the
quicker they download on-screen, espe-
cially for those who are using older com-
puters and/or dialup Internet connections. 
 If your images are destined for print, be
sure and capture enough pixels with your
camera or scanner so that your output res-
olution is around 300 ppi. Check with your
printer documentation for any specific rec-
ommendations. Not sure? Go with the high-
est. At least you won’t be stuck with poor
image quality as a result of not having
enough pixels. Just be sure and have lots of
memory available on your computer’s hard
drive and in your camera’s flash card or
memory stick. 
 Don’t have a clue what you want to do with
your photos? Again, err on the side of high
resolution. Use Album to resize your images
smaller if your creations and Web galleries
require smaller images. In the long run, it’s
a lot less damaging to have too many pixels
than not enough.

Size takes on two roles in digital imaging:
 File size: A result of the pixel dimensions just mentioned
 Print or image size: The width and height of an image when printed on
paper (described in the section “Working with output and printer resolu-
tion,” later in this chapter)
The file sizes of raster images can be very large, in comparison to slim and
petite file sizes of vector images. You may have discovered this fact on your
own while working with your digital camera or scanner. It seems that in no
time flat, that CompactFlash card, memory stick, or hard drive space is eaten
up. Another disadvantage of raster images is that because they contain a fixed
number of pixels, when they’re enlarged the quality can go downhill fast.
Changing the resolution by 
enlarging the pixels
Album allows you to resize your images in certain instances. You should be
careful in choosing a new size that is a significant increase from the original.
What happens is that the original number of pixels is spread across a larger
area resulting in pixelated mush, as shown in Figure 3-3. Here are a few sce-
narios in which you want to avoid increasing the size of images with small
pixel dimensions:
 Web Photo Gallery: I took a small photo of a dog, which had dimensions
of 66 x 100 pixels. When I created my Web Photo Gallery, I chose X-Large
in the Resize Photos option and set the quality to Medium. The result
Figure 3-2:

the file 
size and
resolution of

the Single

38
Part I: Getting Started with Photoshop Album 

from enlarging a photo with such a small number of pixels to full-screen
view was an indefinable, grainy animal (refer to Figure 3-3). I then took a
new photo of the dog with pixel dimensions of 2048 x 3072 and used the
same settings. The result was a happy dog — sharp and recognizable.
 Slide Show: Similarly, if you take a photo with small pixel dimensions
and use it in Slide Show creation, Album responds with a warning that
your image is low resolution and will not display well at
this size.
 Greeting Card: When you take low-resolution images and try and use
them in creations such as greeting cards, which are intended to be
printed and require images with higher resolution, Album warns you
that the images you chose are below optimum resolution for
printing.
All the preceding scenarios involve taking the set number of pixels in an
image and spreading them across a larger area, whether on-screen or on
paper. The result is larger-sized pixels and therefore a chunkier, pixelated-
looking image. Enlarging pixels isn’t recommended. The best thing to do is to
start with images that contain enough pixels for their intended end-usage size.
Working with output and printer resolution
When you print an image from Photoshop or Photoshop Elements, you can
enter the desired output resolution. The output resolution is measured in
pixels per linear inch (a line that is 1 inch long), or ppi, and can be calculated
by dividing the number of pixels wide or high by the printed size in width or
height. For example, if an image is 800 pixels wide and you print it so that it’s
4 inches wide, the output resolution is 200 ppi. The higher the ppi, the higher
the quality, as shown in Figure 3-4.

39
Chapter 3: Working with Resolution, Color Modes, and File Formats

After an image is printed onto paper, the resolution is measured in dots per
inch, or dpi. Generally, the greater the number of dots, the better the print
quality. Although Photoshop Album doesn’t allow you to manually manipu-
late the output resolution, it warns you if you’ve chosen a print size that will
cause the photo to print poorly — at a dpi setting of less than 150 dpi.

Part I: Getting Started with Photoshop Album 
Changing the resolution by resampling
In programs such as Photoshop and Photoshop
Elements, you can manually change the image
size (height and width) and resolution. But
rather than increasing the size of the individual
pixels to fill the space, Photoshop, Photoshop
Elements, and other image-editing programs
perform a kind of voodoo called resampling.
(Photoshop Album doesn’t allow you to resam-
ple images.)
Resampling enables you to add or delete pixels
to increase the pixel dimensions of an image.
Many graphics programs perform a process
called interpolation. Interpolation is as fancy
and technical as it sounds. The process involves
performing an algorithm that manufactures
pixels by averaging the color of original pixels
and adding them to the existing ones. 
When you downsample (resample down), you
eliminate pixels and therefore delete information
and detail from your image. Downsampling is
done pretty frequently because high-resolution
images must be downsampled for posting on
the Web. And in actuality, you may not notice
much degradation in the image quality because
the images are just being viewed on-screen —
unless, of course, you take it to the extreme. 
Upsampling, on the other hand, is almost always
a visual disaster. When you upsample (resam-
ple up), you add pixels. The result is that your
image tends to lose sharpness and get blurry,
soft, and mushy. The more you upsample, the
worse the image looks.

Here are a few tips for working with printer resolution:
 Read the documentation that shipped with your printer. The documen-
tation will give you the various resolution settings it can print at, as well
as tips on the recommended image resolution of your photos.
 Be sure that your image has an adequate resolution. Raster images
are resolution dependent. Because raster images contain a fixed number
of pixels, generally, your printer’s resolution doesn’t much influence the
quality of these images. For example, an image of only 72 ppi doesn’t look
any better printed at a printer resolution of 600 dpi than it does at 1200
dpi. So be sure that your image has an adequate image resolution to
start with.
 Don’t use a higher resolution than you need. All you’ll do is create an
unnecessarily huge file with a slower print time. In addition, the printer
may be incapable of reproducing all the detail in the image. In some
cases, higher-than-necessary printer resolution settings may make your
printout look muddier.
 Remember that one printed dot doesn’t correlate to one image pixel.
Most printers today use several dots per image pixel. Therefore, your
printer manufacturer may recommend that you use a 300 ppi image to
print at a printer resolution of 1440 or 2880 dpi.
You can easily calculate the maximum size to print an image at your desired
print resolution based on the image’s pixel dimensions. Simply divide the pixel
dimension by the printer resolution to get the print size. For example, an image
with the pixel dimensions of 640 x 480 yields a print of 2.1 x 1.6 inches at 300
dpi. Or an 8 x 10 print with a printer resolution of 300 dpi requires an image
with a resolution of 2400 x 3000 pixels.
The term image size doesn’t refer to pixel dimensions per se. Image
size refers more to the physical dimensions and dpi of an image when it’s
printed. For example, a conversation at the local coffee house may go like
this, “So what’s the image size on that photo?” and the response would be
“Well, it’s 5 x 7 inches at 300 dpi.”
Working with Camera Resolution
Many digital cameras allow you to select various resolution settings. Those
settings may be in pixel dimensions, such as 1024 x 768, or in graphic display
standards, such as VGA (Video Graphics Array, usually 640 x 480) and XGA
(Extended Graphics Array, usually 1024 x 768). The settings may even take on
generic terms like Fine, Hi and Basic. To understand the resolution settings
your camera offers, check the manufacturer’s documentation. 
41
Chapter 3: Working with Resolution, Color Modes, and File Formats

Depending on your type of camera, the manufacturer may refer to resolution
settings as Image Size.
Some manufacturers also tie in image quality with resolution and file format.
For example, if you choose a Hi setting, your image will be stored as a TIFF,
not a JPEG. (For more on file formats, see “Working with Different File Formats,”
later in this chapter.) And that Hi setting is only available if you choose Full res-
olution (which is equal to 2560 x 1920 pixels).
After you’re familiar with your camera’s settings, consider what setting is
optimum for your intended output:
 For high-quality printed images, shoot your photos at a higher resolution. 
If you take the resolution setting in pixels and divide it by the recom-
mended resolution of the printer (described in the preceding section),
you get the size of your image when printed. 
 If the image is intended for the Web, be sure and take into account the
demographics of your audience. Are they imaging professionals with 
21-inch monitors or are they your friends and family with a 15- to 17-inch
monitor?

Part I: Getting Started with Photoshop Album 

The size of the images when printed depends on the printer’s resolution set-
ting. The higher the printer resolution, the smaller the final print size. Similarly,
if you reduce the print size of an image, the resolution of the image increases.
Working with scanner resolution
Just as your camera has resolution settings, so does your scanner. Scanning
resolution corresponds with output resolution. Here are some suggestions for
working with scanner resolution:
 Skim the manual that came with your scanner for resolution settings
and any tips on getting the best scan for your particular scanner.
Typically, for scanners, the maximum optical resolutions start at 600 ppi
and go up to 2400 ppi.
 Never scan beyond the scanner’s maximum optical, also called true,
resolution. Anything higher involves the nasty process of interpolation.
Standard scanning software allows you to scan anywhere from 72 ppi
on up.
 Consider the end usage for your images before you scan and use resolu-
tion that is appropriate. If you’re planning to print your images at 100 per-
cent of their original size, a good rule to follow is to scan them at 300 ppi.
Some Web designers swear that you’ll get a better image if you scan your
Web images at 144 ppi (2 x 72 ppi, the standard screen resolution) and then
downsample them in an image-editing program like Photoshop or Photoshop
Elements. If you don’t own an image editor, go ahead and scan your Web
images at 72 ppi.
43
Chapter 3: Working with Resolution, Color Modes, and File Formats
Understanding megapixels
You often hear cameras described or rated in
terms of the number of megapixels they can
capture. A megapixel is a unit of measurement
equivalent to 1 million pixels and is used to
quantify the resolution of digital cameras. The
number of megapixels is calculated by multiply-
ing the height and width of the image in pixels.
For example, 2590 x 1920 pixels is 4,915,200
pixels, or the number of pixels my 5-megapixel
Nikon is capable of capturing in full-resolution
mode. More pixels means higher resolution,
greater detail, and better quality. It also means
big files. You will also find a “megapixel-dollar”
relationship — the greater the number of
megapixels, the more expensive the camera.
For details about print sizes in relationship to the
megapixels of a digital camera, check out
Chapter 14.
Run your own test prints to see what your
camera, and either your home printer or service
provider, is capable of.

Photoshop Album, in conjunction with your scanner’s plug-in, allows you to
get photos directly from your scanner. For more specifics on acquiring
images from scanners, see Chapter 4.
Working with monitor resolution
Monitor resolution is measured in the number of pixels that are displayed on
the screen. Monitors have various preset pixel settings that you can choose
from, depending on the size of your monitor and the amount of video RAM you
have. Common monitor resolutions are 640 x 480, 800 x 600, 1024 x 768, 1280 x
820, and 1600 x 1024 pixels. Monitor resolution settings are also referred in
graphic display standards such as VGA, UXGA, and so on (refer to Table 3-1).
When viewing screen images, output resolution settings really don’t a play a
role. Because the display of images on-screen is based on a one-to-one ratio
(one image pixel per screen pixel), what matters is that you want your image
to fit inside your monitor when viewed at 100 percent. 
Unlike printer resolution, monitor resolution is a one-to-one (1:1) ratio.
This is where pixel dimensions come into play. When you view an image on-
screen, the display size is determined by the pixel dimension, plus the size
and setting of the monitor. For example:
 A 17-inch monitor usually displays 1024 by 768 pixels. When you view an
800 x 600 pixel image, the image fills only part of your screen.
However, change your monitor setting to 800 x 600, and the same image
fills the screen (of course, each pixel appears larger). 
 An 800 x 600 pixel image fills the screen of a 15-inch monitor. 
But if you were to view a 1024 x 788 image, it wouldn’t fit inside the
screen; you would have to scroll to see the image. 
Bottom line: Establish the level of your audience and use the appropriate
pixel dimensions. I recommend using a pixel dimension of 800 x 600 as your
default image size. That way the majority of the people will be able to view
your image adequately.
For images to be viewed on-screen, you may see recommended output reso-
lution settings of 72 to 96 ppi. That’s because monitors display at 72 to 96
dpi, which is an easy number to remember. But keep in mind that when you
change the dimensions of your image, it will always be at a one-to-one ratio
with the monitor.
44
Part I: Getting Started with Photoshop Album 

If you view an image whose resolution is higher than the monitor, the image
appears larger on-screen than in its printed state. For example, try opening a
300 ppi JPEG file into a browser window. It spills way past the screen bound-
aries. That’s because the monitor can only display 72 to 96 ppi at a time, and
it would need a lot higher resolution to show all the pixels in the image.
Understanding Color
Peruse the computer graphics section of your local bookstore, and you’re
bound to see several books on the topic of color — I’m talking, big, thick,
expensive books on color. The array of books may lead you to the logical 
conclusion that color must be a big deal in the world of digital imaging. It is. 
Why? Well, sometimes you might hear a friend, colleague (or yourself) say,
“Geez, the oranges in my photo of the sunset are so vibrant.” Of course, the
comment may be worded a little more like, “#$%&*, what in heck happened
to the print of my sunset? The orange is much more vibrant on-screen!” 
If you find yourself getting serious about digital photography and digital imag-
ing, I recommend plunking down some cash for a good book that tackles the
sole topic of color in depth. Because this book is primarily about Photoshop
Album, I’m just going to provide you with the short version of color theory. 
Album allows you to import images that possess RGB, CMYK, Grayscale,
Indexed Color, or Bitmap color modes (you may also hear image mode or just
mode).
You’ll come across other color modes, such as Duotone, Lab, and
Multichannel, if you do any editing in programs such as Photoshop and
Photoshop Elements. But if you stick with just Album, I’ve covered all the
modes you need to be familiar with.
Color modes define the color values used to display an image and affect the
number of colors shown, the size of the files, and other characteristics. For
the lowdown on each type of color, read on.
RGB color
Light, like you get from the sun or from a flashlight, can be broken down into
three colors — red, green, and blue. These colors are referred to as the pri-
mary colors of light. They are also the colors that correspond to the three
types of receptors, or cones, inside your eyes. Each cone, red, green, or blue,
45
Chapter 3: Working with Resolution, Color Modes, and File Formats

in your eyes senses the amount of red, green, and blue light, respectively.
When that information reaches your brain, it is translated into millions of dif-
ferent colors. I mean millions literally. And I don’t just mean a couple million,
either. When you mix just these three colors, you can produce up to 16.7 mil-
lion colors. 
If you have ever visited a children’s museum or science center, they always
have a display where the kids can shine three spotlights, red, green, and blue
into the same spot. They are amazed to find that the resulting color is white.
Turn off all the lights, and the color is black. Move the light up or down and
create blue, green, orange, and every color in between. By moving the light,
the intensity of the light is being varied. In the digital world, we call the inten-
sity of the light brightness value. Each color — red, green, and blue — contains
256 (from 0 to 255) levels of brightness. These brightness values are con-
tained in what we call channels.
Think of channels as holding tanks of color information. Getting down to the
nitty-gritty, each individual pixel in the channel in your image is assigned its
own brightness value ranging from 0 (black) to 255 (white). When you view
them separately, as shown in Figure 3-5, each channel appears as a grayscale
(black and white) image. But when you view the pixels from each channel
together, the pixels mix to form colors, which, in turn, provide you with a
composite, or full-color image. 
A value of 255 from all three channels produces white while a value of 0
from all three channels produces black. Different values produce all the other
colors. Because RGB colors combined at 255 create white, they are known as
additive colors. If your digital image is comprised of these three colors, it is
called, not surprisingly, an RGB image.
Digital cameras, scanners, computer monitors, and even television screens
all display colors in RGB. Many desktop inkjet printers, such as Epson, also
print RGB images beautifully. RGB is the primary color mode (with Indexed
Color being secondary) to use on any images to be viewed on-screen, whether
on the Web, or in any kind of multimedia presentation such as slide shows
and video CDs.
CMYK color
CMYK color is very different from RGB. It is based on the light-absorbing qual-
ity of ink on paper. When white light hits these inks, some visible wavelengths
are absorbed while other wavelengths are reflected back to your eyes. 
CMYK images are comprised of various percentages of only four colors of
ink — cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. Darker colors have higher percent-
ages, and lighter colors have lower percentages. These colors correspond to
46
Part I: Getting Started with Photoshop Album 

the inks used in the offset printing process that is used for professional, high-
end printing of magazines, books, and sales and marketing materials. Full-color
images that are printed on an offset press must be in the CMYK color mode.
Cyan, magenta, and yellow are called subtractive colors. That’s because colors
are produced by subtracting various percentages of cyan, magenta, and yellow
from white. Technically, if you combined these three inks, you would produce
black. But because of ink impurities, they create a nasty brown color.
Therefore, K (or black) is added to produce black.
CMYK colors are also known as process colors. When all four inks are set
to 0 percent, pure white is produced. A CMYK image contains four channels,
one for each process color. The greater the number of channels, the larger the
image. High-resolution, CMYK images are usually the behemoths of digital
images.

Chapter 3: Working with Resolution, Color Modes, and File Formats

Grayscale
Black-and-white images are referred to as grayscale images in the digital realm.
They only have one channel, which contains up to 256 levels of gray. Each pixel
in the channel has a brightness value ranging from 0 (black) to 255 (white).
Some digital cameras allow you to adjust the color saturation (intensity or
vividness) to black and white, which allows you to take grayscale photos. You
also can scan an image in grayscale mode, or you can convert color images to
grayscale in a program like Photoshop or Photoshop Elements. 
Although Photoshop Album doesn’t allow you to convert color images to
grayscale, you can reduce the color saturation in the Fix Photo dialog box.
For more details on this technique, see “Using Manual Fixes” in Chapter 11.
Indexed Color
Indexed Color uses 256 colors or less, what we call 8-bit color. When an image
is converted to Indexed Color, in a program like Photoshop or Photoshop
Elements, a Color Lookup Table (CLUT) is built that stores and indexes the
color. If a color in the original image isn’t in the table, the program chooses
the closest match or makes a new one from the available colors. 
The low number of colors in Indexed Color really trims the size of an image
file, which is why this mode is used for the popular file format for Web graph-
ics, GIF. Because of the small file size the graphics download quickly from
Web servers.
Just be aware that a format with only 256 colors usually isn’t sufficient to dis-
play photographic images with any quality. Dithering (the technique of emu-
lating colors by varying the pattern of dots) occurs, and too much detail is
lost in the process of discarding colors, as shown in Figure 3-6. Photographic
images for the Web are better displayed in RGB color rather than Indexed.
Bitmap
Bitmap images contain pixels that are either black or white, no shades of gray
in between. Bitmap images consist of one channel and are very small in file
size, so this mode is best used for scanned line art and signatures, shown in
Figure 3-7, to place in letters and page layouts. Occasionally, you may use this
mode for photos where you want a special effect.

Chapter 3: Working with Resolution, Color Modes, and File Formats

Working with Different File Formats
Photoshop Album can handle a variety of file formats for graphics, sound,
and video. A file format is the way a file’s data is represented and saved. It is
a specific way of structuring the information into bytes.
All digital data is stored through a series of 0s and 1s, each known as a bit.
And 8 bits create a unit of storage called a byte.
No need to worry about the technical jargon. Just know that each format has
its strengths and weaknesses, and some are better at certain tasks than others. 
Graphic file formats
Most of the files you will be importing into Album will probably be graphic,
or still image, files. Fortunately Album can work with quite a few different
graphic formats. Certain formats are designed for print purposes, and others
are specifically tailored for the Web. 
JPEG
JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) is a file format that is the standard
format used by digital cameras. It is also one of the formats used for Web
graphics. 
JPEGs uses lossy compression, which means it squeezes your file size down
to the minutiae by discarding image data. The actual technical mechanics of
the compression algorithm are too complex to get into in this book. But suf-
fice to say that during the compression, colors are averaged in blocks of 8 x 8
pixels to save space. When you open the file again, the original colors cannot
be recovered by the program. During a single working session, this compres-
sion won’t hurt because JPEG works from the on-screen version. But if you
close, reopen, and resave or re-export a file in JPEG format, quality degrada-
tion occurs. You might not see the nasty results right away, but you may over
time, because the damage is cumulative.
Leave your image in either TIFF or PSD formats while performing any editing
function like red eye removal, contrast adjustment, and the like. After you’re
finished with all the editing, export the image as a JPEG. Strangely, you will
not find a Save command in Album. Instead Album has you export a file and
then presents you with various file formats from which to choose. Choose the
File➪Export command in Album to open the Export Selected Items dialog
box, shown in Figure 3-8. Here you have several export options:
 Photo Size: This option allows you to keep your image at its original
dimensions or choose from a number of presets, such as 320 x 240 pixels
and 1280 x 960 pixels.
50
Part I: Getting Started with Photoshop Album 

You also have the option of choosing Custom, which allows you to enter
your desired height and width in pixels. Be aware, however, that although
Album lets you enter any value you want, it retains the original propor-
tions of the image. In order for Album to maintain the proportion, it may
throw out one of your dimensions. For example, if you enter a custom
size of 100 x 100 pixels and your original photo is rectangular, you may
end up with a size of 100 x 66 pixels. 
 Quality: For JPEGs, you have a Quality slider, which offers 13 compres-
sion settings from 0 to 12. A compression setting of 0 squeezes your file
size to a few bytes, but the quality suffers tremendously as a result. On
the other hand, a compression setting of 12 retains good image quality
but won’t compress your file as significantly. And of course, you have all
the settings in between — trade offs between quality and level of com-
pression. JPEG compression works best with continuous-tone images,
such as photographs, which have a wide range of colors. But because
the compression is lossy, I don’t recommend this format for high-quality
printing. Reserve JPEGs for Web images.

Chapter 3: Working with Resolution, Color Modes, and File Formats

 Location: Click the Browse button to navigate to the desired location on
your computer or external media, such as a Zip disk.
 Filenames: Keep it simple and keep the Original Name of your file, or
provide a generic Common Base Name. For example, if you are exporting
a bunch of photos from the latest Westchester dog show, you may want
to give the base name of Dogs. Each photo you export will then be
named Dog-1.jpg, Dog-2.jpg, and so on.
After you have established your options, click the Export button. For more on
exporting, see Chapter 12.
TIFF
Some digital cameras allow you to shoot your photos as TIFFs. TIFF stands
for Tagged Image File Format, was created by Aldus Corporation and is one of
the most widely used file formats. One of the reasons TIFFs are used so widely
is because they have always been usable across platforms. That means that
whether your friends and family are using a Mac or a PC, they can always
view your TIFF images.
Most programs, ranging from word-processing to image-editing programs, are
able to import TIFFs. TIFFs are the format of choice for images that are to be
ultimately printed.
Album can both import and export files as TIFFs. Like JPEGs, you have a Size
option when you export the file. 
The TIFF file format does support lossless compression (described in a
moment), but you don’t have an option to select it in Album; therefore, the
TIFF files you create and modify in Album may end up being large. Also note
that if you set your camera to capture images as TIFFs, you will quickly eat up
the storage on your memory card. For example, using a 3 megapixel camera,
a TIFF will take up around 9MB (megabytes) of storage.
As with JPEG, you specify the location and filename of your image in the
Export As dialog box. The remaining file formats described in the next few
sections also have options for Size, Location, and File Name in their Export
As dialog boxes.
Lossless compression compresses files without deleting any vital data. LZW
(named after the founders, Lempel-Zif-Welch) and Zip are two popular loss-
less compression schemes. Both work especially well with images that have
large areas of a single color. If, during your forays in the computer world, you
come across the option to apply these compression methods, you can use
them without worrying that your gorgeous images will turn into mush after
several dozen sessions of opening and saving.

BMP
BMP is a standard bit-mapped Windows graphics file format often used for
images that you want to make part of your computer’s resources, such as the
wallpaper that you see on the Windows desktop. Although Album can import
BMP files, it cannot export any images in the BMP format. 
PNG
Another file format for Web graphics, PNG stands for Portable Network
Graphic. Like GIFs, PNG files offer good lossless compression, but are usually
10 to 30 percent smaller than GIFs.
Here are the various PNG graphics options:
 PNG-8: Supports only 8-bit color, which is fine for graphics such as logos
and other illustrations with areas of solid color.
 PNG-24: Supports 24-bit color and is suitable for photos. 
PNGs also support transparency, which allows an image to be silhouetted
against background of the Web page, rather than appearing on-screen sur-
rounded by a white box.
GIF
GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) is a commonly used file format for Web
graphics. GIFs use the Indexed Color mode (described earlier in the chapter),
which uses a color palette of 256 colors or less. It also utilizes the LZW loss-
less compression scheme.
This limited color palette is great for creating miniscule files for Web down-
loads, but is not suitable for continuous tone images (such as photos) in
which the number of colors displayed is critical. 
Like PNG-8 files, GIFs are well suited for images with areas of solid colors, as
shown in Figure 3-9. You may want to export an image as a GIF only if it is of
an illustrative nature such as a logo, or if the color quality of the photo is not
critical. 
PSD
PSD is Photoshop’s native file format. Album allows you to export an
image as a PSD file. The Photoshop format supports all image color modes,
is the fastest format for opening and saving files in Photoshop or Photoshop
Elements, and uses a lossless compression process (although it’s invisible to
you). Just don’t expect to get the same kind of compression you get with
JPEG or PDF.
53
Chapter 3: Working with Resolution, Color Modes, and File Formats

Besides being the format of choice if you (or the recipient of your image)
want to work on the image in Photoshop or Photoshop Elements, almost all
drawing and layout programs now support the importing of native
Photoshop files.
PDF
PDF stands for Portable Document Format and is the native format of Adobe
Acrobat. PDFs can contain text, images, sound, motion, and video, which
make them an ideal format to save Photoshop Album creations. Here are a
few other advantages to using PDFs:
 They’re flexible. They are one of the few file formats that are suitable for
both viewing on-screen and for printing.
 They’re often used for electronic documents that are downloadable from
the Web (like your IRS forms) and are a great format for e-mail attach-
ments and exchanging files between people.
 Anyone with a computer running Windows, Mac OS, or a Unix
operating system can read a PDF. All you need to view a PDF file is
Adobe Acrobat Reader, which is available as a free download on Adobe’s
Web site (www.adobe.com). The recipient of your file doesn’t need to
have the same operating system, program, or fonts as you do. All he or
she needs is the reader.
 PDFs have an automatic compression scheme that crunches down the
file size and makes them ideal for e-mail and Web transfer. 
Figure 3-9:

54
Part I: Getting Started with Photoshop Album 

When you make a creation in Album — such as an album, slide show,
video CD, or even an e-mail attachment — and want to save it, the format
of choice is PDF. PDFs are small in size and allow you to e-mail a single attach-
ment rather than numerous, individual images. Album offers various Size and
Quality options for optimizing the PDF: for viewing on-screen, for printing, or
for utilizing the full resolution of the images. 
After you choose one of these three options (as shown in Figure 3-10), Album
presents you with one of two dialog boxes, depending on whether it deems the
size and resolution of your images are satisfactory for your intended creation:
 Satisfactory: Album presents you with the Export PDF dialog box where
you can enter the filename and location to save the file. Then click the
Save button, shown in Figure 3-10.
 Unsatisfactory: You get a dialog box that presents you with “issues,” as
shown in Figure 3-11. These issues may be that your images are either
below the optimum resolution for printing at this size or that they are
low resolution and will not display well at this size on-screen. For more
on resolution, see the section “Getting a Handle on Resolution,” earlier
in this chapter.
When you’re sending creations as e-mail attachments, Album also displays
the file size and download times after the creation has been saved as a PDF.
You can reduce the size of PDF e-mail attachments by changing the settings in
your e-mail preferences. 
Like JPEG files, size and quality have an interrelationship: the smaller the
file, the lower the quality. For more details on file size and resolution, see
Chapter 13.

Chapter 3: Working with Resolution, Color Modes, and File Formats

PDD
PDD files are catalogs created in Adobe’s PhotoDeluxe program. Album
allows you to import the PDD images, but you are unable to export them in
the PDD format. Adobe stopped delivering PhotoDeluxe in July 2002 (tech
support continues until mid 2003). It won’t be missed; Photoshop Album
does everything PhotoDeluxe did and a ton more.
Choosing a format for your digital
photos or scanned images
Before I leave the topic of graphic file formats, let me just briefly cover what
file format you should choose when taking digital photos or when scanning
images. Many digital cameras offer the option of choosing either JPEG or TIFF
as a file format for the photos you take. Some even offer their own propri-
etary formats unique to the camera’s manufacturer. 
When choosing a format, take your intended usage for those photos into
account:
 If you plan on making a photo book or you want high-quality prints, I rec-
ommend capturing your images as TIFFs. Just remember, TIFFs will
result in larger files.
 If you just want to create slide shows or albums to view on-screen or
you want to e-mail your photos to family and friends, stick with the more
compressed JPEG format.
 If you aren’t sure and just want the photos in your library for future pro-
jects, then it is okay to stay with JPEGs; just don’t continually open and
re-export them. 
Figure 3-11:
Album
warns you
when an

too low for
its intended
use.
56
Part I: Getting Started with Photoshop Album 

The lossy compression scheme used by JPEGs will deteriorate the image
over time. Better to make a copy of the image (Edit➪Duplicate Item) and
keep your originals unmolested.
 Avoid using any proprietary format. Not that proprietary formats are
bad; it’s just that the format might not be supported by Album and
other software programs. For example, if your camera allows you to
choose between JPEG and Camera RAW or CCD RAW, choose JPEG.
Album doesn’t support the Camera RAW or CCD RAW formats.
It may not be completely obvious how to choose the file format for your
camera. Some cameras go by settings. A setting of High saves your images
as TIFFs, while other settings, such as Medium or Low, save your images as
JPEGs. If you’re not sure which setting does what, refer to the documentation
that came with your camera. I know, “manual reading” isn’t fun, but it is a
necessary evil sometimes.
When acquiring a scanned image, Album prompts you to choose a file
format in which to save your scanned image. You have the choice of three:
JPEG, TIFF, and PNG. Again, using the criteria I listed earlier in this section, 
consider your intended usage. For the specific mechanics of scanning an
image, see Chapter 4.
Converting one file format to another
Although Album doesn’t have the sophisticated file conversion capabilities of
Photoshop or Photoshop Elements, you can change one format to another by
choosing File➪Export and selecting your desired format, as shown in Figure
3-12. This feature can come in handy when you have a JPEG file, and you want
to perform some editing magic on it. Export it as a TIFF before you begin your
editing session if your editing session will take awhile, and you need to open
and save it repeatedly.
When you fix a photo in Album, Album leaves the original file intact and
saves the file with the word edited after the filename. But it doesn’t allow you
to the save the file in any format but the original format. On the flip side, if
you have a TIFF that you want to post on the Web, you will have to convert it
to a PNG or JPEG, since TIFFs cannot be used as Web graphics. Again, choose
the TIFF and choose File➪Export.
Album doesn’t support the Camera RAW file format used by some digital
cameras. If you want to import these files into Album, you will have to use the
manufacturer’s software that came bundled with your camera to convert the
files into a format Album can handle. If the software isn’t capable of doing the
conversion, you may have to invest in a program that does graphic conver-
sions. See Chapter 21 for more information.
57
Chapter 3: Working with Resolution, Color Modes, and File Formats

Audio file formats
If you’re one of those folks who aren’t satisfied with just using one of your
senses, Photoshop Album graciously allows you to incorporate one more.
The program can handle a couple of different audio formats. 
Not to get too technical, but audio file formats essentially store digital audio
data that contains information about waveform characteristics and how
they’re stored.
Audio files are great for jazzing up slide shows or desktop videos with music
or narration, such as audio captions. (For more on incorporating audio files,
see Chapters 6 and Chapter 18.) Album supports two audio file formats: MP3
and WAV.
Figure 3-12:

58
Part I: Getting Started with Photoshop Album 

MP3
The popular MP3 audio file format has been the rage of late, prompting soft-
ware companies to develop players and consumer electronic manufacturers
to produce personal MP3 devices. Musicians and record labels have also
embraced MP3 and offer online samples of their music in this format.
MP3 is a great format for several reasons:
 It compresses the file size significantly (a 1:12 ratio) without sacrificing
sound quality. The compression scheme reduces the number of bytes in
the file by deleting sounds that the human ear cannot hear, much like
JPEG reduces the size of a graphic by deleting pixels. A one-minute song
only requires 1MB or so of storage.
 The quality approaches CD quality or near CD quality depending on the
compression scheme used.
 Any platform, Windows, Mac, or Unix, can handle MP3 files.
The disadvantages of MP3 files are 
 They need to be decompressed when played. Decompression requires
processing muscle.
 A 16-bit sound card is a minimum system requirement. 
 You need a software player like Winamp, Windows Media Player, or Real
Audio QuickTime to play MP3 files.
Just a bit of techno geek trivia. MP3 is an abbreviation for its real name —
Moving Picture Experts Group, Audio Layer 3. MP3 refers to its method of
compression, with Layer 3 providing the highest level of compression (in
contrast MP1 and MP2 files where Layer 1 and Layer 2 provide a lower level
of compression). MP3 is one of a family of standards (you’ll meet more in the
next section) used for digitally coding audio and video data created by the
MPEG folks. I use the term “folks” loosely. MPEG consists of a group of over
70 international organizations.
WAV
Every beep, chirp, and clang you hear from a Windows computer is essen-
tially a WAV file. That’s because WAV is Microsoft’s native audio file format for
the Windows operating system. This format is a great way to store voice data
because the format is simple, easy to create files with, widely used, and cre-
ates files of good quality. 
Many sound effect clips that you download from the Web (such as
www.partnersinrhyme.com) are in the WAV format. In addition, no special
software players or plug-ins are needed to play WAV files.
59
Chapter 3: Working with Resolution, Color Modes, and File Formats

On the down side, WAV files tend to be very large. While some compression
algorithms are available for WAV files, they are almost always uncompressed
when you download them from various sound Web sites. Uncompressed data
is more easily decoded and can therefore be played easily by most everyone.
Therefore, a one-minute song may require as much as 10MB of storage.
Video file formats
If you have a hard time keeping still, you’ll probably want to experiment with
bringing motion to your images. In its simplest form, motion can be achieved
by incorporating transitions into a slide show. But if that doesn’t satiate your
need to move, you can try importing video clips into Album and incorporat-
ing them into your video CD projects or Web sites. A video file is an integrated
package of sound and lots of still images. Album allows you to import a few
video file formats. 
Here are a few points to keep in mind when creating video files:
 Video files can eat up memory like Godzilla ate up Tokyo. If you want
to use the video for a Web site, choose a format that offers excellent
compression.
 If you want to share your videos with family and friends, be sure every-
one who will be viewing the videos has the necessary plug-ins or players
to play the video file.
 Be sure that the media you choose to store or burn your video clips (your
hard drive, a Zip disk, CD, or DVD) provides adequate storage space.
Motion JPEG
Also known as MJPEG, this format is an extension of the JPEG standard.
In an MJPEG file, each frame in the video is stored with the JPEG still-image
lossy compression applied. Because each frame is captured, the quality is
high, and you can easily edit the files in a desktop video-editing program
such as Adobe Premiere. MJPEG is a common format used by digital video
recorders and often used in security surveillance cameras.
Here are a few other characteristics of the MJPEG format:
 Produces compressed AVI files that are smaller, easier to play and e-mail
than regular AVI files. Audio/Video Interleaved, or AVI, is the native file
format for Windows-based video.
 Offers a variety of compression rates ranging from 2:1 (broadcast qual-
ity) to 12:1 (consumer grade).
60
Part I: Getting Started with Photoshop Album 

 Requires large amounts of storage in comparison to MPEG files and does
require fairly large bandwidth.
 Is not a standard, so the MJPEG file format can vary across different 
vendors.
The newer MJPEG 2000 format is an international standard and has found a
market in professional video production, especially in the fields of medical
imaging, mapping, remote surveillance and sensing, and mobile phones.
MPEG-1
MPEG-1 was the original file format used in CD-ROMs and video CDs. 
MPEG-1 offers high-quality and good (although lossy) compression (50:1
ratio). Unlike MJPEG, the MPEG-1 file format only captures the differences
between one frame and the next, a technique called interframe compression.
Because every frame isn’t captured, editing is more difficult, since the frames
in between have to be re-rendered. In addition, a plug-in is required to view
the movies. 
On the upside, the file sizes are small and can be streamed over the Web.
MPEG-1, however, has seen its hey day and has been replaced with MPEG-2
(better quality and smaller file sizes, 150:1 ratio of compression), which is the
standard used for DVD movies, and the MPEG-4, which is the latest standard
for multimedia, offering the most compression and highest quality, on the
Internet.
Streaming video (or streaming media, which also includes audio) in Web 
circles has nothing to do with water. It refers to the technique of processing
data as a continuous stream. In other words, the file plays while it is being
downloaded. With streaming video, your browser starts displaying the video
before the whole file has been downloaded. It is not necessary to download
the file, open it, and then view it in a browser or application. Remember, 
however, that the files do require streaming servers to deliver the video.
MOV
Originally for Macs, the MOV format, or Apple QuickTime movie shown in
Figure 3-13, is now available for all platforms. The format delivers great qual-
ity, is streamable, but tends to produce large file sizes (depending of frame rate
and quality). Of course, the result is longer download times and the need for
more bandwidth to download the files. In addition to video, QuickTime is also
capable of creating or viewing virtual reality files, like those used in sophisti-
cated computer games. 
The QuickTime plug-in is required to view MOV files. (You can download the
plug-in for free from www.apple.com.) The latest version of QuickTime also
supports the MPEG-4 file format, among a host of 200 media types.

Chapter 3: Working with Resolution, Color Modes, and File Formats

AVI
Audio/Video Interleaved, or AVI, is the native file format for Windows-based
video. This simplest of video file formats was the big dog on the block before
the advent of the Web. It is still a common format found on CD-ROMs. 
AVI files are basically comprised of a string of JPEG images brought together
in a glorified slide show. The quality of AVI files is pretty good, and the format
doesn’t need any special software or plug-ins to play. 
Unfortunately, the file sizes are monstrous and therefore not practical for
loading onto the Web unless they are highly compressed. The problem is that
the compression scheme is lossy, so you have to sacrifice quality to com-
press the files.
AVI files are also not streamable. Advance Streaming Format, or ASF, is the
successor to AVI.
Album can import video in PAL format, but the files cannot be used in
any Album creations. For more on creations, see Chapter 18.

A
lbum’s got features coming out of its proverbial ears,
but in order to use them, you have to bring your ﬁles
into the program. Album can get photos from just about
anyplace — digital cameras, scanners, CDs, hard drives.
Unfortunately, it can’t dive into those shoeboxes and stor-
age totes full of snapshots and suck them into the moni-
tor, but in Chapter 4 you ﬁnd everything you need to know
about importing your ﬁles from a multitude of sources.
After you import your ﬁles, you can start to utilize one of
Album’s greatest strengths — its capability to identify,
track, and organize your photos, clips, and creations.
Chapters 5 and 6 show you how to create and use tags,
captions, and notes to identify and organize your image
inventory. Be sure to back up your catalog in case of a
computer glitch or other type of catastrophe. Chapter 7
shows you to create backups of your catalog and also how
to archive images onto CD or DVD to make more space
available on your hard drive.

Importing Files
In This Chapter
 Collecting your source materials
 Importing files from your hard drive
 Importing photos from cameras, card readers, and scanners
 Importing files from CDs, DVDs, and Adobe resources
A
fter you’ve successfully installed Album and have a feel for how it
works, it’s time to wrangle your files and get them into the program. If
you have a large inventory of files or if your images are scattered about, this
process may take a good chunk of time. But the feeling of well being and peace
of mind that comes from knowing all of your images are in one centralized,
well-organized location is well worth any time you invest.
You can get your files into Album many ways, depending on the source they’re
coming from — your hard drive, CDs, your digital camera, your scanner, and
so on. Album gives you a lot of assistance in finding and importing files and
makes the process extremely simple. However, Album isn’t quite able, at least
not yet, to hook up your camera or scanner for you or look on your shelves
for CDs. That manual labor is still up to you, and it’s the first step toward get-
ting stuff organized in Album.
Gathering Your Source Materials
Before you start importing your files into Album, it’s a good idea to gather all
your source material. Granted, you don’t have to get every digital image you’ve
gathered over the years into Album in one sitting, but may find the process to
be more time efficient if you have some materials handy before you get started
on the first import session. Here are some items you may want to round up:

 Digital camera: If you have images stored in your camera, connect your
camera to the computer. Or if you’re using a memory card (CompactFlash,
SmartMedia and so on), insert the card into your reader or adapter,
which should also be connected to the computer. If you have a digital
video camera, connect that to your computer as well.
 Photo CDs: If you have had images burned to a Photo CD by your
photofinisher or service bureau, and you want to have a record and
thumbnail of those images, be sure and import them into Album. You
can store the actual, high-, or full-resolution files offline, which means
Album retains only the low-resolution proxy version of the files on your
hard drive, and prompts you for the Photo CD when it needs to access
the actual file.
A proxy is like a stand-in image for the real thing. For more on storing
images offline, see the section, “Importing Photos from CDs, DVDs, and
Adobe Sources,” later in this chapter.
 Picture CDs: These CDs, which are offered by Kodak photofinishing cen-
ters, contain digital copies of your prints. You may even have some really
old digital copies of your prints on, gasp, floppy disks. The images are low
resolution and in JPEG file format, which is great for posting on the Web
or e-mailing. But they may not be appropriate for creations that you will
ultimately print.
If the only digital version of an image that you have is a low-resolution
JPEG, you may want to rescan the prints yourself at a higher resolution.
For more on resolution and format, see Chapter 3.
 Stock photography CDs: If you have acquired any stock photo CDs,
you may want to have a record of the images within Album. As with
Photo CDs, you can store the full-resolution files offline so your hard
drive space isn’t eaten up.
 CDs and DVDs: Dust off those CDs and DVDs to which you dutifully
burned archived photos, video clips, and audio clips. Although you
can’t import music directly off a music CD, Album does recognize MP3
files. So any music that you have either converted to or downloaded in
the MP3 format can be imported. For more on acceptable file formats,
see Chapter 3.
 Prints, slides, or negatives that need scanning: It’s time to dig out those
photo albums, binders, and shoeboxes that contain years of memories.
You can scan and store the images in a folder on your hard drive and
import them from your hard drive, or you can import them directly into
Album via the scanner. For details, see “Getting Photos from a Scanner,”
later in this chapter.
If you have a lot of photos to scan, you might want to hire a sharp,
quick-learning neighborhood teenager (or maybe you have one in the
family) who will scan for meager wages. However, before anyone scans
anything, be sure to check out Chapter 3 on resolution. Believe me, you
don’t want to do this job twice.
66
Part II: Importing, Organizing, and Managing Photos 

 Videotapes that need digitizing: Those priceless home movies need to
be digitized in order to get them into Album. If you don’t have the hard-
ware and software to digitize tape, some service centers will do it for
you for a reasonable fee. Album accepts Motion JPEG (commonly saved
as AVI), MPEG-1 (MPG), QuickTime (MOV), and Audio/Video Interleaved
(AVI) formats.
 URLs of Web sites that contain images you want: If you and your
family and friends have shared photos online on Web sites such as
Shutterfly.com, MSN Photo.com, and others, you may want to have
those URLs handy so you can download those images and import them
to Album.
 Removable disks: If you have files stored on Zip disks, Jaz disks,
Bernoulli disks, or even floppy disks, have them at the ready so you can
“insert and import.”
 External hard drives: If you have any external hard drives that you use
for data storage, make sure they’re connected and ready to go.
Importing Files from Your Hard Drive
After you’ve completed the “hunting and gathering” of source materials, you’re
ready to start importing files into Album. When you import files from your hard
drive, Album creates a link to those files. This means that the file itself isn’t
copied or embedded into the program. Instead, a low-resolution version, called
a proxy, is imported, and the thumbnail is displayed in the Photo Well. A link
is created from the proxy to the full-resolution file on your hard drive. When
you need to use the full-resolution file — to print a copy or make a creation,
for example — Album goes out and gets the full-resolution data and uses it.
Because the files are just links, it is important that you don’t move the files
from their original folder locations after importing them. If you move a file,
Album will not be able to find it and will consider it a “missing file.” You will
then have to reconnect the file to its new location. (For more on reconnecting
missing files, see Chapter 7.)
Importing photos by using 
menu commands
Here’s how to get files into Album from your hard drive:
1. Choose File➪Get Photos➪From Files and Folders.
You also can click the handy Get Photos button in the Shortcuts bar and
choose From Files and Folders from the pop-up menu. Or you can
67
Chapter 4: Importing Files

choose Help➪Quick Guide and click the Get Photos button or the Get
Photos tab. From there, click the File Folders button.
The Get Photos from Files and Folders dialog box appears (see Figure 4-1).
2. Navigate to the folder that contains the photos you want to import.
You have three choices in the types of files that will display in the list:
• Media Files: Shows any photo, audio, and video files that are in for-
mats compatible to Album.
• PDF Files: Shows files in the Portable Document Format (PDF),
such as those you created with the Creations Wizard (albums, slide
shows, and so on).
• All Files: Shows, well, everything, whether Album can import it
or not. If you choose a file format that Album can’t work with, a
message that says “Unsupported File Format” appears where the
thumbnail preview would be in the dialog box. For more on the file
formats that Album supports, see Chapter 3.
3. Choose the method that relates to the number of files you want to
import:
• Single file: Select the file from the folder. Note that if you hover
your mouse over a file, info about the photo (file type, date/time,
and size) displays. After you select the file, you see a thumbnail
preview. If you’re satisfied with your selection, click the Get Photos
button, shown in Figure 4-1.
Figure 4-1:
You can
import one
or multiple
photos 
into Album
using the

dialog box.
68
Part II: Importing, Organizing, and Managing Photos 

• Multiple photos: Select the first file you want to import, hold down
the Ctrl key, and select additional files. Or you can select the first
file, hold down the Shift key and click a second file, and you will
select those files and all the files in between. Then click the Get
Photos button.
• All the photos in a folder: Navigate to the folder, select it, and
then click the Get Photos button.
• All the photos stored in multiple subfolders: Navigate to the main
folder and select it. Select the Get Photos from Subfolders check
box on the right side of the dialog box (refer to Figure 4-1).
4. When you’re finished selecting files, click the Get Photos button.
Album imports your photos into the Photo Well. Album may display a
dialog box that tells you that only newly imported files are being dis-
played. Click OK, and if you don’t want to keep seeing this dialog box,
check the Don’t Show Again option.
To see all your images, click the Show All button in the Shortcuts bar or
the Clear button in the Find bar above the Photo Well.
If you accidentally try to get an image you previously imported, Album tells
you it wasn’t imported because it already exists in your catalog, as shown in
Figure 4-2.
You can’t import a PDF creation that was made in Album, such as a Slide
Show or Calendar (for example, if a relative or friend who also owns Album
sends you a PDF creation). Album imports the individual files (photos, video
clips, and audio clips) used in the creation, but not the actual creation. If you
want to keep the creation, you will have to recreate it. For more on creations,
see Chapter 18.

files weren’t
imported
and why.

Chapter 4: Importing Files

Importing photos by dragging 
and dropping 
If you’re a drag-and-drop kind of person, you’ll be happy to know Album sup-
ports this method of importing photos. To import photos into your catalog,
just drag and drop them into the Photo Well. Album creates a new file with
the image, just as it does when you import using the menu commands.
You can drag and drop from your desktop, from Windows Explorer, or from
image editors, such as Photoshop Elements: 
 If you drag and drop from the desktop or from Windows Explorer, the file
appears in the Photo Well immediately.
 If you drag from an image editor, the Getting Photos dialog box briefly
appears, and then the photo appears in the Photo Well.
Not every image editor allows you to drag photos into Album. Try it, and
if it doesn’t work, you can always go the conventional route and use the
menu commands.
Click the Show All button in the Shortcuts bar or the Clear button in the Find
bar to view all your images.
You also can export image files by dragging and dropping. See Chapter 12 for
details.
Searching for files on your hard drive 
Getting photos from your hard drive is fine and dandy, if you know where
everything is. But what if you were a little lapse on your file housekeeping,
and items are scattered high and low on your hard drive? 
Being the wonderful organizer it is, Album provides a way to search for files
on your computer and then allows you to pick and choose what you want.
Album can find photos and video clips, but not audio clips or creation PDFs
(for more on creations, see Chapter 18).
Album cannot search CDs and DVDs or network drives (like a server). But it
can search external media such as Zip disks.
Here are the steps to get photos into Album by searching your hard drive:
1. Choose File➪Get Photos➪By Searching.
The Get Photos by Searching for Folders dialog box appears.
70
Part II: Importing, Organizing, and Managing Photos 

2. Select one of the following search options from the Look In drop-
down menu: 
• All Hard Disks: Finds all the files on your computer, which
includes all installed and connected hard drives.
• Drive C: Searches only the main hard drive, which is usually the
C drive.
• My Documents: Searches for files in the My Documents folder and
its subfolders only.
• Browse: Allows you to navigate and pinpoint specific locations on
your computer.
3. Deselect the Exclude System and Program Folder option, if desired.
By default, this option is checked, so Album searches all the folders
on your computer except for System and Program folders. This relieves
Album, and you, from looking through folders that probably don’t con-
tain photos and video clips. On the other hand, if you have really bad file
management practices, or if someone else who uses your computer does,
you may want Album to search every nook and cranny for possible
rogue images.
Files that you are using for your Windows wallpaper reside in the System
folder. And sample images supplied by programs like Photoshop Elements
live in the Program folder. If you want to have these files included in your
catalog, then you will want to deselect the Exclude System and Program
Folder option.
4. Deselect the Exclude Files Smaller than 100K option, if desired.
By default this option is checked so Album ignores any file smaller than
100K. The reasoning behind this option is that any files that small are too
low in resolution to be of any significance. This assumption may not be
true, however, if you prepare a lot of images for to display on the Web,
because such files are smaller in size by nature. You can enter in your
own size criteria or uncheck the option altogether.
5. Click the Search button.
Depending on your search option and the number of files you have, the
search may take a couple minutes. Take a break and get a beverage or
click the Cancel button if you want to end the search.
When Album has finished its search, it displays a list of folders that con-
tain photos and video clips in the Search Results section of the dialog
box, as shown in Figure 4-3.
If, like me, you have a bazillion folders with files, you may be a bit over-
whelmed when you see the search results. My head spun, anyway.
71
Chapter 4: Importing Files

6. If you decide you just want to browse the folders on your own and
navigate to a particular folder, click the Take me there link at the
bottom of the dialog box.
The Search dialog box transports you to the Getting Photos from Files
and Folders dialog box. See the section, “Importing Files from Your Hard
Drive” earlier in this chapter.
7. Select one or more folders that contain files you want to import.
When you select a folder, Album thankfully gives you a preview (on the
right side of the dialog box) of the first few files in the folder so you can
get an idea of what’s in it, in case your memory is a bit foggy.
8. Click the Import Folders button.
Album retrieves the files and imports them into your Photo Well.
You also can use the Quick Guide to search for files on your computer. Choose
Help➪Quick Guide. Click the Get Photos button or tab. Then click the Search
Drive button. From there, follow Steps 2 through 4 above.

Part II: Importing, Organizing, and Managing Photos 

Importing Photos from Cameras 
and Card Readers
If you are connecting your camera directly to your computer, via a serial, USB
or FireWire cable, first make sure that you have all the necessary drivers that
came with your camera. If you are running Windows XP, drivers for some cam-
eras (models of Nikon, Kodak, Olympus, and others) are already installed. Still,
I recommend installing the drivers that actually came with your camera. If
you don’t know where the disk containing the drivers is, you should be able
to download the drivers from the camera manufacturer’s Web site.
If this is the first time connecting your camera, I recommend reading the
documentation that came with your camera. As dry as most manuals are, the
information is usually useful. And let’s face it, if the camera isn’t talking to the
computer, there’s no way the images are getting into Album.
The exact steps you take to import photos from a digital camera also depend
on the kind of driver your camera uses:
 TWAIN drivers: TWAIN is a universal software standard that links appli-
cations and devices, such as cameras and scanners. If your camera came
with a TWAIN driver, it must be installed so that the computer and Album
can talk to the camera. Also, if you are running Windows 2000 or 98SE,
you will have to work with TWAIN drivers.
 WIA (Windows Image Acquisition) drivers: WIA can be used only if
you’re running Windows XP or ME. If your camera is WIA-enabled, you
can get photos from your camera by clicking a single button in Album.
Some cameras mount directly to your computer like a hard drive. Getting
photos from a mounted camera is similar to getting photos from a hard drive,
so follow the steps in the section “Importing Photos from Your Hard Drive,”
earlier in this chapter.
If your camera uses a flash card or memory card, like a CompactFlash or
SmartMedia, or another kind of card and you have a reader attached to your
computer, Album also can import images from the reader. In fact, importing
from the reader is usually faster, quicker and pretty much hassle-free. If you
have a choice between importing from the camera or from the reader, I rec-
ommend going with the reader.
To get photos directly from the camera or the reader, follow these steps:
1. Make sure that your camera or card reader is connected to the 
computer.
73
Chapter 4: Importing Files

If you are unsure how to connect the camera or card to the computer,
check the documentation that came with your camera. Most likely a USB
cable was included in the box along with your camera or card reader.
Manufacturers recommend that you keep the camera turned off while
cabling it up. Card readers usually don’t have any on and off switch, so
don’t worry about those being off.
If you’re connecting your camera via a serial cable, turn off your camera
and your computer, as well. If you don’t, the computer may not recognize
that the camera is connected.
2. Turn on your camera.
At this point, some juice is needed.
Note: If you’re running Windows XP or Me and using a WIA-enabled
camera, Album may begin importing your photos automatically, so you
can skip the rest of the steps. Your newly imported images appear in the
Photo Well. Click the Clear button to see your entire catalog.
3. Choose File➪Get Photos from Camera or Card Reader.
You also can use one of these methods:
• Click the Get Photos button in the Shortcuts bar and choose From
Camera or Card Reader from the drop-down menu.
• Choose Help➪Quick Guide and click the Get Photos button or tab.
Click the Camera button.
The Get Photos from Camera or Card Reader dialog box appears, as
shown in Figure 4-4.
4. Choose the name of the camera or reader from the Camera pop-up
menu, if necessary.
If you have already established your settings in the Preferences dialog
box (described in the next section), you bypass the dialog box, and your
photos are imported directly into the Photo Well.
Album may not distinguish between the camera or reader in the Camera
pop-up menu. Both may appear as <Camera or Card Reader> rather
than the specific name of the device. And to make matters more confus-
ing, if you happen to have a Zip drive, it may also be called <Camera or
Card Reader>. If you’re not sure what device belongs to what drive
letter, use Windows Explorer and check and see what contents are on
each drive letter.
5. Click the Browse button if you want to save the imported photos in a
particular folder on your hard drive. In the Browse for Folder dialog
box, navigate to the folder and then click OK.
74
Part II: Importing, Organizing, and Managing Photos 

By default, Album stores the files at C:\Documents and Settings\My
Pictures\Adobe\Digital Camera Photos\. You also can create a
new folder if desired.
6. If you want to import your photos into a new subfolder, which is
named using the date and time of import, select the Create Subfolder
Using Date/Time of Import option.
This subfolder is saved inside the folder that appears in the Save Files In
field. This option can come in handy if you have other folders on your
computer identified by date and time, and you want to be able to readily
identify this new batch of images.
7. If you want to delete the files from your camera after they have been
imported into Album, select Delete Photos on Camera or Memory
Card after Import option.
If you choose this option, Album displays a prompt when you click OK,
asking you if this is really what you want to do.
I really don’t recommend selecting this option, just in case something
goes awry in the importing process. You can always delete the images
later, after you’re sure they have been imported successfully.
8. The Import All Photos option is available only if you have a WIA-
enabled camera. Select it if you want to import all the images on the
camera. 
If you want to select only certain photos, don’t check this option.
Figure 4-4:
Choose your

75
Chapter 4: Importing Files

9. Click OK and watch the magic happen.
If your camera uses TWAIN drivers, Album may launch the manufac-
turer’s software that came with your camera. If so, just follow the on-
screen instructions to import the photos from your camera. If there
aren’t any, consult your camera’s documentation.
Album flashes a quick preview of the images as it imports them.
Album may display a dialog box that tells you that only newly imported
files are being displayed. Click OK. If you don’t want to see this message
again, check the Don’t Show Again option before you click OK. They
are then displayed in the Photo Well. Click the Shortcuts button in the
Shortcuts bar or the Clear button in the Find bar to see your entire
catalog.
Getting Photos from a Scanner
Album allows you to scan images and immediately import them into Album
in one fell swoop. You can import photos from either a USB or an older SCSI
scanner (at least I was able to). If you have problems importing with a SCSI
scanner, scan your images to the hard drive and then import using the
method described in the section, “Importing Files from Your Hard Drive”
earlier in this chapter. Also, you can always resort to this measure if the
steps below prove to be too frustrating, for whatever reason.
Before you get started, make sure that you have installed all the software (dri-
vers and so on) that shipped with your scanner. Some scanners use TWAIN
drivers (described earlier in the camera and card reader section). Other scan-
ners use WIA (Windows Image Acquisition) drivers, which are only available
on Windows XP or ME. The software enables the scanner to communicate with
the computer. It is a good idea to make sure that your scanner is, in actuality,
able to talk to the computer after you install the software. If necessary, run a
couple of test scans using the stand-alone scanning software that came with
the device.
Here are the ins and outs of importing photos from a scanner:
1. Turn on the scanner.
I know this is a no-brainer, but I have to mention this step just in case it’s
early, and you haven’t had your morning coffee. Also, it is a good idea to
make sure your scanning bed is clean from dust, fingerprints, chocolate
smudges and any other debris. Remember, unwanted garbage gets
scanned along with your image.
76
Part II: Importing, Organizing, and Managing Photos 

2. Choose File➪Get Photos➪From Scanner.
You also can use either of these commands:
• Choose Help➪Quick Guide and click the Get Photos button or tab.
Then click the Scanner button.
• Click the Get Photos button in the Shortcuts bar and choose From
Scanner from the drop-down menu.
The Get Photos from Scanner dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 4-5.
3. Select your scanner from the Scanner pop-up menu.
If Album annoyingly responds with a “None Detected” message, make
sure that the scanner is on and all connections are well seated.
4. If you want to save your file in a location other than the default path
shown, click the Browse button.
Navigate to your desired folder on your computer or create a new fold.
5. Choose a file format from the Save As pop-up menu.
If you are unfamiliar with file formats, check out Chapter 3.
6. If you’re using the JPEG format, drag the slider to establish the qual-
ity of the image.
Album’s default quality setting is Medium. A higher value results in
a better quality image but larger file size. If you plan on using the file
just for display on-screen, you can get away with using a lower value.
However, if you plan on using the image for print, be sure and save it at
a higher value. For more on JPEGs and quality settings, see Chapter 3.
7. Click the OK button.
If you’re using a scanner with a TWAIN driver, Album launches the driver,
and your scanning plug-in software appears. My scanning software
Figure 4-5:
Album
allows you
to scan and
import your
images
directly.
77
Chapter 4: Importing Files

appears in Figure 4-6. If you’re familiar with using the software, you’re all
set. If not, read the instructions that came with the scanner to capture
the scan. If you have questions on size, resolution, and color mode, refer
to Chapter 3.
If you’re using Windows XP, Album may launch the Windows XP scan-
ning interface. If you’re unfamiliar with using it, check your Windows
documentation for details.
8. When the scan is completed, close the scanning software, if necessary.
The Getting Photos dialog box briefly flashes, and then Album imports
the scan into the Photo Well.
Album may display a dialog box that tells you that only newly imported
files are being displayed. Click OK. The scanned image is then displayed
in the Photo Well. Click the Shortcuts button in the Shortcuts bar or the
Clear button in the Find bar to see your entire catalog.
When you import an image using a scanner, the date and time of the scan is
embedded in the file’s information. You can easily change the date and time.
See Chapter 5 to find out how.

Part II: Importing, Organizing, and Managing Photos 

Importing Photos from CDs, DVDs,
and Adobe Resources
When importing images from a CD or DVD, you have two options:
 You can import the files and have a full-resolution copy stored on your
hard drive and displayed in the Photo Well.
 You can import them and have a proxy (a low-resolution copy) stored,
while leaving the original, full-resolution image on the CD or DVD.
This is known as storing them offline. A proxy is like a stand-in image for
the real thing. It is linked, or points to, the original, full-resolution image,
and Album prompts you to insert the CD or DVD when it needs to pull that
information to execute a command like printing and making creations and
so on. At that time, you can choose to insert the disk to import the master
image, use the low-resolution proxy, or cancel the command. Storing
images offline is a good idea if you are short on hard drive storage.
Follow these steps to import files from a CD or DVD:
1. Insert your CD or DVD in the appropriate drive.
2. Choose File➪Get Photos➪From Files and Folders.
Or you can use one of the following options:
• Choose Help➪Quick Guide and click the Get Photos button or tab.
Then click the CD button.
• Click the Get Photos button in the Shortcuts bar and choose From
Files and Folders from the drop-down menu.
The Get Photos from Files and Folders dialog box appears, as shown in
Figure 4-7.
3. Navigate to your CD or DVD drive.
4. Select the photos you wish to import.
5. If you want to copy only a proxy of the photo to your catalog, check
the Keep Original Offline option. If you want to copy the full-resolution
original, leave this option unchecked.
If you select this option, Album creates a link to the full-resolution origi-
nal image on the CD/DVD.
6. If you checked Keep Original Offline, you can choose to type in an
optional Reference name for the CD or DVD for easier identification
later.
79
Chapter 4: Importing Files

Although it is optional, I recommend providing a descriptive reference
name so that when Album requests the master file, as described in the
first paragraph, it will provide the reference name of the disk, making it
easy for you to retrieve. Generic names like “Volume 71” or “Photo CD”
leave a lot to be desired. Choose something more descriptive, such as
PhotoDisc Modern Living Stock Photos.
7. Click the Get Photos button.
The Getting Photos dialog box appears briefly, as shown in Figure 4-8,
and your images are imported in to Album.
Album may display a dialog box that tells you that only newly imported
files are being displayed. Click OK if you desire, and also the Don’t Show

Chapter 4: Importing Files

Setting Import Preferences
It is helpful to set the import preferences for your various devices. Once you
do so, Album will use those preferences as the defaults for all of your import-
ing tasks. The only time you will have to change your preferences is if you
want to import from another device.
Camera or card reader preferences
After you identify your camera to Album by setting your camera and card
reader preferences, you can bypass the Get Photos from Camera or Card
Reader dialog box when you execute the Get Photos command (unless you
click the Restore Default settings button). Your photos are imported directly
into the Photo Well.
If you are experiencing difficulty importing photos, try clicking the Restore
Default Settings button in the Preferences dialog box to return to the original
defaults, which may alleviate the problem.
Here’s how to set the preferences for your camera or card reader:
1. Choose Edit➪Preferences.
The Preferences dialog box appears.
2. Choose Camera or Card Reader from the list on the left side of the
dialog box, as shown in Figure 4-10.
3. Choose the name of your camera from the Camera pop-up menu.
If you’ve used more than one camera, or a camera and card reader, all
devices will appear in the list. If you connect a different camera, you
need to select it from the list.
4. Specify the location you want to save imported files. Also check any of
the options you want.
For more on these options, see “Importing Photos from Cameras and
Card Readers,” earlier in the chapter.
5. Check the Always Ask to Become Default Application option.
This action ensures that Album automatically launches when WIA-
enabled cameras are attached to your computer, and your computer is
running Windows XP or ME. Select this option even if you don’t have a
WIA-enabled camera.
6. Click OK to close the Preferences dialog box.
82
Part II: Importing, Organizing, and Managing Photos 

Scanner preferences
After you set your scanner preferences, the scanning process is streamlined.
Essentially, you bypass the Get Photos from Scanner dialog box and are
transported directly to your scanning software interface.
You will lose the flexibility in choosing file formats and Quality settings 
for various scans. All images are scanned to the settings established in your
Preferences. If you need to change the settings, as well as the default location
you are saving your scanned images to, you have to change your Preferences
settings.
Here’s how to set the preferences for your scanner:
1. Choose Edit➪Preferences.
The Preferences dialog box appears.
2. Choose Scanner from the Preferences list on the left side of the dialog
box, as shown in Figure 4-11.
3. Choose your scanner from the Scanner pop-up menu.
If you connect your computer to a different scanner, you have to go back
to the Preferences and select that scanner from the list.

JPEG, select a Quality setting.
For more on the Quality setting, see “Getting Photos from a Scanner,”
earlier in this chapter. For real details, see Chapter 3 for more on file
formats and Quality settings.
5. Click the Browse button to select the location of the folder where you
want your scans to be stored.
You can skip this step if you’re satisfied with the default location.
6. Click OK to close the Preferences dialog box.
Preferences for offline photos
In the General section of the Preferences dialog box, you can choose a default
size of the proxy images you want to store in Album. Here’s how:
1. Choose Edit➪Preferences and click General in the list on the left side
of the dialog box, as shown in Figure 4-12.

2. Choose the default pixel dimension for the Proxy File Size in the
Offline Media section.
Album’s default size is 640 x 480, which is a good middle-of-the-road size.
A larger size (such as 1024 x 768) provides better quality, and a smaller
size (such as 320 x 240) saves disk space. For particulars on pixel dimen-
sions, see Chapter 3.
3. Click OK to close the dialog box.
Getting Photos from Adobe PhotoDeluxe
or Adobe ActiveShare Albums
If you are a current, or most likely a former, PhotoDeluxe or Adobe
ActiveShare user, Album can import images from those catalogs. I recom-
mend consolidating your entire inventory of images into one program. Trying
to remember which image resides where is just too tedious for even the most
fastidious among us.

1. Choose File➪Get Photos➪PhotoDeluxe Album or ActiveShare Album.
Either the Finding PhotoDeluxe Albums dialog box (shown in Figure 4-13)
or the Finding ActiveShare Albums dialog box appears.
2. Choose which folders Album should search.
Leave the default folder to search for catalogs only in the folders associ-
ated with PhotoDeluxe or ActiveShare. Or click the Browse button to
navigate to a particular folder.
3. Click the Search button.
When Album is done searching, any folders containing PhotoDeluxe or
ActiveShare albums appear in the Search Results list. Click a folder to
preview its contents.
4. Select a single or multiple PhotoDeluxe or ActiveShare album.
5. Click the Import Album button.
Album imports the PhotoDeluxe or ActiveShare catalogs, and the photos
appear in the Photo Well.

Part II: Importing, Organizing, and Managing Photos 

Getting Images Off the Web
Album does not have a direct way to import images from the Web. If you want
to bring Web images into your catalog, you must save them to your hard drive
and then use the method described in the earlier section “Importing Images
from Your Hard Drive.”
Most images that you download from the Web, unless otherwise noted, are
low resolution and not really suitable for any applications, such as printing,
which require higher resolutions. They are fine for displaying on alternate
Web sites, for viewing in e-mail messages, or for slide shows to be displayed
on-screen.
Make sure that any images you get from the Web are not copyright protected.
There are numerous sites that offer free or inexpensive, copyright-free images
for your personal use. And of course, there are also great sites such as Getty
Images, Corbis, ThinkStock, and PhotoSpin, all of which offer high-quality,
high-resolution photos (priced accordingly of course) for business and per-
sonal use.

A
lbum’s greatest strength, in my humble opinion, is its ability to help you
organize all your digital images. Album allows you to sort and view your
images in the Photo Well by a particular date or range of dates, import batch,
folder locations, color similarity, media type and tags. How you sort and view
your images is totally up to you, and you may find one particular method
works better than others depending on what you are doing or looking for. In
my opinion, one of the best organizational tools is the tagging function. Tags
are like keywords that you attach to your file.
Although you can organize your files by date and use the timeline and calendar
to track down files, tags kick it up a notch by adding descriptive information to
help identify and later find your files quickly and efficiently. For example, say
you have no idea when you took such-and-such image. After the 1,000th snap-
shot, dates can begin to blur. Having to scroll through a year’s worth (or even a
few months’ worth) of images can be time consuming, especially if you have a
lot of files. 
Using tags also can unburden you from assigning pertinent filenames to your
images or grouping them into folders by topic. You can actually get lazier
while getting more organized. What a concept.

This chapter focuses on using the Photo Well and the tag categorization
system to organize files. You also can organize your files by adding informa-
tion to them in the form of captions, notes, and audio annotations. This addi-
tional method for keeping your digital images straight really works and isn’t a
whole lot of extra effort. To find more information about using captions and
notes to identify, organize, and find your photos, see Chapter 6.
Organizing Photos in the Photo Well
Album allows you to view your whole collection of images in one central 
location — the Photo Well. (See Chapter 2 for more on the Photo Well.) This
fact is true no matter where your files reside — on the hard drive, on a CD, on
a CompactFlash card, and so on.
Album automatically organizes your photos in the Photo Well by the follow-
ing criteria:
 Date (Newest First)
 Date (Oldest First)
 Import Batch
 Folder Location
 Color Similarity
Select a different viewing arrangement or a different range in the timeline, and
your photos will be organized and displayed accordingly in the Photo Well.
Selecting a viewing arrangement
I cover sorting by these criteria in detail in Chapter 9, but I’ll give you the con-
densed version here. You can select a viewing arrangement a couple ways:
 Choose View➪Arrangement and select one of the sorting criteria.
 Click the Photo Well Arrangement button (also known as the Sort
button) in the Options bar and do the same.
Either way, Album displays your images in the Photo Well accordingly. For
example, if you choose Date (Newest First), your images are organized from
the newest creation date to the oldest, as shown in Figure 5-1. Choosing
Folder Location organizes and displays your images by the name and loca-
tion in which they are contained.
90
Part II: Importing, Organizing, and Managing Photos 

Using the timeline
You also can organize your photos by using the timeline. The timeline, which
appears above the Photo Well, displays bars that represent the number of
photos you have in a given month, folder, or batch, depending on how your
photos are organized in the Photo Well. Using the timeline, you can find and
organize photos based on a range you establish by dragging the endpoint
markers at either end. For example, if your images are organized by date, you
can drag the endpoint markers to set a range of time in the timeline. Album
then displays photos with dates that are within that timeframe. For more on
the timeline, see Chapter 8.
I use the word “photos” loosely in the preceding paragraph. Depending on
what media types you have selected (View➪Media Types), you may see cre-
ations, video clips, and audio clips, in addition to photos (refer to Figure 5-1).
Of course, if you want to narrow down the media types that are displayed in
the timeline, just choose the file type you’re interested in from the
View➪Media Types menu.

Chapter 5: Organizing, Categorizing, and Cross-Referencing Photos

Changing the Date of a Photo
Dates are used extensively in Album to identify, find, and organize your files.
Most digital cameras automatically embed the date and time when you take a
photo, and when you scan an image, the date and time of the scan is
recorded by your computer’s operating system, so using dates as a sorting
criteria makes a lot of sense and shouldn’t waste too much of your time.
At some point, you may need to change the date of a file. Maybe your
camera’s clock was wrong or the photo you took on vacation was in another
time zone from your camera. Or you may have scanned some vintage shots of
your great grandparents and want the date to reflect 1900 instead of 2003. Or
possibly, you just want to make a group of photos reflect a certain fixed date
for organizing and locating purposes. Whatever the case, you can adjust the
date and time of a file by following these steps:
1. Select your desired photo(s) in the Photo Well.
You also can change the dates of video and audio clips and creations.
2. Choose Edit➪Adjust Date and Time.
You also can use any of these options:
• Click the date or time on the file’s thumbnail. Your mouse pointer
looks like a pointing finger. 
If you don’t see any dates, be sure and check the Show Dates option in
the Options bar. Or choose View➪Show Dates and Tags. The thumbnail
method works for all Photo Well views. For more on views, see Chapter 9. 
• Right-click an image thumbnail and choose Adjust Date and Time
from the context-sensitive menu.
• If you have selected a single photo, you can click the Adjust Date
and Time button in the Properties pane, shown in Figure 5-2. For
details on the Properties pane, see Chapter 6.
The Adjust Date and Time dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 5-3.
3. Select one of the following options:
• Change to a Specified Date and Time: Select this option to manu-
ally change the date and time, and then click OK. In the Set Date
and Time dialog box, enter your desired date. If you don’t know
the date, you can select the question marks from the pop-up menu.
Choose the time, if you know it. If you are unsure (or aren’t that
picky), you can select Unknown. Click OK when you’re done.
92
Part II: Importing, Organizing, and Managing Photos 

• Change to Match File Date and Time: Select this option to have
Album change the time to the modified date of the file, and then
click OK. For example, you may have shot an image on March 23,
2003, and cropped it and removed red eye in Album on April
10, 2003. The date of the image is March 23, but if you select the
Change to Match File Date and Time, the date of the image changes
to April 10.
• Shift by Set Number of Hours (Time Zone Adjust): Select this
option to adjust the time by a certain number of hours, and then
click OK. In the Time Zone Adjust dialog box, select either Ahead
or Back and select the number of hours you want to adjust. Click
OK when done. This is a great option if you want to adjust the date
and time of those vacation photos you took in Europe or Asia.

Chapter 5: Organizing, Categorizing, and Cross-Referencing Photos

Album adjusts the date and time and embeds the new information in the
image’s metadata. Metadata is information about the image, such as infor-
mation about your digital camera settings, that is stored along with the
file. Depending on the new date and time, the file dutifully takes its new
position in the Photo Well.
Occasionally, you may see a file that has a question mark instead of a date.
This indicates that the date is unknown. Maybe the clock on your digital
camera wasn’t cooperating at the time you shot your images. Don’t worry;
you can assign the date and time of your choice using the above steps. If you
want to round up all those stray doggies, choose Find➪Items with Unknown
Date or Time.
Creating Subcategories and Custom Tags
In Album, calling yourself a tagger is a good thing and won’t result in the City
Graffiti Removal Unit paying you a visit. While you can organize your images
by date, folder, batch, or color and be perfectly content, attaching tags to
your files puts you in the major leagues of organization.
Tags are tidbits of descriptive information that you attach to your files. You
can use tags to group types of images together for easy access. For example
you may want to tag some images with a keyword, such as Family or Places.
By default, Album categorizes tags into four categories of tags: People,
Places, Events, and Other.
When you attach a tag to a file, the tag appears as an icon on your image
thumbnail, as shown in Figure 5-4, and the descriptive keyword displays in
both the Properties and Tags panes and in the Large Thumbnail and Single
Photo views (also shown in Figure 5-4) in the Photo Well.
Tags are powerful for several reasons:
 The additional identifying information makes finding and organizing
your files easier, quicker, and more specific.
 You don’t have to remember the name, date, or location of your files.
 You don’t have to go through the hassle of filing your images in folders
by topic. Album performs the manual labor for you and wrangles the
tagged files from wherever they’re located. To get the lowdown on using
tags to locate your images, check out Chapter 9. The next few sections
take a look at the Tags pane, which manages the world of tags, and tag
categories. You find out how to create subcategories and custom tags.
Tags can be applied not only to photos, but also to video and audio clips and
to creations.
94
Part II: Importing, Organizing, and Managing Photos 

Using the Tags pane
To display the Tags pane, choose View➪Tags. (You also can click the
Organize button in the Shortcuts bar.) The Tags pane is control central for
working with tags. By default, tags fall into four categories of tags: People,
Places, Events, and Other. If you don’t have a large inventory of files, these
default categories may be sufficient. But if you need more specificity, you can
add your own subcategories. And if you need even more identification, you
can create your own custom tags under a category or subcategory.
You can attach one or more tags to a file. For example you may have all of
your family photos tagged with the Family tag. Within that group of family
photos, some may also be tagged with a Christmas tag or a Vacation tag.
This cross-reference allows you to quickly find all family photos or just the
family photos that were taken at Christmas or while on vacation, as shown
in Figure 5-5. And like I mentioned above, these files can be stored in different
folders or on CDs or elsewhere in your system. 
If you make a mistake or decide you aren’t happy with the way you have
tagged and organized your images, you can always edit your tags, or even
delete them and start over.

Chapter 5: Organizing, Categorizing, and Cross-Referencing Photos

The Tags pane displays and manages all of your various tags, including cate-
gory tags, subcategory tags, and the custom tags you create within those two
groups.
As you can see in Figure 5-6, you can use the Tags pane to click buttons
to create, attach, edit, select, and delete tags. You also can choose various
viewing options; for example, you can choose small, medium, or large icons
for your tags, and organize the tags in alphabetical order. Click the triangle
to the left of the tag name to view or hide subcategories or custom tags.
Working with tag categories
As I mention earlier, Album provides you with four default tag categories:
People, Places, Events, and Other, as shown in Figure 5-7. These four categories
cannot be edited or deleted, so learn to love them. You also cannot create a
new tag category.

Part II: Importing, Organizing, and Managing Photos 

But don’t let this fact deter you from taking advantage of the ample organiza-
tional opportunities that the existing tag categories give you. You can create
and organize your own subcategories and custom tags, arranging them in
countless permutations in the default categories.
Although you can attach category tags to files, category tags are best used as
organizational headings for other more descriptive subcategories or custom
tags. For example, the People category doesn’t really tell you a whole lot,
except that human beings are involved. A subcategory of “Family” or
“Friends” is a little more descriptive. And a custom tag of “Joe” is more
descriptive yet. 
Here are a few tips on how you can use the four default categories:
 People: The People category is for tags featuring, well, humans. (If you
consider the family pet worthy of the People category, I’m certainly not
going to argue with you.)

Chapter 5: Organizing, Categorizing, and Cross-Referencing Photos

By default, Album graciously provides you with two subcategories under
People — “Family” and “Friends” (refer to Figure 5-7). But if you prefer,
you can either edit or delete these subcategories.
 Places: You can use the Places category for tags that tell where a photo
was taken. You can create tags based on particular destinations, such as
“Japan,” “New York City,” or “Vacation Cottage, Lake Winnebago.” Or you
may want to add Places tags that represent generic locales, such as “The
Beach” (which contains every picture you ever took of anyone at any
beach) or “School” (which contains every school picture, from kinder-
garten to law school graduation).
You can create custom tags under the subcategories as well. For exam-
ple, if the subcategory is Japan, you could then create custom tags such
as “Mt. Fuji,” “Tokyo,” and “Kyoto” to further identify the images.
 Events: The tags you can create in the Events category are endless. For
example, holidays, birthdays, reunions, graduations, sporting events,
competitions, performances, and vacations are all possible Events sub-
categories. 
Although you could then create separate custom tags for the year of
each event, for example, “First Birthday,” “Second Birthday,” and so on,
you don’t have to. You can just use the timeline to select your desired
date. Then only those tagged photos with that specific date will appear
in the Photo Well. For more on using the timeline, see Chapter 8.
Figure 5-7:
There are
four tag
categories.
98
Part II: Importing, Organizing, and Managing Photos 

 Other: I am sure you have a few files that don’t fit nicely in the
preceding three categories. That’s where the Other category comes
in handy. You can create subcategories for “Work,” “Hobbies,” “Church,”
“Volunteering,” “Barn Raisings,” or plain old “Miscellaneous.” And,
of course, you can have lots of custom tags under those and other 
subcategories.
Using the Favorites and Hidden tags
In addition to the four default categories, Album provides you with two spe-
cial tags — the Favorites and Hidden tags (refer to Figure 5-7). Here’s the
scoop on these tags:
 Favorites: The name of this tag pretty much says it all. Attach this tag to
your most beloved files. The unique thing about the Favorites tag is that
it instantly whittles down your search results with a single click of the
mouse. For example, say you created a tag with your child’s name, as
described earlier in this chapter, in “Working with tag categories.” You
can then tag your favorite pictures of your child with a Favorites tag.
When you want to gather images of your child to create an Album to
send to the grandparents at the holidays, simply select the child’s tag
and the Favorites tag as your search criteria. In an instant, your favorite
images of your child appear in the Photo Well for you to use in your cre-
ation, as shown in Figure 5-8. No more scrolling through screens of
photos. For more on finding images, check out Chapter 8.
99
Chapter 5: Organizing, Categorizing, and Cross-Referencing Photos
Organizing family photos
You may want to create custom tags under the
Family or Friends category with the specific
names of family members or friends. Here’s an
example scenario to get your organizational
juices flowing.
Say you attach the Family tag to all family mem-
bers. Makes sense, right? Well, why not have
custom tags called “Dad” and “Mom” that you
attach to all photos with either Dad or Mom in
them? If you have photos of dad and mom
together, you can attach both the “Mom” and
“Dad” tags to those photos. 
Here’s how this organization can really help you
down the line. When you’re planning mom and
dad’s golden wedding anniversary party, you
will be able to locate any photos of them both
within micro seconds. A few more micro sec-
onds and you could create an eCard invitation
to the anniversary party and e-mail it to all of the
guests. No doubt, you will earn family hero
status for that.

 Hidden: If you have files you don’t want to see or sort through, but that
you still want to keep, attach the Hidden tag to them. Files that you
attach Hidden tags to only appear in the Photo Well when you perform a
search with the Hidden tag as a search criteria.
Examples of candidates for the Hidden tag may be those mediocre shots
that you want to keep as backups, or photos that are similar but not
exact (different poses of a person). Or maybe you have some files that
are embarrassing, like those video clips you’ve considered sending to
“America’s Funniest Videos.”
The Hidden tag can be attached in addition to other tags. But unlike the
Favorites tag, it does not carry a preference in searches. For example, if
you use Family and Hidden as your two search criteria, your results will
show all photos with the Family tag, including images that have been
tagged as Hidden. Your search results will not show just those Family
tagged images that are also tagged with Hidden. 
After attaching a Hidden tag to a photo, you still see the photo in the Photo
Well until you refresh the Photo Well. You refresh the Photo Well by choosing
View➪Refresh or by pressing F5. Or you can select a different view of the
Photo Well by using the View buttons in the Options bar.

Creating tag subcategories 
Because Album gives you only four main categories and doesn’t allow you to
add any more, you have to rely on creating subcategories to help further iden-
tify, organize, and find your files. Here’s how to create new subcategories:
1. Choose Tag➪New Sub-Category.
You also can right-click a tag category and choose Create a New Sub-
Category from the context-sensitive menu.
The Create New Sub-Category dialog box appears.
2. Type the name of your subcategory.
For example, type Clowns if you have a large collection of clown pho-
tographs that you’d like to group together.
3. Choose the category under which you would like to place your subcat-
egory from the Category pop-up menu, shown in Figure 5-9.
For example, if the clowns are members of your family, choose Family.
4. Click OK.
Your new subcategory now appears in the Tags pane. 
The icon of a subcategory tag always appears as a plain tag. It cannot
display a photo like a custom tag can. (See the next section for more on
creating custom tags.)
Creating custom tags
The most definitive kind of tag is one that you create to fit the photos you
have in your repertoire. Tags that you create with specific, personalized
descriptions help to categorize and organize your inventory of files into
groups that have a common element and allow you to locate and gather
them on your system quickly and efficiently.
Figure 5-9:

gories helps

101
Chapter 5: Organizing, Categorizing, and Cross-Referencing Photos

You can use custom tags in addition to, or in lieu of, subcategorical tags.
What counts is that the tags are useful and meaningful to you and that they
enable you to be as organized — and as productive — as possible. 
To create a custom tag, follow these steps:
1. Click the Create New Tag button in the Tags pane.
You also can choose Tag➪New Tag. Or you can right-click a category or
subcategory tag and choose Create New Tag from the context-sensitive
menu.
The Tag Icon Editor dialog box appears.
2. From the pop-up menu, choose the Category or Subcategory under
which you want the tag to be organized.
For example, you can choose the Events category.
You also can choose New Sub-Category from the pop-up menu to create
a subcategory for this custom tag.
3. Type the name of the custom tag in the Tag text box.
For example, type Vacation 2003.
4. Type a note if you wish to provide more descriptive information
regarding the tag.
For example, if your tag is “Vacation 2003,” you may want to add a note
that says, “Summer family vacation in Washington, D.C., June 2003.”
5. Click OK to close the dialog box. 
You won’t see a photograph on the tag icon when you first create it.
Instead, you see a question mark, as shown in Figure 5-10. When you
attach the tag to your files, the first file in the Photo Well supplies the
thumbnail photo for the icon. You also can edit the icon photo if you
want. See the section “Modifying and deleting tags” later in this chapter. 
Using folders to create
subcategories and tags
If you have your music CDs alphabetized and you feel faint if someone
returns a CD out of that alpha order, you probably already have your digital
image files grouped in appropriately named folders on your hard drive.
You can extend your tagging system to your pre-existing folder structure by
using the Folder Location command to display your files and then create tags. 
102
Part II: Importing, Organizing, and Managing Photos 

Here’s how to apply tags to an entire folder of images in one fell swoop:
1. Choose View➪Arrangement➪Folder Location.
You also can choose Folder Location by using the Photo Well
Arrangement button in the Options bar. For more on viewing files, see
Chapter 9.
Your files are then displayed in the Photo Well by the folder where they
reside. The folder’s pathname appears above the thumbnails, as shown
in Figure 5-11.
2. Scroll through the Photo Well until you see the folder of images you
want.
3. Using the Tags pane, create the tag for your folder. Or you also can
create a subcategory by choosing Tag➪New Sub-Category.
Details on how to do either are described above in the sections
“Creating tag subcategories” and “Creating custom tags.”
4. Click the folder pathname in the Photo Well to select all the images in
that folder.
5. Click the Attach button in the Tags pane.
The tag is now attached to all the images in that folder. See the next sec-
tion for more on attaching tags.

Attaching, Editing, and Deleting Tags
Coming up with really descriptive tags is the hardest thing about tagging.
Attaching, editing and removing the tags once they are created is a cinch. In
the next few sections, you find out how to attach, edit, and remove the tags.
Attaching tags to photos
Attaching tags is a no-brainer. You can drag a tag from the Tags pane onto a
file or select the file in the Photo Well and click the Attach Selected Tag(s) to
Selected Photo(s) button in the Tags pane. 
Here are the specific steps for attaching tags:
1. Select your desired photo(s) in the Photo Well.
2. In the Tags pane, select the tag you want to attach to those files.
If you want to select more than one tag, Ctrl+click to select multiple tags.

Part II: Importing, Organizing, and Managing Photos 

3. Click the Attach Selected Tag(s) to Selected Photo(s) button in the
Tags pane.
Or you can use one of these methods:
• Drag the tags from the Tags pane onto the photo (or onto any one
of the multiple photos) in the Photo Well.
• Choose Tag➪Attach (1) Selected Tag. If you have more than one,
the command will read (2) or (3) and so on.
The tag is now attached to the photo(s). If this is the first time you have
attached the tag to a photo, the photo becomes the icon for that tag. If
you select multiple photos, the first photo in the Photo Well becomes
the icon for that tag.
You also can select your photo(s) in the Photo Well and then choose
Tag➪Attach Tag. Select your desired tag from the sub-menu. However, this
method only allows you to select one tag at a time.
In the Small and Medium Thumbnail views, to identify which tags are
attached to a file, position your mouse over the tag icon on the thumbnail
in the Photo Well. The name of the tag displays on-screen.
Removing tags
The process of removing tags is easy and pain-free. Removing a tag from a file
is not the same thing as deleting the tag category altogether. When you remove
a tag, you merely detach the categorization from that particular file or files.
When you delete a tag, you remove the tag entirely from your catalog.
To remove a tag, you can be in any of the views — the Single Photo, Small,
Medium, or Large Thumbnail view. Right-click a tag and choose Remove Tag
from the context-sensitive menu. For more on viewing your files, see Chapter 9.
If you want to remove tags from multiple photos, select your desired photos
in the Photo Well. Then right-click any of the selected photo thumbnails and
choose Remove Tag from Selected Items from the context-sensitive menu that
appears. Choose the tags you wish to remove from the sub-menus. You also
can choose Tag➪Remove Tag from Selected Items and choose the tags from
the sub-menu.
Modifying and deleting tags
After you create a tag or two, you may decide that what you came up with
wasn’t that descriptive after all and needs a little refining. Or maybe you want
to add a note to an existing tag or change the photo that is being used for the
105
Chapter 5: Organizing, Categorizing, and Cross-Referencing Photos

tag icon. You may just want to delete the darn tag altogether. No problem.
Just remember you can’t touch the four main tag categories; nor can you
modify or delete the Favorites or Hidden tag.
Here’s how to modify your tags:
1. Select the tag in the Tags pane and choose Tag➪Edited Selected Tag.
You also can click the Edit button at the top of the Tags pane. Or you can
right-click your chosen tag and choose Edit Tag from the context-sensitive
menu that appears. The name of your tag appears in the Edit command.
The Tag Icon Editor dialog box appears.
2. Edit the tag information to your heart’s desire.
• To modify the category: Choose a category or subcategory from
the Category pop-up menu. If you choose New Sub-Category, you
will get the Create New Sub-Category dialog box where you can
enter your information.
• To modify the tag’s name: Type the new name in the Tag Name
text box.
• To add or change the note: Type in the Notes text box.
• To change the photo being used for the tag icon: Click the Edit
Icon button, shown in Figure 5-12. Click the Find button to open the
Select Icon dialog box. Scroll through all of the images that use that
tag, select the image you want, and click OK.
You also can click the arrows to the left and right of the Find
button to browse through the tagged images and select the one
you want. Adjust the cropping marquee (the moving dashed line)
by dragging the corner handles (your mouse icon changes to a
double-headed arrow) to frame the photo to your liking. To move
the entire marquee, place your cursor inside the marquee and
drag. Click OK. For more on cropping, see Chapter 11.
3. When you’re done modifying the tag, click OK in the Tag Icon Editor
dialog box.
If you would just rather delete a tag and start fresh, you can do so. Select the
tag in the Tags pane and click the Deleted Selected Tag button. Or you can
choose Tag➪Delete Selected Tag. 
You can’t delete more than one tag at a time.
106
Part II: Importing, Organizing, and Managing Photos 

When deleting tags, don’t press the Delete key on your keyboard. Album will
try and delete actual photos. A warning will appear on-screen telling you that
you need to select the photos first, however, so you have a chance to cancel
the command.

I
f you have been poking around in Album a bit, I am sure you have gotten
the feeling that this program loves to provide you with data. Without trying
too hard, you can find all kinds of data about your images, from where they
originated, to when they came into existence, what you did with them, and
where they are currently stored. Album is like a digital private detective when
it comes to identifying your files.
You can contribute to that profiling of your images by adding additional infor-
mation. Album lets you give descriptive names to your files and add captions,
notes and audio captions. You’ll find many opportunities to add descriptive
tidbits. For example, you can add data directly in your images, in creations,
galleries, and contact sheets. Captions and notes help you not only identify
and find your images, but also to enhance your presentations. Use them in a
fun and creative way, and they can make your images and creations really
come to life.
You also can use captions, notes and annotations as a basis to search for
your files. For details on how, check out Chapter 8.
Renaming Your Photos
As wonderful as digital cameras are, their naming conventions leave a little
to be desired. I mean DSCN0423.jpg really doesn’t tell you much about the

image. And if you have traditional images that have been converted from film
to a Photo CD you also have funky names like 834044.pcd or something
equally useless when all you want is to find a picture of Roger, your pet
cockatiel.
Although it isn’t mandatory to rename your files for Album to find and manage
them, you may want to do so in order to have the easily identifiable to you.
Renaming is a snap in Album. You can rename a single file or a group of files
in one fell swoop. The following sections give you the skinny.
Renaming a single file
To rename a single file, select your desired item in the Photo Well and choose
one of these two options:
1. Choose File➪Rename.
The Rename dialog box (shown in Figure 6-1) appears.
2. Type a name in the New Name text box and click OK.
Or
1. Choose View➪Properties to display the Properties pane.
You also can click the Show Properties button in the Options bar
beneath the Photo Well.
2. Enter a new name in the File Name text box.
If the photo has been edited, it will say Edited File Name.
If you change your mind, you can undo by pressing Ctrl+Z immediately after
renaming.
Renaming a group of files
Your files will be batch-renamed. This means that after you assign something
called a common base name, each file gets that base name along with a
numeric suffix. For example, if you assign the common base name Europe,
the first photo is named Europe-1, the next one Europe-2, and so on. Note
that Album renames the files according to the order in which they appear in
the Photo Well.
If you batch rename an edited or duplicated photo, it loses its “_edited”
or “_copy” suffix. The name of the original file remains undisturbed.
110
Part II: Importing, Organizing, and Managing Photos 

And if, by chance, you already had an existing file with a batch rename name
(say that five times fast), Album adds an additional suffix. For example, if a
filename Europe-1 is already in your catalog, the renamed file is Europe-1-1.
To rename a group of files, follow these steps:
1. Select your desired files in the Photo Well.
Ctrl+clicking allows you to select both adjacent and nonadjacent items.
2. Choose File➪Rename.
3. Enter a name in the Common Base Name text box, shown in
Figure 6-2, and click OK.

Chapter 6: Giving Your Photos a Better Identity

Using Captions with Your Images
There are utilitarian reasons for adding captions to your photos. Captions
provide descriptions of the image, such as who is in the image, who took the
image, where and when the image was taken, and so on. Captions also are great
if you want to add a personal touch to your images and to preserve a memo-
rable occasion. Add a caption with some humor or sentimentality. You are lim-
ited to 63 characters, so short and sweet is the ticket. You can add a caption
when you first import your images or at any time thereafter.
Adding a caption
You also can use captions in creations, such as eCards, Web and 3D
Atmosphere galleries, calendars, photo books, video CDs, slide shows,
instant slide shows, and albums.
If you plan to use captions in a creation, you have to add the captions before
you make your creation. If you don’t, no captions will appear with your images.
(For more on making creations, see Chapter 18.) Also, when you print a con-
tact sheet, you can choose to include captions. But again, the captions must
be added before you print the sheet.
Here’s how to add captions to your files:
1. Select a file and double-click the thumbnail to open the image in
Single Photo view in the Photo Well.
Or you can choose View➪Properties to display the Properties pane.
Then select a thumbnail in the Photo Well.
2. Enter your caption in the Caption text box, as shown in Figure 6-3.
When you duplicate a photo, you also duplicate any captions, notes, and tags
attached to that image. Be sure to apply all those extras before you duplicate
your image to save time. For more on duplicating photos, see Chapter 7.
Editing and deleting captions
Editing or deleting a caption is a no-brainer. Use one of these methods:
 Select the image in the Photo Well, and in the Properties pane, highlight
the text in the Caption text box and retype your caption. To delete the
text, simply highlight the text and press the Delete key.
112
Part II: Importing, Organizing, and Managing Photos 

 Double-click the image, and in the Single Photo view, edit or delete the
text in the Caption text box below the image.
 Select one or more images and choose Edit➪Clear Caption for a single
image or Edit➪Clear Captions of Selected Items to delete several cap-
tions at a time.
Adding Notes to Photos
The Notes function in Album is great for identifying your photos and adding
information related to the images. You can have up to 1,023 characters in a
note. Or on the more practical side, you could enter information such as the
lighting conditions or camera settings (that aren’t part of the embedded
metadata) you used to capture the image.
If you have images that represent unforgettable events, try adding a personal
recollection or short story about the image in the form of a note.

Chapter 6: Giving Your Photos a Better Identity

To add a note to an image, follow these short steps:
1. Choose View➪Properties to display the Properties pane.
You also can click the Show Properties button in the Options bar.
2. Select your desired image in the Photo Well.
3. Enter your text in the Notes text box in the Properties pane, as shown
in Figure 6-4.
Unlike captions, you can only view your notes on-screen. You can’t print
them along with your images. You also can’t include notes in your creations.
However, like captions, you can search for your images based on keywords in
your notes.
Adding Audio Captions 
If you have a microphone attached to your computer, you can easily add
audio captions to your files. You can add them in addition to, or in lieu of,
written captions and notes.
Like other kinds of captions, you can use audio captions to provide practical
information such as descriptions (who took the picture, what the picture is
of, and when and where it was taken). Or you can use them to preserve a
memory with sound.

2. Choose View➪Properties to display the Properties pane.
Or click the Show Properties button in the Options bar under the Photo
Well.
3. Click the Record Audio Caption button in the Properties pane, shown
in Figure 6-5.
The audio window, also shown in Figure 6-5 appears.
4. Click the Record button in the audio window and begin speaking into
your microphone.
If you have an existing audio clip you want to use as your audio caption,
choose File➪Browse from the audio window menu, locate your file and
click Open. The audio clip is imported into your audio window. Note the
filename of the audio clip at the top of the audio window.

5. Click the Record or Stop button when you’re done recording your
audio caption.
6. Click the Play button to listen to your audio caption. If you want to do
a second take, click the Record button again.
7. Click the Close button to close the audio window.
You also can choose File➪Close from the audio window menu. This action
automatically saves the audio caption and attaches it to your photo.
Here’s some useful information for handling your audio captions:
 Playing an audio caption: You can play captions in a couple of ways:
• Double-click the image thumbnail to display the photo in the Single
Photo view. Click the Play Audio Caption button (which looks like a
mini speaker icon), located immediately to the right of the written
Caption text box.
• Select your photo and click the Record Audio caption button in the
Properties pane.
In either case, the audio window appears. Click the Play button to hear
the caption. Close the window when you’re done.
 Editing an existing audio caption: Repeat all of the steps above.
 Deleting an audio caption: Follow Steps 1 through 3 above. Then
choose Edit➪Clear to delete the audio caption from the image.
Viewing Information About a Photo
Earlier in this chapter I showed you how to add captions, notes, and audio
captions. I referred to the Properties pane as one vehicle to use when adding
these identifiers. But I didn’t give the Properties pane its full due. In addition
to displaying your captions and notes, the Properties pane lets you see every-
thing you’ve done with the file, from when and where it came from to whom
you shared it with and more.
Here’s how to use the Properties pane to find all the vital statistics about
your files:
1. Select your desired photo in the Photo Well.
2. Choose View➪Properties to bring up the Properties pane.
You also can right-click and choose Properties from the context-
sensitive menu or click the Show Properties button in the Options bar.
116
Part II: Importing, Organizing, and Managing Photos 

You immediately see any caption attached to the image, the filename,
the location of the file, the size of the file, and the date and time of the file.
3. To play an audio annotation, click the audio button (the speaker icon),
and click the Play button in the audio window.
4. Click the Complete Metadata button (the “i” icon), if it is available, to
see all EXIF (Exchangeable Image File) data in a separate window,
shown in Figure 6-6.
Metadata is extra information that some software programs or digital
cameras store as part of the image’s file format.
Metadata includes the caption (if there is one), the camera’s make
and model, resolution, and other data. EXIF is a variation of the JPEG file
format (see Chapter 3 for more on formats) and contains information such
as your camera’s aperture, shutter speed, exposure and other settings.

Chapter 6: Giving Your Photos a Better Identity

5. Choose one of the following options from the pop-up menu, shown in
Figure 6-7: 
• Brief Metadata: This option gives you an abbreviated version of
the Complete Metadata profile.
• History: This setting shows you the date a photo was imported
and modified, where you imported it from, any creations that use
the image, when and how it was shared, and if and when it was
printed. I bet you didn’t know your images were under surveil-
lance, did you?
• Tags: Selecting this option displays any tags attached to the file.
For more on tags, check out Chapter 5.
You also can view information about a file by double-clicking the image
thumbnail in the Photo Well to display the image in a Single Photo view.
Make sure the Show Dates option is checked in the Options bar (or choose
View➪Show Dates and Tag). You can then see the caption, the file’s location,
the size of the photo, any attached tags, and the date and time the photo was
taken (see Figure 6-8). You also can listen to an audio caption if one exists.

In This Chapter

T
he more you use Album, the more you’ll discover its exceptional ability to
gather data about your files, store that information, and update it when
directed to. Album is also excellent in its ability to track the uses, or what is
referred to as the history, of the file (see Chapter 8). For example, with
Album’s tracking system, you can see just what you’ve done with an image
and when you did it. And last, but not least, Album provides a great way to
allow you to identify your files by using tags (Chapter 5), captions, and notes
(Chapter 6). All of this file data, along with the history, tags, captions, and
notes, gives Album a wealth of information to help identify, organize, and
modify your files.
Organizing Files into Catalogs
When you launch Album and import files — photos, video clips and audio
clips — a catalog is automatically and invisibly created. You don’t have to lift
a finger.
A catalog is a database of information that keeps track of everything about
your files — file formats, locations of files, dates and times, edits, tags, cap-
tions, and so forth. This vital data is linked to your files (the important word
being linked).

When data about a file is linked to a catalog, that means that although the
catalog contains this information about your files, it doesn’t contain the actual
photos, video, or audio clips themselves. Instead, the catalog references the
files on your computer (or external media like CDs and DVDs) and displays a
thumbnail in the Photo Well. Adobe uses the analogy of a catalog being like a
phone book. The catalog contains important information about people and
businesses, but not the actual people and businesses themselves.
Here is a laundry list of the info that the catalog stores about your files:
 The path and filename of the photo, video clip, or audio clip.
 The path and filename of any audio file attached to a photo (such as an
audio caption) or creation (such as background music).
 If the original file is being stored offline (on a CD, DVD, or external media
such as a Zip disk), the catalog stores the path, filename, and volume
name of the original, full-resolution file.
 If a file has been edited, the catalog stores the path and filename of the
original, unedited file.
 If you imported a batch of files from a digital camera or scanner, the cat-
alog stores the name of the camera or scanner.
 Any captions, notes, or tags that you’ve added to a photo.
 The media type of the file and whether it’s a photo, video clip, audio
clip, or creation.
 The date and time the photo was taken.
 The file’s history, such as if it was e-mailed, shared online, printed,
exported, sent to an online service provider, used in a creation, or Web
or Atmosphere gallery.
 Edits, such as contrast and color adjustments, that have been applied to
the image.
 The pixel dimensions of photos and video clips.
 Details on creation settings, such as the type of creation, selected style,
whether you’ve included captions and page numbers, transitions, and
so on.
Creating new catalogs 
Like me, you may be perfectly content to live with a single catalog. With all
the great organizational tools Album provides, you can have your entire
inventory of photos and clips neatly identified and categorized. But, just in
case you want to, Album allows you to create additional catalogs.
122
Part II: Importing, Organizing, and Managing Photos 

For example, maybe you don’t want to mix business with pleasure and feel
better if your business and personal files reside in two separate catalogs. Or,
if you share a computer with the family, you may want your kids to have their
own catalogs, especially if they want to use their own tagging system. Why
clutter your Tags pane with tags like “Lollapalooza Mosh Pit?” 
If you decide to go the multiple catalog route, be warned that you can’t move
photos or tags between catalogs. You also cannot search across more than
one catalog at a time. For more on locating files, see Chapter 8.
Here’s how to create a new catalog:
1. Choose File➪Catalog.
The Catalog dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 7-1. Note that if you
want Album to import free music files (these files are installed when you
install Album) into your new catalog, select the check box at the bottom
of the dialog box.
2. Click the New button.
The New Catalog dialog box appears.
3. Select a location for the catalog or use the default Catalogs folder,
shown in Figure 7-2.
I recommend using the default Catalogs folder. You will remember
where it’s stored because it simply makes sense to store a catalog in the
Catalogs folder. However, if you have a really large catalog and need to
store it on a separate hard drive, you can do so.
If you want to change the default folder to any catalog you create, check
out the next section “Changing the default catalog folder.”

4. Enter a name for the catalog in the File Name text box and make sure
the Save as type says Photoshop Album Catalogs (*.psa).
5. Click Save.
Changing the default catalog folder
To establish a different default folder to any catalog you create, follow these
steps:
1. Choose Edit➪Preferences.
2. In the General pane of the Preferences dialog box, click the Browse
button for the Save Catalogs In section, shown in Figure 7-3.
The Browse for Folder dialog box appears.
3. Either select an existing folder or create a new folder in your desired
location. Click OK.
If you change your mind or made a mistake, simply click the Restore
Default Settings button to get back to the original folder pathname.
4. Click OK to exit the Preferences.
The next time you create a new catalog, your new default folder will
appear in the New Catalog dialog box.

124
Part II: Importing, Organizing, and Managing Photos 

Copying catalogs
Instead of creating a new catalog from scratch, you can create one by making
a copy of your existing catalog. For example, say you currently have personal
and work files in one catalog. You can make a copy of your existing catalog,
rename it Business, and then remove your personal files, while leaving your
work files intact.
Or you may want to give a copy of your catalog to someone who admires
your elaborate, yet efficient tagging system and wants to use it for organizing
his or her own catalog. You shouldn’t have to reinvent the wheel if you want
your catalog like someone else’s, right? 
Here’s how to copy a catalog:
1. Choose File➪Catalog.
2. In the Catalog dialog box that appears, click the Save As button.
3. Keep the new catalog in the default folder or choose a new location
and folder.
4. Give your new catalog a name in the File Name text box.
5. Click Save.
Your new catalog opens in Album, and your old one closes.
Figure 7-3:
Album

the default
folder you
use to

catalogs.
125
Chapter 7: Managing Your Photos

Although the catalog has been copied, the physical files (photos, video clips,
audio clips, and creations) have not been duplicated. The new catalog is
linked to the same files as the original catalog. This is fine if the copied cata-
log is for you on your system. But if you are giving the catalog to a friend or
colleague to use on another computer and you don’t also give your friend
or colleague the links (the actual photo, video, audio, and creation files), a
“file missing” icon appears on the thumbnail as soon as your friend tries to
view the images in the Photo Well. If your colleague doesn’t want your files
to begin with, no biggie. He or she can just remove the files from the catalog
(see the section coming up in a minute). But your friend needs copies of the
files as well as the catalog. Of course, your friend will have to reconnect to
those files because the file location has been moved. For more on reconnect-
ing to files, see “Reconnecting to missing files,” later in this chapter.
Opening catalogs
If you have multiple catalogs, you can open a different catalog from within
Album. Here’s how:
1. Choose File➪Catalog and click the Open button in the Catalog
dialog box.
2. Select your catalog.
If your catalog is stored in a location other than the default folder, navi-
gate to that folder.
3. Click Open.
Your current catalog closes to accommodate opening another one. Album
only allows you to work in one catalog at a time.
Removing items from the catalog 
If you don’t want a file to show up in your catalog, you can remove it without
deleting the original file. You are simply removing the link to the photo, video
clip, or audio clip. You also can remove creations.
Here’s the scoop on removing a file from your catalog:
1. Select one or more files in the Photo Well.
2. Choose either Edit➪Delete from Catalog (for a single file) or Delete
Selected Items from Catalog (multiple files).
The Confirm Deletion from Catalog dialog box appears, as shown in
Figure 7-4.
126
Part II: Importing, Organizing, and Managing Photos 

3. If you want to delete the actual file in addition to the link, select the
Also Delete Selected Item(s) from the Hard Disk check box.
4. Click OK.
Keeping Your Catalog Safe and Sound
After you’ve painstakingly imported, identified, and organized your files,
you definitely want to protect them. Fortunately, you don’t need to hire a
body guard to watch over your catalog; you can ensure its safety by using
the tools in Album along with a blank CD or DVD or additional hard drive.
Using Album’s Backup command and burning your catalog and all associated
files (both original and edited versions) onto a CD or DVD keeps them safely
stored in a location other than your hard drive. You also can back up your
catalog and files to another drive, for example, a drive that you have dedicated
for data storage. Although you may never need to use a backup, you’ll be so
very thankful if the unimaginable does occur. Recovering or restoring a cata-
log is a piece of cake if you have a backup handy.
Make a habit of burning a backup once a month or so, or after you have
imported a significant number of files or have performed a major tagging
reorganization. The hard-core computer troubleshooting experts say that
you should store those backup CDs and DVDs offsite, in another location
other than where your computer resides. That way if a fire, earthquake, or
other act of Mother Nature destroys your possessions, you’ll be covered.
Backing up your catalog
Album’s Backup command makes it quick and easy to back up your catalog
and all the linked files — photos, video clips, and audio clips.

Chapter 7: Managing Your Photos

You can back up the catalog to another hard drive or external media such
as a Zip disk, Jaz disk, CD, or DVD. The following steps give you all you need
to know:
1. Choose File➪Backup.
The Missing Files Check Before Backup dialog box appears, as shown in
Figure 7-5. This dialog box warns you that if you have moved the loca-
tion of your files since you’ve imported them that Album may not be
able to find them and therefore not include them in the backup.
Album backs up only your current catalog. If you have multiple catalogs,
be sure to perform separate backups for all of them.
2. Click the Reconnect button in the dialog box.
In the Reconnect Missing Files dialog box, shown in Figure 7-6, a list of
your missing files appears on the left, along with the file’s thumbnail. If
you don’t have any missing files, proceed to Step 4.
3. Select a file and then locate the file’s new location by clicking the
Browse button on the right side of the dialog box. If it is a match,
click the Reconnect button. Repeat this step until all files have been
reconnected.
You also can view a thumbnail of the file you have located.
The reconnected files are removed from the Missing Files list.
4. Click the Close button in the dialog box.
The Backup dialog box appears.
5. Select the hard drive or external media to which you want to back up
your catalog.
Choose Burn onto a CD or DVD Disc to burn your backup catalog to a
writeable CD or DVD. Or choose Specify Backup Drive and then choose
Figure 7-5:
Be sure to
reconnect
any files you
have moved
so they will
be backed
up properly.
128
Part II: Importing, Organizing, and Managing Photos 

the particular drive onto which you would like your backup. If you’re
backing up the files to external removable media such as a Zip or Jaz
disk, choose the letter of the Zip or Jaz drive.
6. Select the type of backup you want.
Choose Full Backup to create a copy of the catalog, along with all the
associated, linked files — photos, video clips, and audio clips. Choose
Incremental Backup to make a copy of the catalog and any new or modi-
fied files since the last full or incremental backup.
7. Click OK.
8. If you selected Burn onto a CD or DVD Disc, follow the instructions
presented to you. If you selected Specify Backup Drive, navigate to the
specific location on your hard drive or external media you want your
backup to reside (see Figure 7-7). You can, of course, also create a
brand spanking new folder as well.
If you’re performing an incremental backup, insert the media or locate
the hard drive that has your last backup and follow the instructions pre-
sented to you on-screen. If your backup is too large, Album gives you a
gentle heads up, and you can either insert new media or locate another
hard drive if available.
Album informs you when the backup has been completed. That’s it. Label
your backup and keep it in a safe location. You are officially backed up
and ready for computer crashes and any other unfortunate events.

Chapter 7: Managing Your Photos

Recovering and restoring your catalog
Say the unfortunate does happen. The first thing you may want to try before
you break out your backup disk is to recover the catalog. If that doesn’t work,
you can restore the catalog by using your backup copy.
Using the Recover command
If you launch Album and you get a nasty message that says you have a prob-
lem with your catalog, don’t call your computer the first foul word that pops
into your head. At least not yet. Your catalog could have been damaged by a
power outage or some other technical gremlin, but is possibly still salvage-
able. The Recover command tries its best to repair the catalog. As a bonus,
the command also removes any unused space, thereby getting your catalog
lean and mean.
Here’s how to recover and repair a catalog:
1. Choose File➪Catalog.
2. Click the Recover button in the Catalog dialog box.
The Recover Catalog dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 7-8.
3. Click OK.
Figure 7-7:
Specify the
location you
want your
backup
catalog and
files to live.
130
Part II: Importing, Organizing, and Managing Photos 

If the catalog was recovered and repaired successfully, a dialog box
appears, also shown in Figure 7-8.
If you get another nasty message instead, you might want to proceed to
the next section.
Restoring your catalog 
If your catalog couldn’t be recovered, you need to restore it instead. You may
also want to restore your catalog to a previously saved version if you inadver-
tently deleted some files or did something equally as irritating. And finally, you
also can use the Restore command to move your catalog and files to another
computer. The Restore command installs the backup copy of your catalog,
along with all the associated, linked files — photos, video clips and audio clips.
Follow these steps to restore your catalog and all its files:
1. Insert your backup media (CD, DVD, or other external media).
If you had to back up your catalog and files onto more than one disk,
Album prompts you to insert the additional disk(s). Just follow the
instructions on-screen. If you made your backup to an external hard
drive, make sure it is connected to your computer.
2. Choose File➪Restore.
The Restore dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 7-9.
3. Choose Restore from CD or DVD or Restore from hard disk or other
storage volume.
4. Select the backup copy of your catalog in the list and click the Restore
button.
Your backup is installed, and your catalog is restored and back to normal.

Chapter 7: Managing Your Photos

Archiving Your Photos 
There may be instances when you don’t want to back up a catalog, but you
want to make a copy of just the files themselves. The Archive command is the
ticket. This command allows you to make a copy of your files (photos, video
clips, and audio clips) and burn them onto a CD or DVD.
You might use the Archive command when you want to give a family member
or friend a copy of a bunch of photos for him to use as he pleases, for exam-
ple, to print or make his own creations. This is especially handy if the files
are high resolution and large, and you don’t want to (or can’t) e-mail them.
For more on resolution, see Chapter 3.
Or you may want to free up your hard drive by archiving the high-resolution
originals of your photos onto a CD or DVD. Remember that Album lets you
store your physical files offline (on media) as well as on your system. The
Archive command actually has an offline option where the master files are
burned to a CD or DVD, and a low-resolution proxy is saved to your hard
drive. The master files are then deleted from your hard drive. The files still
appear in the Photo Well, but now they have a CD icon on their thumbnails.
If you try and make a creation or print an image whose master is offline,
Album politely prompts you to insert the CD or DVD with that master.
Here’s how to archive your files:
1. From the Photo Well, select the items you wish to archive.
If you don’t select any items, all files in your catalog will be archived.
Note that you cannot archive creations. If they are among the items
selected, they will be listed in the “Items Not Archived” dialog box.
2. Choose File➪Archive.
3. Name your archive in the Archive Set Name text box.
Figure 7-9:
Restore
your catalog
from your
backup
copy if
things have
gone awry.
132
Part II: Importing, Organizing, and Managing Photos 

4. If you want to delete the high-resolution photos from your hard drive
after the archiving is done, select the Move items offline option.
You cannot use this option for video clips and audio clips.
5. Select the CD or DVD drive where you’re burning the archive and
click OK.
Album asks if you really want the items removed permanently from your
computer or forever hold your peace.
6. Click Yes or Chicken Out (er, No).
Album does a quick analysis and lets you know how many disks are
required for the archive. Album then directs you to insert a CD or DVD.
7. Click the Burn button.
As in most CD- or DVD-burning sessions, you have the option of verifying
the disk. Even though it takes a couple additional minutes, I highly recom-
mend verifying. Once in awhile the burning process hiccups, and the CD
or DVD isn’t burned properly. You don’t want to find that out after you have
mailed the media to your family member or friend or when you need the
high-resolution image to make a print and the disk is corrupted, especially
if you deleted the high-resolution original from your hard drive.
Working with Different
Versions of Photos
Album is very methodical when it comes to managing various versions
of photos — originals, edited images, duplicates, and so on — giving them
descriptive names to identify whether they are edited or copied versions.
The program also errs on the cautious side by retaining the original in case
you want to revert back to it. But as with any other program, fully under-
standing how Album manages all of your files and their various iterations
can help you avoid confusion and prevent management mishaps.
Naming edited files
When you edit a photo — for example, when using the Fix Photo dialog
box — any changes you make are applied to a copy of the file, not to the 
original. Album provides a new name for the edited version. This little trick
can be annoying if you’ve done a lot of correction and retouching and would
rather just dump the original. But don’t worry; you can dump the original as
well, as I explain in the upcoming section, “Replacing an original photo with
an edited version.”
133
Chapter 7: Managing Your Photos

If the format of the edited file is JPEG, PNG, TIFF, or PSD, Album adds
the word “_edited” to the filename. For example, my original is called 
statueofliberty.jpg, and the edited version is called statueofliberty_
edited.jpg, as shown in Figure 7-10. For more on file formats, see Chapter 3.
If your file is in a format that Album can’t work with, you can save the edited
version in one of the approved formats listed above. Album also adds
“_edited” to the original name.
Reverting to an original photo
If you decide later that it isn’t really a good idea to submit the photo of your
boss with his head cropped off to the company newsletter, you can always
return to the original, unadulterated version of the image. Here’s how:
1. Select one or more images in the Photo Well.
2. If you chose only one image, choose Edit➪Revert to Original. If you
selected multiple photos, choose Edit➪Revert Selected Photos to
Original.
You also can right-click and choose the commands from the context-
sensitive menu.
Replacing an original photo
with an edited version
Say you performed digital magic on your original image and want the edited
version to forever replace the mediocre original. Album allows you to make
this switch, but make sure you’re positive that you want to make the switch
Figure 7-10:
Album
retains your
original 
file and
appends 
the name 
for edited
versions.
134
Part II: Importing, Organizing, and Managing Photos 

yourself, because after the original is replaced with the edited file, the origi-
nal is gone forever. And, with the exception of rotating, you can’t undo any
changes made in the editing process.
If disk space, not image quality, is the issue and you want to delete the origi-
nal to save room, archive your files first so that you have a copy if you should
ever need it (see the section on archiving in this chapter).
Follow these steps to replace your original photo with the edited version:
1. Select one or more photos in the Photo Well.
2. If you selected a single image, choose Edit➪Replace Original with
Edited. If you selected multiple images, choose Edit➪Replace Selected
Originals with Edited.
You also can right-click and choose the commands from the context-
sensitive menu.
Duplicating photos 
The Duplicate command is pretty self-explanatory — it creates a copy of your
image. The power to duplicate photos can come in handy if you want one or
more copies to edit differently. For example, you may want to crop an image a
couple different ways — one version that only shows a single person and
another that shows the group shot. Or maybe you want a copy that is color
corrected and another copy that is desaturated so it appears as a black-and-
white image. For more on editing photos, see Chapters 11 and 12.
To duplicate a photo, follow these steps:
1. Select the photo in the Photo Well.
You can only duplicate one file at a time.
2. Choose Edit➪Duplicate Item.
You also can right-click and choose Duplicate Item from the context-
sensitive menu.
The duplicated photo is a new file, with the word “-copy” appended to the
name. It is also a new catalog entry. The duplicate appears near the origi-
nal in the Photo Well. It is, however, no longer linked to the original photo.
The Duplicate Item command copies both the original file of the photo
and, if there is one, the edited version as well. For example, I duplicated
my “Europe-01.jpg” file, but as you can see in Figure 7-11, it also dupli-
cated my “Europe-01_edited.jpg” file as well.
135
Chapter 7: Managing Your Photos

Any tags, captions, and notes attached to the original are duplicated
with the file. So be sure and do all your tagging and caption/note writing
before you duplicate to maximize your time.
Updating thumbnails
As long as you do all your editing within or through Album, the program
keeps a good record of your photo’s vital statistics and history. If you edit a
photo in Album, it makes an edited version, keeps the original, and it knows
exactly what’s going on. If you need to edit your image in another image-editing
application, like Photoshop Elements or Photoshop, be sure and launch the
program from within Album. If you do so, Album will still know what’s going
on and will be able to track all versions of your file.
If you don’t launch an image-editing program through Album, the thumbnail
in the Photo Well and the file information will not reflect the edited image. In
this case, you have to perform an additional step to update the thumbnail
and file info. Here’s how:
1. Select one or multiple images in the Photo Well that have been edited
outside of Album.

136
Part II: Importing, Organizing, and Managing Photos 

2. If you selected a single image, choose Edit➪Update Thumbnail. If you
chose multiple photos, choose Edit➪Update Thumbnails for Selected
Items.
You also can right-click and choose the commands from the context-
sensitive menu.
Reconnecting to missing files 
In your zeal for organizing, you may move a file, such as a photo, video, or
audio clip, from its original location in Album to a new one that is outside
the Album realm. If you do so, Album will not be able to find it and will
consider it missing. It will then place a File Missing icon on top of your
thumbnail in the Photo Well. This is not a disaster, by any means, but it is a
minor inconvenience. All you have to do is use the Reconnect Missing File
command and show Album where the file now resides.
You may choose to ignore the file missing icon thinking you know darn well
the file isn’t missing. But the next time you try and print, export, e-mail, edit,
or do anything that requires the original file, the Reconnect Missing Files
dialog box will appear automatically, forcing you to take action to direct
Album to the file’s new location.
To reconnect a single missing file, follow these steps:
1. Select a file that has a file missing icon in the Photo Well.
2. Choose Edit➪Reconnect Missing File.
You also can right-click and select the command from the context-
sensitive menu.
The Reconnect Missing Files dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 7-12.
The missing file, along with a thumbnail preview and file info, appears
on the left side. The right side of the dialog box shows the original folder
where the image was once stored.
3. In the Browse for Missing Files section of the dialog box, navigate to
folder where the file now resides and click the Reconnect button.
A thumbnail preview of a possible match is displayed when you select a
new folder.
The Last Action pop-up menu lists the file that has been reconnected.
The Reconnect Missing File command does not work for files that have
been renamed outside of Album or deleted.
4. Click Close to exit the dialog box.
137
Chapter 7: Managing Your Photos

Here’s how to reconnect multiple missing files:
1. Choose File➪Reconnect All Missing Files.
You don’t have to select the images in the Photo Well. Album checks
through your catalog, and all files it finds as missing are listed in the
Reconnect Missing Files dialog box that appears.
2. Select one or more of the missing files in the list.
As with a single file, Album displays the thumbnail preview and last
known folder location on the left side of the dialog box (refer to Figure 7-6).
3. In the Browse for Missing Files section, navigate to the folder contain-
ing the missing files and then click the Reconnect button.
4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 for all missing files.
The Last Action pop-up menu shows a list of the files reconnected. Any
files that couldn’t be reconnected remain in the missing files list. If you
mistakenly reconnect to the wrong file, click the Undo button right away.
Or, later, once back in the Photo Well, you can rename the erroneous file
or delete it from the catalog.
5. Click Close to exit the dialog box.

W
hen you’ve gotten your ﬁles into Album and orga-
nized them to your liking, you can ﬁnd, sort, and
view images without much strain. Those days of rummag-
ing through shoeboxes and scrolling through folders on
your hard drive are over! You also ﬁnd information on the
different ways you can view your images. Choose from
thumbnails, Single Photo view or take a gander at images
using instant slideshows.
The very ﬁrst step in ﬁxing digital images is to set up the
best editing environment possible. After you optimize
your editing environment, Chapter 11 shows you how to
use Album’s Fix Photo dialog box to eliminate red eye, ﬂat-
ten contrast, and eliminate color casts, all with a click or
two of the mouse. You’ll be amazed at the large amount of
improvement that can be gained from such little effort. If
you need heavier-duty capabilities, I cover using Album
with an external image editor, such as Photoshop
Elements.

 Finding photos by date with the timeline and calendar
 Finding photos by filename, captions, media type and color
 Using History to find photos
 Refining searches with tags
P
hotoshop Album is chock full of ways to help you find the exact photos
you want. One method isn’t necessarily better than another; it’s a matter
of how you’ve organized your images and how you like to work. If you haven’t
organized your images, you might want to check out Chapters 5 and 6 for the
lowdown. Although you can find your images by date, filename, and media type
without any prior organizing, working with tags may be the ticket for getting
a handle on your digital shoebox of images. But no matter which method you
use or which search criteria you choose, you’ll find Album does a great job in
bringing you the files you’re looking for.
Finding Photos by Date
One of the most popular criteria to find any kind of file is by date. I know I often
find myself hunting for the latest version of a particular file by having Windows
arrange my files by date modified. Fortunately, Album gives you a couple of
methods to find photos by date — using the timeline and the calendar.
Using the timeline
To view images using the timeline, it isn’t necessary to attach tags to them
(although you can). Album automatically arranges your photos in the timeline.
The timeline is divided into years and months, as shown in Figure 8-1. You can
click the month you desire, or you can drag the slider. Hold your mouse over a
bar in the timeline, and the name of the month appears. To find and view
photos within a select range of time, move the end points of the timeline.

Here are the specific steps to find and view photos using the timeline:
1. Choose View➪Timeline to bring the timeline into view.
2. Choose View➪Arrangement and then choose a sorting criteria.
You can sort by criteria such as newest date first, oldest date first,
import date, folders, or color. Album’s default sorting option is newest
date first. For full details on sorting, see Chapter 9.
After you choose a sorting option, Album displays blue bars in the 
timeline. The height of each bar corresponds to the number of images
per your sorting criteria. For example, if you’ve sorted by newest date
first, the height of the bars corresponds to the number of photos in each
month (refer to Figure 8-1). If you sort by folder location, the height cor-
responds to the number of images in each folder (as shown in Figure 8-2),
and so on. Hover your mouse over a bar in the timeline to display the
name of the respective folder containing the images.
3. Choose Find➪Set Date Range.
The Set Date Range dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 8-3.

Part III: Finding, Viewing, and Editing Photos 

4. Enter start and end dates to further refine your search. Click OK.
You also can drag the endpoint markers to set the date range. Only those
photos with dates within the range specified appear in the Photo Well. If
a photo doesn’t have a date, it appears with a question mark in both the
Photo Well and the timeline. You can assign a date to a photo by choos-
ing Edit➪Adjust Date and Time. For details on changing the date or time,
see Chapter 9.
Using the calendar
You also can use the calendar to find photos by date. Of course, it is a good
idea to know the approximate date of the photo(s) you want, or you may
spend quite a bit of time clicking through images, depending on the size of
your catalog.
It’s extremely simple to find photos using the calendar. Here are the steps
you need to follow:
1. Choose View➪Calendar.
You also can click the Calendar button in the Shortcuts bar. The calen-
dar window (shown in Figure 8-4) initially displays whatever photo is
selected in the Photo Well or, if none is selected, the first photo in the
Photo Well.

Or you can view a slide show in the calendar. Click the Start button to
have the slide show automatically play.
5. After you’ve found your desired file, click the View button.
The image displays in the Photo Well in a Single Photo view.
Finding Photos by Caption,
Note, or Filename
Maybe you’re not into dates, but instead are more of a wordsmith kind of
person. You’re in luck. Album lets you easily find photos by providing a word
or phrase that you used in an image’s filename, caption, or note. You don’t
even have to use the exact phrase.
Maybe you only remember a single word. No problem — Album brings up any
matches that use the word in the data related to the file. Here’s how to find
files using similar words in captions or notes:
1. Choose Find➪By Caption or Note.
The Find by Caption or Note dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 8-5.
2. Enter a word or phrase in the text box to find any files whose captions
or notes contain that word or phrase.
The default option is set to match any part of any word in the caption or
note. You also can choose to match only the beginning of words in the
caption or note.
3. Click OK.
Any matching files appear in the Photo Well.
To find a file by filename, follow these steps:
1. Choose Find➪By Filename.
The Find by Filename dialog box appears.
145
Chapter 8: Locating Your Photos

2. Enter a word or phrase in the text box to find any files whose file-
names contain that word or phrase.
3. Click OK.
Any matching files appear in the Photo Well.
For full details on creating captions and notes, see Chapter 6.
Finding Photos by Their History
Album is truly a program for those of us who appreciate a meticulous track-
ing system. This program remembers where you got your photos, how you
got them, when you received them, whether you shared, printed, or exported
them, and how you’ve used them. So don’t get any ideas about sneaking a
photo in under Album’s nose. It flat isn’t going to happen. Album refers to all
these details as a photo’s history. And just as it captures and retains this his-
tory, it also allows you to locate photos via their history.
To find photos using their history, choose Find➪By History and choose one
of the following options, shown in Figure 8-6:

With creations, you have a few other ways to view items used:
• If you select a creation in the Photo Well, you can right-click and
choose Show Photos in Workspace from the context-sensitive
menu. Thumbnails of the files used in your creation appear in the
Workspace window.
• You also can drag a creation onto the Find bar to display those
files used. The files appear in the Photo Well. For more on the
Find bar, see the section, “Searching with the Find bar and tags.”
• You can see if a file was used in a creation by looking at its History
in the Properties pane. Choose History from the pop-up menu at
the bottom of the pane. If the file was used in a creation, the name
of the creation is listed, as shown in Figure 8-13. For more details
on using the Properties pane, see Chapter 2.
 Items in Web Photo Galleries: Select this option to view all items you
have used in Web Photo Galleries and when you created those galleries.
To see the files used, double-click any item in the list. For more on creat-
ing Web Photo Galleries, see Chapter 18.

Tracking Down Files by Media Type
If you have any extensive catalog with various types of files — still images,
video clips, audio files, and creations — you can have Album wrangle them
into the Photo Well by media type. Unfortunately, you can choose only one
type of media at a time. Choose Find➪By Media Type and select an option
from the sub-menu. You have a choice of the following options:
 Photos: Displays photographs only.
 Video: Shows thumbnails of your video clips. Only the first frame of the
clip is displayed. A small filmstrip icon appears in the top-right corner of
the thumbnail, as shown in Figure 8-14.
 Audio: Displays your audio clips. An icon of a little speaker with the file-
name is shown.
 Creations: Displays in the Photo Well all creations you have produced.
The first page or screen of any multi-page or multi-screen creation
appears as the thumbnail with a small creation icon in the top right
corner.
 Items with Audio Captions: Shows any photos and creations that you
have attached audio captions to. A small speaker icon annotating an
audio caption also appears in the top-right corner of the thumbnail.

Part III: Finding, Viewing, and Editing Photos 

Even if you don’t pay attention to the descriptive icons on your thumbnails,
Album generously displays your chosen Search criteria in the Find bar above
the Photo Well. And once you have narrowed down your search by media
type, you can then apply other search criteria to further refine the search
for your desired files.
Finding Files with Unknown Dates
Maybe the clock on your digital camera wasn’t operating properly and didn’t
embed any dates and times on your photos. How do find those files that don’t
have a date or time they were created or imported? You can direct Album to
round up those stray files by choosing Find➪Items with Unknown Date or
Time. Album then displays all the files without dates or times in the Photo
Well. After you’ve rounded them up, you can easily change the date of the
images by choosing Edit➪Adjust Date and Time. For more details on date
and time changes, see Chapter 5.
Photos with unknown dates are marked with question marks in the timeline
and in the Photo Well.
Locating Images by Their Color
To find photos that have a similar color distribution, choose Find➪By Color
Similarity with Selected Photos. But before you can use this command, you
have to select one or more images (up to four) so Album knows what to look
for. Don’t select any creations, Album will just ignore them anyway.
If you choose photos that are extremely dissimilar, you are going to basically
get the kitchen sink thrown back at you. Even when choosing a single image,
sometimes Album locates images that are not really all that similar, as shown
in Figure 8-15. I chose a nighttime shot of New York City as my search criteria.
Expecting only dark images to be found, I couldn’t quite understand why I got
some bright daytime shots among the images.
With all the other great search criteria available at your disposal, I would skip
this one if you’re trying to save time.
You also can find similarly colored images by dragging a photo onto the
Find bar.
153
Chapter 8: Locating Your Photos

Using Tags to Find Files
You also can search for files by tags. Tags are descriptive keywords you
attach to your photos to add additional information for organizing and man-
aging purposes. Check out Chapter 5 to find out about these useful critters.
To find files using tags, choose any of these methods: 
 Choose Find➪Items Tagged With, and then select a tag from the sub-
menu. Your tagged images appear in the Photo Well. Click the Clear
button in the Find bar to display all the files in your catalog again.
 Choose View➪Tags to bring up the Tags pane. In the pane, click the
square to the left of the tag name(s), so the binoculars icon appears.
Your tagged images appear in the Photo Well, as shown in Figure 8-16.
Click the icon to cancel the search and display all files or click the Clear
button in the Find bar.
 Drag one or more tags from the Tags pane onto the Find bar. The
selected tag(s) appears in the search criteria window in the Find bar.
Click the Clear button to cancel the search and display all catalog files.

Part III: Finding, Viewing, and Editing Photos 

 Right-click a Tag category in the Tags pane and select New Search using
(Tag name) category.
You can work from the opposite perspective and choose any images that do
not have assigned tags. Choose Find➪Untagged Items to see all of the files in
your catalog that are don’t have tags.
Using the timeline with tagged files
If using tags narrows down your search, but doesn’t quite give you the exact
images you are looking for, try using the timeline along with your tags. For
example, say you’re searching for images of family members taken around
the holidays. Of course, all your pictures of family have a nice “Family” tag
attached to them.

Chapter 8: Locating Your Photos

You could first do a search using the “Family” tag and then display the time-
line and click in December bars to find winter holiday–related photos within
the tagged images. Or you can drag endpoint markers to narrow the time
range of photos you want displayed in the Photo Well.
Follow these steps to use tags along with the timeline to zero in a specific
group of images:
1. Choose View➪Tags to display the Tags pane.
2. Drag and drop your selected tag onto the Find bar.
3. Drag the timeline endpoint markers to set the range you want to
search.
All images with the tag found within the range of dates appear in the
Photo Well, as shown in Figure 8-17.

Part III: Finding, Viewing, and Editing Photos 

Searching with the Find bar and tags
The fabulous Find bar, the thin blue bar directly above the Photo Well, allows
you to quickly find files. When you drag a tag from the Tags pane onto the Find
bar, the bar expands and displays a Search Criteria window that shows the tag
you have used to search with. All tagged images then appear in the Photo Well.
The Find bar also shows you how many items in your catalog exactly match
the Search Criteria, how many closely match, and how many don’t match at
all. To display the items in any of these three categories, simply click in the
check box. The default display are those items that match exactly. To cancel
the search and display your entire catalog, click the Clear button.
Besides tags, you also can drag photos and creations onto the Find bar. You
can find similarly colored images by dragging a photo onto the Find bar. And
when you drag a creation onto the Find bar, all files used in the creation are
displayed in the Photo Well.
Finding Favorite or Hidden files 
Album allows you to attach a Favorites tag, which identifies your most prized
images, clips, and creations. The methods to use when searching with the
Favorites tag are the same as searching with other tags (described above);
however, the Favorites tag has preference in searches when it is used with
other tags.
For example, if you drag both the Family and Favorites tag onto the Find bar,
only those images tagged with the Family tag that also have a Favorites tag
attached to them appear in the Photo Well. For full details on creating and
using tags, see Chapter 5.
You also can attach a Hidden tag to files, as shown in Figure 8-18. Maybe you
have a batch of backup images or mediocre shots that you don’t want to view
in your catalog. Whenever you search for photos, any with a Hidden tag are not
found. In order to find Hidden images, make sure you select both your desired
tag and the Hidden tag in your search. And of course, if all you want to find
are Hidden photos, simply select or drag the Hidden tag alone.
If a bar in the timeline is part purple, it means that you have Hidden photos
in that month, batch, or folder.

Viewing Your Photos
In This Chapter
 Choosing a viewing size
 Sorting images in the Photo Well
 Viewing slide shows
 Displaying video clips
A
fter you’ve located and imported your images into Album, I am sure
you’re more than ready to sit back and gaze at their awesomeness.
Imported files, whether they’re photos, video clips, audio clips, or creations,
appear in the Photo Well in a grid of thumbnails. You can adjust the size of
these thumbnails, as well as how your images are sorted. 
Album also gives you the capability of displaying your images in an instant
slide show. Slide shows are great if you want to preview images you’ve just
imported or to show them off for family and friends as they huddle around
the monitor and ooh and aah. For those of you who are more multimedia
inclined, Album also has a built-in media player that allows you to play
both your audio and video clips.
Choosing a Viewing Size
Album gives you the option of choosing how you want to view your files in
the Photo Well. At times, you may want to see everything in your catalog so
you would use the Small Thumbnail view. In other instances, you may just
want to isolate the view to a single image, in which case the Single Photo
view may better suit your needs. Changing the view is as easy as clicking
your mouse, so feel free to do it as often as you want. 

To change the view, choose View➪Size and select from the following options:
 Small Thumbnail: This option displays your files in the Photo Well
in the smallest size. This is the best option if you need to see as many
images at once as possible, as displayed in Figure 9-1. In addition to the
thumbnail, the date, time, and tag icons (if tags have been attached) are
displayed. For more on tags, see Chapter 5.
 Medium Thumbnail: This option is Album’s default view. This view,
shown in Figure 9-2, provides the best overall view for everyday brows-
ing through your catalog. In addition to the thumbnail, dates, times and
tag icons of the images are displayed. 
 Large Thumbnail: This option shows just a few files at a time. This
means you’ll need to do a lot of scrolling, but you’ll also see more details
in the images than with the smaller views, as shown in Figure 9-3. This is
a good choice if you have a sequence of images that look similar, and
you need to distinguish between them. This view also displays the date,
time, tag icon, and tag name for each image.
 Single Photo: This view shows only one photo at a time. To view the
rest of the images in your catalog, click the Next Item or Previous Item
buttons, shown in Figure 9-4. Not only do you get the largest view of the
image, but you also get to see the metadata about the image (the file size
and resolution are displayed on-screen below the image). You also can
see the image’s date, time, and any tags that have been attached. 
Figure 9-1:
To see 
as many
images as

choose

160
Part III: Finding, Viewing, and Editing Photos 

If you don’t see any metadata or tags, be sure that the Show Dates and
Tags option is checked under the View menu (or check Show Dates in
the Options bar at the bottom of the screen).
This viewing option also allows you to type a caption and attach or play
an audio annotation. For more on captions and annotation, see Chapter 6.
You also can access the Single Photo view by double-clicking the image
in the Photo Well (double-clicking an audio or video clip brings up the
Album media player).
Here are a few other points to remember about views:
 You can change the date and time assigned to the photo by clicking
either the date or time on-screen. For more on adjusting dates and
times, see Chapter 5.
 You also can change your viewing options by clicking the icons in the
Options bar.
 There is one other view you can select. Select your desired photo
and choose View➪Show Full Screen. Your image will explode onto
your screen. Any screen real estate not eaten up by image will be filled
with black as shown in Figure 9-5. Click your mouse or press Esc to
return to Album.

 Choose View➪Refresh to refresh your screen view. Sometimes com-
mands you’ve performed on your image won’t be displayed until you
refresh. For example, if you attach a Hidden tag to a photo, the photo
doesn’t become hidden until the screen refreshes. For details on tags,
see Chapter 5. You also can force a regeneration of all of your thumbnail
images by right-clicking any photo, holding down the Ctrl key and select-
ing the Update Thumbnail command from the context-sensitive menu.
Note that this process can take awhile if you have a large catalog.
Sorting Images in the Photo Well
You can specify how Album should sort the images you display. This option
is truly made for us anal-retentive types who have a love for all things cate-
gorical and chronological. 
Album lets you sort the files in your catalog using various criteria. You can
sort by media type or you can sort by what Album refers to as arrangement.
Sorting by arrangement allows you to sort your image by date and location
among other criteria. After you choose your sorting criteria, Album retains
this display until you decide to change it.
Figure 9-5:

Chapter 9: Viewing Your Photos

Sorting by media type
Sometimes you may want to view only images that are pertinent to a particu-
lar project. For example, say you’re putting together a video CD and are con-
cerned only with viewing video clips. Or maybe you’re constructing a photo
book and only want your photos to show in your Photo Well. Sorting files by
media type allows you to selectively tell Album which kinds of files you want
to display. Here’s how:
1. Choose View➪Media Types.
The Items Shown dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 9-6. 
2. Select or deselect the types of files you want to display. 
3. Click OK to close the dialog box.
Your chosen media types are now displayed in the Photo Well.
Sorting by arrangement
Besides sorting by media types, Album also allows you to sort your files by
date, how they were imported, location, and color. Sorting by the newest image
first is probably the most popular arrangement, but each option has its
advantages.
To sort by arrangement, choose View➪Arrangement and select one of the
options from the sub-menu, shown in Figure 9-7. You also can select a sorting
option from the Photo Well Arrangement pop-up menu in the Options bar.
Here’s the lowdown on the options:
Figure 9-6:

Part III: Finding, Viewing, and Editing Photos 

 Date (Newest First): This option shows the newest photos first, and
includes either those images most recently taken or imported. Use this
sorting option when you need to organize your most recently acquired
images by renaming them, adding captions, or attaching tags. This
option is Album’s default.
 Date (Oldest First): This sorting option displays all of your files in
chronological order, from the oldest to the newest. 
 Import Batch: Choose this setting to display files in the batches in
which they were imported. Each batch is separated by a dark gray line
that includes information about the way the photos were imported into
Album.
 Folder Location: This option displays photos by the folders in which
they are located, as shown in Figure 9-8.
 Color Similarity: This option is grayed out unless you’re viewing photos
that have a similar color distribution. You can get this specialized view
by selecting one or more photos in the Photo Well and choosing Find By
Color Similarity with Selected Photo(s). For more on this option, see
Chapter 8.
You also can view photos by date using the timeline and the calendar. Because
this viewing option is closely tied to finding photos in Album, I cover it in de-
tail in Chapter 8.

Chapter 9: Viewing Your Photos

Viewing Instant Slide Shows
A great viewing option in Album is the instant slide show. You can select the
photos in your catalog and with a single command create a slide show that
launches and plays on-screen. Each image in the slide show appears individu-
ally, gradually fades to black after a few seconds and then transitions into the
next image. When the last image in the instant slide show is displayed, Album
automatically closes the slide show and returns you to the Album application
window.
Creating an instant slide show is a nice way to preview a folder or even a
whole catalog of images. It is also helpful if you want to do a dry run of a slide
show you ultimately plan on constructing and exporting as a PDF with the
Creations Wizard (for more on the Creations Wizard, see Chapter 18). You
also can control the pace of slide shows using the on-screen controls.
Viewing photos as a slide show
Follow these steps to view photos as a slide show:

2. Choose View➪Slideshow.
You also can click the Slideshow button in the Shortcuts bar, as shown
in Figure 9-9.
You temporarily leave Album, and the slide show launches and takes
over your screen, as shown in Figure 9-10. The show transitions through
the chosen images automatically. Or you can use the on-screen controls
to nudge the show along:
• You can pause the show by pressing the Stop button.
• If you don’t see any controls, move your mouse to bring them to
life. If the controls are not an aesthetically pleasing part of your
presentation, you can close them by clicking the X in the top left
corner of the controls.
• The slide show ends automatically; however to end it prematurely,
press the Esc key.
If you’re not happy with the timing, transitions, or background of the default
settings for the slide show, you can change the slide show preferences (see
the next section, “Setting instant slide show preferences,” in this chapter).

Setting instant slide show preferences
If the default instant slide show settings aren’t exactly to your liking, you can
customize them by choosing new options in the Preferences dialog box. You
can even jazz up your show by adding some background music. And if want
your cat or dog to be entertained when you leave the room to do something
else, you can set the show to repeat over and over and over . . .
Here’s how to set your slide show preferences:
1. Choose Edit➪Preferences.
2. Select Slideshow from the list of on the left side of the dialog box,
shown in Figure 9-11.
3. Choose settings for the following options: 
• Background Music: Choose an audio clip to play during your slide
show. Select Play Audio Captions to play any captions that you
have attached to the images in your slide show.
• Transition: Select how the photos transition from one to the other
in the slide show.

Just a note of advice: Don’t mix too many styles. Transitions are wonder-
ful, but too much of a good thing has a tendency to make those of us
with weak stomachs nauseous.
• Page Duration: Select the length of time that each photo stays on
the screen. You can choose 2, 5, or 10 seconds from the pop-up
menu or you can enter your own custom time duration.
• Include Play Controls: Choose this option to include the on-screen
controls when you run your slide show.
• Allow Video to Resize: Select this option to allow video clips to
resize to fill your screen. Be careful, however. If your image is
small, allowing it to resize may result in a less-than-desirable
screen quality, as shown in Figure 9-12.
• Include Captions: Choose this setting to include any captions you
have attached to the images in your slide show.
• Pause on Start/Manual Advance: Select this option to pause
the slide show when it starts so you can use the on-screen
controls to run through the slide show instead of allowing it
to run automatically.

will repeat (and repeat, and repeat) until you tell it to stop.
4. When you’re finished, click OK to close the dialog box.
Viewing Video Clips
Because Album can’t display thumbnails of moving images in the Photo Well,
the thumbnails for video clips are displayed by their first frame. You can dis-
tinguish these thumbnails from still images because video clips have a film-
strip icon that appears in the upper-right corner of the thumbnail.
Here are the steps to view a video clip:
1. Double-click the video clip in the Photo Well.
The Photoshop Album media player launches, as shown in Figure 9-13.

Setting Up Your Editing
Environment
In This Chapter
 Setting up your work environment
 Getting rid of visual distractions
 Testing and optimizing your hardware
 Calibrating your monitor
B
efore you start a massive makeover of your images in Album, you might
consider first taking inventory of your work area to see if it’s conducive
to image editing. I mean, you (or a delegate) spent a considerable amount of
time setting up your computer, digital camera, and scanner to perform their
assigned tasks, right? Similarly, consider setting up your workspace as an
extension of your imaging equipment. 
Not convinced? Well, let me add that setting up your workspace is free, easy,
and takes very little time. I guarantee you’ll get better-looking images as a
result. As an added bonus, I throw in a couple of other tips in this chapter
that help you manage your image-editing workflow.
After you have your workspace in ship shape, it’s time to make sure your
monitor is calibrated. The second step in working with digital images is to
make sure that what you are seeing on-screen is as accurate as it can get.
After that’s been done you can move on to viewing, editing and sharing your
photos with confidence.
Keeping Your Lighting Consistent
It is important to try and keep your lighting as consistent as possible:

 Try not to radically vary the level and intensity of the light while you are
editing your images. For example, try to avoid working on an image in
the bright afternoon sun and then again under the harsh light of a fluo-
rescent bulb late at night.
 Try to view all of your images under the same intensity of light.
Looking at your source material, your on-screen images, and your prints
under the same lighting can provide a consistent benchmark to use in your
viewing and editing sessions. Variations in lighting can cause you to perceive
color differently and result in color shifts in your output (both on-screen and
in print).
If you happen to be stuck next to a window or skylight, you may want to pur-
chase a monitor hood or visor. These tools help to shield your screen against
glare and reflection and run in the neighborhood of $15 to $100.
Removing Distractions
No, I don’t mean eliminating rambunctious kids, barking dogs, and cats hop-
ping onto your warm monitor. (Of course, removal of the above could very
well make you more productive.) The kind of distractions I am talking about
are the ones on and around your monitor.
174
Part III: Finding, Viewing, and Editing Photos  
Stepping up to professional lighting devices
If you find yourself really getting into this digital
imaging stuff, there are a couple of devices that
the professionals use which may interest you:
 Task lamp: This is a lamp that provides con-
sistent full-spectrum light that mimics sun-
light. Task lamps allow you to see colors
more accurately and with more clarity. They
also offer low-glare lighting, run on less
energy, and cut down on eye strain. Task
lamps run from $50 to $200 or so. 
 Light box: This is also called a light booth
or color viewing booth. Professional-grade
light boxes adhere to lighting standards
developed by the ISO (International
Standards Organization). Light boxes offer
various lighting environments (depending
on the make and model), such as fluores-
cent, incandescent, UV, daylight, and so on.
Light boxes enable you to view images in a
controlled, consistent environment so that
you can see the images the way that your
intended audience will. For example, if
people will be viewing one of your pictures
in an office setting (under fluorescent
lights), you can adjust the settings
accordingly — and adjust your output.
Likewise, if people will be viewing the
poster outside (in daylight), you just adjust
the setting. Cost ranges from a few hundred
dollars to several thousands, depending on
the model.

Using a neutral background
If you’ve become attached to the dancing dinosaur wallpaper on your desk-
top, it’s time to cut the ties. It might be painful, and it may seem oh so boring,
but let go of the disco T. Rex and keep your desktop a neutral gray, which is
better for image viewing. 
Any colors and patterns behind your images will affect how you view those
images, as shown in Figure 10-1. Think about it: When you display artwork,
whether photographic or illustrative, it is usually framed against a neutral
black, white, or gray background. That way the focus is on the work, and noth-
ing is distracting your eye. Same principle applies for your digital photos.
If you’re using Windows XP, follow the steps below to get your desktop to a
neutral gray. If you’re sporting another flavor of Windows, check your docu-
mentation if you’re unsure of how to achieve a gray desktop. In Windows XP,
follow these steps:
1. Right-click the desktop. Select Properties from the context-sensitive
menu.
2. In the Display Properties window, click the Appearance tab.
3. Click the Advanced button.
4. In the Advanced Appearance window, select Desktop from the Item
pop-up menu.
5. Select Other from the Color pop-up menu.
6. In the Color window, enter a value of 128 in the Red, Green and Blue
text boxes.
A value of 128 for Red, Green and Blue will yield a neutral gray color.
7. Click OK. 
You are now the proud owner of neutral gray background to help you
with your image-editing tasks. 
In fact, putting certain colors next to each other influences the way your eyes
perceive a color. For more on color theory, see Chapter 3.
Choosing a work area with neutral walls
Like the computer desktop, keep the walls of your work area neutral as well.
You don’t have to paint the room gray (although, believe it or not, hard-core
color and retouching experts do), but try to avoid lots of colorful artwork
around and behind your monitor. Even objects and art that aren’t directly
next to your screen image may influence your perception.

Sitting Pretty
If, by the end of a day of playing with your digital images, your arms are
numb, your legs are cramped, and your back is screaming for a massage, it
may be time to look at your desk and chair. Face it. If you aren’t comfortable
when you’re parked in front of your computer immersed in imaging heaven,
you’re not going to be as productive. 
At the very least, messing with your images isn’t going to be as enjoyable.
Invest in an ample desk and a chair with good support. 
I find that propping my feet on a short wooden block under my desk helps
my back tremendously. If you feel like you have carpal tunnel syndrome after
a few hours at the keyboard, try using those cushy gel wrist rests for both
your keyboard and mouse. Give yourself a little time to get used to them;
you’ll be surprised how much strain they absorb.
Find a Vendor and Stick with It
If you plan on buying imaging or printing services, either online or from a
vendor near your home or office, spend some time finding the best service
Figure 10-1:
A neutral

conducive
for editing
than moon-
flowers.
176
Part III: Finding, Viewing, and Editing Photos  

bureau or printer online or in your area. After you’ve found the one you like,
stick with that vendor for all your prints, photo books, Photo CDs, and other
products and services. Here are a few reasons why:
 You’ll know what to expect, in terms of color and other quality 
characteristics.
 You will get better services by being a regular customer.
Sometimes jumping from vendor to vendor to save a few bucks isn’t worth
risking a good working relationship. After you have established a relationship
with a vendor in your area (or online), ask questions. These people not only
know their own business’ products and services, but probably know a lot
about digital imaging in general.
Running Tests, Tests, and More Tests
Take some time to test your workflow and your computer system. Take a lot
of digital photos. You don’t have to worry about film and developing costs so
snap away. The more photos you take, the better photographer you’ll be
(check out Chapter 19 for tips on composition). Even if all you plan to be is
the designated family vacation photographer, don’t underestimate the signifi-
cance of your function. Experience and a little knowledge behind the lens will
make your photos all that more memorable, and that’s a priceless gift. Here
are a few other tests you can try:
 Scan images using multiple settings and see what kinds of results 
you get. 
 Print images using multiple resolutions and different types of papers.
 View your images using different browsers on different monitors and 
different platforms.
Really become familiar with the ins and outs of every piece of your equip-
ment in your workflow. No books, documentation, or advice comes close to
the amount of knowledge gained from spending time on your system and
experimenting. And play, play, play in Album. If friends and family start com-
plaining about how they never see you now that you’ve become this digital
fiend, you could always give them a beautifully printed photo of yourself!
Calibrating Your Monitor
If your images appear too dark, too light, or have a weird bluish, yellowish, or
reddish cast, your monitor probably needs calibrating. Even if your images
look pretty good, it is still a good idea to calibrate. 
177
Chapter 10: Setting Up Your Editing Environment

By calibrating your monitor and creating a characterization, or profile, of
your monitor, you ensure that you are getting rid of any color casts and pro-
viding as neutral a gray screen as possible. By doing so you are standardizing
the display of images — how you view your images today will be the same as
how you view them next week. 
Calibrating your monitor is the first step in trying to get consistent color
from all input (cameras, scanners), and output devices (screen, printer).
You can calibrate your monitor by using any of several methods. If you hunt
on the Internet, it seems every digital expert or photographer has his or her
preferred method. Photoshop Album ships with a program called Adobe
Gamma.
It’s a good idea to display an image with known color values while calibrating
your monitor. In other words, use an image that you have worked with before
and for which you have a good print. Then use that image each and every
time you calibrate. 
Some experts say you should calibrate your monitor weekly; others say
monthly because monitors can drift and even degrade over time. 
Using the same image every time you calibrate enables you to more closely
match what you see on-screen to match the printed output. For more on get-
ting optimum prints, see Chapter 14.
Using Adobe Gamma
Follow these steps to use Adobe Gamma to calibrate your monitor:
1. First, turn your monitor on and let it warm up at least 60 minutes.
This action allows your monitor to stabilize before calibration. 
2. Make certain that your monitor is displaying thousands of colors (16
bits) or more. If your monitor is set to 32 bits, don’t change it.
3. Set your desktop display to a neutral gray using RGB values of 128.
If you’re not sure how to do these two operations, check with your 
operating system documentation.
See “Using a neutral background,” earlier in this chapter.
4. Set the lighting in the room the way you will have it when you are
viewing images. Also try and reduce any glare or reflections on the
screen.
5. Launch the Adobe Gamma utility. 
178
Part III: Finding, Viewing, and Editing Photos  

This program ships with Album, but if you don’t have this utility already
installed, you can find it on your Photoshop Album installation CD. You
can install it by opening the Adobe Gamma folder on the CD and follow-
ing the simple install instructions in the ReadMe file. Adobe Gamma also
ships with Adobe Photoshop, InDesign, and Acrobat, so if you have any
of these applications, you may already have it installed. 
You can find Adobe Gamma in the Control Panel (Start➪Settings➪
Control Panel). If it isn’t there, check in your Program Files folder, in the
Common Files folder, in the Adobe folder, in the Calibration folder. 
6. You can select either the Step By Step (Wizard) option or the manual
Control Panel option, both shown in Figure 10-2. I highly recommend
using the Wizard. Then click Next. 
The Wizard walks you through the calibration process via questions.
7. Adjust the monitor’s contrast and brightness controls, which set the
dark point of your monitor. Then click Next.
8. Enter the phosphors setting, for example, Trinitron. Then click Next.
If you don’t know it, check your monitor’s documentation.
9. Choose a gamma (gray or midtones) setting by adjusting a slider for
red, green, and blue squares on-screen. Then click Next.
The default gamma for Windows is 2.2.
10. Set your white point. Then click Next. 
The standard for Windows is 6500K (K stands for Kelvin, which mea-
sures color temperature).
179
Chapter 10: Setting Up Your Editing Environment
Taking calibration to the next level
Each of us perceives color a little differently, so
your visual perception could affect the way you
profile your monitor. If you have a big budget
and you really want to do a great calibration job,
you might consider purchasing a self-
calibrating monitor. These monitors constantly
measure their own color and create a profile
that is very precise. The technology comes with
a price, however. These monitors are obviously
more expensive than the average monitor.
If your budget isn’t quite so hefty, consider a
combination hardware/software calibration
package that you can use with your existing
monitor. You can get a pretty good package
from 
several 
manufacturers, 
such 
as
Pantone/Color Vision, which costs around $300.
The package includes software that displays
color swatches on your screen. Then you attach
a photoelectric device, called a colorimeter, to
your monitor with a suction cup. The sensors in
the colorimeter measure the color, brightness,
and other characteristics of the monitor. The
software takes the data, adjusts your monitor to
its optimum state, and then creates a profile
from it. Very Invasion of the Body Snatchers.
Very high tech.

You can start with the default settings, but they may need a little adjust-
ing depending on what you see. When you’re done, Adobe Gamma cre-
ates a profile of your monitor so your graphic programs know how your
monitor is displaying color.
If you use the Wizard, Adobe Gamma allows you to see a before and after view
of your screen. If Adobe Gamma has done its job properly, you won’t see any
funky color cast, and your monitor won’t be too dark or overly bright. If every-
thing looks good, you can click Finish. If not, you can go back and adjust.
Using another calibration utility
If you don’t have Adobe Gamma, no problem. Quite a few Web sites offer simi-
lar calibration utilities. Check out
 www.viewsonic.com/support/calibration.htm
 www.easyrgb.com/calibrate.php
 www.risingphotography.com/calibration
 www.praxisoft.com (a free version wiziWYG XP)
All of the sites listed here offer tools similar or even better than Adobe
Gamma. You also can search around the Web and find a utility that I didn’t
mention here. 
Photographer Norman Koren has a great tutorial on monitor and printer cali-
bration at www.normankoren.com, but be warned that while informative and
comprehensive, it may be too technical for some folks.

H
ave you ever gotten home from a vacation or special event and anx-
iously imported your photos only to find that quite a few of them could
use a little help? Maybe one image is too dark, and another image has a dis-
tracting background? Maybe the color is washed out, or the image is blurry?
Don’t delete your so-so pictures; they can be saved! 
Thankfully, Photoshop Album comes equipped with a batch of editing tools
to help correct those images and make them worthy of sharing or printing.
What’s even better is that Album has conveniently put all those editing tools
in one handy location called the Fix Photo dialog box. 
If you haven’t already, be sure to read Chapter 10 so that you can get your
work area and monitor ready for some editing magic. 
Improving Images with Fix Photo 
The Fix Photo dialog box is makeover central for your digital images. It’s easy
to use and provides several controls for improving their appearance. There
are fixes that require a single click of a button and others that need a little
more intervention on your part.

Choosing a viewing option
The first step is getting your image into the Fix Photo dialog box. Here’s how: 
1. Select the image you want to edit in the Photo Well.
If you’re not sure how to select a photo, check out Chapter 2. 
You can bring only one photo into the Fix Photo dialog box at a time.
2. Choose Edit➪Fix Photo.
You also can click the Fix button in the Shortcuts bar, shown in
Figure 11-1. Or you also can right-click and choose Fix Photo from the
context-sensitive menu. And if those aren’t enough ways to get into Fix
Photo, you also can just double-click the photo to enlarge it to a Single
Photo view and then double-click it again.
You’re prompted with a warning, shown in Figure 11-2, that says you
are about to edit an original photo, but that the original file won’t be
changed. It also specifies where the edited photo will be saved. 
If you’ve sufficiently digested the meaning of this message, and don’t
want to see this warning every time you access the Fix Photo dialog box,
go ahead and check the Don’t Show Again option. 
Figure 11-1:
Album
provides
multiple
ways to get
an image
into the 
Fix Photo
dialog box.
182
Part III: Finding, Viewing, and Editing Photos 

3. Click OK.
The warning disappears.
If you are fixing a previously edited photo, the warning will be a little 
different. It will say you are going to edit a previously edited photo,
and your changes will be written to that file. And if you’re editing a
Photoshop file with multiple layers, you will get an additional warning
that the edited photo will be flattened (a technical term that means
smushed into a single layer called a Background). Again, your
original image is still tucked away unaltered.
After you click OK, the Fix Photo dialog box appears, as shown in
Figure 11-3.
You can resize the Fix Photo dialog box. Place your cursor in the bottom
right corner of the dialog box until your cursor appears as diagonal
double headed arrow. Drag to size. I recommend clicking the Maximize
button in the upper-right corner to bring the dialog box to its max size.
That way your image is as large as possible for your editing session.
4. Select a viewing option from the tabs in the upper-left corner.
Album provides you with four viewing options, as follows:
• Original: Shows your image appeared when you first imported it
into Album. After you edit the image, the original view is the only
place you can view the original, unedited photo (unless you undo
your edits, which I describe later in this section).
After editing, the original photo is stored on your computer, but
doesn’t display in the Photo Well. The only version you can see in
the Photo Well is the edited version.
• Before: Displays the photo as it looked when you launched the Fix
Photo dialog box. This tab appears only if the photo has been pre-
viously edited.
Figure 11-2:

that your
original file
won’t be
edited.
183
Chapter 11: Making Quick Fixes

• After: Displays the photo with all of the current edits that you’ve
made since launching Fix Photo.
• Before & After: Shows both the Original (or Before) image and the
After version. This is a great view for a side-by-side comparison.
When you’ve found a viewing option that satisfies you, move on to the
following section, “Introducing editing tools.”
Introducing editing tools
After you’re in the Fix Photo dialog box and have chosen your viewing option,
you’re ready to start editing. Here are a couple of options you’ll find in the
dialog box to help you along the way:

Part III: Finding, Viewing, and Editing Photos 

 Zoom controls: By default, your image displays in a Fit On Screen view,
which fills the preview area with the entire image. Click the Zoom In
button to magnify your image. Click the Zoom Out button to reduce the
view of the image. You also can choose a preset magnification level from
the pop-up menu just to the right of the Zoom buttons. 
You can use the handy keyboard shortcuts. Press Ctrl+Plus sign to zoom
in. To zoom out press (surprise) Ctrl+Minus sign. To view your image at
100 percent, press Ctrl+Alt+0. To see your image in a Fit On Screen view,
press Ctrl+0. 
 Scroll bars: To view portions of the image that aren’t visible within
the preview window, drag the scroll bars on the right and bottom of the
window. You only see the scroll bars if the entire image doesn’t fit within
the preview window.
 Undo: If you make a mistake, you can easily undo it by clicking the Undo
button in the bottom right of the dialog box. And if you really didn’t mean
to undo, you can click the Redo button to bring your action back.
Feel free to use the standard keyboard shortcuts of Ctrl+X and Ctrl+Y, too.
 Cancel: Click Cancel (or press the Esc button) to leave the Fix Photo
dialog box without accepting any adjustments.
 Revert to Original: Click the curved blue arrow at the bottom of the
dialog box to revert to the original image as it looked when you first
imported it into Album. 
This option wipes out all previously edited versions of the file, and
reverts only to the original.
 Help: If you’re lost and need assistance, click the Help button in the
bottom-right corner of the dialog box. The online Help file launches in
your browser. For more on using Help, see Chapter 2.
All you ever wanted to 
know about reverting
Here are a few other points to keep in mind about reverting to previous incar-
nations of your edited images:
 All edits are made to a copy of your image, which is saved as a file called
“filename_edited” and placed in the same folder as the original photo.
The original photo is left untouched. After you edit a photo, it is the only
version that displays in the Photo Well.
 If later on, you decide the edited version just isn’t cutting it, you can
choose Edit➪Revert to Original.
185
Chapter 11: Making Quick Fixes

 If you feel the edited version is just so much better than the original ever
was and you don’t want to waste disk space saving the original, choose
Edit➪Replace Original with Edited. That command will overwrite the
original and leave you with only the edited file.
For more on managing your images, see Chapter 7.
Quick and Dirty Edits with
Single Click Fixes
The quickest and easiest edits to make in the Fix Photo dialog box are what
are called Single Click Fixes. These are automatic edits, meaning you really
have no say-so in how Album applies them.
You click the Fix you want to apply, and an algorithm (or mathematical for-
mula) churns. Then, boom, the edit is applied. 
With Single Click Fixes, you’re putting your trust in Album’s hands. Often, the
quality of your images is improved. 
In image editing, there is no right or wrong. The most important factor in
whether an edit is good is what your eye perceives and likes or dislikes. The
contrast and color may look great to you and downright lousy to someone else.
If you’re editing images to please yourself, that’s all that matters. If you’re edit-
ing images to please someone else, well, maybe the two of you can reach a
happy compromise. 
One thing to keep in mind. Although your image may benefit nicely from
using one of the automatic fixes (Auto Color, Auto Levels, or Auto Contrast),
using more than one probably won’t make the image look any better. In fact,
it may make it look worse. Feel free to go ahead and experiment. That’s why
the Undo button is in close proximity.
Here are the steps to apply a Single Click Fix:
1. If your photo isn’t already displayed in the Fix Photo dialog box,
select it in the Photo Well. Then choose Edit➪Fix Photo.
Or simply double-click the image once to enlarge the view and double-
click again to bring it into the Fix Photo dialog box.
2. Select the Single Click Fix option in the top right of the Fix Photo
dialog box.
186
Part III: Finding, Viewing, and Editing Photos 

3. Choose one of the following options:
• Auto Color: This option fixes two problems. First it removes
color casts and adjusts the color balance of an image. Your image
has a color cast if its image looks too red, as in Figure 11-4 or too
blue, as shown in Color Plate 11-1 of the color insert. It also cor-
rects oversaturated (neon like) or washed out colors, as shown in
Figure 11-4. The black-and-white figures just don’t do this editing
command any justice.
• Auto Levels: This command lightens the highlights and darkens
the shadows in a photo. In other words, it automatically improves
the contrast of an image, shown in Figure 11-5. This algorithm works
by defining the lightest pixels as white, the darkest pixels as black,
and redistributing the gray, or midtone, pixels in between.
Figure 11-4:
An image
with a 
nasty red 
color cast 
(top) gets
improved
with Auto
Color
(bottom).
187
Chapter 11: Making Quick Fixes

Beware that although adjusting Auto Levels may vastly improve the con-
trast quality, it can sometimes also produce an undesirable color cast.
• Auto Contrast: This option also lightens the highlights and darkens
the shadows of an image. It does so by converting the lightest pixels
white, and the darkest pixels black. This option may not be quite as
effective in improving the contrast, but it also preserves the color
balance of an image and doesn’t cause any unsightly color casts. It
works especially well with hazy images like the New York City sky-
line shown in Figure 11-6. To see the Auto Contrast fix work its
magic on a color image, check out Color Plate 11-2.
Try using Auto Levels first, and if it causes a color cast, click Undo and
apply Auto Contrast instead.
Figure 11-5:
Auto Levels
can improve
the contrast
of an image,
but can

unwanted
color cast.
188
Part III: Finding, Viewing, and Editing Photos 

• Sharpen: This command adds clarity to an image by sharpening
the edges of objects in the photo, as shown in Figure 11-7.
Sharpening is a technique that increases the contrast between
pixels to give the illusion of improved focus. Try applying the
Sharpen fix more than once to further improve a fuzzy picture.
Don’t get too carried away, however. It can’t take a photo that was shot
out of focus and make it look like it was taken on a tripod. In fact, you
can oversharpen an image. If it starts looking grainy, you know you’ve
gone too far. So hurry and click Undo.
4. Choose the Before and After tab in the top left of the dialog box and
compare the original unedited image with the edited version.
5. If the image looks better, click OK to exit the Fix Photo dialog box,
unless you have more editing to do. 
The edited image replaces the original image in the Photo Well.

189
Chapter 11: Making Quick Fixes

If any of the Single Click Fixes you choose do not produce a satisfactory
result, click the Undo button. That particular fix may be unsuitable for
the particular correction needed, or it may just be beyond its capability.
Instead, try one of the manual adjustments described in the next section,
“Using Manual Fixes.” Manual fixes take a little more effort on your part but
may just provide the enhancement you need.
Using Manual Fixes
If you applied a Single Click Fix and it didn’t work out (or maybe it did, but your
image still needs a little more help), you can enter the world of manual image
fixes. I must say, that there isn’t a whole lot of manual labor involved, unless
you consider moving a handle or slider a strenuous or tedious maneuver. 
Manual fixes give you more control in the editing process by allowing you to
set the amount of adjustment necessary. Don’t be afraid to experiment and
see what happens. As I mentioned earlier, that’s what the Undo, or if neces-
sary the Cancel, buttons are there for — to bail you out in times of editing
gone bad.

Rotating images
When importing your images in Album, you may find that a number of them
need to be rotated. Maybe you turned your camera to fit your subject in the
viewfinder or you scanned your image sideways in order to get it to fit on the
scanning bed. Well, no worries. One of the easiest and most common editing
functions is rotating.
In the Fix Photo dialog box
To rotate your image in the Fix Photo dialog box:
1. Select the photo in the Photo Well and choose Edit➪Fix Photo.
You also can double-click the photo twice to bring it into the Fix Photo
dialog box.
For the remaining discussion on manual adjustments, I assume your
image is in the Fix Photo dialog box and ready to go.
2. Click the Rotate Left or Rotate Right button located in the bottom,
shown in Figure 11-8. 
You may have to click more than once to get your photo oriented
correctly. 
3. After you rotate the image to your liking, simply click OK to exit the
Fix Photo dialog box. 
Album saves an edited (in this case rotated) copy of your original image.
In the Photo Well
You also can rotate a photo right in the Photo Well. This option is actually
better if you have several photos that need rotating because you can select
and rotate multiple photos all at the same time. 
Figure 11-8:
Rotating

the simplest
and most
popular edit.
191
Chapter 11: Making Quick Fixes

One important difference between rotating images in the Photo Well as
opposed to using the Fix Photo dialog box: If you rotate the photos in the
Photo Well, the rotation is done and saved over the original file. A new edited
file is not created as it is in the Fix Photo dialog box. 
Here’s how to rotate images using the Photo Well:
1. Select one or more photos.
2. Click the Rotate Left or Rotate Right button in the Options bar.
For a refresher on the Options bar, see Chapter 2.
Like many other commands in Album, there is more than one way to do the
same thing. You also can right-click the image and choose Rotate Right or
Rotate Left from the context-sensitive menu. Alternatively, you can choose
Edit➪Rotate Right or Edit➪Rotate Left. If you have selected multiple photos,
the command appears as Edit➪Rotate Selected Photos Right or Edit➪Rotate
Selected Photos Left.
Cropping photos
The second-most popular editing command is cropping — selectively getting
rid of part of the image. Sigh. How many times have I captured way too much
distracting background in a photograph? 
One of the cardinal rules of good composition is to get close to your subject.
Sometimes when shooting the image you may feel you need to get everything
in the shot, only to find later that when the image is cropped, it’s so much
stronger. It is always best to try and frame your subject when you take the
photo, but if that doesn’t happen, you also can crop it in Album.
Here are the steps to crop a photo in the Fix Photo dialog box:
1. Select Crop from the list of editing options in the top right.
A cropping rectangle appears on your image. Don’t worry, you’ll have
ample opportunity to adjust the handles so that the rectangle surrounds
the part of the image that you want to retain.
2. To maintain a desired ratio between the height and width of the
cropped image, choose one of several options from the Select Aspect
Ratio pop-up menu.
Choosing an Aspect Ratio isn’t the same thing as choosing an actual size.
Aspect ratio refers to the proportional relationship between height and
width. For example, a 4 x 6 aspect ratio is the same as a 2 x 3 aspect ratio. 
192
Part III: Finding, Viewing, and Editing Photos 

Choosing No Restriction allows total freedom in moving your cropping
handles. Selecting Use Photo Ratio keeps the aspect ratio to the stan-
dard rectangular snapshot format no matter what the actual size is.
3. Position your cursor on one of the handles of the cropping rectangle.
Drag that handle, and any others, to frame the portion of the photo
you want to retain.
4. To move the entire cropping rectangle, position your cursor inside the
cropping rectangle. When your cursor changes from an arrow to a
hand, drag the rectangle to your desired location on the image, as
shown in Figure 11-9.
Press the Plus sign key or the Minus sign key to make the cropping rec-
tangle larger or smaller. You also can press the arrows keys to move the
rectangle 1 pixel in any direction. Press Shift with an arrow key to move
the rectangle 10 pixels in any direction. Luckily, these keyboard short-
cuts also work with the red eye rectangle, described in “Removing the
dreaded red eye” later in this chapter.
5. When you’ve framed the image satisfactorily, click the Apply Crop
button.
You also can press Enter on your keyboard or double-click inside the
rectangle.
6. Click OK to exit the Fix Photo dialog box.
The cropped image appears, as shown in Figure 11-10.
Figure 11-9:
Adjust the

rectangle to
frame your
image.
193
Chapter 11: Making Quick Fixes

If you accidentally chop off someone’s body part, you can always click the
Undo button. And if you click the Crop button and decide you don’t want to
crop after all, simply click the Single Click Fix button. The cropping rectangle
disappears, and you’ll be back at square one.
When you crop an image in any computer program, you are making the image
smaller because you are eliminating pixels. Make sure you have sufficient res-
olution to print the image at the size you want, or else you may not be happy
with the quality. For more on resolution, see Chapter 3.
Removing the dreaded red eye 
Digital photographers adore the ability to remove nasty red eye from pic-
tures. Red eye occurs when light from a camera’s flash bounces off the back
Figure 11-10:
The photo
on the top is
fine, but the
cropped
image
(bottom)
really
shines.
194
Part III: Finding, Viewing, and Editing Photos 

of the retina of the eye and back into the camera’s lens. It often occurs in
low lighting situations and/or when the flash is too close to the lens of the
camera, as is often the case with digital and point-and-shoot cameras. 
At the source, you can prevent red eye by making sure your camera is set
to no red eye mode. Check your documentation to see if your camera has
the capability. You also can ask your subjects to look away from the camera.
If you are shooting indoors, turn on all the lights in the room. This will help
shrink the pupils of the eye. You also can ensure that the flash of your camera
is mounted above or to the side of the lens. If you can’t move (or remove) the
flash (at least not without duct tape), Album offers an easy solution after the
fact. Enter the Fix Photo dialog box.
To remove red eye, follow these simple steps in the Fix Photo dialog box:
1. Using the Zoom In button and the scroll bars, navigate to the offend-
ing red eyes.
2. Click the Red Eye Removal button in the Editing Options list in the
upper-right side of the Fix Photo dialog box.
A rectangle appears on the image preview, as shown in Figure 11-11.

3. Adjust the rectangle by placing your cursor (which appears as a
double-headed arrow) and dragging the handles to size the rectangle. 
You can place your cursor inside the rectangle and drag with the hand
icon to move it. Frame the offending eyes fairly tightly.
4. When you have adjusted the rectangle, click the Red Eye Removal
button again. Like cropping, you also can press the Enter key or
double-click inside the rectangle.
If you’re lucky, the red eyes have been replaced with black pupils once
again, as seen in Figure 11-12. 
To really see the great red eye removal effort of Album, check out Color
Plate 11-4 in the color insert. Album not only got rid of the little girl’s red
eyes, but also fixed the eyes on the Siamese kitten.
If your eyes are still looking a tad eerie, first try repeating the steps. On
some images, I found that I had to do it two or three times before I com-
pletely got rid of the red. If it still doesn’t work, you may require the extra
strength editing power of Photoshop Elements or Photoshop. See more
on editing in these two programs in Chapter 12.

Improving contrast with
Brightness and Contrast
If you tried the Single Click Fixes to adjust contrast and it didn’t quite cut
the mustard, you may need a little manual adjusting with the Brightness and
Contrast controls. 
When I talk about brightness, I’m referring to the lightness or darkness of a
photo. Contrast, on the other hand, refers to the relationship between the
light and dark areas of a photo. In some instances you may want to play with
these adjustments to get a special mood or effect, but most often you should
use this tool to correct the exposure of the photo. A photo with too little con-
trast looks flat and dull. A photo with too much contrast lacks details in the
highlights and shadows.
If you are making brightness and contrast adjustments on a photo that will
ultimately be printed, be sure and run some test prints before saving the
edits. Often an image may look fine on-screen, only to find it looks darker
when printed.
You may also find that adjusting the brightness and contrast settings doesn’t
really improve your image much after all. That may be partly due to the fact
that brightness and contrast makes uniform adjustments to your overall image.
It makes no discretion to particular problem areas of the image. If you experi-
ence this problem, try canceling the adjustments and using the Lighting edit-
ing option instead. You may find that lightening just the shadows and
darkening just the overexposed areas are better remedies.
Here are the steps to manually adjust the brightness and contrast:
1. Select the Brightness and Contrast editing option from the list in the
top right of the Fix Photo dialog box, shown in Figure 11-13.
2. Drag the brightness slider to the right to lighten the photo or to the
left to darken the photo.
You also can enter a value between –100 and 100. In my image, I moved
the Brightness slider to the left to –20 to darken it.
3. Drag the contrast slider to the right to increase the contrast in the
photo or to the left to decrease it.
Again, you also can enter a value between –100 and 100. In my example
(shown in Figure 11-14), I moved the contrast slider to the right to 15 to
give it more contrast.
4. Click OK to exit the Fix Photo dialog box.

Part III: Finding, Viewing, and Editing Photos 

Fixing shadows and highlights
with the Lighting option
You can use the Lighting option in the Fix Photo dialog box to fix highlights
and shadows in your images.
Lightening shadows
In photos taken in bright light, such as at the beach or in the snow on a sunny
day, shadows often lose any sign of detail. At the source, you can lighten these
shadows by using the Fill Flash mode on your camera. This mode activates the
flash on your camera regardless of the available light, providing additional
light in those shadowy areas and preserving some detail. 
After the fact, you can use the Fill Flash setting on Album’s Lighting option.
To lighten shadows using the Fill Flash setting, follow these steps:
1. Select the Lighting editing option from the list in the top right of the
Fix Photo dialog box.
2. Drag the Fill Flash slider from Darker to Lighter. You also can enter a
value between 0 and 100.
Drag the slider until you see detail in the shadows, shown in Figure 11-15,
but not so much that your shadows all turn gray. Also check out the Fill
Flash in action in Color Plate 11-3.
3. Click OK to exit the Fix Photo dialog box.
Adjusting the backlighting
Photos that have been shot with backlighting can be especially dramatic.
Backlighting means that the light source is behind your subject. Think of a sil-
houette of a person walking on the beach at sunset. But if the light source is
strong, such as midday, and you’re trying to capture detail in all areas of the
photo, backlighting can cause two problems:
 The area surrounding the subject gets overexposed (too light).
 Your subject gets underexposed (too dark).
Either way, you’re losing detail somewhere. You can correct this problem at
the source easily by either moving yourself or your subject so the light source
isn’t directly behind the subject. Or you can try using a flash. (For the flash to
be effective, you will probably need to be fairly close to your subject, though.)
For close-up shots, you also can use a white reflector card (like poster board)
to reflect light onto your subject.
199
Chapter 11: Making Quick Fixes

After the fact, you can use the Backlighting setting in Album to help darken
those overexposed areas, as shown in Figure 11-16. Use the Fill Flash option
described above to lighten the underexposed portions of the same image.
To adjust the backlighting in an image, follow these steps:
1. Select the Lighting editing option from the list at the upper-right
corner of the Fix Photo dialog box.
2. Drag the Backlighting slider from Lighter to Darker. You also can
enter a value between 0 and 100.
3. Click OK to exit the Fix Photo dialog box.
Intensifying with Color Saturation
Saturation refers to the intensity of the color in an image. When colors look
washed out, they are undersaturated. If the colors are oversaturated, they
appear almost neon like. A happy medium between the two is the ideal.
An easy way to turn a color image into a black-and-white (or grayscale) photo
is to adjust the saturation. Drag the saturation slider all the way to the left
until the color has been removed. Check out Color Plate 11-7 to see this tech-
nique in action. Read the following steps for more details.
Figure 11-15:
Adjusting
with the Fill
Flash option

Part III: Finding, Viewing, and Editing Photos 

To manually adjust the color saturation, follow these steps:
1. Select Color Saturation from the editing options list in the top-right
side of the Fix Photo dialog box.
2. Drag the Saturation slider to the right to increase the saturation of
colors in the photo or to the left to decrease it. 
You also can enter a value between –100 and 100. In my example, I
moved the slider to 45 to increase the saturation.
3. If your image is improved, as shown in Figure 11-17, click OK to exit
the Fix Photo dialog box.
The grayscale images shown here make it hard to illicit the oohs and
aahs that are so nice to hear when demonstrating a color technique.
Open an image in your catalog that needs some saturation help and
see for yourself.

 Exporting with drag and drop
A
lbum is spectacular. It enables you to organize your pictures, stay orga-
nized, become more productive, and even create some fun and useful
projects. 
If I have any criticism, it’s that the editing tools in Album don’t always do
the trick if my images are particularly problematic. Don’t get me wrong; for the
most part, Album is great for getting rid of red eye or improving the contrast of
a photo. But if you have an image that you really need to overhaul, you may
require the editing horsepower of a full-fledged image-editing program. 
Comparing Photoshop Elements 
and Photoshop
If you’re interested in purchasing an external digital-imaging application, I
highly recommend either Photoshop Elements or Photoshop, depending on
your needs and budget. Trust me; I’m not being paid to endorse these prod-
ucts. It’s just that if you use either of these Adobe products you’ll have the
benefit of seamless integration with Album. You can purchase Elements for
about $90. Photoshop will set you back a hefty $600 or so. (Ouch.) If you’re
not sure whether you want to make the investment, download a 30-day, fully-
functioning trial version of either program from www.adobe.com.

If you’re not familiar with either of these programs, you may wonder which
one is appropriate for your needs and why there is such a vast difference
between one program that runs about the cost of two dinners out and
another that is about the cost of two car payments.
Elements
Elements is Adobe’s amateur photographer-level imaging program. Elements
has a large toolbox, as shown in Figure 12-1, filled with selection, color cor-
rection, and retouching tools. Here are a few other things you can do with
Elements:
 Size your images.
 Change color modes. Color modes define the color values used to dis-
play an image and affect the number of colors shown, the size of the
files, and other characteristics.
 Apply color, shapes, and stylized text to your images.
 Merge photos and construct photo collages using layering techniques.
 Add bevels, shadows, glows, and other special effects and filters to jazz
up your images.
It’s actually quite amazing that a program with a price of $90 can do all this
and more. Check out Color Plate 12-5 to see this program in action.

204
Part III: Finding, Viewing, and Editing Photos 

Photoshop
Photoshop is Adobe’s professional photographer/graphic designer–level
image editor. It can do everything that Elements can, of course, plus more.
Much, more. In fact, Photoshop stops just short of brewing and serving you
a latte.
Photoshop has more tools and commands for selecting, color correction,
and retouching. The program also includes ImageReady, which is Adobe’s
Web graphics program. With ImageReady, you can easily construct anima-
tions, slices, rollovers, and image maps. All this power comes with a price,
however. Not just the price tag, but also the learning curve. 
Elements gives you a palette with Hints and Recipes (instructions to perform
certain techniques), but Photoshop leaves you to your own devices. This
program isn’t for a once-a-month hobbyist.
Specifying an External 
Image Editor in Album
If you have another digital-imaging application installed on your computer,
you can jump to that application directly from Album to edit your images. But
what if you’re lucky enough to have more than one image editor installed on
your system? Well, you can instruct Album to choose one over the other by
setting it as the default editor in the Preferences file. Here’s how:
1. Choose Edit➪Preferences.
2. Select the Editing category on the left side of the Preferences dialog
box, shown in Figure 12-2.
3. If you have an Adobe image-editing program, choose either
Photoshop Elements 2.0 or later or Photoshop 6.0 or later.
If you have another image-editing program, you have two choices:
• Default Application for File Type: This option launches the image-
editing program associated with the type of file you have selected.
During the installation of programs like Elements and Photoshop,
you have the option of associating the particular application with
various file types. For example, if you are in Windows Explorer or
at the desktop whenever you double-click a TIFF or JPEG, you can
specify that Elements is launched. Similarly, if you are working in
Album and want to externally edit a TIFF or JPEG, Album will auto-
matically launch Elements.
205
Chapter 12: Extra-Strength Editing

• Choose Application: Click the Browse button and select the image
editor you want Album to launch.
4. Click OK to close the Preferences dialog box.
Fixing a Photo in an External
Image Editor
After you’ve established which image editor you want Album to jump to (as
described in the preceding section), you’re ready to, well, jump. You can fix a
photo in an external image editor a couple of ways — either directly from the
Photo Well or via the Fix Photo dialog box. 
Editing in Elements or Photoshop
Here are the steps for launching either Photoshop Elements or Photoshop:
1. Select a photo in the Photo Well.
2. Choose one of these methods to launch the editor:
Figure 12-2:
You can
choose your

206
Part III: Finding, Viewing, and Editing Photos 

• Choose Edit➪Edit with (your designated image editor). The
name that appears in the menu depends on whether you chose
Elements or Photoshop as your editor in the Preferences dialog
box (as described in “Specifying an External Image Editor in
Album” earlier in this chapter).
• Click the Fix Photo button in the Options bar. Then click the Edit
With button at the bottom of the Fix Photo dialog box, as shown in
Figure 12-3.
A warning message appears telling you that you’re editing a copy of the
image and not the original.
3. Click OK to get rid of this warning. 
Album launches the editor, and your image is opened and ready to be
improved. Meanwhile, in Album, a red lock icon with a label that says,
“Edit in Progress” appears on the image thumbnail (shown in Figure 12-4)
while you’re editing the photo in your external editor. This lock remains
on the image until you close it in your editor.
4. Edit the photo in either Elements or Photoshop.
If you got here accidentally or you’ve changed your mind and want to
cancel your external editing session, return to Album and choose
Edit➪Cancel External Edit.
Figure 12-3:
You can

207
Chapter 12: Extra-Strength Editing

Although you can jump to Image Ready from Photoshop, you can’t use
Image Ready on an image you opened from Album.
5. Choose File➪Save and close the photo in your image editor. 
In either Elements or Photoshop, you also can choose the File➪
Save As command and rename the edited photo (for example “filename_
edited.jpg”). If you use this option, when you return to Album you have
the choice of saving the edited photo as (see Figure 12-5)
• An edited copy of the original
• A new photo
If you rename the file in Photoshop, rather than Elements, when you
return to Album you have the additional choice of saving the edited
photo as (see Figure 12-6):
• A copy of the original in its original file format
• A copy of the original as a Photoshop (PSD) file
• A new Photoshop (PSD) file with a new name
• Nothing — not saving it at all
6. Return to Album.
The red lock icon goes away, and the fixed photo is automatically
updated in Album.

If you don’t want to keep the edits you made, choose Edit➪Undo External Edit. 
Editing in an application other
than Elements or Photoshop
If you have an external image editor other than Elements or Photoshop, such
as CorelPAINT, you can jump to that application from Album. All of the steps
are identical except that when it comes to saving the file in the external
image editor. Here are the steps to follow:
Figure 12-6:

209
Chapter 12: Extra-Strength Editing

1. Select a photo in the Photo Well.
2. Choose one of these methods to launch the editor:
• Choose Edit➪Edit with Editor (where Editor represents your desig-
nated image editor). The name that appears in the menu depends
on what editor you chose in the Preferences dialog box (as described
in “Specifying an External Image Editor in Album” earlier in this
chapter).
• Click the Fix Photo button in the Options bar. Then click the Edit
With button at the bottom of the Fix Photo dialog box (refer to
Figure 12-4).
A warning message appears, telling you that you’re editing a copy of the
image and not the original. 
3. Click OK to rid yourself of this warning. 
Album then launches the editor, and your image is opened and ready to
be improved.
4. Perform your editing voodoo.
5. Choose File➪Save in the external image editor.
You must save the edited photo without changing the filename in any
way. Don’t even add the word “edited” after the name. If you save the file
with a different name, Album will not be able to find the photo automati-
cally. You will have to look for the photo using the Get Photos command
(for more details on getting photos, see Chapter 4).
6. Return to Album.
7. Choose Edit➪Finish External Edit.
By doing so, you complete the external editing process, and the changed
photo appears in the Photo Well in Album.
You also can select the photo in the Photo Well; right-click the image and
choose Finish External Edit from the context-sensitive menu.
If you don’t want to retain the edits, you can choose Edit➪Undo External
Edit. You also can cancel the process midstream by choosing Edit➪Cancel
External Edit in Album.
Bringing Photos into Other Applications
When your photos are all coiffed and ready to be used, you may want to
bring them into another application. Maybe you want to insert the image into
a Word memo or a PowerPoint presentation. Or maybe you want to use the
210
Part III: Finding, Viewing, and Editing Photos 

photo in a collage in Elements. Of course you can always go the traditional
route and either insert or open the image in the destination program. But you
also can copy and paste, export, or drag and drop between Album and many
applications.
Album won’t keep track of any changes you make to the images in other
applications unless you reimport them to Album. If you need to make changes
to the images before using them, be sure to read the previous section. It gives
you all the necessary know-how to do so properly.
Copying and pasting to other applications
Here are the short and simple steps to copy photos to other applications:
1. In Album, select one or more photos in the Photo Well. 
Note that you also can select video clips.
2. Choose Edit➪Copy in Album.
3. Go to your destination application and choose Edit➪Paste into an
open file, shown in Figure 12-7.

211
Chapter 12: Extra-Strength Editing

Exporting images
I feel that using the Export command is better than copying and pasting if
you want to get an image ready for use in another program. When you export
photos, you can control file formats, size, and quality, depending on how you
plan to use the image. For more on the characteristics of each file format and
associated options, see Chapter 3.
You can only export photos using the Export command. It doesn’t apply to
creations. For more on creating and saving creations, see Chapter 17.
Here are the steps you need to export an image:
1. Select the images you want to export.
You can select more than one image at a time.
2. Choose File➪Export.
The Export Selected Items dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 12-8.
3. Select your desired file format in the File Type area.
You have a choice between Original Format, JPEG, PNG, TIFF and PSD.
For everything you’ve ever wanted to know about file formats, check out
Chapter 3.
4. Choose a Size for your image.
The Photo Size option keeps your image at its original dimensions. You
can choose from a number of preset sizes, as well. Choose Custom to
enter in a specific height and width in pixels.
Although Album lets you enter any custom size you want, it retains the
original proportions of the image. As a result, you may get either your
desired height or width, but not both. For example, if you enter a custom
size of 200 x 200 pixels and your original photo is rectangular, you may
end up with a size of 200 x 132 pixels.
5. If you selected JPEG in Step 3, drag the Quality slider to your desired
quality setting.
The Quality slider offers 13 compression settings. The JPEG compres-
sion is a trade-off between file size and quality. Drag to the left to export
a smaller, lower-quality image. Drag to the right to export a larger,
higher-quality photo. 
The compression scheme used by JPEGs is lossy, which means that it
compresses images by deleting image data, which it later remanufac-
tures. Use the setting with the highest quality that you possibly can get
away with so that you have less loss of detail in your image.
6. In the Location area of the dialog box, either accept the path listed or
click the Browse button to navigate to the location on your computer
where you want to store the image(s).
212
Part III: Finding, Viewing, and Editing Photos 

7. In the Filenames area of the dialog box, click Original Names or
Common Base Name.
If you choose Common Base Name, type the name you want in
the field. Album then adds sequential numbers to your base name
for all exported photos. For example, if you are exporting a bunch
of photos from the latest Alpaca shearing show, you may want to give
the base name of Alpacas. Each photo you export will then be named
Alpacas-1.jpg, Alpacas-2.jpg, and so on. 
8. When you have established your options, click the Export button.
A progress bar shows the saving process. After a couple seconds, a mes-
sage appears saying you have successfully exported your images. 
9. Click OK.
You’re transported back to the Photo Well.
Dragging and dropping into 
other applications
If copying and pasting or using the Export command is too tedious for you,
you can always drag and drop images from Album’s Photo Well into other
applications. 
Figure 12-8:
The Export
dialog box
offers
options for
file format,
size, and

213
Chapter 12: Extra-Strength Editing

Simply select the photo in the Photo Well, and drag the image from the Photo
Well to your destination application. This technique works if you want to
drag and drop an image into an image editor (like Elements), a page layout
program (like Adobe InDesign), a word processor (such as Word), or a pre-
sentation program (such as PowerPoint). 
Not all applications support the drag-and-drop method, however. If you see a
nasty No symbol (a circle with a slashed line) when you try to drag and drop,
that’s a sign that what you’re trying to do won’t work. 
By the way, you also can drag an image from the Photo Well directly onto your
desktop. Here are a few points to remember about dragging and dropping:
 If you are dragging and dropping into Elements or Photoshop, you don’t
even need to have an open file. You can just drag the image directly into
the application itself, and the file opens automatically in a new window.
 You don’t have any options in the size, quality, or format of the exported
file. So drag and drop an image only if you are planning on using the
image in its current state in Album.
 You also can drag photos from the desktop into the Photo Well in
Album. When you drag and drop the photo, the Getting Photos dialog
box appears with a preview of the photo. Album then creates a new file
with the image data, which appears in the Photo Well.

 Sharing files via e-mail
 Setting your e-mail preferences
 Creating a contact book
 E-mailing files
A
lbum makes it easy for you to share your files in many fun and high-
tech ways. You can create albums, snazzy slide shows, calendars, or
share your files online with at Shutterfly.com. If your recipients just want
the images unadorned so that they can let their own creative juices flow
and make their own masterpieces, sending the files as plain, old e-mail
attachments fits the bill.
Album walks you through the process of preparing and e-mailing your files,
making it quick, simple, and fool-proof. So share those photos you’ve been
hoarding.
Sharing Photos Via E-Mail
About the only thing Album doesn’t do in e-mailing your files is read your
mind and type the e-mail message. It creates the attachments, sets up your
desired recipients, and launches your e-mail client.
The most important things to keep in mind when e-mailing photos are
file size and the Internet connection speed of your recipient. You want
the file size to be small enough that your recipient can download it fairly
quickly, without using your name in vain, especially if the recipient has a 
dial-up connection.

218
Part IV: Sharing and Printing Photos 
If your recipient is lucky enough to have a high-speed connection, like a DSL,
cable, or T1 line, you can get away with e-mailing larger files. Of course, make
sure your connection is high-speed as well.
Setting Up Album for E-Mail
Before you can start e-mailing photos and even creations (see Chapter 18),
you need to establish your e-mail preferences and set up your contact book
with your recipients.
Setting your preferences
Follow these steps to establish your e-mail preferences:
1. Choose Edit➪Preferences.
2. Select E-mail from the list on the left side of the dialog box, as shown
in Figure 13-1.
Avoiding Web-based e-mail problems
Many Web-based e-mail providers limit the
space on their Web servers for storing and
sending messages. Some Web servers limit the
size of files you can send, as well. For example,
Yahoo! Mail has a 6MB limit for individual mail-
boxes. Yahoo! Mail users can send and receive
attachments up to 3MB in size. Send two e-mail
messages, each with a big picture attached,
and you can pat yourself on the back — you
have officially flooded your buddy’s inbox, and
all other incoming messages will bounce back
to the sender. Good job.
Many ISPs don’t have any limits on incoming
and outgoing messages — as long as you’re
using an e-mail client such as Outlook to accept
messages. However, if you check e-mail from
the Web (say, while you’re traveling), your mail-
box has a limited capacity.
On the other hand, you want a large enough
pixel dimension in the photo so that the image
displays with good quality, and it doesn’t leave
your sister in Duluth scratching her head saying,
“Was that a photo of Aunt Mabel or Duke the
wonder dog?” Therefore, be sure to check out
Chapter 3 to learn the vitals about pixel dimen-
sion and resolution. Also, if you need to send
high-quality images (which translates to high-
resolution, large files) to family and friends, 
you also can try uploading them to a Web photo-
sharing site like Shutterfly.com. Sure, it might
take your friends and family members awhile to
download the image, but at least you won’t bog
down their e-mail accounts.

3. Choose your default e-mail client from the Send E-mail Using pop-up
menu.
If you use America Online (AOL), see the sidebar “Psst . . . Confidential
for AOL users” later in this chapter for special instructions. Album can
create e-mail messages with AOL, Eudora, Hotmail, Outlook, and Outlook
Express. If you use another e-mail client, or if Album has problems gen-
erating the e-mail message, select Other from the Client pop-up menu,
and your attachment will be saved to your hard drive. Then you can
open the saved file directly from your e-mail client.
You won’t need to change this setting again unless you want to choose a
different e-mail client.
4. Select a preset size from the Presets For pop-up menu. Here are your
options: 
• Big: This option creates high-quality photos with good resolutions.
The recipient can view large images on-screen with all the details
crisp and all the colors intact.
Quality comes with a down side — the file size will be large. Make
sure that your recipients can handle big files before choosing this
option. Give them a call and ask if they are capable of receiving
a file of a specific size. Consider this nicety a matter of simple
“netiquette.”

Chapter 13: Spreading Photographic Joy Electronically

When you choose a Preset size, the Maximum Photo Size (width
and height in pixel dimensions) and Quality settings display in the
Size and Quality section of the dialog box. This dialog box tells you
the size and quality associated with the Presets; you can change
these settings if you desire. See Step 5.
• Medium: This setting provides a good quality photo. You get an
average file size and decent detail in the image. This is Album’s
default setting and works fine for most attachments.
• Small: If you really need to squeeze the file size down to the mini-
mum, choose this size. File sizes will be tiny, and the quality won’t
be that great. But what the heck — the files will download in a
flash.
• Leave As Is: If you want to keep the photo’s original settings, this
is the option for you. If you choose this setting, the Maximum
Photo Size and Quality options are not available. If you want to
send your recipient a high-resolution image that will be used for
optimum quality printing, make sure and select this option.
In this case, it is really, really important that the recipient has a
high-speed connection. Also make sure that your file size doesn’t
exceed any limits placed by the recipient’s ISP.
5. If you want to alter the default size associated with the Presets, choose
your desired pixel dimension from the Maximum Photo Size pop-up
menu.
Don’t worry; these size settings aren’t written in stone. Even though the
preference settings become the defaults, you can change the size set-
tings for individual e-mail attachments as you send them.
6. You also can adjust the default Quality setting. Drag the Quality slider
to the left to export a smaller file with lower quality and detail. Drag
to the right for a larger file with higher quality and detail.
The Quality slider determines how much compression is applied to the
image. The more compression, the smaller the file, but the poorer the
quality — and vice-versa. For more details on quality and compression,
see Chapter 3.
7. Click OK to save the settings and exit the Preferences dialog box.
You can now barrage your family and friends with photo attached
e-mails.
Creating your contact book
Your contact book is just like your little black book of friends who like pic-
tures. You should include everyone and anyone you plan on sending files to.
220
Part IV: Sharing and Printing Photos 

When you enter e-mail addresses in the book, you can easily send e-mail mes-
sages to those people. Note that this contact book is unique to Album. You
cannot exchange it with other applications, including your e-mail client.
Album keeps a record of who you’ve e-mailed photos and even what images
were sent. You can actually search for files based on who you have e-mailed
them to. For details on finding photos, see Chapter 8.
If you often e-mail files to the same group of people, you can set up a group in
the contact book to make your e-mailing process even more productive.
Here are the steps to create your contact book:
1. Choose View➪Contact Book.
The Contact Book dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 13-2.
2. To add a person, click the New Contact button.
The New Contact dialog box appears.
3. Enter the person’s name and e-mail address, as shown in Figure 13-3.
Click the Address tab to add a mailing address and phone number, if
desired.
Repeat Step 3 to add all the people you want to include.

E-Mailing Photos and Creations
After you’ve established your e-mail preferences, you’re ready to prepare
your attachments and send the messages. The only thing left to decide is
which of your great images, video clips, audio clips, and creations you want
to share. The following steps help you with the mechanics of sending your
e-mail — the attachment choices are up to you:

Psst . . . Confidential to Hotmail users
If you are a Hotmail user, you may encounter a
problem if you try and attach multiple individual
attachments. Try combining all of your individ-
ual photos into a PDF slide show. Also, if you are
using Hotmail to e-mail an attachment for the
first time, you may be asked to download and
install the Hotmail Attachments Control. By all
means, say Yes and get this file installed.

5. In the File Type area, choose a file format for the attachment: 
• PDF slide show: This option creates a PDF document in which
your selected images are combined into a single slide show. This is
a great way to e-mail multiple photos because they’re bundled in
one neat little package. It is also handy if you, or your recipient,
use Web mail and there are limits to the number of attachments
you can send or receive.
This is a toned-down version of other slide show capabilities
offered by Album. You won’t be able to add all the bells and whis-
tles (styles, music, captions, and so on) that you can when making
a slide show using the Creations Wizard. For more on creations,
see Chapter 18. Enter a name for your PDF file.
PDF (Portable Document Format) is a universal file format that can
be read on any computer platform, without the need for any spe-
cial programs except Adobe Acrobat Reader. Acrobat Reader is
free and can be downloaded from www.adobe.com. For details on
the PDF format, see Chapter 3.
• Individual Attachments: Select this option to send each photo as a
separate attachment. By default, the file formats of all attachments
are converted to the JPEG format (if they aren’t JPEGs already). If
you want to keep your photos in their original file formats, dese-
lect the Convert Photos to JPEGs check box. For more on file for-
mats, see Chapter 3.
If you’re attaching a creation, you don’t get to choose between PDF
and an individual attachment. It is what it is. You can provide a name
for the file, though. If you’re attaching an audio clip, you can send
the file only as an individual attachment, not as a PDF.

6. Choose a size for your attachment or leave the default setting as is.
If you have already set up your e-mail preferences, your default setting is
displayed in the Size field. If you want to choose a different setting for this
attachment, select the setting from the Size pop-up menu (described in
“Setting your preferences,” earlier in this chapter). Click the Customize
button to open the E-mail Preferences dialog box, in which you can
change your default preferences.
If you’re attaching a creation, you have the choice between optimizing
your file for viewing on-screen, optimizing your file for printing, or using
full resolution. For details on each option, see Chapter 18.
If you’re attaching an audio or video clip, you don’t have any size and
quality options.

Getting Your Images on Paper
In This Chapter
 Getting to know your printer
 Establishing your print options
 Printing single photos, picture packages, and contact sheets
 Printing creations
 Getting better prints
F
or some reason, printing in general seems be a thorn in the side of most
computer users. Either your print doesn’t match what you see on-screen,
the quality of the print is marginal, or worse, the print simply doesn’t want to
emerge from the printer. This chapter helps you avoid these unhappy scenar-
ios. This chapter helps you get a handle on these and other ways of improv-
ing your prints, demystifying the printing process along the way.
Basics on Getting High-Quality Prints
Here’s a preview of what you can do to ensure that you get quality prints
every time:
 Get friendly with your printer. Learn everything you can about it.
 Be sure you follow the directions and establish the correct printing
options to get your prints. Know what options are best for different 
formats — single prints, contact sheets, cards, calendars, and so on.
 Make absolutely certain you have the best source material possible. If
your image is of lousy quality, you’re not going to get a great print, no
matter what you do. You need to make sure your images have sufficient
resolution, are saved in the correct file format, and are cleaned up and
fixed of any flaws.
 Make sure you use good quality equipment and materials. This
includes everything from your printer to your paper to ink.

Getting Intimate with Your Printer
If you print your photos on your home printer, Album provides several
options. For example, you can print single prints, picture packages, or cre-
ations. But before you can get to the fun stuff, you really have to get to know
your printer:
 Read the manual. If you’ve been using your printer for awhile, you
may have a good handle on its strengths and shortcomings, but have
you really put the printer through the paces? To really understand your
printer, you should — please don’t slam the book shut — read your
manual. I know, it can be tedious and not very enjoyable, but you never
know what good info and recommendations you may glean from it. 
 Test, test, and test some more. I don’t mean, stick a piece of paper in the
printer and see whether something is printed on it when it comes out the
other end. I mean really make your printer jump through some hoops. Try
each and every print setting. Try different combinations of options. Try
different kinds of papers. Label each print with the settings, options and
kind of paper and compare the results. What setting works best with
photos? What setting is best for glossy paper? Is there a difference
230
Part IV: Sharing and Printing Photos 
What you see is not always what you get
Although you can do many things to improve the
quality of your prints, you can’t translate all the
colors, nor their vivid brightness from screen to
paper. Here are a few factors that influence this
disparity:
 Color models: Monitors and printers use
two different color models. Your monitor dis-
plays colors in RGB (red, green, and blue),
while printers print in CMYK (cyan, yellow,
magenta, and black). The RGB color gamut
(or range) is 16.7 million colors, and the
CMYK gamut is around 55,000 colors.
There’s a big difference between those two
numbers, so a lot of what you see on-screen
cannot be physically output onto paper. (See
Chapter 3 for more on color.)
 Quality and calibration of your monitor: You
can do a basic calibration of your monitor
by following the steps in Chapter 10.
 Whether or not you use a color manage-
ment system for all your devices: For exam-
ple, a color management system based on
using ICC (International Color Consortium)
profiles can help you control your color
across all of your devices. Unfortunately,
color management is way beyond the scope
of this book. But if you are bound and deter-
mined to try and get your monitor to match
your printed output, I would suggest buying
a book solely devoted to this topic.

between a print at 1440 dpi and another at 2880 dpi? Only when testing
can you discover your printer’s proclivities. For example, some printers
have a tendency to print a certain color cast (some printers tend to
create bluer or greener output, for example). 
Testing is a very time-consuming process, but one that will reap rewards.
You will know what works and what doesn’t. Only when you’ve got your
printer’s personality down to a science can you can sit back and print
anything and everything without worrying about the quality of the
output.
Setting Print Options
Before you run off on a printing frenzy, you need to give Album some basic
info about your print job — little details like the size and orientation of your
paper, the width of the margins, and so on. These options are found in the
Page Setup dialog box. Keep in mind that if your computer is connected to
multiple printers, you need to set your print options each time you change
printers.
Here’s how to set your print options:
1. Choose File➪Page Setup. 
The Page Setup dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 14-1.
2. Set the following options: 
• Size: Choose the size of your paper from the pop-up menu.
• Source: Specify the tray or feeder that provides the paper to your
printer. Also be sure to select the appropriate paper in your printer
settings if you’re using a photo-quality or specialty paper.
• Orientation: Choose your desired page orientation, either Portrait
or Landscape. 
• Margins: If available, set your margins on all sides.
The preview at the top of the dialog box changes according to your 
settings.
3. If you have multiple printers and want to change the printer, click the
Printer button. Choose a printer from the Name pop-up menu, or click
the Network button to choose a printer from your network. 
4. Click the Properties button to specify additional options. When you’re
done setting options, click OK.
231
Chapter 14: Getting Your Images on Paper

The options in this dialog box are determined by your printer, not
Album, so be sure and check your printer manual for more information
if you’re unfamiliar with the settings. You’ll find options such as printer
resolution, color adjustments, and so on. 
5. Click OK in the main Page Setup dialog box.
Printing Your Images
After you’ve set your print options (see the preceding section), you’re ready
to start printing your images. Album gives you several options for printing, as
discussed in the following sections.
Printing individual photos
If you want individual prints, all you have to do is choose a print size, and
Album combines as many photos as will fit on a single sheet of paper. 
Figure 14-1:
Set 
your print 
options 
in the 
Page Setup
dialog box.
232
Part IV: Sharing and Printing Photos 

Choose a print size that is appropriate for the resolution of the image. If you
need more details on working with resolution, see Chapter 3 and also the
“Tips for Getting Better Prints” section at the end of this chapter.
If you choose a size that causes the print to be printed at less than 150 dpi,
Album issues a stern alert, shown in Figure 14-2, so you can adjust the print
size smaller. 
Make sure your printer is turned and the ready light is on, and then follow
these steps to print individual photos:
1. From the Photo Well, select one or more photos. Then choose
File➪Print or click the Print button in the Shortcuts bar. 
You can print a video clip — sort of. Only the first frame will be printed.
In the Print Selected Photos dialog box, shown in Figure 14-3, the left
side of the dialog box shows the selected photo(s).
2. In the Layout area of the dialog box, select Individual Prints (if it’s not
already selected). 
3. In the Individual Print Format area of the dialog box, choose one of
these options:
• Select a preset size from the list. If more than one copy of the
photo(s) fits on the page, the preview shows the layout of the
photos. If only one print will fit on a page, you can scroll through
the pages using the Backward and Forward buttons.
• Choose Fit on Page to scale the image to fill the page. If the photo
is small or has a low resolution, and it is scaled to fit the page, the
quality may be unsatisfactory.

Chapter 14: Getting Your Images on Paper

• Choose Custom Size. When you select this option a second dialog
box appears to allow you to enter your desired dimensions.
The right side of the dialog box shows the preview of how the images
will be printed on the page. If you change a print option, Album updates
the preview. 
Being the ever-so-frugal program that it is, Album may automatically
rotate your images in order to maximize the number of prints that it can
fit on a page.
4. Select Print Single Photo Per page if you would rather print only one
photo per page.
5. Select Crop to Match Print Proportions if you want Album to automati-
cally crop the photo as needed to fill the entire space.
I’d be careful of using this option because vital parts of your image may
be cut off. If you’re having problems getting your images at a specific
size, try cropping the photo before you print it. For more on cropping,
see Chapter 11.
6. Type the number of copies of each photo you want in the Use each
Photo text box.
You also can click the up and down arrows to specify the quantity.
7. If you have multiple pages, click the Forward and Backward buttons
to preview each page of the print job.

Printing a picture package
Besides individual photos, you also can print picture packages. A picture 
package lays out and prints each photo in a variety of sizes, similar to various-
sized portraits that you can purchase from a photography studio. You dictate
the layout style, and Album arranges the photos on the page. If you select
more than one photo, each photo is printed in various sizes on its own page.

assistance.
6. Click Print to print your images.
Printing a contact sheet
Album gives you the ability to print a contact sheet that shows thumbnails of
each of your selected photos. You can print the sheet with captions, filenames,
dates, and page numbers. Contact sheets are great because they give you a
concise printed inventory of your entire catalog.

8. Click the Preferences button to specify settings. Click OK when
you’re done.
Refer to Figure 14-5, and check your printer manual if you need assistance.
9. Click Print to print your images.
Printing creations
Album allows you to make a variety of projects it calls creations. A couple of
these creations, such as greeting cards and calendars, are specifically designed
to be printed on your home printer. For specifics on making creations, see
Chapters 17 and 18. I’ll just give you the rundown on printing them here. 
When you have completed and previewed your creation in the Creation
Wizard (described in detail in Chapter 17), you arrive at Step 5, the printing
stage. From here, you can print the creation by following these steps:
1. In the Output Options section of the Creations Wizard window, shown
in Figure 14-8, click the Print button.
The Print dialog box appears and shows your current printer settings.
2. Click the Preferences button to specify your settings. Click OK when
you’re finished.
Check with your printer manual if you need help with these settings. 
3. Click Print to print your images.
Here are a few specifics in regards to each type of printed creation.
 Greeting cards: After the page is printed, you need to fold the page in
half and then fold it again. Some types of photo paper can crack when
folded, so be careful. It helps to score the card with a paper clip or thin-
tipped burnishing tool before folding.
 Calendars: After you print the pages of your calendar, you can either
bind them yourself or take them to your local copy shop for binding. 
239
Chapter 14: Getting Your Images on Paper

Ask for a clear acetate cover and vinyl backing to give further polish to
your custom calendar. After you create and preview your calendar, you
have the option to have it printed via an online service for $19.95. Simply
click the Order Online button in Step 5 of the Creations Wizard. See more
about ordering online in Chapter 15.
 Albums: As with calendars, after you print your album, you can take it to
a copy shop to have it bound with a front and back cover. Or you can
simply place the pages in your leather-bound photo album or scrapbook.
If you choose to print creations that do not have sufficient resolution, Album
presents you with a warning dialog box, shown in Figure 14-9. At this point,
you have a couple options:
 Use another image, with higher resolution, for the creation.
 Try to print the image anyway, using the individual print method
described earlier in this chapter, at a smaller size. You won’t get the
image in the cool creation form, but at least you may be able to get some
kind of print.
 Send the creation to recipients to view on-screen. Make an eCard instead
of a greeting card, or send friends and family that calendar as a PDF to
view on-screen. What the heck — you’ll save a few trees, too.

Finding Images You’ve Previously Printed
Album allows you to locate images by their history. Part of an image’s history
is whether or not it has been printed. If you need to locate images that you
have previously printed, follow these steps:
1. Choose Find➪By History➪Items Printed On.
A list of the photos you have printed, and the dates they were printed,
will appear.
2. Double-click an item in the list.
The image appears alone in the Photo Well, which can be helpful if you
are being bombarded for requests for prints from the last family reunion,
and you can’t remember which ones you have already printed and
handed out.
You also can locate images for which you have ordered prints online:
1. Choose Find➪By History➪Items Ordered Online.
A list of all photos for which you have ordered online prints and the
dates you ordered them appears, as shown in Figure 14-10.
2. Double-click an item in the list.
Those images will appear in the Photo Well.

Tips for Getting Better Prints
If there is one complaint I hear constantly from my graphic students it’s
that their prints look so much better on-screen. Often printing problems are
a result of operator error, and the problem can be easily solved. But I have to
admit, there have a few times I myself wondered whether it was going to take a
voodoo ritual to get my print to come out correctly. You may need to do a few
voodoo rituals along the way, but if you consistently follow a few rules, you’re
likely to be ahead of the game and will have great printed output more often.
Check your resolution
The most basic thing to keep in mind is that you have a good chance of getting
a high-quality print if you start with a high-quality image. And one of the keys
to a high-quality image is to make sure the resolution of your images is high
enough to accommodate high-quality printed output, as shown in Figure 14-11.
Images from a digital camera
If you are capturing images with a digital camera, do not set your camera to
low-resolution capture mode. Always use the maximum megapixel size of
your camera. 
Figure 14-10:

or ordered

Part IV: Sharing and Printing Photos 

The maximum print size you will be able to achieve depends on the image
resolution. If you have a camera that is only capable of capturing 1 to 2
megapixels, you’re not going to be able to get high-quality large-size prints. 
Table 14-1 gives a few approximate guidelines on print sizes in relationship to
the camera’s resolution.

Other ways to print your photos
If your printer is of marginal quality or is acting
contrary, you can always get your images
printed by ordering them via an online service.
See Chapter 15 for details. Another option is to
use the Kodak Picture Maker. I’m sure you have
seen the walk-up kiosks at your local mall or
drugstore. Simply insert your memory card, CD,
or even a diskette into the appropriate slot, and
the machine at the kiosk scans the images for you.
You can even insert slides and negatives. Using
a touch-screen monitor, select the photos you
want to print. You can get rid of red eye, crop
your images, and add borders and small
amounts of text to the pictures. Choose the print
size, and in a few minutes you have a finished
print for a very reasonable price. The kiosk even
lets you print stickers and cards.

Scanned images
If you’re scanning hard-copy prints to import into Album for editing or inclu-
sion in a creation such as a photo book or calendar, be sure that you set your
scanning resolution high enough to ensure good-quality prints. In terms of
scans, here are a few guidelines:
 Images that are 4MB are suitable for 4 x 6 prints.
 An 8 x 10 print requires at around a 9 or 10MB file. If you want top-
notch quality for an 8 x 10 print, you’ll need to have a file that is around
16 to 20MB.
 In terms of pixels per inch, use the general rule of thumb of 300 ppi
at 100 percent scale of the image size for a very high-quality print.
Be aware that your image will be extremely large, so be sure and have
adequate hard drive storage. Working with an image of this monstrous
magnitude will also eat up your available RAM like nobody’s business,
so be sure you’re locked and loaded with plenty of memory.
If you plan on making a large print, I recommend making a small 4 x 6
print first. Proof it and see if it requires any adjustments before you
incur the expense and time of making a larger print.
Watch your file format
Although some people may disagree, my recommendation is to capture your
digital images in TIFF format, if your camera allows it. TIFF images do not uti-
lize the lossy compression scheme that the JPEG file format does and there-
fore produce a higher-quality image.
244
Part IV: Sharing and Printing Photos 

There are downsides to capturing your images as TIFFs:
 The file size is much larger and will therefore fill up your camera’s
memory card faster.
 It takes a little longer to record the image to your camera after you cap-
ture it, so your camera may be hung up for as little as a second or two to
as long as 30 seconds.
If your cameras can only capture images in JPEG format, then select the
highest-quality JPEG setting possible (such as High, Fine, or Large). The
result will be the lowest amount of compression and therefore a higher-
quality image.
Even if you decide to capture your image as a JPEG, if you feel that you are
going to be opening, editing, and resaving the image, be sure and save the file
on your hard drive or external media as a TIFF. 
You can apply LZW compression, which is a lossless compression scheme, to
your TIFF image, which makes your file size a bit smaller without deleting
image data.
Nothing beats running a test. Shoot the same subject using TIFF and JPEG
modes (of various quality settings). Print out prints of varying sizes and
check the results. You may find that for your specific needs, a high-quality
JPEG will be sufficient in most cases, except where you need a very large-size
print.
If you are scanning prints to bring into Album for editing or inclusion into a
creation, be sure and save them as TIFFs as well.
See more details on resolution and file formats in Chapter 3.
Calibrating your monitor is essential to having the best editing environment
possible. You should also set up your work environment and desktop so that
you have no distractions when you edit your photos. For all you need to know
about calibrating your monitor and optimizing your editing environment, see
Chapter 10.
Crop and clean up
If you didn’t capture quite the image you wanted, you have the opportunity
to digitally edit those images. Album gives you tools to rotate, crop, sharpen
and fix red eye, contrast and color. See Chapters 11 and 12 for information
about the tools at your disposal, all of which are quick and easy to use. 
245
Chapter 14: Getting Your Images on Paper

Remember that your print can only be as good as your original image. If the
original image is flawed, so will be the print, as shown in Figure 14-12.
If you are scanning your images, you may want to especially consider sharp-
ening the image. Flatbed scanners are notorious for producing soft images,
and a little sharpening may be just the ticket. 
Always make sure that sharpening is the last edit you make on your image.
Album automatically saves your edited image as a new file, which is a wise
move. That way you can always go back to the original if the need arises. 
Use a good printer
Just as the source of the print is important, so is the final destination. If your
printer is old or on the low end of the printer quality totem pole, you may be
disappointed with your prints, no matter how great the image looks on-screen.
High-quality photo printers are so reasonably priced now that it would be a
shame not to have one if you are serious about home printing. 
Shop around and request some sample prints. Some companies or retail 
outlets even let you print your file. Make sure the printer’s specs say that
the printer provides photo-quality printouts and can handle all of the paper
types and sizes you need. After you acquire a good printer, get to know it.
Run it through a gamut of tests. For more on this topic, see the first section
in this chapter.
Keep your inkjet printer clean. Use the cleaning utility to unclog or align the
heads. You may find that if you haven’t used your printer in awhile, you may
need to clean the nozzles. And aligning the heads when you change ink car-
tridges may be necessary. Refer to your owner’s manual for details.
Print resolution
Many printers are capable of printing at various resolutions, such as 360 dpi,
720 dpi, 1440 dpi and 2880 dpi. How do you know which to use? It depends on
the intended use. For example:
 Is it for a flyer for your child’s school? If so, maybe 360 to 720 dpi is fine.
 Is it for an exhibit at the local coffeehouse? Better crank it up to 1440 to
2880 dpi.
Run sample prints to see the differences between the various print settings.
The higher the printer resolution, the longer the print time and the more ink
is consumed.
246
Part IV: Sharing and Printing Photos 

Alternatives to the inkjet
There are a couple of other types of photo printers to consider besides inkjet:
 Dye-sublimation printers: These printers, which are becoming more
affordable, use a heating element to melt pigment from a colored ribbon
onto the paper. Dye-sublimation printers print much faster than inkjet
prints and provide excellent quality prints, but are more expensive to
purchase than the average inkjet printer. The printers in the Fujifilm PG
series are the most expensive, but can produce prints that rival tradi-
tional photographic prints.
 Direct-print printers: These printers allow you to bypass the computer
completely. Instead, you cable your digital camera to the printer or insert
your memory card into a slot on the printer. You can print everything
from contact sheets to regular-size prints. The downside, of course, is
that aside from a couple of brightness and color adjustments on some
models, you cannot repair or fix your images before you print them.

Chapter 14: Getting Your Images on Paper

Use good paper
Don’t make that penny squeak when it comes to buying paper. Plain paper
absorbs ink like a sponge and makes the colors appear dull and muddy. Invest
in premium photo-quality paper that is designed for inkjet printers. Paper
comes in a variety of finishes, from glossy to matte to luster, depending on
your preference. Here are a few things to look for when choosing paper:
 Whiteness: Look for paper that has a bright whiteness. The whiteness
of the paper will play a part in how vibrant the print looks. Bright white
paper also gives the widest range of colors. Try to find paper that has a
brightness of 90 percent or higher.
 Weight: Also consider the weight of the paper. Lightweight paper won’t
hold up when saturated with ink and is more prone to damage. Look for
a weight of 65 lbs. or more per ream, or 10 mil. or more in thickness per
sheet. These weights are similar to the weight of traditional photographic
paper. Go online to see if manufacturers are offering free sample packs.
I have owned four models of Epson printers and have tried dozens of brands
of paper. I always end up going back to Epson paper. It’s expensive, but it
gives me the best results. Epson obviously formulates the paper to work
exceptionally well with the printer and Epson brand inks. I never use third-
party inks, by the way. They may work great for you, but I have had very bad
luck using them.
Also, even though their durability has improved, prints from inkjet printers
are not as resistance to water, smudging, direct sunlight and fading as tradi-
tional prints. Traditional photographic prints last around 12 years, but prints
from inkjet printers may survive just 2 months (most last for 2 years). 
Some manufacturers claim to offer longer-life prints. Epson, however, says
that its inks are designed to last around 12 years if used with certain Epson
papers. And the company claims that prints will last 40 years if you use its
Matte Paper Heavyweight. Epson provides a great paper and ink guidebook
that you can request for free. Visit the Epson Web site (www.epson.com) for
more information. 
You may want to look into archival papers and archival inks or UV coatings
to protect your prints. Service bureaus can apply UV coatings to your images,
or you can purchase sprays. Just make sure that whatever UV coatings you
add to prints are compatible with the type of paper you are using.
You aren’t limited to just the standard size sheets of paper. You also can pur-
chase inkjet paper in the form of precut and scored greeting cards, postcards,
sticker, transparencies, banners, iron-on transfer paper, and more.

ave you ever put a small plant in a really big pot, knowing full well that
in time, that puny plant would flourish and grow to accommodate the
currently oversized container? That’s the feeling I got when I started poking
around Album’s Online Services feature. At press time, there are only a few
services to take advantage of. But Album has set itself up nicely to accommo-
date more in the future. 
The Online Services feature allows you to send images directly from Album
to service providers online. You can share images online with family and
friends. You can order prints of all sizes. And you can even order a profession-
ally printed and bound book of your images. The procedure is pretty seamless,
easy to use, and so far, reasonably priced. Because the Online Services feature
is in its infancy, be sure and update the list periodically to see whether there
are any new services or providers. Read on to find out how.
Signing Up for Online Services
If want to explore using an online service, you first have to register with one
and create an account. This process takes just a few mouse clicks. Here are
the short steps:

250
Part IV: Sharing and Printing Photos 
1. Choose Online Services➪Manage Accounts. 
The Create or Modify Online Service Accounts dialog box appears, as
shown in Figure 15-1.
2. Make sure All Service Types is selected in the pop-up menu.
This action ensures that all types of services, from print to share, are
visible. 
3. Choose the name of the service provider you want to sign up with.
You can share your photos online or order professional-quality
prints from Shutterfly.com. Another company, MyPublisher, prints
and binds photo books (find out more about this type of Album
creation in Chapter 17).
4. Click the Select button.
The Online Services Wizard appears.
5. Follow the instructions using the Wizard to register and create an
account.
You also can go to www.shutterfly.com and www.mypublisher.com to sign
up for their services. 
Figure 15-1:

Checking for New Online Services
Although Album has only a few online service providers to date, it’s almost
certain that new providers will be added over time. So be sure and check for
new providers every so often. You never know what cool service could be
around the corner. 
To check for new online services, choose Online Services➪Check for New
Services. Album checks for any changes in services and installs them on your
system. If there are no new services, a dialog box appears telling you that
your services are up-to-date.
Sharing Photos Using Online Services
Some services, like Shutterfly, let you post images to a Web site so that
you can easily share your photos with others. This is a great alternative to
e-mailing photos as attachments, especially for those without a broadband
Internet connection. 
What’s great is that you don’t even have to leave Album. You don’t have to
launch your Web browser or use FTP (file transfer protocol) software. If you
are using a dialup connection, you will have to open your connection first,
however. If you already have registered and received an account with an online
service like Shutterfly, you are ready to start sharing. If you haven’t registered
be sure and check out the earlier section, “Signing Up for Online Services.”
Follow these steps to share your photos using an online service:
1. Select your desired photos in the Photo Well.
2. Choose Online Services➪Share Services. Choose a service from the
submenu.
Or you can click the Share button in the Shortcuts bar. Choose Share
Online from the pop-up menu.
I chose the only available option at this time, which is Shutterfly Picture
Share. Outside of Album, you can use your Internet browser to go directly
to Web sites such as Microsoft’s Internet Photo Site at http://photos.
msn.com, Kodak at www.kodak.com or PhotoFun at www.photofun.com. 
Here are the advantages of using Album as your vehicle to online shar-
ing and printing:
• Convenience
• Ease of use
• A handy record of who you shared with or what and where you
ordered services from (details are covered in Chapter 8).
251
Chapter 15: Using Online Services to Share and Print Photos

If this is the first time you are using an online service provider, a dialog
box filled with legalese that explains that Adobe isn’t responsible for
anything you do with third-party vendors (so no scanning and printing
money, okay?) appears. Click OK if you agree to the terms.
The Share Items Using Online Service dialog box appears next, as shown
in Figure 15-2.
3. Select the recipients you wish to share your images with.
The recipients will receive an e-mail from Shutterfly giving them a link to
a Web site that will display your images.
If your desired recipients are not in the list, click the Contact Book
button. Click the New Contact button and enter the person’s name and
e-mail address. Click OK. The person now appears in the list of Recipients. 
You also can choose your desired online service from this dialog box.

6. In the Online Services Wizard window, check the e-mail addresses of
your desired recipients. Click Choose From Address Book to select or
add recipients. Enter a Subject and Message for your e-mail if you so
desire. Click the Next button.
Shutterfly transfers the photos from Album to its Web site. If your
images are large, this process may take some time.
Shutterfly then confirms that your photos have been transferred and
provides you with the Web link used in the e-mail to your recipients. You
also can e-mail the link to others you forgot to initially share with or
post the link to a personal Web site as a picture gallery. 
When your recipients receive the e-mail and click the Web link, they are
taken to the Shutterfly site, where they can view your images as a slide
show, shown in Figure 15-3. They also can order prints of those images.
If you need help sharing your images using the Shutterfly service, con-
tact Shutterfly’s customer service department at (510) 266-8333 or send
an e-mail message to ols_support@shutterfly.com.

Ordering Prints from Online Services
If you perused Chapter 14, you’re probably a pro, or at least a seasoned 
amateur, at getting your images on paper in some form or another. But maybe
you’re time challenged, or perhaps you prefer the convenience of ordering
prints online. 
Ordering prints online is easy to do, and the results are very reasonably
priced. For example a 4 x 6-inch snapshot is less than 50 cents, and an 
8 x 10-inch print is less than $4. You even can have prints shipped directly
to friends and family, saving you a trip to the post office. 
Many online printing services also offer additional goodies. For example,
Shutterfly offers online tools that enable you to add decorative borders or
color effects to an image before you order your prints, as shown in Figure 15-4.
You also can order additional photo products, such as cards, calendars, and
printed albums. 
The most critical preparation you must make before ordering prints online is
to make sure that the resolution of the digital images is high enough to ensure
quality results. Even if your images look beautiful on-screen, printing them is
a whole other ballgame; you don’t want to waste money on low-resolution,
low-quality prints. If you’re unsure how to determine the resolution of your
pictures, check out Chapters 3 and 14.

2. Choose Online Services➪Order Prints. Choose a service from the 
sub-menu.
You also can click the Order Prints and Books from Online Services
button in the Shortcuts bar. 
The Online Services Wizard appears.
At press date, there are only two available services from which to
order prints directly through Album. One is Shutterfly and is located
in California. The other is Dixons and is located in the United Kingdom.
This isn’t to say you can’t find other places to order prints. For example,
Microsoft’s MSN Photos (http://photos.msn.com) and Kodak
(www.kodak.com) are popular photographic sharing and printing Web
sites. But again, working through Album is easy, convenient and pro-
vides a record of all images you have used with an online service.
3. If you’re a member, enter the e-mail address and password you estab-
lished during the registration process. Then click the Next button. If
you aren’t a member, click the Sign Up button and register now.
If this is the first time using a service provider, an End User License
Agreement dialog box may appear. Click OK if you agree with the terms.
4. Select your desired sizes and quantities in the dialog box and click
Next when you’re done. 
A great bonus in ordering prints from Shutterfly is that you can print a
message (up to 80 characters) on the back of each print. With this handy
feature, even your hard-copy prints will be identified and organized.
5. Select a recipient for your prints. Click Next.
6. Review your order and click Next.
7. Enter your credit card number, billing address, and shipping address.
Then click Next.
When you first sign up with Shutterfly, you get 15 free prints. Take advan-
tage! You can check out the service for nothing.
8. Review your billing info and click Next.
Shutterfly uploads your photos to its Web site. If your images are large,
this process may take a few minutes. Go and grab an icy beverage. You
deserve it.
After uploading is complete, a dialog box confirming your order appears.

Ordering Creations from Online Services
Prints aren’t the only items you can order online. Photoshop Album also
allows you to send your creations, such as Albums or Photo Books, directly
to online services. Currently, MyPublisher is the only online service that pro-
vides printed Photo Books. These printed Photo Books are coffee-table qual-
ity, 81⁄2 x 11 inches, printed on archival paper, and bound with linen or leather
covers. Prices start at $29.95 for a 10-page book, with each additional page
costing $2.95 apiece.
Follow these steps to order a creation from an online service:
1. Select your creation in the Photo Well.
2. Choose Online Services➪Order Creations. Choose the service from
the sub-menu.
You also can click the Order Prints and Books from Online Services
button in the Shortcuts bar. 
At press time, only MyPublisher Print Services is available for creations.
3. Select a service from the list in the Print Items Using Online Service
dialog box. Click OK.

or 100 percent refund. You can’t beat that.
You can order online services when making creations using the Creations
Wizard. For more details, see Chapter 18.
You can locate photos using an image’s history. In fact, one of the search
criteria if you’re looking for files based on history includes if and who you
shared the pictures with online and also what items you ordered online. For
more on finding files, see Chapter 8.
Downloading Templates
from Online Services
Adobe and its third-party partners plan on making downloadable templates
for you to use in your creations. Templates are the preset creation types that

hether you’ve thumbed right to this chapter after cracking the seal on
the book or you’ve dutifully perused the preceding 15 chapters first,
you have imported all of your photos and video clips into your catalog. I say
this because getting familiar with the Workspace is a kind of warm up for the
making of creations. And to make a creation, you have to have some source
material to use.
In addition to making creations, you can execute other operations from the
Workspace, such as e-mailing, printing, viewing a slide show, and so on. These
operations also require files to use. So if you’re staring at an empty Photo
Well, you may want to go back and revisit Chapter 4, which describes what
you need to know about importing files. If, on the other hand, you have a
bustling, robust Photo Well full of files, you’re in the right place. 
Getting Cozy with the Workspace
You can think of the Workspace as a kind of light table within Album.
Although you can do just about everything without using the Workspace, the
Workspace makes tasks easier because you can view all your selected items
in a neat little window. (By the way, you must use the Workspace in order to
make creations.)
The Workspace is especially convenient if you have a large catalog, and you
need to do a lot of scrolling to pick and choose your files. You can see only a
few images at one time if you look at them in the Photo Well. The Workspace,
on the other hand, provides a compact viewing arena.

Follow these steps to add items to the Workspace:
1. Choose View➪Workspace.
You also can click the Show or Hide Workspace button in the Options
bar or click the Create button on the Shortcuts bar. Figure 16-1 shows
the locations of these three commands.
The Workspace window appears. Now add your desired items.
2. Select one or more photos or video clips in the Photo Well and choose
Edit➪Add Selected Items to Workspace.
Or you can use any of the following methods:
• Click the Create button in the Shortcuts bar. 
• Drag the items into the Workspace window. 
• Right-click one of the selected items and choose Add Selected

Your items are copied into the Workspace and numbered accordingly, as

You also can select items before you access the Workspace. Select your files
and then use one of the methods described in Step 1. Your images appear
when you open the Workspace.
Here are some additional tips for using the Workspace:
 Moving or resizing the Workspace window: To move the window, drag
it by the title bar. To resize, move your mouse over a side or corner of
the window. Drag when the pointer changes to a double-headed arrow.
 Changing the order of the files in the Workspace: Select and drag the
item to a different position. A yellow line appears where the item will be
placed when you release the mouse. The files will automatically renum-
ber themselves.
Once you are in the Workspace, if you want to add files, don’t click the
Create button on the Shortcuts bar. If you do, Album will clear your cur-
rently selected items and replace them with your new additions. Instead,
use one of the other methods described in Step 2 to add more files to
the Workspace.

 Removing an item from the Workspace: Use one of the following meth-
ods to remove an item:
• Drag the item to the Clear button in the Workspace window.
• Right-click an item and choose Remove from Workspace from the
context-sensitive menu. 
• To remove all items, click the Clear button in the Workspace
window.
Working with Workspace Items
When you’re happy with the selection and order of the photos in your
Workspace, you can get to work. You can execute a ton of tasks from the
Workspace. For example, you can add tags, create a slide show, share files
online, e-mail photos, and print images from the Workspace.
Adding tags to Workspace items
You can attach tags to items in your Workspace. To add a tag in the
Workspace, simply click the Attach Tag to All Items button at the top of the
window, and choose your desired tag from the drop-down menu, as shown
in Figure 16-3. For example, if you’re assembling a group of vacation photos
because you want to have Shutterfly.com create prints for you, you could
create a tag called Vacation Print Order #1.
All items are tagged. You can’t attach tags to individual items. Tags can be
attached to individual files only in the Photo Well. For the lowdown on tags,
see Chapter 5.
It isn’t wise to use the Workspace as a temporary storage area because
whenever you start to work on a new creation the Workspace clears out all the
files that were placed there before. Do what you need to do with the files, but
don’t forget about them.
Creating a slide show from
Workspace items
If you want to create an instant slide show from the items in your Workspace,
click the Select Command to Apply to All Items in the Workspace button at
the top of the window, and choose Play Slideshow from the drop-down menu.
Album displays each image in full-screen preview mode. The images are
shown in the order in which they appear in the Workspace.
266
Part V: Creating Larger Projects with Photos 

Use the on-screen controls in the top-right corner to control the slide show,
as shown in Figure 16-4. Click the Close button or press Esc to end the slide
show and return to the Workspace. For details on instant slide shows, see
Chapter 9.
Sharing, exporting, e-mailing, and printing
items from the Workspace
You can execute several other commands from the Workspace window. Click
the Select Command to Apply to All Items in the Workspace button at the top
of the Workspace, and choose one of the following commands from the drop-
down menu:
 Order Prints: See Chapter 15.
 Export: See Chapter 12.
 Web Photo Gallery: The Web Photo Gallery with Workspace Items
dialog box displays, as shown in Figure 16-5. When it’s done churning,
your gallery displays in your Web Photo Gallery browser, shown in
Figure 16-6. For details on creating Web Photo Galleries, see Chapter 18.

onto a CD or DVD. You can create archives to use as backups or you can
choose to move high-resolution files from your hard drive if you are low
on storage space. A low-resolution proxy file remains in your catalog.
For details on archiving, see Chapter 7.
 E-mail: You can choose to e-mail all your Workspace items. Specify
your recipients and the settings for your e-mail in the Attach Workspace

Making creations from the Workspace
Although you can perform are all sorts of operations in the Workspace, you
usually find yourself there because you want to make a creation. After you
have your desired items arranged in the Workspace, click the Start Creations
Wizard button and follow the steps. In no time you’re off to making great
things like albums, photo books, and eCards. See Chapters 17 and 18 for
more on using the Creations Wizard and making creations. 
Finding photos from the Workspace
If you need to find a Workspace item in your Photo Well, you can
 Double-click the thumbnail in the Workspace.
 Right-click the thumbnail in the Workspace and choose Find in Photo
Well from the context-sensitive menu.
The Photo Well scrolls to locate the image and places a yellow border around
the item. 
Conversely, you can have the files you used in a creation appear in the
Workspace. Select a creation in the Photo Well, right-click, and choose Show
Photos in Workspace from the context-sensitive menu. The photos used in
your creation appear in the Workspace window.

 Creating slide shows and video CDs
 Making greeting cards, eCards, calendars, and photo books
 Editing creations
T
his chapter touts the merits of creations. Album does a fantastic job in
giving you a variety of ways to share your photos, video and audio clips
with family and friends. These ways range from the usual e-mailing of attach-
ments or making prints to the more creative making of albums, eCards, Web
galleries, or photo books. The results are so good, people will think you slaved
for hours to create these personalized projects. Little will they know it took
longer to boot up your computer and was just as simple.
In Chapter 16, I introduce you to the Workspace, which is an integral compo-
nent in making creations.
Making Creations with
the Creations Wizard
With the Creations Wizard, you choose from a variety of projects, or what
Album calls templates. Each template offers various design styles you can
choose from. Depending on the project you choose, you can add various
details and options. You can make albums, slide shows, video CDs, greeting
cards, eCards, calendars, and photo books.
Web Photo and Adobe Atmosphere 3D galleries are not created with the
Creations Wizard. For details on these creations, see those sections later in
this chapter.

To make a creation, follow these steps:
1. From the Photo Well, select the photos and video clips you want to
use in the creation. Then choose Creations➪New.
You also can use one of these methods:
• Click the Create button in the Shortcuts bar. 
• Right-click a file and choose Add Selected Items to the Workspace
from the context-sensitive menu.
If you need to add another file to the Workspace, drag the file from the
Photo Well into the Workspace. Don’t select the files and then click the
Create button on the Shortcuts bar or Album will delete all the files
currently in the Workspace and replace them with the new files.
You can choose Creations from the Menu bar, and then choose
your desired type of creation directly from the menu. If you do so,
the Creations Wizard skips the first step of choosing the type of
creation (Step 4).
2. In the Workspace, shown in Figure 17-1, arrange the photos in your
desired order.
To add additional files, drag and drop them into the Workspace. See
Chapter 16 for the lowdown on the Workspace.
Don’t select the files and click the Create button on the Shortcuts bar.
Your newly added files will delete the ones currently in the Workspace.

3. Click the Start Creations Wizard button.
Step 1 of the Creations Wizard appears.
4. Choose the type of creation you would like to make from the list of
templates, shown in Figure 17-2. Then click Next.
You can download additional templates from Adobe and its partners. At
press time, there is nothing new to download, but keep an eye out for
new templates in the future.
5. Follow the remaining few steps using the Creations Wizard. For
details on each kind of creation, see the sections that follow.
Creating albums
If you’re like me, you have tons of snapshots languishing in boxes, drawers,
and baskets. Drumming up the time and enthusiasm to put them into albums
and with titles and captions just never seems to happen. But in Album, creat-
ing, er, albums is quick, easy, and fun. After you create an album, you can
e-mail it as an attachment or print it and have the pages bound at a copy
center. Here are a few album ideas:

Chapter 17: Creating Projects

 Events: At the next wedding or family reunion, take a lot of candid snap-
shots or solicit photos from other attendees. Make a personalized album
and e-mail it to everyone.
 Themes: You can center your album on a theme, such as a particular
person, project, pet, or vacation.
 Records: Maybe you want your album to take a chronological approach
to recording events over a longer period of time. For example, you could
create a scrapbook that records a child’s year at school or a baby’s first
year of life.
 Locations: Your album can focus on a special location, such as your
recent one-year trek through the Himalayas. Okay, if your locale isn’t
that exotic, you can focus on your hometown.
To make an album, follow these steps:
1. Start your creation by following the steps in the section “Making
Creations with the Creations Wizard,” earlier in this chapter. 
Step 2 in the Creations Wizard appears, as shown in Figure 17-3.
Figure 17-3:

2. Choose the style of template you want to use and then click Next.
For albums, you have the choice of several categories, from full photo to
simple, from decorative to seasonal. A description and preview of each
style appears in the window.
3. In Step 3 of the Creations Wizard, customize your album by using the
following options, shown in Figure 17-4. Click Next when you’re done. 
• Title: If you want your album to have a title page, enter the text
you want to use in the Title text box. The first photo of your album
will be used for the title page. No caption appears on the title page.
• Photos Per Page: From this pop-up menu, select the number of
photos you want to display on each page.
• Include Captions: Select this option if you want your captions to
appear below each photo (except for the title photo). 
You should add captions to your photos before you make a cre-
ation (for details on captions see Chapter 6).

Chapter 17: Creating Projects

• Include Page Numbers: Select this option if you want your album
to display page numbers. 
• Header and Footer: Select either or both of these two options, and
type the text in the box to add headers and footers. Headers and
footers are small lines of text that appear at the top or bottom of
each page.
4. Here’s your chance to preview your album. When you’re happy with
it, click the Next button. If you are not happy, you can edit your cre-
ation. Click the Back button to return to a previous step.
Use the navigation buttons, shown in Figure 17-5, to scroll through the
pages. Click the Full Screen Preview button to see your album at full-
screen size, as shown in Figure 17-6. Press Esc to get out of full-screen
mode and return to the Wizard.

5. To publish your album, select one of the Output Options. If you don’t
want to publish your album right now, skip this step. 
Table 17-1 gives cross-references to the chapters where you can find
more information about these output options.
6. Click Done to save your creation.
Album saves the creation, and it is selected at the top of your Photo Well.
You can access your album, as well as any creation, to apply edits or publish
it at any time by simply double-clicking the thumbnail in the Photo Well. It
opens in Step 4, the preview stage. Click the Back button to go back and make
changes if necessary.
The saved album, like all creations in the Photo Well, has references, or links,
to your photos. The photos you use are not embedded in the creation, but
are low-resolution copies that are linked to the full-resolution originals. The
links are to the latest versions of your photos. So if you edit or remove a
photo after the creation has been saved, the creation is updated accordingly.

Creating slide shows
Slide shows are a great way to share photos. They provide such a better view-
ing experience than simply looking at photos as e-mail attachments. You also
can burn slide shows onto CDs and give them to family and friends to play at
their leisure, either on their computer or on their TV via a DVD player.
Instant slide shows, described in Chapter 9, are quick-and-dirty slide shows
you create with selected photos. While great for previewing your images, you
cannot add all the bells and whistles that you can with the regular slide
shows described here.
Your collection of photos is saved in a single, compressed file. This is very
handy when e-mailing multiple photos to people who have attachment
number limits evoked by their Internet provider or e-mail client.
Album allows you to set up the sequence of your images, choose a template
style, add captions, music and transitions between slides, such as fades and
wipes. Slide shows also include a control panel so that the viewer can control
the playback. 
Follow these steps to create your own slide show:
1. Start your creation by following the steps in the section “Making
Creations with the Creations Wizard,” earlier in this chapter. 
This takes you to Step 2 in the Creations Wizard.
2. Choose the style of template you want. Then click Next.
You can choose from several categories. For example, you can choose a
full photo, a simple style, or something more decorative or seasonal. A
description and preview of each style appear in the window.

Part V: Creating Larger Projects with Photos 

3. In Step 3 of the Wizard, customize your slide show by using the fol-
lowing options, shown in Figure 17-7. Click Next when you’re done.
• Title: If you want your slide show to have a title screen, select this
option. Enter a 30-character or less title in the Title text box. The
first photo of your slide show will be used for the title page, as
shown in Figure 17-8. No caption will be displayed on the title page.
• Photos Per Page: From the pop-up menu, select the number of
photos you want to display on each page.
• Include Captions: Check this option if you want your captions to
appear under each photo, as shown in Figure 17-9.
• Background Music: If you want background music to play during
the slide show, choose a file from the pop-up menu or click Browse
to locate an MP3 or WAV file. Album installs some sample files that
you can use if you’re short on music.
The pop-up menu lists only music files that have been imported into
your catalog. If you browse and select a music file, Album automatically
imports it for you. For my Disneyland show, I included a clip of kids laugh-
ing. But a kid’s tune would have made great background music as well.
Figure 17-7:

281
Chapter 17: Creating Projects

When selecting background music for slide shows, use MP3 files when-
ever possible. When using the other format, WAV files larger than 2MB
may not play properly.
• Play Audio Captions: Select this option to play audio captions that
you have recorded for your photos. For details on creating audio
captions, see Chapter 6.
• Transition: Select how you want one image to change to the next
from the pop-up menu. You have your choice of fades, wipes, dis-
solves, boxes, random, or none. Fade is my personal favorite.
• Page Duration: Choose how long you want each photo to be dis-
played on-screen. You can choose 2, 4, or 10 seconds from the pop-
up menu or you can type a time into the text box. I usually use 2 to
3 seconds, but it is up to you.

• Include Play Controls: Select this option to include an on-screen
panel of controls for playing and stopping the slide show (refer to
Figure 17-8).
• Pause on Start/Manual Advance: Choose this option if you don’t
want your slide show to play automatically. With this setting, only
the first page displays. The viewer then clicks the Play controls to
advance the next slide. 
• Allow Video to Resize: If you have a video clip in your slide show,
select this option if you want the clip to resize itself to the dimen-
sions of the slide show’s window.
Be careful about resizing video clips. The average video clip doesn’t
have a high resolution, so making it larger may degrade the image
quality significantly. I recommend allowing video clips to display at
their original resolution settings. Smaller and sharper are always
better attributes than larger and lousier.
• Start Slide Show Automatically: Choose this option if you want
the slide show to display the first page at full screen and then auto-
matically play the show. If you don’t select this option, the slide
show opens in Acrobat or Acrobat Reader. The recipient can then

283
Chapter 17: Creating Projects

choose to either play the slide show or view the pages in the
Acrobat or Acrobat Reader window. However, viewers won’t be
able to hear any audio, view any video, or see any transitions. 
• Repeat Slideshow: Choose this option if you want the slide show
to loop, or repeat continuously until you make it stop.
4. Preview your slide show in Step 4 of the Wizard. If you are satisfied
with the slide show, click the Next button.
Use the navigation buttons below the preview to scroll through the
pages. Click the Full Screen Preview button to see your slide show at full-
screen size (refer to Figures 17-8 and 17-9). Press the Esc key to exit from
full-screen mode.
5. If you want to publish your slide show, select an output option. If you
don’t want to publish your slide show right now, skip to Step 6.
Refer to Table 17-1 for a list of cross-references to the chapters where
you can find more information about these output options.
6. Click the Done button.
Album saves the creation, and it is selected at the top of the Photo Well.
Creating greeting cards
Ads for well-known card company suggest that you should buy its cards
when you care enough to send the very best. Well, I think the very best is
making your own personalized greeting cards. No more searching through
hundreds of cards for just the right message or image. Using Album, you can
create a variety of cards and then print them a couple ways: 
 Inkjet printer: Although you can print cards on your inkjet printer, I rec-
ommend using card stock.
 Copy shop or service bureau: You can take your file to a copy shop or
service bureau when you need larger quantities of prints. Depending on
the quantity you order, you can often get your greeting cards at below-
retail prices.
The next time you or a family member receives a gift, take a photo of the
person using the gift and make it into a thank-you card. How much more per-
sonalized can you get than that?
Here’s the scoop on creating a greeting card:
1. Start your creation by following the steps in the section “Making
Creations with the Creations Wizard,” earlier in this chapter. 
This takes you to Step 2 in the Creations Wizard.
284
Part V: Creating Larger Projects with Photos 

2. Choose the style of template you want and then click Next.
For a greeting card, you have the choice of several categories, from
simple, to decorative to colorful and seasonal.
Because a greeting card creation only uses one photo (always the first
one), it ignores any other images you have in the Workspace.
3. In Step 3 of the wizard, customize your greeting card by using the fol-
lowing options, shown in Figure 17-10. Click Next when you’re done. 
• Title: Enter a title in the text box. The title will appear on the front
of the card. You can have the title appear next to or below the
image, depending on the style you chose in the previous step. Your
title is limited to 30 characters.
• Greeting: Enter your greeting in the text box. The greeting will
appear in the inside the card along the top. Again, you are limited
to 30 characters.
• Message: Type a message in the text box. The message will appear
below the greeting on the inside of the card.

4. Preview your card in Step 4 of the wizard. If you like your card, click
the Next button.
Use the navigation buttons to preview both the outside and inside of the
card. Click the Full Screen Preview button to see your card at full-screen
size, which is shown in Figure 17-11. 
5. To print your card, click the Print button in the Output Options list. If
you don’t want to print your card now, skip to the next step.
After your card is printed, fold it in half and then in half again. For
details on printing, see Chapter 14.
6. Click the Done button to exit the Creations Wizard.
Album saves the creation, and it’s selected at the top of the Photo Well.
You can access the card at any time by double-clicking it in the
Photo Well.
Don’t just limit yourself to just greeting cards. You also can make personal-
ized invitations to parties, weddings, graduations, and other events. 
Creating eCards
If you feel like being environmentally conscious and don’t want to be a gasp,
“tree killer,” try sending an eCard. Here are a few benefits to sending eCards:
 Your recipient gets it quickly.
 You save on postage and envelopes.
Figure 17-11:
Preview
your card in
full-screen
mode to
really see
the details.
286
Part V: Creating Larger Projects with Photos 

 You don’t need a high-resolution image. Because eCards are meant to be
viewed on-screen, they are a great option if the image you want to use
doesn’t have a high enough resolution to print. 
 You can personalize an eCard. That’s more meaningful than the ones you
find at online e-greeting Web sites.
If your recipient doesn’t have access to e-mail, you also can burn your eCards
onto CD if you so desire. See Chapter 7 for more on burning CDs.
Like all creations, Album kindly provides you with a potpourri of template
styles and options to choose from. As a final crowning touch, you can add
music or an audio caption to your eCard. What family member wouldn’t melt
when receiving an eCard from their loved one with a personal audio message,
like “I love you?” 
Here’s how to create an eCard:
1. Start your creation by following the steps in the section “Making
Creations with the Creations Wizard,” earlier in this chapter. 
This takes you to Step 2 in the Creations Wizard.
2. Choose the style of template you want and then click Next.
For an eCard, you have the choice of several categories — simple, sea-
sonal, decorative, and colorful. Like a greeting card, an eCard uses only
the first photo for the front page of the card. It will ignore any other
images you have in the Workspace.
3. In Step 3 of the wizard, customize your eCard by using the following
options, shown in Figure 17-12. Click Next when you’re done.
• Title: Enter a title in the text box. The title will appear on the front
of the card next to or under the photo, depending on your tem-
plate style.
You are limited to 30 characters. for the title, greeting and signature.
• Greeting: Type a greeting for the salutation. It will appear inside of
the card at the top. 
• Message: Enter a message which will appear inside the card below
the greeting.
• Signature: Type a name in the text box for the signature which
appears inside the card on the bottom.
• Background Music: Choose an MP3 or WAV file from the pop-up
menu or click Browse to locate a file on your computer. When your
recipient opens the eCard the music will play. 
287
Chapter 17: Creating Projects

• Play Audio Captions: Select this option to play an audio caption
that you previously recorded for the photo in your eCard. For
details on creating audio captions, see Chapter 6. 
• Transition: Select the way you want the front page to transition to
the inside page from the pop-up menu.
• Page Duration: From the pop-up menu, choose how long you
want each page to display. You also can enter a time in the Page
Duration text box.
• Include Play Controls: Choose this option to include an on-screen
panel of controls for playing and stopping the eCard.
• Pause on Start/Manual Advance: Choose this option if you don’t
want your eCard to play automatically. With this setting, only the
first page will display. The viewer then clicks the Play controls to
go to the inside page.
• Allow Video to Resize: If you have a video clip in your eCard,
select this option if you want the clip to resize itself to the dimen-
sions of the eCard.

a theme for the calendar or just use your best shots. For example, a calendar
featuring grandchildren doing seasonal activities (skiing, swimming, wearing
Halloween costumes, and so on) is perfect for grandparents. Give a calendar
featuring your favorite vacation shots to a travel buff friend. The themes are
endless. 
You can print the calendars at home or at your local copy shop or service
bureau if your printer isn’t up to snuff. Album gives you a choice of several
styles, and all you need to do is just enter the range of months you want.
Follow these steps to create a calendar: 
1. Start your creation by following the steps in the section “Making
Creations with the Creations Wizard,” earlier in this chapter. 
This takes you to Step 2 in the Creations Wizard.
2. Choose the style of calendar you want and then click Next.
3. In Step 3 of the wizard, specify the following options. Click Next when
you’re done. 
• Title: Enter a title for your calendar. Your title will appear either
next to or below your first photo, depending on the style you
selected.
• Starting: Choose the month and year you want your calendar to
start.
• Ending: Choose the month and year you want your calendar to
end.
• Include Captions: Select this option if you want your captions to
appear under each photo. Note that a caption will not appear
under the title photo.
4. Preview your calendar in Step 4 of the Wizard. If you like your calen-
dar, click the Next button.
Use the navigation buttons to preview each month. Click the Full Screen
Preview button to see your calendar at full-screen size, as is shown in
Figure 17-14.

5. If you want to publish your calendar, choose one of the following
output options. If you don’t want to publish it as this time, proceed to
Step 6.
These are your printing options:
• Print it on your home printer: Click the Print button (see Chapter
14 for tips on printing). You can then take the prints and have them
bound at your local copy center.
• E-mail it: For e-mail details, see Chapter 13.
• Burn it onto CD: For CD burning advice, see Chapter 7.
• Have it professionally printed and bound via an online service:
You can have this done for around $20. To do this, click the Order
Online button, which will launch the Online Wizard and take you to
MyPublisher.com.
Shutterfly.com will also print your calendar, but you cannot order
the calendar directly from Album using the Online Wizard. Check
shutterfly.com for details on how to submit your file. For general
details on using an online service, see Chapter 15.

Album saves the creation, and it is selected at the top of your Photo Well. 
Creating Video CDs
Not all your recipients may be tech savvy. In other words, what do you do if
your family member or friend doesn’t own a computer? You can send printed
output of course, but then you can’t show off your wonderful slide shows and
eCards with music, audio captions, and transitions. If they have a DVD player,
you can create a video CD (you need to have a CD burner, of course), which
is basically a slide show designed for viewing on TV. Recipients also can view
video CDs on a computer provided that it is equipped with a DVD drive and
DVD player software that is compatible with the video CD format. 
Follow these steps to make a video CD:
1. Start your creation by following the steps in the section “Making
Creations with the Creations Wizard,” earlier in this chapter. 
This takes you to Step 2 in the Creations Wizard.
2. Choose one of the three styles of video CD slide show you want and
then click Next.
3. In Step 3 of the wizard, specify the following options. Click Next when
you’re done. 
• Title: Choose this option if you want your video CD to have a title
screen. Type a title using a maximum of 20 characters.
• Background Music: Choose a file from the pop-up menu or click
Browse to locate an MP3 or WAV file on your computer. The back-
ground music will play during the slide show. 
• Transition: From the pop-up menu, choose how you want one
image to transition to the next.
• Page Duration: Decide how long you want each photo to be dis-
played on-screen. Choose a time from the pop-up menu or type in
your own time.
• Allow Video to Resize: If you are using a video clip, you can
choose this option if you want the video clip to resize itself to the
dimensions of the video CD template window.
I would avoid this option and let it play at its original size.
• Include Captions: Select this option if you want your captions to
appear under each image. If you don’t have any captions, nothing
will appear.

4. Preview your slide show in Step 4 of the Wizard. If everything is fine,
click the Next button.
Use the navigation buttons to scroll through each image. Click the Full
Screen Preview button to see your images at full-screen size, which is
shown in Figure 17-15. 
5. To burn the slide show onto a CD, click the Burn button in the Output
Options list, shown in Figure 17-16. If you want to publish the CD
later, proceed to the next step.
For more on burning onto CDs, see Chapter 7. 
6. Click the Done button.
Album saves the creation, and it is selected at the top of your Photo
Well. You can access the video CD slide show by double-clicking it in the
Photo Well.
Creating photo books
When you’re looking for that special gift, either for yourself or someone else,
photo books can fit the bill. Using Album, you design the book with your
photos and text. After you design your book, you access an online service,
such as MyPublisher, which I discuss in Chapter 15. Prices start as low as
$29.95 for a book with a minimum of 10 pages.

Chapter 17: Creating Projects

Photo books can be great for preserving the memories of a wedding, reunion,
birth, graduation, or other special occasion. They are also perfect gifts for
less formal occasions as well. Here are a few situations when a photo book
would make an excellent gift:
 Classroom or team gift: Take photos of all the students in a class or
on a sports team or club. Let them all create their own message, which
you then enter as a caption for their photo. Have the students pitch in
a dollar or two toward the price of the book, and you have a wonderful,
personal thank-you gift for a teacher or coach.
 Gift for the bride and groom: You could do the same thing for a
couple getting married. Take childhood photos of the bride and groom,
add photos of their courtship, and finally end with photos of their wed-
ding. Add personalized captions, and I guarantee you’ve got a gift that
will be appreciated much more than a toaster.
Here are the steps to create a photo book:
1. Start your creation by following the steps in the section “Making
Creations with the Creations Wizard,” earlier in this chapter. 
This takes you to Step 2 in the Creations Wizard.
Figure 17-16:
Choose 
an output
option, like

294
Part V: Creating Larger Projects with Photos 

2. Choose the style of photo book you want and then click Next.
If you choose the Just Photos style, you will not have the option of
adding captions.
3. In Step 3 of the wizard, specify the following options. Click Next when
you’re done. 
• Title: The title will appear on the cover and first page of the photo
book.
• Subtitle and Author: The subtitle and author name will also
appear on the cover and first page of the photo book.
• Header and Footer: Enter text for the header and footer of the
photo book, if you want these items, and if the style you chose
allows them to be added.
• Include Captions: Select this option if you want captions to appear
under each photo.
• Include Page Numbers: Select this option if you want your photo
book to have page numbers. 
4. Preview your photo book in Step 4 of the Wizard. If things look okay,
click the Next button.
Use the navigation buttons to scroll through each page. Click the Full
Screen Preview button to see your photos at full-screen size.
5. If you want to publish your book, select one of the following printing
options. If you want to print it later, skip to the next step.
These are your printing options:
• Order the book online: Click the Order Online button to order a
hard-bound, printed photo book from MyPublisher.com.
• Print it yourself: If you want to print the book on your own printer,
click the Print button in the Output Options list. You can then take
it to your local copy shop to have it wire or coil bound.
See Chapter 15 for details on using online services. For details on print-
ing, see Chapter 14.
6. Click the Done button to exit the Creations Wizard.
Album saves the creation, and it is selected at the top of your Photo Well.
Editing Creations
If, when previewing your creation in Step 4 of the Creations Wizard, you
notice that a photo needs cropping, rotating, or other edits, you need to work
outside of the Workspace and Creations Wizard to fix the problem. Follow the
steps below to find out how:
295

I
f you’ve made enough albums, slide shows, and cards (see Chapter 17) to
keep your friends and family happy for awhile, then you may be ready to
try your hand at some other types of projects. Web photo galleries and Adobe
Atmosphere 3D galleries are great ways to share your images with others. You
post the galleries online, and anyone who knows the URL can go and view
the images in his or her Web browser. Both galleries offer a variety of creative
styles and different options. If online galleries aren’t your cup of tea, then
check out the section on “Going Beyond Album” later in this chapter. Here
you will find lots of ideas on how you can use your inventory of digital images
to make your life more productive, more organized, and more fun.
Creating a Web Photo Gallery
Album allows you to share your photos by posting them online in a Web
Photo Gallery. Don’t worry, you don’t need to know HTML (the code used
to publish Web pages). If you can push your mouse button, you can create
a Web Photo Gallery. Album gives you different gallery styles and various
options to customize your gallery to your liking. Follow these steps to
create a Web Photo Gallery in a matter of minutes:
1. In the Photo Well, select the photos and video clips you want to
include in your Web Photo Gallery. 
2. Choose Creations➪Web Photo Gallery.
You also can click the Create button on the Shortcuts bar. Or you can
click the Select Command button in the Workspace window and choose
Web Photo Gallery from the menu.

Photoshop Album opens the Web Photo Gallery dialog box with your
items added. You can now select options and specify text to determine
the look of your gallery.
For detailed instructions on selecting an option or determining the look
of your gallery, click the Help button in the dialog box. For more infor-
mation on creating a Web Photo Gallery, click the Creating a photo
gallery for the Internet link; advanced users who want to create an
Adobe Atmosphere 3D Gallery can click the Creating an Adobe
Atmosphere 3D Gallery for the Internet link.
3. Choose a style from the Gallery Style drop-down menu, shown in
Figure 18-1.
You have several options, from Vertical Frame to Spotlight to Theater.
A preview of the splash page for your selected style appears in the top-
right corner of the dialog box.
4. Enter a name in the Site Folder text box for the folder that will contain
your gallery files. Use the path listed to save the folder or click
Browse to select the folder location on your hard drive. 
It is a good idea to keep it simple and use lowercase letters and numbers
with no space or punctuation when naming your site folder. That way
the Web server will be able to easily decipher the name.

Part V: Creating Larger Projects with Photos 

Once the Web Photo Gallery is completed, you can copy this folder of
gallery files to a Web server. 
5. Click the Banner tab, (refer to Figure 18-1), and specify the following
options, which may or may not be available depending on your
chosen style:
• Title: Type a name for the gallery. The title will display on your
Web page and in the browser’s title bar. 
• Subtitle: Type an optional subtitle for your gallery. Depending on
which gallery style you chose, the subtitle may appear in the
footer, the header, or not at all.
• E-mail Address: Type your e-mail address if you want it to appear
in your gallery. Depending on the gallery style you choose, it may
or may not be displayed.
• Font and Size: Choose a font style and size.
6. Click the Thumbnails tab, shown in Figure 18-2, and set the following
options:
• Thumbnail Size: Choose a size option for your thumbnails from
the pop-up menu. In my example, I chose Medium.
• Font and Size: Choose a font style and size for the labels of your
thumbnails. 
• Use Filename, Caption, or Date: You can choose to have the file-
name, caption, and date appear next to each thumbnail. Note that
captions and dates are not available for some gallery styles. For
more on adding captions, see Chapter 6.
7. Click the Large Photos tab, shown in Figure 18-3, and set the following
options for your full-size images: 
• Resize Photos: Choose this option if you want the photos to resize
and then choose a size from the pop-up menu. If your recipients
have fast Internet connections, you can choose X-Large, and your
photos will fill up the screen. Stick to smaller sizes if your viewers
have slower connections.
If your photos are small and low resolution, resizing them larger than
their original size will degrade their quality. Conversely, if your images
are large and very high resolution (larger than 1 megapixel), as are mine
in the example, they will take a long time to load, and your viewer may
have to scroll in all directions to see the entire image.
Because the files in my example are very large, I resized them to
Medium. For lots of information on resolution, see Chapter 3. 
301
Chapter 18: Taking Creations to the Next Level

• Photo Quality: Drag the slider bar to specify the quality of your
photos. Better quality means a larger file size and longer download
times for your viewers.
• Font and Size: Choose a font style and size for the labels that will
appear next to your photos. Note that this option may not be avail-
able for all styles.
• Use Filename, Caption, or Date: Select any or all of these labels for
your photos.
8. Click the Custom Colors tab (if available) to specify the colors to be
used in your gallery. To change the color of a component of your
gallery, click its color swatch and select a new color using the Color
Picker, shown in Figure 18-4.

You can choose colors from the Color Picker several ways:
• Choose a color from the Basic colors list.
• Click any color in the large multicolored box (called a color matrix)
on the right side.
• Enter numeric values in the Hue, Saturation and Lightness or Red,
Green and Blue text boxes to define a custom color. Then click the
Add to Custom Colors button.
Your chosen color appears in the Customs Color list.
9. Click OK to create the gallery and preview it in the Web Photo
Gallery Browser window, shown in Figure 18-5. When you are doing
previewing, click the Close button. 
Album creates and saves the following HTML and JPEG files in your des-
tination folder (which you specified in Step 4): 
• JPEG images inside the Images subfolder 
• HTML pages inside the Pages subfolder 
• JPEG thumbnail images inside the Thumbnails subfolder 
• Index HTML file for the splash (or home) page of your Web Photo
Gallery

10. Upload the files in your destination folder to a Web server.
Contact your Internet service provider (ISP) to find how and where to
transfer the files. Don’t worry; almost all ISPs will walk you through the
process. 
You also can post your images online by using a photo sharing Web site, like
Shutterfly.com. Posting images online is even easier than creating a Web
Photo Gallery and allows you to add fun decorative borders around images
and other goodies. See Chapter 15 for details.
Creating an Adobe Atmosphere
3D Gallery
Feel like making something really funky? Try creating an Adobe Atmosphere
3D Gallery. This gallery type takes your photos and puts them on the walls
of a 3D virtual building that viewers can walk through (virtually, that is).
You can then post this gallery on the Web. You also have a chat option
that enables multiple visitors to walk around the gallery at the same
time and chat online about the experience.

1. From the Photo Well, select the photos you want to include in your 3D
Gallery. 
2. Choose Creations➪Adobe Atmosphere 3D Gallery. 
3. Choose a style from the Gallery Style pop-up menu, shown in
Figure 18-6.
A preview of the style you chose appears in the top right of the dialog box. 
A music track will accompany the gallery. The type of music depends on
the style of gallery chosen. Refer to the left of the preview window for
details on the type of music for each gallery style.
4. Choose the Enable Chat option if you want to let multiple visitors view
your gallery at the same time.
Here’s more information on this option:
• Each visitor will be displayed in the gallery by a human figure
called an avatar. The avatars walk around, representing the visi-
tors’ navigation through the gallery. 
• If you select this option, when viewing your completed gallery, a
check box appears, enabling users to show or hide the chat area.
If the chat area is showing, a field is available for visitors to type
their comments. In turn, visitors can see the comments of all of
the other visitors. 
• The chat/multiple visitors option only works if you upload your 3D
Gallery to a Web server. Contact your Internet service provider to
find out how and where to upload your files. 
Web pages are available to anyone who has an Internet connection.
If you choose the Enable Chat option, your gallery may be visited by
people you don’t know. If you want to keep the gallery private, do not
select the Enable Chat option. Or consider password-protecting the
gallery Web page when you upload it to the Web server. Your Internet
service provider can show you how to password-protect the Web page
containing your gallery.
5. Enter a name in the Site Folder text box for the folder that will contain
your gallery files. Use the path listed to save the folder or click Browse
to select the folder location on your hard drive.
When you’ve completed the 3D Gallery, you can copy this folder of
gallery files to a Web server.

Contact your ISP for the directions on how to do this.
Read the next section to find out all you need to know to navigate
around the 3D Gallery.
You can replace any gallery style, or what Adobe calls worlds, that shipped
with Album with your own designed world by placing the new gallery AER
file into one of the template folders in Program Files/Adobe/Photoshop
Album/Shared Assets/AtmosphereWebGallery. And, if you have
Atmosphere Builder software program, you can open up any of the tem-
plate gallery AER world files and edit them as you see fit.
Viewing and navigating the Adobe
Atmosphere 3D Gallery
After you upload your Adobe Atmosphere 3D Gallery to a Web server, it is
accessible for visiting. When your visitors go to your Web page and view your
gallery in the Web browser, they can walk around it in various ways.

Version 5.0.1 or greater. No other Web browsers are supported at this time.
Here’s the lowdown on navigating around the gallery:
 Click the Start Guided Tour button to move through the gallery. You
view the photos along the walls. To stop the tour, click in the 3D view or
click the Stop Guided Tour button. 
 Drag the mouse in the 3D view to move through the gallery. Drag left
and right to rotate the direction of view. Drag up and down to move for-
ward and backward. To change the view up and down, hold down the
Ctrl key while dragging up and down. 
 Use the arrow keys to navigate through the gallery. Press the left- and
right-arrow keys to turn left and right. Press the up- and down-arrow
keys to move forward and backward. Again, hold down the Ctrl key, and
the up and down arrows move the view direction up and down.
 Click any photo in the gallery to see a larger view. This view also
includes the caption or other labels you chose during the creation
process, as shown in Figure 18-8.

As I mention in Chapter 10, if you are serious about image editing, you really
should have a neutral gray background. I know this is oh, so boring, but a neu-
tral and unbiased editing environment ensures that your color corrections are
as accurate as possible. Still, you gotta have some fun. As long as your wallpa-
per isn’t showing while you do your image editing, then feel free to go crazy.
Follow the simple two-step procedure below to use a photo for wallpaper.
1. From the Photo Well, select the photo you want to use. 
2. Choose Edit➪Set as Desktop Wallpaper. 
That’s all there is to it! Your photo is now desktop wallpaper, as shown
in Figure 18-9.
Using photos as a screen saver 
in Windows XP
You can take two or more photos to create a Windows XP screen saver. That
way, when you walk away from your computer you can have your gorgeous
photos display and protect your monitor at the same time. If you’re not using
Windows XP, check the Help file of your particular operating system to find
out how to create a screen saver.

ered all the great things Album can create. But why stop there? There are so
many other ways of using your photos. In this section, I give you a few ideas,
but in no way does this list represent everything you can do. There are virtu-
ally no limits. Before you know it, there won’t be an element left in your life
that doesn’t include your photos.
Getting your images onto stuff
Many local copy shops, retail shops, and Web sites enable you to add photos
to T-shirts, mugs, buttons, tote bags, ties, mousepads, plates, and even cakes
and lollipops! If you can think of it, they can put a photo on it. You can even
do a lot of this stuff yourself, as described in the following sections.
T-shirts
Buy plain white T-shirts at your local discount department store or plain
aprons and tote bags at your neighborhood craft or fabric store. Then buy
special transfer paper at your office supply or computer store. Print your
photos on the transfer paper, iron the print onto the fabric, and you’ve got
yourself a personalized gift for very little cash outlay.
I’ve known a couple of really ambitious people who transferred photos onto
patches of fabric and created gorgeous memory quilts. What grandparent
wouldn’t love a quilt with photos of their children and grandchildren? If
you’re not crafty, maybe you could trade your photographic skills with 
someone who can sew?
Posters
You can get poster-size prints at some copy shops and service bureaus. Call
and talk to a knowledgeable rep at your copy shop or service bureau so you
know exactly how you need to prep your file. Here are a few questions to ask:
 What file format and resolution should the file be?
 What size prints do you offer?

Part V: Creating Larger Projects with Photos 

 Do you provide mounting and lamination services? Many service
bureaus offer great-looking oversized prints that they then mount
on foam core or a sturdier material called gator board. These service
bureaus also can laminate prints to protect them from scratches and
UV rays. The edges of these posters are finished and clean, and the print
is ready to hang on the wall.
Documenting projects
Another great use for photos is to document your projects from beginning to
end. Whether it is a project involving home improvement, auto repair, furniture
building, crafts, or cooking, take photos at each stage to document the project
both for the preservation of memories and for more practical reasons. 
Photos can be great as a teaching tool when showing others how to do 
something. Import the photos into Album and create notes on each step of
the project. Here are a few examples of projects you may want to document:
 Your garden: Take pictures of your garden each month or each season.
That way you can create a journal of how your garden looks during the
year. It is also fun to see how that little twig of a tree goes to maturity
over the years. Import the images into Album and create notes on what
and when you planted, what worked, and what didn’t.
 Classes and workshops: If the instructors don’t mind, you also can
take your camera to your next class or workshop. Whether it is a new
yoga, pottery, or flower-arranging class, documenting the positions or
steps of a class will help you to practice or recreate it on your own later.
Photo Potpourri
Before I leave you to take your photos to the next dimension, here a few extra
ideas:
 Use photos to show off your work. That’s right. Photographers and
artists aren’t the only people who benefit from portfolios. Think of cater-
ers, florists, carpenters, landscape architects, interior designers, tailors
and seamstresses, jewelry designers — the list is endless. 
 Use pictures if you’re selling something. Pictures speak louder than
words. Whether its real estate or puppies, attaching a photo to an ad adds
some sales punch. Post those photos for online auction sites like eBay.
313
Chapter 18: Taking Creations to the Next Level

 Have your kids incorporate photos into their school reports and 
projects. In fact, buying your children their own inexpensive point-and-
shoot cameras may give them a little more enthusiasm for school work.
 If you’re having a dinner party, make fun placecards for your guests.
Then when they leave, give your guests recipe cards with a photo of the
wonderful meal on the front of the card.
 Make CD labels and jewel case covers with your photos. If you are
burning a CD of images or of a creation, why not also create a custom
label and cover that features a photo or two? It gives the CD a more pol-
ished appearance and looks much better than writing the title with a
magic marker. There are many inexpensive CD labeling packages that
come equipped with templates to use with a variety of programs.
 If you have storage boxes or drawers that are hard to reach or access,
take photos of the contents, print them out, and attach them to the
outsides of boxes or drawers to show what is inside. I recently saw a
TV show on homes of the stars, where an actress took Polaroids of her
shoes and pasted them to the outside of the boxes so she could see at a
glance what shoes were inside what box. At first, I thought this was frivo-
lous and only for the rich and famous, but in retrospect I think it can come
in handy. You can even laminate the cards at home or at a copy shop. It
will make searching through storage containers a lot less aggravating.

 Telling a story
E
ven if you have no aspirations to be the next Ansel Adams or Edward
Weston, you’ll want to take photographs that are interesting and well
composed. Keeping a few simple concepts in mind, you can vastly improve
the quality of your photos — both in production quality and conceptual or
creative quality.
Don’t worry. You won’t have to memorize all these tips. Employing just one
or two will make a huge difference in your photos. 
Establishing a Focal Point
The single most important compositional tool is to establish a focal point —
a main point of interest. A viewer should be able to immediately identify the
subject of your photo. If there are too many elements competing for atten-
tion, then the focal point is probably not obvious. The eye needs to be drawn
to a subject.
One of the biggest mistakes amateur photographers make is not having a
clearly defined focal point. Make sure that your pictures don’t include too

much insignificant background clutter like furniture, walls, tables with food,
and so forth. What you really want to capture are the smiles and surprised
expressions of your family and friends.
Here are some tips on establishing a clearly defined focal point:
 Move closer to your subject. 
 Include a point of interest in scenic shots. 
One sunset pretty much looks like the rest. But throw a fisherman cast-
ing his line or a child finishing up the final touches on a sand castle, and
your image is elevated to a higher level.
 Include elements in the foreground to add depth and a sense of scale. 
It is even better if you place that foreground element off center.
 Use foreground elements to frame your subject. You can use elements
like tree branches, windows, archways, and doorways to frame a wide
shot and add depth.
Using the Rule of Thirds
One of the primary concepts of good composition is based on geometry.
The Rule of Thirds says that if you mentally divide an image into a grid of
nine equal segments, as shown in Figure 19-1, the elements most appealing
to the eye and most likely to be noticed first are those that fall on or close to
the intersections between the sections, on the dividing lines. Therefore, when
framing your shot, try mentally dividing your frame into vertical and hori-
zontal thirds and position the main focal point, your most important visual
element, of the shot at any one intersection of the dividing lines. Check out
the image of the buffalo in Color Plate 19-8 to see this rule in action.
For portraits, try putting the face or eyes of a person at one of those inter-
secting points, as shown in Figure 19-1.
Moving from Center
If you follow the Rule of Thirds (described in the preceding section), you
will naturally move things away from the center of the frame. But if the Rule
of Thirds is too hard for you to remember or employ, when you look through
the viewfinder, just repeat this mantra, “move from center.” We have been
told since we were toddlers to always color within the lines. So naturally,
we have a tendency to want to center everything. Get it nice and orderly.
But centered subjects are often static and boring. Asymmetry often gives
us more dynamic and interesting images, as shown in Figure 19-2.
318
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Here are a few tips to get you moving from center:
 Either move your subject off center or move your viewfinder and place
the focal point off center. 
 In landscapes, avoid placing a horizon line dead center. It makes your
images look like they’re cut in half. Instead, position the horizon one-third
or two-thirds of the way up. A low horizon creates a dreamy and spacious
feeling, while a high horizon gives an earthy and intimate feeling.
If you have an autofocus camera, make sure that you lock the focus when
moving from center. If you have an autofocus camera, you’ll need to lock the
focus when moving from center because the autofocus sensor will lock onto
whatever is in the center of the viewfinder — not on your desired subject.
Autofocus can also be problematic when trying to do something as simple as
photographing two people (in this case you may want the two people in the
center), and your camera keeps focusing on the space in the distance
between them. Here is how to lock the focus:

Getting Close to Your Subject
Many people worry about photographers cutting their heads off when they
get their photos taken from an amateur photographer. But in actuality, more
often than not, most photographers tend to capture too much. Too much
boring or distracting background, that is. Although you can always crop your
image later, either at the photo lab or on the computer, it is better to try and
get your subject to fill the frame when you take the photo. Not only is the
composition usually stronger that way, but it always ensures you have enough
pixel information to enlarge the photo if necessary. See Chapter 3 for more on
pixels and resolution.
Getting closer provides intimacy, especially with people, as shown in
Figure 19-3. Long shots create distance and distraction. Look through the
viewfinder and fill the frame with your subject. Only include what comple-
ments your main subject.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Don’t get too close, or your image may turn out blurry. If you’re less than
three feet away from your subject, the chances are good that you will end up
with blurry images. 
Cleaning Up Your Background
I bet you have at least one or two photos that have a telephone pole,
branches, or some other inanimate object sticking out of your loved one’s
head (I know I have torn up a few such pictures in my day).

321
Chapter 19: Ten Tips for Composing Better Photos

Here are some tips on ways you can clean up your background:
 Shoot at a different angle. Sometimes a vertical shot helps to eliminate
unproductive space on the sides of the subject.
 Move around your subject, even go above or below it, if possible.
Moving around may help eliminate unwanted clutter.
 Move your subject, if it is a person or small object, to try and get
the optimum background. An optimum background is usually free
from distracting elements like furniture, tree branches, poles, wires,
chain link fences, signs, bright lights, lots of loud colors, busy wallpaper,
and so on.
If the background doesn’t enhance the subject, rethink including it in the
photo. A plain background places the focus on the subject. 
 Use background elements to enhance, not distract. This is not to say
that your background has to be a totally blank slate. That can be boring.
You can use landmarks, props and even use decorations in background
to give context to images, as shown in Figure 19-4, and help to define an
important event. Just don’t give the background first priority.

322
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

 Use space around a subject to evoke a certain mood. A lot of space
around a person can give a sense of loneliness, just as a closely cropped
portrait can create a feeling of intimacy.
 If you’re stuck with a distracting background, you can try blurring it
by using a wider aperture (like f/4 instead of f/11 or f/16) on your
camera. This will make the depth of field (areas of sharpness in relation
to your focal point) shallower so your subject is in focus, but the back-
ground isn’t.
Because consumer digital cameras use image sensors that are
typically one-third of the size of a 35mm frame, the lens is very close
to the sensor, which really increases the depth of field. This can make
it hard to blur the background. Not a problem, if you can’t do this on
your camera, you also can do it digitally, using a program like Photoshop
or Photoshop Elements.
Lighting Your Subject
Lighting is one of the most important elements to consider when taking
photos. When we think of lighting in regards to photography, the first thing
that comes to mind are all those photos that we’ve taken in the past that are
either overexposed (too dark) or underexposed (too light). With lighting you
have to not only consider whether there isn’t enough or there’s too much,
but also consider these factors:
 The direction of the light
 The intensity of the light 
 The color of the light
 Whether you’re shooting in natural light (outdoors) or artificial light
(indoors) 
 How to use lighting creatively to lead the eye and create a certain mood
A lot of these factors are interrelated. I bet you never thought that light could
be so darn complex. Well, don’t go anywhere because it’s all broken down
concisely below.
If the light isn’t right for your shot, you have quite a few choices — hurry
up and wait, move yourself, move the subject, add more light with a flash,
or diffuse light. Of course, which you choose depends on the circumstances
around the shot and what’s convenient or most productive. Here are a few
tips to remember about light:
323
Chapter 19: Ten Tips for Composing Better Photos

 The best light for photographs is in the early morning and later after-
noon. The light is softer, and the shadows are less harsh.
 Avoid taking portraits at midday. The overhead sun causes ugly shad-
ows and makes people squint. 
 If you must shoot in midday sun, use a reflector to block some of the
sunlight or fill in the shadow areas. Or you can use a scrim to diffuse
the light. See Chapter 20 for more on both items.
 Cloudy or overcast days are great for photo taking, especially por-
traits. The light is soft and diffused, and flatters the face.
 Shooting subjects with backlighting (where the lighting is coming
from the back) can produce very dramatic results. Figure 19-5 shows
an example. Subjects have a soft halo around them. If you want to see
the details of the subject, and not just their silhouette, use a fill flash to
lighten the shadow areas.
 Watch that the brightest light source isn’t directed right into the lens.
This will cause lens flare, those funky light circles that appear in the final
image.
If you’re up for it and it’s a bright, sunny, cloudless day, you can try the
Sunny f/16 rule. This rule helps prevent the camera from automatically
underexposing (making too light) your subject because of all the bright
light. Put your camera on manual mode. Then set the aperture to f/16
Figure 19-5:

images.
324
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

(if the subject is being lit from the front) and the shutter speed to the
nearest reciprocal of the ISO of your film. For example, if your film is ISO
200, set the shutter speed to 1/200. For side-lit subjects, use f/11. For
backlit subjects, use f/8.
 Take into account the color of the light. The light at noon is white, the
light at sunset is orange, and the light at twilight is blue See Color Plate
19-9 to see how the color of the light can make an image feel warm or cool.
 Use a flash when necessary. Use a flash in low-light conditions. If
your built-in flash isn’t cutting the mustard, you may want to invest in an
accessory flash (see Chapter 20). Use a fill flash with a backlit subject or
in midday sun to help lighten harsh, shadowy areas.
Getting Creative with Light
Even though I tout the merits of certain kinds of light, you can actually find
good things to shoot in all lighting conditions. Look for those unique compo-
sitions created by the interplay between light and shadow areas or how the
light illuminates a particular subject.
Lighting by itself can make or break a certain mood or emotion. Think of a
simple beam of light coming through the roof of an old barn. Or a thin shaft
of light that streaks across an otherwise shadowed face. Even in the lousiest
weather, the most beautifully lit images can emerge. Think of how dramatic a
backdrop is with dark, stormy clouds. When wet objects are lit, they seem to
shimmer, as shown in Figure 19-6. Remember the wise old proverb about
everything being beautiful? It is up to you to see it.
Using an Unexpected Angle
For photos of people, using direct eye contact is a good thing. It provides a
sense of realism and makes the image more intimate and warm, pulling you
into the photo. But for some subjects, using a front or eye level angle may not
be the best. More of an extreme angle may provide a more interesting image.
Experiment by taking a photo from above (bird’s eye view) or below (worm’s
eye view) the subject. Try changing your perspective on how you normally
would look at the subject. Here are a few ways this can change the photograph:
 Unexpected angles can exaggerate the size of the subject. The subject
may appear either larger or smaller than normal, as shown in Figure 19-7.
Try this technique with scenic shots, which can tend to be rather static
or even plain boring. 
325
Chapter 19: Ten Tips for Composing Better Photos

 Changing your viewpoint can change the mood of the image. If the
shot of this cactus had been taken from a directly front angle, it would
have been pretty dull. Taking from below, looking up, exaggerates the
height and makes for a stronger and more exciting composition, making
the cactus seem like nature’s skyscraper.
Remember that children are not at the same eye level as adults. We so often
shoot down at them, making them appear smaller than they really are. Try
kneeling, or sitting on the floor and getting down to their level. Do the same
for pets and other small creatures. You will also find that you get less dis-
tracting background in the frame, and the lighting from your flash will more
evenly cover the face.

Keeping It Sharp
With the great digital imaging programs we have today, it’s amazing the
number of flaws that can be fixed. Red eyes, color casts, and flat contrast
all can be repaired with a click of a few buttons. One flaw that isn’t so easily
reversed is out-of-focus or blurry images. You can apply sharpening filters in
Elements and Photoshop, but even those applications do a marginal job and
often make the image appear overly grainy. 
It’s better to capture an image sharply and in focus rather than to try and 
salvage it later. The following sections give you some tips on how to capture
sharp images.

327
Chapter 19: Ten Tips for Composing Better Photos

Using a tripod
Using a tripod or monopod will give you the sharpest image, especially in
low-light conditions. It will also allow you to shoot a slower shutter speed
without the risk of incurring blurriness. If you don’t have a tripod or mono-
pod, use the roof a car, a fence post, a tree branch or any other handy and
fixed ledge. See Chapter 20 for more on tripods.
Using a tripod along with the self-timer on your camera will let you get some
shots of yourself, too!
Catching fast-moving subjects
Using slower shutter speeds creates colorful blurs of moving lights or sparks.
Faster shutter speeds freeze the image and capture it as-is. For sports shots
or any shots where there is movement, you have a couple options:
 Prefocus on an area where you anticipate the next action will be. 
 Pan the action. Set the shutter speed to 1⁄30th of a second or slower and
move the camera to follow the motion of the subject. In other words, keep
the subject in the same spot in the viewfinder. This technique keeps the
subject sharp and blurs the background, enhancing the feeling of motion.
Understanding Digital
Camera Focus Issues
There are some specific focus issues that are unique to digital cameras:
 Image sensors: It is especially important to keep digital cameras steady
because the image sensors these cameras use are a third smaller than
35mm film. This means a digital image will be three times larger than a
35mm image. Consequently, any movement will make the digital image
three times as blurry. 
 LCD monitors: If you consistently have blurry images, try using
the camera’s viewfinder, not the LCD monitor, for taking your photos.
When you use the LCD monitor, you hold the camera away from your
body and, therefore, probably won’t hold it as still. Hold your camera
with both hands, keep your arms close to your body and stand with
your feet firmly planted. 
 Shutter lag: You probably noticed there is a lapse from the time you
press the shutter release button and when the exposure is complete.
This is referred to as shutter lag and may be the cause of a blurry image.
328
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Or even worse, your subject may even move out of the photo during
that lag, as shown in Figure 19-8. It goes without saying that you want to
try not to move the camera after you press the shutter release button.
Get used to the lag of your camera so you can anticipate it. If your
camera has a burst mode or best shot mode, try it.
Check your camera documentation to see what features are offered. 
Digital cameras are great because they give you instant feedback on your
photos. Check the photo in the LCD monitor immediately after taking it, make
the necessary adjustments you need and reshoot, if possible.
Giving Direction
When you look at those magazines that feature the year’s best photos, they
all appear spontaneous and a matter of pure serendipity. Sometimes that’s
the case, but more often than not, the photographer arranged the shot or
waited for the right light.
As an amateur photographer, you also shouldn’t be afraid to play photo stylist: 
 Give directions on where you want people to stand, how to stand, and 
so on. For example, tell people to touch each other, putting their arms
around each other, as shown in Figure 19-9, or bringing their heads in
toward each other.

Chapter 19: Ten Tips for Composing Better Photos

 Designate the location.
 Use props, such as trees or cars, to arrange people around.
 Use a variety of poses. Have some people sit and others stand.
 If it is a large group of people or you are dealing with unruly kids or wild
pets, get someone to help direct. Just make sure that the parties being
photographed pay attention and look at you, the camera.
 Try and get people to relax. While spontaneity can yield great images,
you can still get good photos from posed subjects if they aren’t hating
the experience.
Getting Vertical
Sometimes it’s hard to fight comfort. Most photos are horizontal just for the
mere fact that it is easier to hold the camera that way. That’s fine for a lot of
shots (such as the ubiquitous group photo and many landscape shots). But
other subjects — portraits of one person, buildings, trees, waterfalls, moun-
tain peaks, flowers, giraffes, Shaquille O’Neal, and so forth — lend themselves
to a vertical format, as shown in Figure 19-10.

photograph-
ing, while

their spirits.
330
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Turn the camera and look through the viewfinder to check if a vertical orien-
tation lends itself to a stronger composition. Often, vertical images are more
impactful because vertical lines by nature create a feeling of action, whereas
horizontal lines create a feeling of harmony or tranquility. Vertical shots often
help to fill the frame and either reduce useless space to the left and right of
the subject or eliminate distracting background elements.
Using Leading Lines
Leading lines are lines that, either by the actual elements in the image or by
the composition of those elements, lead the eye into the picture and often to
a point of interest. These lines add dimension, depth and perspective by car-
rying the eye through the photo:
 Diagonal lines are dynamic and evoke movement.
 Curves are graceful and harmonious. 
 Horizontal lines are peaceful and give a feeling of balance. 
 Vertical lines are direct and active. 
Figure 19-10:

331
Chapter 19: Ten Tips for Composing Better Photos

There are many elements that provide natural leading lines, especially in
scenic or landscape photos such as roads, walls, fences, rivers, shadows,
skyscrapers, bridges and so on. The image of the Great Wall in China in
Figure 19-11 is an example of curved leading lines. Check out Color Plate 19-8
to see another example of leading lines.
Telling a Story
This last tip can’t really be quantified in technical terms. You just know it
when you see it. When you look at an image and it evokes an emotional
response from you, you will end up with a memorable photo. Maybe the
image tells an immediate story or maybe the image is more mysterious. It
draws you in and makes you yearn to know more. The bottom line is you
want an image that carries a message.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 

So often people snap away capturing the obligatory “record” shots. I’m not
suggesting that those photos are bad. I’m suggesting that you can turn a
record into a work of art without a whole lot of extra effort.
Try to capture images that go beyond the obvious or cliché. Keep an eye out
for the unexpected or unusual. Get off the beaten path. Sometimes it isn’t the
destination or event that produces the great photo. It is the trip along the
way. That great shot of Grandpa feeding his grandchild before his first birth-
day party may be the image that wins everyone’s heart rather than the
obvious “kid playing with cake” shot. Maybe the shots of the Mayan ruins in
Mexico were nice, but it was the photo you took of a young boy and his even
younger brother, selling Popsicles from a push cart on the way to the ruins,
that sticks in your mind.
Even mundane or routine events that show the bonds between people or give
insight into a culture can yield those truly special images. Sometimes finding
the right shot is a matter of chance; sometimes you need to take the time to
build a relationship with the people or with the place. Learn to trust your
instinct for those just-right shots.

Ten Great Digital Camera
Accessories
In This Chapter
 Essential accessories
 Nice-to-have extras
I
f you made the switch from a film camera to a digital camera, you may be
interested in acquiring accessories to further enhance your photograph-
ing experience. Some of those accessories fall into the must-have category
while others are nice to have. Acquire them as your budget allows, or drop
subtle hints around gift-giving holidays and occasions.
Essential Accessories
There are a couple of accessories that are really more like necessities. It can
be frustrating when you find yourself in the midst of a picture-perfect moment
only to find that your batteries died, or your memory card is maxed out. So be
the perfect Boy Scout and stay prepared with the following two accessories.
Extra batteries
You’ve got to have juice. Make sure and buy at least one if not a few spare
batteries. The cost is really minimal in comparison to the agony you’ll feel
when (not if, but when) they run dry. Here are a few points to keep in mind
about batteries:
 I recommend using rechargeable Nickel Metal Hydride (Ni-MH) cells along
with a trickle charger (a low-current charger that continuously charges
batteries without risk of damage) for the batteries. These batteries are
more powerful than their counterparts, last the longest, and can even be
repurposed for use in other devices in a pinch.

 If your camera uses custom-designed rechargeable Lithium-Ion batteries,
shown in Figure 20-1, buy extras and keep the spares charged.
 Avoid alkaline batteries like the plague.
 To conserve battery life, use your AC adapter when you can. For exam-
ple, bust out with the AC adapter when you’re sharing your images with
others by viewing them on the LCD or when you’re transferring your
photos onto your computer. These processes can quickly (and unneces-
sarily) eat up battery life. 
Using a flash and the LCD when photographing tends to shorten your battery
life even more. Don’t stop using these functions (if you need a flash, you need
a flash). Just be stocked with extra batteries, fully charged of course.
Extra memory cards
Digital cameras store their images in a few ways, in the camera’s internal
memory, on memory cards, or a combo of both. Whether your memory card
is CompactFlash (shown in Figure 20-2), SmartMedia, Memory Stick, Secure
Digital/MultiMedia, x-D-Picture, or some other flavor, having more cards
means having more photos.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Card sizes currently range from 16 to 2GB (gigabytes), with a 4GB card just
around the corner. The sizes available depend on your particular type of
card. I recommend buying a card with the largest memory you can afford (or
the largest memory that your camera can handle). Here are a few additional
considerations:
 For the budget conscious: If budget is a concern and you’re a casual
photographer, you can get away with 32 to 64MB cards.
 For photoholics: If you’re using a high-resolution camera, or shooting in
high-resolution mode, you should really consider 256 to 512MB cards.
Although cards aren’t as cheap as film, you can use them over and over, and
they last for years.
Useful Extras
When you’re fully equipped with spare batteries and memory cards, you can
start to explore those accessories that aren’t vital but can make your photo
taking better, easier, and more fun. Here’s a partial list. Look around on the

Web, and I’m sure you’ll find lots more. Check out the Web site of your partic-
ular camera manufacturer for the latest gadgets for your model of camera. Or
visit www.ritzcamera.com, a reputable dealer that offers lots of digital
camera goodies.
Flashes
My biggest complaint when I bought my digital camera was the weakness
of the built-in flash. It’s no wonder — the built-in flash has the equivalent
strength of about an ISO 100 film. After getting way too many dark images, I
purchased an accessory flash for $150, shown in Figure 20-3. This particular
flash is extremely easy to use, and I’m sure it’s not an anomaly. I just slip it on
the hot shoe of the camera. I don’t even have to turn it on! And now even my
interior shots look great.
If your digital camera doesn’t allow for a dedicated accessory flash, you can
always use a slave flash. These types of flashes do not require a mechanical
or electronic connection to your camera. All you do is hold the flash toward
your subject, and the flash does the rest; it automatically goes off at the same
time that your built-in flash does. You also can buy a mounting bracket that
allows you to fasten the slave flash to some camera models.
You don’t have to use your flash just in low-light situations. You can use a fill
flash to get rid of harsh shadows on your subject or to bring out details in a
subject where the lighting is coming from the back.
Tripods or monopods
With the advent of image-editing programs, it is amazing how you can repair
and enhance images. Unfortunately, no image-editing program can perform
miracles. For example, you can’t use Album (or even its heavy-duty cousins,
Elements and Photoshop) to make blurry images, er, unblurry.
If you’re tired of blurry images, and you’re even more sick of using car
roofs, tables, or ledges to steady your camera, add a tripod or monopod
(like a tripod but with just one leg) to your camera bag. These accessories
offer you several advantages: 
 You can capture a sharp photo, especially in low-light conditions. 
 You can shoot pictures at a slower shutter speed without the risk of get-
ting a blurry image.
 You can use them for night shots. Simply set up your camera to a slower
shutter speed to create streaks of lights or set it to a faster shutter
speed to freeze the image.
338
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

You also can purchase mini tripods for around $25 to $50. Mini tripods are
compact and work great with digital cameras.
Lenses
Several manufacturers make lenses that can be used interchangeably with
both digital and film cameras. For example, digital SLR (single lens reflex)
cameras accept Nikon, Canon, or Contax lenses made for film cameras. 
Manufacturers (like Nikon for example) also produce lenses intended specifi-
cally for digital cameras. Because they are designed for digital cameras, they
are smaller and lighter than traditional lenses. So if you’re a digital SLR
owner, look into wide angle, telephoto, or fish eye lenses to add another
dimension to your photo taking.

Chapter 20: Ten Great Digital Camera Accessories

Filters
Improve the quality of your images with filters. Filters are like glass lens caps
that you place over the end of your camera lens. Here are a few you may want
to consider for your camera:
 UV filter: Helps to filter out UV rays and provide better contrast for
your photos.
 PL (polarized light) filter: Great for shots involving reflections from non-
metallic surfaces like water or glass.
 FD filter: Wonderful for shots under fluorescent lighting, giving a more
natural-looking light rather than the dominant green tint often seen.
Lights, reflectors, scrims, action
Shooting in high midday sun isn’t the greatest. It causes nasty, harsh shad-
ows on people’s faces, enhances flaws, and makes people squint. Here are a
few accessories that combat these problems:
 Reflector: If you find that you do a lot of photographing in high, midday
sun, you can purchase a reflector to block some of the sunlight or fill in
the shadow areas. Here’s how to use it:
• To block the sun, hold the reflector between the subject and
the sun. 
• To fill in shadows, hold the reflector next to the subject and
bounce light onto the side opposite the sun.
 Scrim: Diffuses the harsh light. A scrim is white translucent fabric
stretched across a frame. For smaller subjects or close-up shots, you
can buy smaller diffuser panels. Position the scrim between the sun and
your subject to soften the light.
You can purchase all these goodies at a photo supply store for a nominal cost.
Compact printers
Just as cameras are getting smaller while their quality is improving, so are
other devices such as high-resolution printers. Manufacturers, like Olympus,
Hewlett-Packard, and others are even making tiny printers. When I say tiny, I
mean small enough to stuff in a camera bag! The quality is great, and they
range in price from around $150 to $800.
340
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

These miniprinters connect directly to your camera and output 4 x 6 prints,
which you can use as proofs or hand out to guests at gatherings. Canon
recently came out with a postcard printer, which quickly prints out a coated
postcard-size photo. On the back are spaces for the message, the address,
and a placeholder for the stamp. Be sure and check the Web for sites like
www.dpreview.com for the latest in digital camera accessories.
Paper and media
If you plan on printing your photos at home, invest in good quality paper. I
recommend running tests with various brands of paper to see which works
best with your printer. I have found that often the manufacturer’s brand of
paper just works the best with the manufacturer’s printer. I have owned four
Epson printers and have run tests with lots of brands of paper. I always come
back to Epson paper because it gives me the best results. If you’re a Costco
member, you’re in luck. You can get 100 sheets of photo quality paper for $20.
If you find that a cheapie store brand is just as good, more power to you.
Digital prints tend to fade over time, especially if exposed to sunlight.
Invest in archival paper if it is essential that your prints stay fresh and bright.
Likewise, if you want to store your images on CD for eternity (or close to it),
make sure and use an archival CD-ROM such as Verbatim DataLife. Archival
CDs should last for up to a hundred years. Don’t forget to stick a copy in your
safety deposit box as a backup.
Just for fun
Although not an accessory, ultra-compact digital cameras are light, practical,
affordable, and just plain fun. A few good ones are 
 Minolta DiMAGE, which is the size of a deck of cards and costs
around $400 
 Sony DSC-U20 Cyber-Shot, which is 4.2 ounces and costs around $250
 SiPix StyleCam Blink, which is only 1.5 ounces and a measly $40
Although these cameras won’t give you the highest quality large images, what
you do get is convenience. Here are a few instances where they might come
in handy:
 For photographing notes on a white board at a meeting or in a class.
 For quick on-site inventories of items.
 To photograph potential new cars you’re considering buying.
341
Chapter 20: Ten Great Digital Camera Accessories

 To photograph a car accident scene. You never know when you may get
into a fender bender or witness someone else getting into an accident.
Keep a camera in your car.
 For your kids to use. If you find your children begging to use your digital
camera, buy them an inexpensive ultra-compact camera that they can
take on field trips or outings with their friends. Then they can e-mail
their photos to relatives and friends.
Don’t leave home without it
If you are going on a photo adventure, remember that the best accessories
to have are not necessarily camera-related. First and foremost, the best acces-
sory to take is a cell phone — fully charged, with a spare battery if possible. If
you are going to the great outdoors and the location is away from civilization,
remember to take a flashlight, map, sunscreen, pen and pad of paper, water,
snacks, a watch, and a jacket (even if it isn’t cold when you leave). 
I recommend leaving extra water, a blanket, a first aid kit and a change of
clothes in the car. If you’re trekking alone, let someone know where you are
going and when you intend to return home.

Ten Cures for Ten Problems
In This Chapter
 You can’t import the files or files are missing
 You can’t print from Album
 Your catalog is corrupted
 Your images are below the optimum resolution
 You can’t read your PDF creation
 You can’t burn files on your CD or DVD
F
ew events are more frustrating than when your computer or software
applications don’t do what they’re supposed to. You’re not asking the
system to read your mind — just to perform the command that you ask it to
perform. Right?
Unfortunately, I came to the realization long ago (and maybe you did too) that
the computer and its buddies (the software applications) are just as human as
the rest of us and have those moments where they just don’t work at peak effi-
ciency. Maybe they’re a little overworked (need more RAM), or maybe they
need a makeover (updated drivers), or maybe it’s just — gasp — the infamous
operator error. Whatever the problem, maybe you can find the cure here.
Another good resource is Adobe’s Web site. Look at the Customer Support
link where you can find a great user-to-user forum, knowledge base, and list
of top support issues. Or you can always call your friendly tech support guy
at Adobe. Don’t be shy. I am sure he has heard it all and can lend you a hand.
But be warned that this “live” advice may cost you some cash.
Update Now!
As I write this book, Adobe has just released a Version 1.01 patch for
Album. Go to www.adobe.com and get the free download. If you have a
slower Internet connection, you can request a free CD from Adobe
Customer Service at (800) 492-3623. 

As with most initial versions of new programs, the .01 patch fixes a host
of bugs that users encountered in Version 1.0. Check the ReadMe file that
accompanies the download to see what problems have been remedied. Who
knows? Your problem may be fixed with the installation of the latest patch.
The Web site also should have instructions on how to install your download
in case you should need the help. Be sure and check Adobe’s Web site period-
ically for updates.
You Can’t Import Files
Problem: Short of gluing the photos on your monitor, you can’t import any
files into Album.
Possible cure: Make sure that the file formats of the files you are importing
are one of the many formats Album can handle. Here are the file formats
Album can import:
 Graphics: JPEG, TIFF, BMP, PNG, GIF, PSD, PDF, and PDD
 Audio: WAV and MP3
 Video: Motion JPEG, MPEG-1/MPG, QuickTime/MOV and Audio/Video
Interleaved/AVI
For everything you need to know about file formats, see Chapter 3.
If you have All Files chosen in your Files of Type pop-up menu and you
choose a file that Album can’t import, an Unsupported File Format
message appears in the Get Photos dialog box, as shown in Figure 21-1. If the
format is one that Album cannot import, you may first have to bring your file
into another application that can import that particular format and then re-
save it in a format Album can deal with. 
There are also graphic conversion programs such as Conversions Plus (about
$60, www.dataviz.com), HiJaak (around $150, www.imsisoft.com), and
Debabelizer ($450, www.equilibrium.com).
Some digital cameras use proprietary file formats that Album cannot import,
such as Camera RAW or JPEG 2000. If yours is one of them, first try setting
up your camera to use the JPEG format, if possible. If all you have are propri-
etary formats, you will have to use the software that came bundled with your
camera to convert those files to a standard format, such as JPEG or TIFF.
344
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

If you get an error message that the file is too large, Album is letting you
know that the file exceeds its 12-megapixel limit. This limitation has been
fixed in the Version 1.01 patch. In Version 1.01, the file size is limited only by
the amount of available RAM you have installed on your system. For example,
a 12-megapixel image requires 128MB of RAM, while a 20-megapixel image
requires 512MB of RAM. Insufficient RAM can cause a host of other problems
as well, such as problems in making creations, thumbnails that won’t display,
and so on.
Your Devices Aren’t Talking
to Each Other
Problem: Your peripherals, such as your scanner, camera, printer, Zip drive,
or even your mouse, aren’t talking to your computer.
Possible cure: There could be many reasons why this scenario is taking
place. Here are a few troubleshooting suggestions:

Chapter 21: Ten Cures for Ten Problems

 Check that everything is well connected and powered up. Hey, I see
you rolling your eyes! Don’t be so sure your problem is a huge one until
you rule out the possibility that the issue is a simple power supply prob-
lem. I have had a couple of instances where my printer and scanner cable
connections weren’t well seated, and my computer wasn’t seeing the
scanner or printer.
 Make sure that you have the latest drivers for all your peripheral
devices. You also want to make sure that your drivers are compatible
with your flavor and version of your operating system. This is an espe-
cially critical step whenever you upgrade your operating system. Just
keep in mind that sometimes manufacturers are slow to provide updated
drivers when OS upgrades are released, so you may experience a time
lag. Make sure and check the manufacturer’s Web site frequently for
updates. 
Occasionally, drivers get corrupted and need to be reinstalled. Just
recently, a family member of mine had a dead mouse (luckily it didn’t
smell). After a little troubleshooting (like making sure the mouse was
well connected), the culprit turned out to be a corrupted mouse driver.
Reinstalling the driver brought it back to the land of the living. 
 If you purchased a new piece of hardware, and your operating system
is on the outdated side, you may need to upgrade the OS before your
new device can communicate with your computer. Check the manufac-
turer’s Web site for details.
 Make sure your application software is up to date. Check Adobe.com
every now and then for patches and updates to Album. Do the same for
your external image-editing program and your digital camera software.
If you’ve tried all the suggestions in the preceding list and still had no luck,
here are a few possible workarounds:
 If your computer is communicating with your scanner, but Album itself
just can’t recognize the scanner, you can always scan your images using
the software that came bundled with your scanner. Then, import your
scanned images using the method of getting files from your hard drive,
as described in Chapter 4.
 If your computer can see your camera, but Album doesn’t recognize it,
remove the memory card from the camera and insert it into your card
reader. Then try and import the files from the card reader. If that doesn’t
work, get the images from your camera using the software bundled with
the camera and copy them to your hard drive. Then import the files into
Album from your hard drive, again as described in Chapter 4.
346
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

You Can’t Print from Album
Problem: No matter how much you curse, perform voodoo, or kick the
printer, no printed matter is coming out.
Possible cure: Because there are more reasons why you can’t print than
probably any other type of computer glitch, you may not find the cure here.
The problem may require some serious troubleshooting and possibly the help
of your local computer guru. But before you have to fork out some hefty per-
hour consulting fee, try a few of these suggestions:
 Try printing a small file, such as a one-word text file, to determine
whether you can print at all. Maybe the problem isn’t isolated to
Album. It could be the fact that you are short on RAM or hard drive
space, and your file is too large to spool.
 Make sure your cable connections are well seated.
 Make sure your printer is turned on and that the status says “Ready”
or “Online.” Look for a nice, bright green light that says it’s rarin’
to print.
 Make sure that there isn’t a previous print job that is hung up or
paused in the print queue.
 Make sure that the printer driver hasn’t been corrupted. (See “Your
Devices Aren’t Talking to Each Other” earlier in this chapter.)
 If you’re connected to multiple printers, either via a network or by
cable, make sure that you have selected the correct printer in your
print dialog box in Album.
 Reboot your system. If you change the default printer in your Windows
operating system while Album is running, Album may not detect the
change until you close and restart the application.
 Try disconnecting any peripherals you have attached to your com-
puter that you are using. Occasionally, conflicts can occur between
peripheral devices and your computer.
 If you are printing to a shared printer (one that isn’t networkable),
make sure that the computer that is physically connected, via cable,
to the shared printer is turned on. Otherwise you won’t be able to
access that shared printer. 
 Trash the Windows temp files that may be clogging your system.
If you’re unsure how to do this, check your operating system
documentation.
 Check Adobe’s online technical support documents. They have some
good, detailed troubleshooting guides.
347
Chapter 21: Ten Cures for Ten Problems

Your Catalog Has Gone South
Problem: You attempt to open your catalog and get a message that there is a
problem with your catalog or that your catalog is corrupted.
Possible cure: Best-case scenario, your catalog could have been partially
damaged by a power outage or other kind of computer hiccup, but may still
be recoverable. Worst-case scenario, your catalog is dead and unrecoverable.
 First, try using the Recover command to see if it can repair the cata-
log. Choose File➪Catalog, click the Recover button, shown in Figure 21-2,
and then click OK. If the catalog was recovered and fixed successfully,
Album will let you know.
 If recovering fails, you need to restore your catalog. That’s assuming,
however, that you made a backup of your catalog. If you were the ever-
diligent Album user and you backed up your catalog, all you need to do
is insert your backup media, choose File➪Restore, choose the media (or
other storage volume) and select the backup copy of the catalog. Click
the Restore button, and you’re home free.
 No backup copy, you say? As painful as it may be, your only option is to
create a new catalog and re-import your files:
Figure 21-2:

restore your

348
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

For details on recovering, restoring, creating new catalogs and most impor-
tantly, making catalog backups, see Chapter 7.
Your Files Are “Broken”
Problem: You notice broken page icons on the thumbnails of your images in
the Photo Well.
Possible cure: These icons, shown in Figure 21-3, indicate that your files are
missing. Or at least Album thinks they are. Album works on the system of
linking. Linking places a low-resolution, proxy image in your catalog with a
link to the original, full-resolution image on your hard drive. If you move a
photo, video clip, or audio clip from its original location to a new one,
Album can’t find the file and considers it missing. You just need to use the
Reconnect Missing File command and show Album where the file now
resides.
The Reconnect command doesn’t work for files that have been renamed out-
side of Album or even worse, deleted from your hard drive. For details on
reconnecting missing files, see Chapter 7.
Figure 21-3:
If you move

file, Album

349
Chapter 21: Ten Cures for Ten Problems

Your Images Are below the
Optimum Resolution
Problem: When publishing your creation, you get the message that your
image is “below the optimum resolution” for either printing or viewing at this
size, as shown in Figure 21-4.
Possible cure: You have several options, unfortunately none of which is a
quick or easy fix.
 If you took the photo with a digital camera, you need to reshoot the
photo, if possible, using a higher resolution. Of course, if the photo is
of the Eiffel Tower and you’re sitting in your office (which isn’t in Paris),
that option isn’t very feasible. But if the photo is a portrait of a family
member, and he or she is willing to give you another shot, then go for it.
If necessary, check your camera’s documentation to see how to increase
the resolution of the camera.
 If the image is from a scanned print, slide or negative, you need to
rescan the image at a higher resolution. Even though programs such as
Photoshop Elements and Photoshop allow you to resize an image larger
and at a higher resolution, you want to avoid resizing if at all possible. It
is much better (if time consuming) to rescan the image.
Check out Chapter 3, which tells you all about resolution and related
topics.
 If reshooting or rescanning isn’t possible, you may have to live with
using the image(s) in a different way. For example, if you really wanted
to create a photo book or print a greeting card and the resolution isn’t
sufficient, you may have to live with a slideshow or eCard instead. Viewing
images on-screen requires a much lower resolution than printing them.

350
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Finally, you could always try and find suitable substitutes for the images you
initially wanted to use. I know that it’s hard to find an equivalent replacement
for the Eiffel Tower, but maybe in other instances it might be easier.
Your Files Are Marked with “?”
Problem: You see question mark icons on the thumbnails of your images in
the Photo Well.
Possible cure: If there is no date embedded in the image, Album places a
“???” icon on the thumbnail. If the clock on your camera or operating system
is malfunctioning, the question mark may indicate an incorrect date and time
stamp. Or you may have no date or time at all.
Dates are used extensively in Album as a way to identify, find, and organize
your files, so it makes good sense to have a date and time assigned to every
file. If you want to assign dates and times to all the files with unknown dates
and times (see Figure 21-5), you can find all the vital details on making date
and time adjustments in Chapter 5.

351
Chapter 21: Ten Cures for Ten Problems

You Can’t Edit Your Photo
Problem: You can’t edit your image when you bring it into the Fix Photo
dialog box.
Possible cure: Check the file size of your image. Album Version 1.0 can work
with images with a resolution of up to 12 megapixels. If the resolution is any
higher, Album won’t touch it. If you have an external image editor, such as
Photoshop Elements or Photoshop, you can downsize the image there. To fix
the size limitation, make sure and download the free Version 1.01 patch from
www.adobe.com. See the earlier section, “Update Now!”
You Can’t Read Your PDF Creation 
Problem: You, or your recipients, cannot open your creation in Adobe
Acrobat.
Possible cure: First, check the version of Acrobat you (or your recipients) are
using. Acrobat 4.0 and earlier versions are not compatible with certain types
of Album creations. Make sure and use the latest version of Acrobat or Acrobat
Reader. You can download Acrobat Reader for free from www.adobe.com.
Make sure that you check the box to include the options with your Reader
software, which includes the ability to view Album slideshow and eCards.
Note that the file download size is 13.4MB, so make sure your Internet con-
nection can handle that size.
If your recipient is a Macintosh OS X user, tell him or her not to double-click
the PDF creation file itself. Instead, have the recipient launch Acrobat Reader
and choose File➪Open and choose the file from the Open dialog box.
To view your PDF creations with the best quality, especially with template
styles such as “Casual” that have photos positioned at an angle, you should
set your Acrobat preferences to enable “smoothing.” Here’s how: 
1. Choose Edit➪Preferences➪General in Acrobat and Edit➪Preferences
in Acrobat Reader.
The Preferences dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 21-6.
2. Select Display from the left side of the Preferences dialog box.
3. Check the boxes for “Smooth Line Art” and “Smooth Images,” shown
in Figure 21-6. Then click OK.
Checking these boxes helps to prevent any jagged or raggedy-looking
edges on your artwork.
352
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

You Can’t Burn Files onto
Your CD or DVD Disc
Problem: You cannot burn creations, a backup catalog, or an image archive
to your CD or DVD disc.
Possible cure: Here are a few troubleshooting tips:
 Be sure that you have the latest drivers available for your CD or DVD
drive. And make sure the driver is compatible with your flavor of operat-
ing system. Although Album has been engineered to work with most CD
and DVD drives, there may be some drives that it flat cannot work with.
 If you experience repeated problems burning your catalog or files to CDs
or DVDs using Album’s backup and archive commands, you may have to
use a more manual method. If you have enough space, try backing up or
archiving your catalog or files to your hard drive. Then use the software
bundled with your drive, or an external burning program, to burn the
files to the CD or DVD.

353
Chapter 21: Ten Cures for Ten Problems

 With some CD-RW drives and CD-RW discs, Album may be unable to
overwrite a disc that has information already on it. If it can’t overwrite
the disc, try using a blank CD-RW or CD-R disc.
For details on using Album’s backup and archiving features, see Chapter 7.
