Preface
Recent years have seen a growing interest in the effects of relativity in atoms, molecules 
and solids. On the one hand, this can be seen as result of the growing awareness of the 
importance of relativity in describing the properties of heavy atoms and systems 
containing them. This has been fueled by the inadequacy of physical models which either 
neglect relativity or which treat it as a small perturbation. On the other hand, it is 
dependent upon the technological developments which have resulted in computers 
powerful enough to make calculations on heavy atoms and on systems containing heavy 
atoms meaningful. Vector processing and, more recently, parallel processing techniques 
are playing an increasingly vital role in rendering the algorithms which arise in 
relativistic studies tractable.
This has been exemplified in atomic structure theory, where the dominant role of the 
central nuclear charge simplifies the problem enough to permit some prediction to be 
made with high precision, especially for the highly ionized atoms of importance in 
plasma physics and in laser confinement studies. Today's sophisticated physical models 
of the atom derived from quantum electrodynamics would be intractable without 
recourse to modem computational machinery. Relativistic atomic structure calculations 
have a history dating from the early attempts of Swirles in the mid 1930's but continue to 
provide one of the primary test beds of modem theoretical physics.
In non-relativistic molecular structure calculations the use of basis set expansion 
techniques is almost mandatory. Although it has been known since the work of Kim in 
the late 1960's that there are problems associated with the use of basis set expansion 
techniques in relativistic electronic structure calculations, these difficulties have only 
recently been resolved. By affording a firm foundation for the ab initio treatment of 
molecules containing heavy atoms and the interactions between them these developments 
open up new horizons for modem theoretical chemistry. Relativistic quantum chemistry 
has a vast range of potential applications in both the academic and the commercial 
sectors in fields as diverse as catalysis and pharmacology, molecular electronics and 
molecular biology. However, relativistic electronic structure calculations for molecules 
will remain demanding for some time to come both in the requirement for more efficient 
and reliable numerical methods and algorithms, and for the computer resources which 
these methods require.
Relativistic solid-state calculations will be just as demanding. In solid-state theory the 
emphasis has until now been more on deriving physically intuitive approximation 
schemes which seem tractable. The consensus which has enabled atomic and molecular 
physicists and theoretical chemists to build general purpose models has, so far, not 
existed amongst solid-state theorists.
This volume records the proceedings of a meeting on "The Effects of Relativity in 
Atoms, Molecules and the Solid State" held under the auspices of three of the Science 
and Engineering Research Council's Collaborative Computational Projects : Project 1 - 

Electron correlation in molecules, Project 2 - Continuum states of atoms and molecules, 
and Project 9 - The electronic structure of solids. The meeting was held at The Coseners 
House, Abingdon, Oxfordshire, over the weekend 30th March - 1st April, 1990.

RELATIVISTIC EFFECTS ON PERIODIC TRENDS

1. INTRODUCTION
Whether we work on atoms, molecules or solids, we have in 
common the Periodic System. At least seven different trends 
can be found in it, see Figure 1. The last three of them are 
of relativistic origin. Some of their particular consequences 
on chemical and physical properties of elements are shown in 
Figure 2. A few recent examples are quoted below.
2. A REVIEW OF REVIEWS
Grant (1970) reviewed the relativistic calculations on atoms 
and Pyykkd (1978) the ones on molecules, including a chapter 
on "Relativity and the Periodic Table". These effects were 
brought to the attention of many chemists by Pitzer (1979) or 
Pyykkd and Desclaux (1979), and have now entered the inorganic 
chemistry textbooks by Cotton and Wilkinson (1988) or Mackay 
and Mackay (1989).
The book by Pyykkd (1986) includes 3119 references (and 
seems to miss about 1% of the relevant material). Some later 
reviews are mentioned in Table 1.
3. SOME RECENT RESULTS IN CHEMISTRY
The valencies of gold. It was suggested already by Pyykkd 
(1978) that the relativistic destabilization of the 5d shell 
would explain the well-known valency increase from Ag(I) to 
Au(III). Schwerdtfeger (1989) has now_compared the calculated 
stabilities of the (free) halides AuX2 and AuX4 , and expli­
citly demonstrated that the preference for the higher oxida­
tion state, III instead of I, indeed is of relativistic ori­
gin.
The "gold maximum". The relativistic contraction and stabili­
zation of the ns valence shell (n = 4 to 6) suffers a local 
maximum at the coinage metals, group 11. Schwarz et al. (1989) 
analysed the origins of this trend.

"Relativistic compounds". A number of novel organometallic 
compounds have recently been synthesized and characterized, in 
which a weak attraction, roughly of 10 kcal/mole or half of an 
eV, much like in a good hydrogen bond, seems to exist between 
formally closed-shell Au(I) atoms having a 5d10 configuration. 
More generally, bonds between 5d10, 6s2 or the configuration 
5d8 are found. Without explicit proof, these bonds are pre­
sumed to have strong relativistic contributions. In any case, 
this "relativistic encouragement" has been a source of inspi­
ration for the syntheticians, as evidenced by some of the 
titles of Balch et al. (1987), Nagle et al. (1988), Raptis et 
al. (1989), Scherbaum et al. (1988), and Wang et al. (1988).
A particularly striking example is the octahedral, six- 
coordinate carbon complex {(Ph^PAu)6C}2+ of Scherbaum et al. 
(1988). The carbon electron octet could then form, in 0^ 
symmetry, an (a^^) 2 (tlu) 6 "8-electron-7-centre bond". In addi­
tion, the Au-Au attractions would help. The only available 
calculation on it is that by Rosch et al. (1989). Both the Au- 
Au and the C-Au interactions are found to contribute to the 
bonding.
Perturbative Hartree-Fock-Slater studies on the bonding in 
the 5d -6s2 molecule Tl2Pt(CN)4 by Ziegler et al. (1989a) 
suggest that the interaction between thallium and the tetra­
cyanoplatinate has both strong ionic and covalent components.
Au|+. A clean example on the 5d10-5d10 attraction would be the 
gas-phase Au2+, claimed by Saunders (1989). The theoretical 
situation is summarized in Table 2. The pseudopotential HF or 
CI calculations and the semiempirical tight-binding calcula­
tions give a repulsive ground state. The non-relativistic DVM 
calculations by Li et al. (1990) are seen to considerably 
overbind for Au2+ and thus lack credibility. Therefore the 
observation, if true, must come from an excited electronic 
state (Mukherjee et al. 1990). Both their TB calculations and 
the present PP-HF ones jndeed find such a minimum in the 
states promoting one 5da antibonding electron to the 6scr 
bonding MO.
The ground-state PP-CI curve of Ermler (private communica­
tion) can be divided to three domains:
a) R > 6 a.u.: A large-R domain with superposed +1/R repulsion 
and an - <x/R4 charge-polarisability-type attraction. The coef­
ficient of the latter gives an Au+ polarisability, X, of about 
14.2 a.u.
b) About 5 < R < 6: Some extra bonding (about 0.065 eV) but no 
minimum.
c) R < 5: Extra, Pauli repulsion.
Trends along triads. The bond strength trend Cu > Ag < Au was 
explained quite early as a relativistic effect (see Ziegler et 
al. (1989b) and, for later literature, Balasubramanian 
(1989a).) A similar trend is seen in various organometallic 
compounds of groups 6 (Cr > Mo < W), 8 (Fe > Ru < Os), 9 (Co > 
Rh < Ir), 10 (Ni > Pd < Pt), and the strengthening has also 
been shown to be a relativistic effect (Ziegler et al. 1989b). 
For the same trend among the group 6 dimers, see Ziegler 
(1987). A recent experimental example on this De trend are the 
diatomic molecules Culn > Agin < Auln (Balducci et al. 1989).

Trends in Periodic System(s)
IMain vertical trend: First shell of each I ano­
malously small (1s, 2p, 3d, 4f). Due to "primo- 
genic repulsion", larger <r> for larger n.
2 .Main horizontal trend: Smaller <r> for larger Z.
3 .Main periodicity; Filled shells particularly 
stable. Half-filled non-relativistic shells also.
4 .Partial screening effects: d-shell contraction, 
lanthanoid contraction.
5 .Relativistic contraction and stabilization (s, p). 
6.Relativistic expansion and destabilization (d, f) 
7.Spin-orbit splitting.
No deep group-theoretical principle.

For bond lengths it is rather more rare that the 5d element 
should have a shorter bond than the corresponding 4d element. 
A notable exception are the hydrides and fluorides of groups 
8-12, see Figure 16 of Pyykkd (1988a). New examples of the 
same type (4d>5d) are the intermetallic diatomics NiPd/NiPt, 
CuAg/CuAu and AgAg/AgAu (Taylor et al. 1990). Further group 11 
diatomic examples are considered by Schwerdtfeger et al. 
(1989b).
As to the metals, Takeuchi et al. (1989) demonstrate that 
the cohesive energy trend Ag<Au and the closely similar lat­
tice parameters come from relativistic effects; without them 
metallic gold would have a clearly larger a0 and a smaller 
cohesive energy than silver.
Schwerdtfeger et al. (1989a) discuss the question, why is 
thallium preferentially T1(I) in inorganic but Tl(III) in 
organometallic chemistry. Recall that the lighter elements B- 
In are preferentially trivalent.
Superheavy elements. Historically, this is the area where 
relativistic effects were originally thought to have their 
main relevance in chemistry. Kratz et al. (1989) have now 
studied the aqueous chemistry of Element 105 and find it to 
rather resemble that of Nb and Pa, instead of that of Ta. No 
calculations exist yet.
As to the atomic ground states, Glebov et al. (1989) cal­
culate for Element 104 a 7s26d17p1 one, with the s2d2, analo­
gous to the lighter homologues Ti-Th, lying 0.5 eV higher. The 
chemical properties of element 104 are nevertheless predicted 
to be those of a typical d-element.
Actinoids. For actinoids, Ziegler et al. (1989c) find that the 
An-X (X=F-I) bonds show only small relativistic contractions 
but the An-H and An-C(u) bond energies still are greatly 
strengthened by relativistic effects.
Liquids. Not much is known about relativistic effects on the 
electronic and geometric structure or the thermodynamic pro­
perties of liquids, such as melted lead. For a recent example, 
see Jank and Hafner (1989).
The importance of the reference state. Stromberg and Wahlgren 
(1990) considered relativistic effects on the stability of the 
mercurous ion, Hg22+, on a relatively low Ist-order PT quasi- 
relativistic level and concluded that, relative to the 2 Hg+ 
dissociation limit, the relativistically shortened molecule 
may actually lie higher, i.e. be relativistically destabi­
lized. Near the minimum of the well the kinetic-energy stabi­
lization would still operate, as found by Ziegler et al in 
1981 or by Neisler and Pitzer (1987). A further calculation, 
also yielding a bound well for the free mercurous ion, was 
published by Durand et al. (1987).
Inspired by this provocative statement, the sketch in Fig. 
3 then suggests that, while the mercurous ion is certainly 
destabilized with respect to the 2 Hg thermodynamic ground 
state, it is as certainly stabilized with respect to the 2 
Hg2 reference state, at least in the gas phase. This would 
explain why +1 is a common oxidation state for Hg, compared to 
+11.

Trends in one-electron levels. The valence levels of M20 
(M=A1-T1) show an interesting trend: the metal ns levels go 
down and the oxygen 2p levels up along the series; the cros­
sing occurs at In. This leads to rather different photoelec­
tron spectra for these molecules (Ruscic et al. 1986).
Another particular example is the influence of the relati­
vistic stabilization of the Hf 6s AO on the energy of the a-. 
MOs of the tetrahydroborate (Hohl and Rosch 1986). This trend 
is quite common.
Electron affinities. Miyoshi et al. (1988) demonstrate expli­
citly that the (quasi)relativistic contributions diminish the 
EA of WF6 by 1.1 eV. It would be tempting to attribute this 
straightforwardly to the relativistic destabilization of the 
5d LUMO of the neutral species.
Colours. Relativistic effects are supposed to strongly influ­
ence a number of observable colours, see ch. IV.E of Pyykkd 
(1988a). The best documented and most conspicuous case is the 
yellow colour of gold. Preliminary Multiple-Scattering work by 
El-Issa and Zanati (unpublished) suggests, that the colour 
difference between the red MoS42” and the yellow WS,2“ would 
mainly come from shell-structure effects. The relativistic 
destabilization of the LUMO, which is only partially 5d for W, 
would not be, after all, the main reason.
In the case of pentaphenyl bismuth, Schmuck et al. (1990) 
suggested, on the basis of a REX/EHT comparison, that the 
violet colour is caused by the relativistic stabilization of 
the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital, which now is an alz 
containing substantial Bi 6s character. This assumption does 
find support in the MS calculations. Furthermore, all non- 
relativistic transitions are symmetry-forbidden and only the 
relativistic one, perpendicular to the C4v axis is allowed, in 
agreement with experiment (El-Issa, Pyykkd and Zanati, 
unpublished). For symmetry even all relativistic trans­
itions are forbidden.
Mulliken (1928,1989) pointed out that the red atmospheric 
oxygen bands come from the X 3S - b transition of 02. 
Being spin-forbidden, this transition derives it entire inten­
sity from relativistic effects. The same is true for all 
phosphorescent effects and, incidentally, for the red line of 
Aurora Borealis (XD to 3P of neutral atomic oxygen at 630.0 
nm) .
The violet colour of iodine arises from a 5p?r - 5pa H0M0- 
LUMO transition, whose 0-0 line lies at 641 nm in the red. As 
the relativistic stabilization of the o LUMO is some 1.6 eV 
(Yang 1976), strong relativistic effects on this transition 
energy can be suspected.
A further example is the yellow colour of hexachloro- 
plumbate(IV). The corresponding stannate is white (El-Issa, 
Pyykkd and Zanati, to be published).

RELATIVISTIC ATOMIC STRUCTURE CODES USING FINITE DIFFERENCE METHODS
Codes for the relativistic calculation of atomic structures and properties 
have continued to develop in response to the demands of physicists for models with 
greater physical realism. The MCDF/BENA packages and the modules associated with 
them (Grant et al. 1980, McKenzie et al. 1980) have been very widely used, and have 
proved particularly effective in making predictions of energy levels and 
wave-functions for highly ionized atoms. These wave-functions are the starting 
point for calculations of many other properties, for example line strengths or 
collision cross-sections.
The 1980 computer codes allow the user to construct models with quite 
realistic physics, limited primarily by the power of one’s computer and the cost of 
computation. Efficiency and economy are therefore as important as physical realism 
in code design. These codes construct the full Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonian in a 
basis of open—shell configurational states (CSF) of more or less arbitrary 
character. The radial wave-functions can be generated either as the solution of 
some model potential problem or as the solution of some self-consistent field 
calculation. In either case, the nucleus can be modelled as a point charge or can be 
given a finite size. The fully retarded transverse photon interaction between 
electrons in Coulomb gauge can be added as a perturbation to the Hamiltonian matrix 
in the CSF basis. Polarization of the vacuum due to the nuclear charge can be 
computed from the Uehling potential, and the self—energy of the electrons is 
approximated by a screened hydrogenic model.
However, the code has its weaknesses. For example, excited virtual orbitals 
are often difficult to compute, and there is no module for calculating radiative 
transitions. The need to remove these and other deficiencies led to a major code 
revision, resulting in the General-purpose Relativistic Atomic Structure Package, 
GRASP, (Dyall et al. 1989). Much of the original FORTRAN IV code has been rewritten 
in FORTRAN 77 to standardize the code and improve its portability, and all known 
errors have been corrected. There have been many technical improvements: for 
example, the original package NJSYM (Burke 1970, 1971) for calculating angular 
recoupling coefficients has been replaced by the much more efficient NJGRAF 
package (Bar—Shalom and Klapisch 1988), and the TRANSFORM module (Dyall 1986), 
which enables results to be output in non-standard angular coupling schemes, has

been added. The OSCL module permits the calculation of line strengths. Many 
algorithmic improvements enable the package to solve previously intractable 
problems, and the data handling has been modified to accommodate the growing trend 
towards more elaborate CSF descriptions of the wave-function. The code is now 
supplied in a form which requires the use of a pre-processor module to adapt the 
code to the target computer and to set dimensions and other basic parameters before 
compilation. GRASP has now been implemented on a very wide range of computers: 
enhanced PCs, SUN workstations, VAX computers, CONVEX and CRAY supercomputers 
amongst others. A User’s Manual is provided to give complete specification of the 
input options available, a description of the program structure, and some help 
with the set-up and use of the package. A review of the underlying theory of 
relativistic atomic structure calculations updating that of Grant (1970) with a 
detailed account of the use of diagrammatic methods of matrix element calculation 
in a basis of open shell CSFs has been published recently (Grant 1988).
Since the design of GRASP was frozen some 2 years ago, we have made further 
improvements which are embodied in a completely new version, GRASP2, (Parpia, 
Grant and Fischer, to be published). The code has been completely rewritten to be 
fully compatible with FORTRAN 77 and to make it more compact, efficient and easier 
to use. More accurate numerical algorithms are employed, and a new iterative 
scheme adapted from the methods of Fischer (1986) has allowed us to solve many 
problems on which earlier versions failed. It is now possible to include one 
electron excitations to orbitals of the same symmetry (nlj—» n'Ij) in orbital 
wave-function calculation, as well as including the corresponding off-diagonal 
one—electron matrix elements in the Hamiltonian matrix, which is all that was 
possible in earlier versions. Other new options are the evaluation of volume 
isotope shift parameters, and the use of a relativistic local-density 
approximation for exchange and correlation effects.
Problems treated with GRASP2 include the following:
High precision calculations of the levels of helium-like systems
Ve have studied the low-lying states of helium-] ike systems using the 
MCDF—OL procedure for 1 < Z < 36. The method of calculation, described in a recent 
paper (Parpia and Grant 1990) , uses a systematic enlargement of the CSF basis set 
combined with an extrapolation algorithm, to give a limiting value for the 
relativistic correlation correction to Dirac-Fock energies in the "no—pair” 
approximation. Dirac-Coulomb energies can be converged to 1 part in 107 by this 
method; the rate of convergence when the transverse electron-electron interaction 
is added is rather slower, and we have only achieved a precision of 1 part in 106. Ve 
have not calculated the remaining contributions in this study, of which the 
radiative and nuclear mass corrections are the most important. The correlation 
contributions are in excellent agreement with the results of Accad et al (1971) for 
the lowest members of the sequence.
As far as we know, this is the first time that an MCDF—OL study of 
correlation energies has been successfully carried out. Previous versions of GRASP 
(or the older MCDF) were very difficult to use in OL problems, and relativistic 
correlation studies would have been severely inhibited by convergence failures.
Many—body effects in the 4p spectrum of Sr I
The 4p hole spectrum of Sr I presents a much more complex physical problem. 
The subvalence inner-shell spectra of the alkaline earths Ca, Sr and Ba show a 
remarkable increase in complexity as the nuclear charge increases (Baig et al 
1983) which cannot be explained within an independent—electron scheme. In the case 
of the ip spectrum of Sr I, recent high resolution data by Connerade, Baig and 
18

Sweeney (1990) reveal supernumerary Rydberg series, Figure 1, whose presence is 
attributable to d-orbital contraction and attendant ‘s—d’ mixing in the parent 
ion. Ve have attempted to model this situation with GRASP2 using the MCDF-AL 
method. For some symmetries, up to 748 interacting levels must be taken into 
account. Ve have calculated both energy levels and line strengths for selected 
transitions, and have been able to confirm a multi-channel quantum defect analysis 
of the five Rydberg series shown in Figure 1. Our assignments are shown in Table 1. 
Some progress has also been made in the analysis of low-lying members of the 
spectrum. A full account of this work will be reported elsewhere (Parpia, Grant and 
Connerade, to be published).
ELECTRON-ATOM COLLISIONS USING THE RELATIVISTIC R-MATRIX METHOD
Our first calculations using a relativistic generalization of the 
well-known R-matrix method were published by Norrington and Grant (1981) for Ne 
II, and further work on Fe XXIII and Fe VII appeared in Norrington and Grant (1987). 
Progress has been hindered by a number of factors, of which one of the most 
important was the difficulty of constructing high quality wave-functions for 
excited states of the target atom or ion using GRASP. This problem has now been 
completely overcome with GRASP2. The R-matrix method (Burke and Robb 1975) depends 
upon the division of configuration space into two regions: an inner one centred on 
the nucleus of the target atom of radius a, large enough to completely contain the 
target charge distribution, and an external or ’’asymptotic” region. The full 
interaction between the scattering electron and the TV electrons of the target is 
treated by solving for the energy levels and wave functions of the (7V+1)—electron 
system when it is confined to the region r< a. The additional orbitals required to 
describe the excited states of the scattering electron in this region are obtained 
by solving the Dirac equation using the frozen core potential of the target. 
Orthogonality of these basis orbitals to the target orbitals of the same symmetry 
is enforced by Lagrange multipliers. The usual boundary conditions are employed at 
r- 0, and the small component ^(r) and the large component p\(r) are related on the 
boundary r- a by the formula (Norrington and Grant 1981, 1987)
2ac 
- b +
where cis the velocity of light (« 137 in atomic units), and is the Dirac angular 
symmetry quantum number. In the Schrodinger limit c—> oo, we have
Pi(a) —> Pi(a) + 0(l/c2), 2ac q\(a) —> aP' a) + ^iPi(a) + 0(l/c2),
so that our choice of boundary condition ensures that the Schrodinger amplitude 
Pi(a) satisfies the usual R—matrix boundary condition
i( a)/Pi( a) = b 
in the nonrelativistic limit. The wave function for the (7V+l)-electron system is 
assumed to have a CI structure and has components of scattering type as well as 
bound components that produce resonances in the cross-section. Exchange is 
neglected for r> a, and the scattering electron is assumed to move in the effective 
potential of the target. It is the matching of the inner and outer trial solutions 
on the boundary at r- a that allows us to deduce the scattering matrix as a 
function of the energy of the incident electron.

the inner region, it is necessary to correct for the remainder by the method of 
Buttle (1967); STP3E computes the necessary corrections. Finally, STGF computes 
the K-matrices, collision strengths and cross-sections required. STP1 is a 
completely new module; the others are largely taken over or adapted with little 
change from those used in current versions of the Belfast nonrelativistic R—matrix 
code (Berrington et al 1978).

The computed levels are all very mixed, with a composition consisting of a large 
number of contributing CSFs of low weight.
cAlthough the computed separations do not agree well with those measured by 
Connerade et al. (1990), the sequence of limits is in accordance with experiment. 
The quantitative discrepancies are due to the strongly mixed composition of the 
eigenstates which makes the results very sensitive to small perturbations. The 
details will be fully discussed in a paper by Parpia, Grant and Connerade (in 
preparation). The total energy of the lowest state was computed to be -701 731 067

The block structure of the new code, JJMTRX, is illustrated in Figure 2. STP1 
generates the additional orbitals in r < a and computes all the radial integrals 
required. This part of the calculation is effectively the same as a bound state 
calculation, and is done with modified modules from GRASP2. STP2 assembles the 
Hamiltonian matrix and the coefficients needed to construct the potentials in r > 
a, and STP3X diagonalizes it to give the (A+l)-electron eigenvalues and eigenvectors. 
As only a finite number of basis orbitals are taken into account in the inner region, it is 
necessary to correct for the remainder by the method of Buttle (1967); STP3E computes 
the necessary corrections. Finally STGF computes the K—matrices, collision strengths and 
cross-sections required. STP1 is a completely new module; the others are taken over or 
adapted with little change from those used in current versions of the Belfast nonrelativistic 
R~matrix code (Berrington et al 1978).
A first application of JJMTRX, giving a practical demonstration that we now 
have a satisfactory state-of-the-art production code, has been to study the 
collision strengths between low-lying states of neon-like Se XXV, an ion which is 
of some interest as a candidate for an X-ray laser system. Previous studies have 
used the nonrelativistic Coulomb-Born method (Zhang et al 1987) and 
nonrelativistic and relativistic distorted wave calculations were carried out by 
Reed et al (1985). Gupta et al (1989) have recently carried out R-matrix 
calculations using the Belfast Breit-Pauli code in an attempt to see if the 
discrepancies between predicted and observed laser amplification in some 
transitions was due to neglect of relativistic effects. Our calculation 
(Vijesundera and Grant, to be published) used 27 j-j coupled target states arising 
from the ls22s22p6 and ls22s22p53Z, I - s, p, d (nonrelativistic) configurations. 
Table 2 shows the energies of the 10 lowest states along with the predictions from 
other recent calculations. Sixteen orbital basis functions were constructed, 
using the STP1 module, for each of the symmetries = ±1, ±2, ..., ±15, taking the 
R—matrix boundary at a - 2.8 a.u. The dimension of the largest Hamiltonian matrix 
was 1750 for the total angular momentum/parity combination = 9/2 + . J values up 
to 23/2 were required to ensure convergence of the collision strengths to about 17,. 
The whole calculation took some 2| hours on the CRAY X-MP/28 at ULCC. Results for 
selected transitions are shown in Figures 3 and 4; agreement with the Breit—Pauli 
results of Gupta et al (1989) is much closer for the other transitions of their 
study, showing that it is primarily in the description of scattering involving 
excitation of the s electrons in which the Breit-Pauli calculation is most 
deficient.
RELATIVISTIC ATOMIC STRUCTURE USING SPINOR BASIS SETS
The radial wave-functions constructed in both GRASP and JJMTRX have been 
generated by traditional finite difference numerical integration methods. Despite 
their many virtues, this procedure has limitations. In particular, the generation 
of highly excited states and of continuum functions can prove very laborious, 
simply because each one-electron orbital has to be constructed by numerical 
integration, either independently, or as part of the solution of some coupled 
system of equations. The calculation of processes such as photoionization or 
electron scattering in which one or more electrons is ejected is therefore 
expensive, and the construction of sufficiently complete sets of functions for CI 
or MBPT calculations is difficult. In particular, the integration over continuum 
states required in MBPT proves messy and time consuming to do accurately (Kelly 
1964, 1966).
Theoretical chemists are familiar with an alternative method in which the 
wave-functions are expanded in a set of suitable functions, ideally functions 
which can form a complete set in the target Hilbert space. Such ideas have been 
explored in relation to relativistic atomic and molecular structure; many problems

have been encountered, as related, for example, by Kutzelnigg(1987). Spinor basis 
functions completely overcome these problems in atoms, and it is reasonable to 
expect that spinor basis sets will be applied in molecular structure calculations 
before too long. Once a choice of basis set has been made, the numerical 
approximation of orbitals involves the construction of a finite matrix 
representation of the Hamiltonian followed by its diagonalization. This process 
generates high quality representations of the orbitals representing the lower 
bound states of the effective potential and also square integrable 
representations, or wave packets, of the higher excited states and the free states 
in both components of the Dirac continuum. This is much more economical than finite 
differences if it can be made sufficiently accurate. To be acceptable, the 
computed values of observable quantities must converge with sufficient rapidity to 
the correct limit as the basis set is enlarged systematically. Ve have developed 
efficient computational machinery which has sufficient mathematical underpinning 
to make us confident that our results will be physically meaningful.
As a demonstration of the performance of our procedures, we present results 
for the Dirac—Fock ground-state of the mercury atom using both the Dirac-Coulomb 
and Dirac-Coulomb-Breit models with a point charge nucleus. The S~spinor basis 
functions used will be defined presently; we took a basis set, Table 3, of 
18s/16p/14d/12f even-tempered S-spinors, giving a total of 36+32+32+28+28+24+24 
= 204 orbital wave-functions. Table 4(a) shows that this basis set leads to a 
ground state total energy that agrees with the one obtained from GRASP to 7 
significant figures at the Dirac-Coulomb level and also with the energy obtained 
by taking the Breit interaction into account as a first order perturbation. The

agreement with orbital eigenvalues and mean radii is of similar precision so that 
the wave functions are also of high quality. Ve could probably increase the 
agreement by working to higher precision in GRASP and by slightly adjusting the 
parameters of the basis set. Table 5 shows the most interesting feature of this 
calculation, the noticeable change in the properties of the innermost orbitals 
when the Breit interaction is treated self-consistently. The effect on the total 
energy is barely significant at this level of precision. This calculation, which 
was to our knowledge the first basis set calculation for such a heavy atom at this 
level of precision, took just 27s on the CRAY X-MP/48
Mann (1969) was the first to include the Gaunt interaction (the unretarded 
form of the Breit interaction) self-consistently in a Dirac-Fock calculation of 
the mercury ground state. The large number of integrals required, typically 5-10 
times as many as the Coulomb interaction integrals, has discouraged further 
attempts of this sort until Lindroth et al (1989) did it again recently. They used a 
GRASP-style calculation based on numerical integration, and it is encouraging to 
note that the shifts, tfe, in the orbital eigenvalues due to the self-consistent 
treatment of the Breit interaction are in excellent agreement with our work, Table 
5. Lindroth et al (1989) give an extensive analysis of the use of the Breit 
interaction in Dirac-Fock calculations to which we refer the reader. The 
persistence of orbital modifications even in outer shells is remarkable and quite 
different from the perturbative corrections due to the Breit interaction, even 
showing sign differences for 4/and 5d orbitals.
Although this calculation took about the same time as GRASP, it yielded far 
more useful information. The method of approximation generates a complete set of 
states in a finite dimensional subspace of the target Hilbert space which can then 
be used, for example, as intermediate states in a many—body calculation (Quiney, 
1990). The discrete representation of the basis fits naturally into the Furry 
(1951) picture of QED, so that one has immediately a natural framework for 
relativistic perturbation calculations of electron correlation and radiative 
corrections. The pseudo—states in the continuum form natural quadrature points, 
reducing the integration over continuum energies to matrix operations, ideal for 
vector-processing computers (Quiney, Grant and Vilson 1985). Some mathematical 
considerations which support this approach have been discussed by Grant (1989).
Ve have previously published results for other systems, in particular for

argon ((Juiney, Grant and Vilson 1989) in which the Breit interaction was treated 
self-consistently. Although this is extremely expensive when finite difference 
methods are used, the computational overheads are negligible for this basis set 
method because the most time-consuming elements, the two-electron integrals, have 
already been computed for the Coulomb part of the interaction. (The finite 
wavelength contribution in the full transverse electron-electron interaction, 
which is essential for integrals in which both positive and negative energy states 
occur, needs additional terms which require further computing. However, the effect 
of these terms is rather small.)
The use of basis set methods in atomic structure may therefore significantly 
extend the range of effects that can be calculated economically on today’s 
computers. Already, we can see advantages for self-consistent fields and for the 
study of electron correlation effects using many-body methods. There seems little 
difficulty in calculating vacuum polarization corrections, and we hope to be able 
to find a way to include the leading terms in the electron self—energy within the 
scheme. If successful, this will remove one of the greatest uncertainties in 
present day atomic structure calculations due to the need to rely on 
unsatisfactory screening arguments and hydrogenic results (Mohr 1974, 1975, 1982; 
Johnson and Soff 1985) to estimate the self-energy. Finally, the same ideas have 
implications for relativistic molecular electronic structure calculations, as 
will be apparent from the papers by Dyall (1990) and Ishikawa (1990) in this volume 
(see also Clementi 1989).
Criteria for the selection of basis sets for relativistic atomic structure
The foundations of relativistic atomic structure theory were discussed by 
Grant and (juiney (1988), and that article should be consulted for detailed 
explanations. For simplicity, we shall only discuss the Dirac equation with a 
central potential; the extension to Dirac-Fock equations is obvious and is treated 
by Grant and (juiney (1988) and in the talk by (Juiney (1990) in this volume.
The radial Dirac equation can be written (using atomic units)
Ad u (r) = e u (r), 
(1)
where e = E- me2 is the energy relative to the bottom of the electron continuum,
(r) = 
, and
The radial density in (r, r+dr) is
D(r) = P2(r) + Q2(r) 
and we require that both
D( r) dr and ) D( r) V( r) dr 
are finite. These conditions have important implications for the behaviour of P(r) 
and Q(r) at the end-points, especially at the singularity r=0. Ve approximate P(r) 
and Q(r) by finite expansions of the form

Integration by parts gives II = II whenever the basis functions satisfy bound

Ve should like equations (2) to reduce correctly to the matrix Schrodinger 
equation as c —> oo and also that both matrix equations should have solutions 
approximating the exact bound state solutions as close as we please as M—> oo. The 
first condition essentially means that the operator which represents the 
nonrelativistic radial kinetic energy,
32

tL = ^nLS(ss)YL,
(3)
must approach the matrix T of the operator
2 dr2 2 r-2
as c—• cn. (For this identification of tL by elimination of 5 from equations (2) see 
Grant 1982, 1986.) This is easily secured by requiring that
Pi(r) —• [■^ + 7]7ri(r)> i=l, 2, ... ,M 
(4a)
as c—» cd (Nonrelativistic Limit Theorem for Basis Spinors). Notice that both p\(r) 
and 7Ti(r) may depend upon c, and that the theorem only requires (4) to hold in the limit. 
In order to ensure a balanced treatment of the negative energy (or positron) 
states, it is highly desirable to require also that
*i(r)^f--^ + |pi(r), l=1’2’ 
(4b)
These limiting conditions are related to the ’’Kinetic balance” condition which has 
been advocated by a number of investigators. In its original form (Lee and McLean 
1982, Stanton and Havriliak 1984, Aerts and Nieuwpoort 1986) ’’kinetic balance” 
meant adding derivative terms to the small component basis set in order that 
constructions of the type of (4a) could be accomodated. Others (Ishikawa, Binning 
and Sando 1984, Ishikawa, Baretty and Binning 1986) assumed that (4a) should be 
replaced by
i=i’2’ •••
so imposing Pauli’s approximation for the nonrelativistic limit of the small 
components (Bethe and Salpeter (1957), eq. (12.5)) on the relativistic basis set. 
The success of this form of kinetic balance in a number of studies (see, for 
example, the chapter by Mohanty and Clementi in Clementi 1989) is therefore not 
surprising. However, we emphasize that (5) is unnecessarily restrictive and that 
(4a,b) need only hold in the nonrelativistic limit.
A second theorem that has played an important role in the discovery of 
relativistic spinor basis sets is the Dirac Matrix Separation Theorem (Grant 1982, 
1986). This states that if we define
Vnin = inf 
V^p/p^p= inf Vsq/q^SSq
P 
q
and suppose that (4a) and (4b) hold along with Vmin > -2mc2, then the 2M 
eigenvalues of the matrix Dirac equation (2) separate into two disjoint sets:
S_ = {ti < -2 me2, i = 1, 2, ..., M]
and
<S+ = {ei > hmin > -2me2, i- M+l, ... , 2M}.
It is important to realize that V,,iin always exists in practice, even if the 
potential V is unbounded. Any acceptable trial function must yield a finite 
33

expectation value for yThe proof of this result amounts to a demonstration that 
switching on a sub-critical potential 7does not depress the energy of a just free 
electron enough for it to enter the negative energy continuum. Since bound states 
can only exist in the interval -2mc2 < e< 0, this ensures that there is a fixed lower 
bound to the eigenvalue set 5+, so that the familiar nonrelativistic Rayleigh-Ritz 
variational theorems continue to work for the Dirac Hamiltonian. Statements that 
there is nothing to stop Dirac eigenvalues from "collapsing” into the lower 
continuum are therefore wrong, as the successful applications described above 
demonstrate.
The L-spinor basis functions for point nucleus models
The most satisfactory method we have devised to meet all the criteria given 
so far uses the L-spinor basis functions, which can be viewed as relativistic 
analogues of the nonrelativistic Coulomb Sturmian functions. The latter are 
defined by Rotenberg (1962, 1970) as the non-trivial normalised solutions of 
“___d2 | l(t 4- 1)

vanishing at x = 0 and x - oo, where n - 1, 2, 3, ... and I - 0, 1, ..., n—1, and 1 is an 
arbitrary positive constant. The solutions coincide with the hydrogenic 
eigenfunction corresponding to the values of nand t whenever X - Z/n. The Sturmian 
functions are given by the formula

The L-spinors are the relativistic versions; their radial components are 
given by

where the superscript T takes the values L or S to denote respectively the "large" 
and "small" components; the "+" sign goes with L, the sign with S. The angular 
symmetry is denoted by n, the ’cusp’ exponent 7 : = [k2 - aPZ2]^, the ’apparent 
principal quantum number’ is Nn := (n2 + 2717 + k2)*,  and A is, as before, an 
arbitrary constant. In this case n must be interpreted as the "inner" quantum 
number, the "principal" quantum number being n+1 k| . Expressing and f S as 
TIK J TLK, 
functions of x - 2Ar, we find that the basis functions satisfy the Dirac-like 
equation

It is straightforward, though lengthy, to demonstrate that the L—spinors 
satisfy the conditions (4a) and (4b) required in the Nonrelativistic Limit 
Theorem. The nonrelativistic orthogonality relation is replaced by
(Cn-Cn’X/n’IV^I/nb + ( Cn " & )</n’ I V*l
 fn) = 0 
(11)
This orthogonality relationship does not seem easy to exploit directly for 
computational purposes although it has a formal mathematical importance. This is 
most easily seen by passing to the nonrelativistic limit using the results —> n 
+ 
(n—> 0, as c—> od, so that only the first term survives in the form
(n— n’)</n^| l/a:| /nL> = °> 
leading to the nonrelativistic orthogonality relation (6) when n / n' . The Gram 
matrices of the large and small component systems are tridiagonal, with non—zero 
elements given by
35

(12)
where, as before, the label T is either L or S, the minus sign is taken with the 
former and the plus sign with the latter. Thus the two Gram matrices have the same 
eigenvalue spectrum, and therefore the same linear independence properties. The 
completeness and linear independence of the L-spinors can be analysed in the 
manner of Klahn (1981).
The construction of the remaining submatrices of the Dirac operator (2) is 
relatively straightforward. For a point nucleus Coulomb potential, the 7matrices 
are diagonal in the non-relativistic limit, and the off-diagonal terms are 
0(l/c2). The II matrices have a simple algebraic structure permitting recursive 
evaluation of the various contributions. The construction of matrices of 
two-electron interaction operators is more complicated, and will not be discussed 
here.
In practice, one chooses values of n up to some value nmax(ft); the 
completeness and linear independence properties of the L-spinors ensure 
convergence to any desired accuracy by picking 7imax(^) sufficiently large. 
Usually, one fixes A at around Z/(Z+1), to give about ninax(ft)/4 bound states, with 
the remaining 3nmax(«)/4 states representing the upper continuum and 7iraax(^) 
states with energies in the lower continuum. The eigenvalues are stationary with 
respect to variations in A, so that one does not need to choose it precisely. 
However, the distribution of excited states does change with A, and this parameter 
can therefore be used to ’’tune” the basis for particular purposes. This is in fact 
very easy to do as all the matrices scale as a simple multiple of A in the case of a 
Coulomb potential: 
where the subscript k has been inserted as a reminder that we are considering a 
single angular symmetry and the bars indicate that the matrices have been 
evaluated with A=l, Z=l. See the contribution by Quiney (p. ) for further 
details.
The S—spinor basis functions for point nucleus models
Although L-spinors have many attractive features, they do have practical 
drawbacks when it comes to calculating matrices of the electron—electron 
interaction in many—electron calculations makes it advisable to examine 
alternatives. One such alternative is the S-spinors which we have used in all the 
many-electron calculations we have published so far. S-spinors can be viewed as 
the relativistic analogue of the Slater type functions (functions having the 
general form rriexp(-Ar) ) whose simplicity has ensured their popularity in 
nonrelativistic atomic structure calculations (see, for example, Hibbert 1975, 
Vilson 1987). S-spinors are most readily defined as the nodeless, or nearly 
nodeless, functions obtained from L-spinors, equation (7), with minimum index n. 
Ignoring common normalizing factors, we take n- 0 for negative ft,
36

(13a)
n < 0,
and n = 1 for positive /c,
Or) = (xT +Amr)r7exp("Am^

where, as usual, 7 = [k2 - 2?/c2] \

(«d)
and
TV2 = 1 + 27+ /?.
It is immediately obvious that these functions, regarded as individual 
L—spinors, satisfy the requirements of the Dirac Matrix Separation Theorem. For 
negative «, the same basis set can be used for both large and small components, 
(13a), but the algebraic form inherited from the L-spinors for positive /$;, (59b), 
is more complicated. The reason for this becomes obvious when we compare the two 
symmetry types, & - +1 (p symmetry) and n- -1 (s symmetry) which have the common 7 
value, 7 = [1 — Z2/^. As c—> oo, both s-type components go over smoothly into the 
same s-type Slater function
Or) = rexp('M-
However, it is easy to see that for k,- +1,
0(Z2/c2), 4s- 3 + 0(22/c2),
so that the large component goes over smoothly into a p-type function,
fmp^ 
•
as c—>oo, but
f S(r)—>(-3r+A r2)exp(~A r),
which is a linear combination of s- and p-type Slater functions satisfying the 
Pauli relation, (5), apart from an unimportant phase. Clearly, there is no way in 
which the naive choice of a monomial to describe both components as in (13a) can 
achieve this result. The behaviour of S-spinors and L—spinors is (by design) the 
same as that of true Coulomb eigenfunctions near r=0. Although the eigenfunctions 
for distributed charge nuclei have different cusp structure, the same qualitative 
behaviour - vanishing of the s~type contribution to the large component of a 
p-type function in the nonrelativistic limit - has to occur, and this must not be 
37

forgotten when constructing basis functions for such models. So far, strict 
kinetic balance, (5), is the only way that has been found to do this approximately.
The selection of a suitable family of exponents, {Am}, is crucial to the 
efficiency of the S—spinor algorithm. Ve use the members of a geometric sequence
A^ = Of/?"1’1, m- 1, 2, ... 
(14)
where a and (3 are positive constants. This even-tempered prescription was first 
suggested by Reeves (1963) on empirical grounds, and exploited by Raffenetti 
(1973), Feller and Ruedenberg (1979), Schmidt and Ruedenberg (1979) and in other 
papers by Ruedenberg and his collaborators.. One important attraction of this 
choice is the ease with which highly efficient algorithms can be constructed for 
evaluating the various matrices needed to high accuracy (Quiney 1990). There are 
some mathematical complications to be taken into account (Klahn 1981). In 
particular, the sequence (14) with fixed a and (3 gives an S-spinor set which is 
formally linearly independent for any finite /3 but is incomplete in the Hilbert 
space L2(IR+). A way out of this difficulty is to use a sequence of finite sets of 
even-tempered functions of the form
{exp(-Amr) | Am= a/;-1, m= 1, 2, ...M} 
(15)
where

and the H matrices have a similar form which is too lengthy to be worth including 
here.
The calculation of electron-electron interaction matrices is the major 
component of any many—electron electronic structure calculation, and we have 
found that this can be done with great accuracy and high efficiency in S—spinor 
calculations. Each matrix element can be expressed as a linear combination of 
radial (Slater) integrals over the one—electron orbitals, as described in detail 
by Grant (1988). These integrals can, in their turn, be expressed as linear 
combinations of two-electron integrals over S~spinor components, so that in the 
case of the Coulomb interaction, we ultimately have to evaluate combinations of 
primitive integrals of the form

where F(a)is a gamma function, B (a^z) is an un-normalized incomplete beta

b - 7p+7q+fc+/—
6’ = 7p+7 q+^+Z+Z/+l
~ ^pq/ (Amn+Apq) .
Most program libraries include procedures for evaluating the gamma function. The 
incomplete beta function is more troublesome, and demands special treatment 
(Quiney 1990). Isolated values can be readily evaluated by using continued 
traction representations which can be made to work to machine precision. However, 
(21) shows that we need to evaluate a large number of values of B (a,b;z) for fixed 
z in which the parameters a and b differ by integers, and it turns out that stable 
recurrence relations exist that enable this to be done very efficiently and 
accurately for a family of vectors with components B(a,&;zi), i ~ 1, 2, ...The 
details are given by Quiney at p. of this volume.
One bonus of this approach is that the same primitive integrals (20), occur 
in the evaluation of the low—frequency Breit interaction
l(q(l) q(2) , a(l).I a(2).r
2| 'j 
R3
(22)
where R is the relative vector separation of the two electrons as in the evaluation 
of the instantaneous Coulomb interaction. This means that the Breit interaction 
integrals cost virtually nothing extra to compute, a striking contrast to the 
situation in conventional numerical codes such as GRASP. The magnetic and 
retardation parts of the electron— electron interaction can therefore be treated 
together in the determination of the orbital basis, so minimizing gauge-dependent 
effects. Treating the relativistic electron-electron interaction as a single, 
rather than as a composite, operator in which each part is handled as a separate 
perturbation, simplifies perturbation calculations dramatically. Of course, (22) 
is only valid for matrix elements connecting orbitals whose energies are small 
compared with me2, but it is possible to make the necessary finite wavelength 
corrections in integrals connecting positive and negative energy states without 
too much difficulty.
A major question which we do not have the space to treat in detail relates to 
the convergence of S—spinor or L—spinor approximations. This was discussed by 
Grant (1989) in terms of ideas of Klahn and Morgan (1984). The main conclusions are 
that Rayleigh-Ritz approximations for bound state eigenvalues and orbitals in 
Dirac one—electron and Dirac -Fock atomic problems are likely to converge in the 
40

mathematical sense as they appear to do in practice. Moreover, the expectation 
values and matrix elements of most of the operators that are likely to be 
encountered in atomic physics will also converge mathematically. In particular, 
because the radiative multipole operators are all bounded (provided the full 
frequency dependence is retained), their matrix elements can be relied upon to 
converge when evaluated with S-spinor or L-spinor wave-functions. The computation 
of such matrix elements is central to the calculation of higher order terms in 
quantum electrodynamics, and this finding is of vital importance for future 
developments employing these techniques.
CONCLUSIONS
The technical advances in GRASP will enable us to study more complex 
configurations of atoms and ions with less cost and greater physical realism, as 
illustrated by a number of state-of-the-art calculations. The JJMTRX code is now 
able to produce cross-sections for electron scattering from atoms and ions both in 
the continuum and in the resonance region. It will now be developed to generate 
further observable scattering features and, in particular, to compute 
photo-ionization cross-sections for heavy elements for which there is a good deal 
of experimental information awaiting interpretation.
The SVIRLES code is likely to be of real importance in the study of highly 
ionized atoms in the future. S-spinors provide a cheap and highly accurate method 
of generating relativistic wave-functions for bound state problems, and also of 
carrying out calculations of higher order corrections using many-body 
perturbation theory. The negative energy states can be handled quite 
straighforwardly within this method, and it seems likely that SVIRLES will be used 
to compute QED corrections in the near future. A combination of S—spinor and 
L-spinor techniques seems likely to prove very powerful in this context. High-Z 
atoms and ions can also be modelled successfully using basis set techniques, and an 
S-spinor version of GRASP looks an attractive proposition.
Basis sets are essential for the treatment of the electronic structure of 
molecules. Ve have made some preliminary investigations of relativistic 
electronic structure using methods based on those described in this paper. The 
method seems promising, although it is still too early to present any results.

ABSTRACT
It is important to investigate whether non—relativistic errors in calculated oscillator 
strengths and related atomic data are large enough to obscure corrections applied in 
relativistic calculations. The magnitude such errors is however difficult to estimate. 
This is just one reason why the accuracy of the atomic data needs careful scrutiny. 
Application to the analysis of line intensities in laboratory and astropyhsical plasmas 
is a more general one. This review therefore focuses on errors that can affect the 
accuracy of calculated oscillator strengths. Precautions that can be taken to minimise 
errors arising from different causes are surveyed. Special attention is given to their 
reduction through the improvement of eigenvectors with Slater parameter 
optimisation methods. These semi-empirical methods for improving the accuracy of 
oscillator strengths can be important in fully relativistic calculations for a range of 
ions.
1. INTRODUCTION
When relativistic corrections are applied to atomic—structure calculations of oscillator 
strengths and energy levels their true effects may be masked completely by a variety 
of sources of errors resulting from many different physical causes. A detailed 
understanding of these sources of error and how to reduce them is therefore of vital 
importance when making relativistic calculations. Such information is also of crucial 
importance for plasma diagnostics as accurate oscillator strengths are required for the 
interpretation of spectral line intensities to estimate densities, temperatures and 
absorption in astrophysical and laboratory plasmas. Moreover some of the factors 
affecting the accuracy of oscillator strengths also affect calculated collision strengths 
which are often required to enable the analysis of spectral line intensities.
Although many of the numerous factors which contribute to oscillator strength errors 
are described in the literature, it is evident unfortunately that some are frequently 
overlooked, resulting in the publication of numerous unreliable data. This makes it 
very difficult for users to discriminate between valid and unsatisfactory material. The 
situation is made more problematic by the shortage of accurate measured data. It is 
therefore necessary to examine the problem in detail. This review therefore gathers 
together descriptions of the many physical sources of error and emphasises the serious 
difficulties confronting those seeking to reduce and determine errors in oscillator 
strength calculations. Some examples of the techniques for reducing errors on

oscillator strengths are cited, mainly selected from work conducted at the Rutherford 
Appleton Laboratory and the reference list is extended(42—53) to complete the 
bibliography of this work.
There are various contributions to oscillator strength errors which can be catalogued 
under different headings each requiring a different technique for minimisation. There 
are for instance errors arising from the quality of the eigenvectors applied in the 
computations. There can be errors in the radial dipole matrix elements. Cancellation, 
if not correctly modelled, can create large errors. Configuration interaction has to be 
adequately included or errors will arise. Other possible sources of perturbation must 
be considered. The influence of the inner shells or of levels lying in the continuum will 
vary from level to level. The quality of the wavefunctions is another fundamental 
consideration. These as well as other atomic quantities can depend on the method of 
calculation.
A variety of theoretical methods can be applied. There is the RCN/RCN2/RCG code 
(1-4), which incorporates a pseudo relativistic Hartree-Fock (HFR) stage and was 
developed by Dr. R. D. Cowan of Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory; (1-2) or the 
Multiconfiguration-Hartree-Fock (6,7) (MCHF) code of Prof. C. F. Fischer of 
Vanderbilt University. Sophisticated fully relativistic codes are the 
Multiconfiguration-Dirac-Fock (8) (MCDF) and advanced versions called 
Generalised Relativistic Atomic-Structure Programs (GRASP (9) and GRASP2 
(10)), written at Oxford University by Dr. I. P. Grant and co—workers or other 
relativistic codes written by Dr. J. P. Desclaux (11). Many more methods are 
available such as the parametric potential method pioneered by Klapisch (12), the 
Hibbert CIV3 code (13), polarised potential methods and those using scaled 
potentials such as SUPERSTRUCTURE (14) (see Ref. 1 pp 190—199 for a more 
detailed survey and description of methods).
Sub-sets of the aforementioned atomic—structure codes may include length, velocity 
or acceleration oscillator strength formulations, relativistic approximations or 
quantum electrodynamical (QED) corrections (1,8-14). The appropriate choice of 
theoretical method can depend critically on the complexity of the ion under 
investigation. In simple ions for instance the adoption of sophisticated wavefunctions 
and comprehensive treatment of configuration interaction can make the calculations 
sufficiently accurate that quite small relativistic corrections can be sensibly added 
and detailed QED corrections included. At the other extreme, for complicated 
atomic systems, these types of errors are usually dwarfed by others arising from 
configuration interaction effects. They result partly from the limitation in the number 
of configurations that can be included in feasible computations. Although relativistic 
effects become dominant with heavier ions it must be emphasised that the 
aforemenioned sources of error can still be very serious.
2. RELATIVISTIC EFFECTS
For heavy elements and high degrees of ionisation fully relativistic 
Multi—Configuration—Dirac—Fock codes (8—11) are necessary. At intermediate atomic 
numbers up to Z=40 pseudo-relativistic approximations (see Ref 1, pp 200) may be 
adequate while non—relativistic calculations break down at much lower atomic 
numbers. A study of the application of the fully relativistic Multi—Configuration- 
Dirac—Fock Grant code compared with the pseudo-relativistivic Hartree-Fock 
Cowan code was made for Fe XV (15). It was shown that the pseudo—relativistic 
calculations were in close agreement with the fully relativistic ones for this ion up to 
Z=30 and that MCDF was necessary for higher Z. As the Dirac—Fock equations 
involve multi-component wavefunctions, array sizes in the computations are much 
larger than for Hartree-Fock. It can therefore be very important to use these two 
types of code in conjunction as the one gives the advantage of fully relativistic 
calculations and the other gives the ability to include more configurations in the 
model due to the much smaller arrays inherent in the matrices. The more 
46

comprehensive inclusion of configuration interaction effects can be essential for many 
complex ions. In this context it must be emphasised that there is a range of ions for 
which fully relativistic calculations are absolutely essential and the relativistic codes 
are unable to include an adequate number of configurations. Therefore 
semi-empirical modelling (see the detailed discussion in sections 4 and 5) can be of 
crucial importance for such cases. The GRASP2 code allows semi—empirical 
eigenvector optimisation, but this has yet to be exploited for relativistic cases.
3. CANCELLATION EFFECTS
The calculation of line strengths and oscillator strengths involves a double summation 
over amplitudes whose correct relative phases must be known. Two different 
cancellation effects (1,16,17) are involved. One is due to the signs of the eigenvectors 
and the other the signs of the radial dipole integrals. If either are incorrect gross 
errors can occur on individual values. An explanation of cancellation (1,16) is as 
follows:
In terms of the line strength, S, the weighted oscillator strength gf is given by
gf = 87r^mcao2crS/3h
where ao, a, and h are the Bohr unit of length, transition wavenumber, and Planck’s 
constant over 2tt, in cgs units. If the level energy eigenfunction 17J> is expanded in 
terms of eigenvector components and (LS-coupled) basis functions | Z?J> according to 
the equation
i^j>=X |/?J>
0
and the qth component of the classical dipole moment of the atom in units of -eao is 
taken as
q Li qk ’ 
i=l
Then the square root of the line strength is given by the double summation
u n-
The summation is one of amplitudes. Its magnitude may be considerably diminished 
as a result of destructive interference effects, especially when strong basis function 
mixing is present due to intermediate coupling and/or configuration interaction 
perturbations. The cancellation factor
2
CF = [I 
I/SZI 
i]
will then be quite small. When this is the case, there could arise random errors in the 
resulting gf values. Provisions are made in the atomic—structure codes written by 
Dr. R.D. Cowan to print cancellation factors on individual transitions. Small 
cancellation factors therefore indicate which oscillator strengths are subject to errors 
from eigenvector phase summations. It should also be noted that there is also some 
measure of cancellation in the calculation of different dipole intergrals: with some 
being very sensitive to wavefunction details.
47

4. CONFIGURATION INTERACTION
It is well known that the first step in setting up any model for atomic-structure 
calculations is to select all the configurations necessary to provide a valid 
approximation of the configuration interactions which affect the transition arrays 
under investigation. It is advisable to choose a computer code which allows the 
inclusion of all the necessary configurations. A large computer memory may be 
needed to store huge matrices that deal with the many interacting configurations and 
fast processing power may be required to complete the runs in a reasonable time. 
Often the problem is not soluble in the most desirable manner as matrices become too 
large for the computer to handle or else because many of the outer configurations 
added are themselves so perturbed, by excluded levels, that their addition to the 
model has adverse effects. Forced approximations for modelling configuration 
interaction therefore may have to be made and these usually affect the quality of 
eigenvectors. Steps that can be taken to improve eigenvector representation in such 
cases will therefore be discussed in the next section.
5. EIGENVECTOR REPRESENTATION
The quality of eigenvectors involved in atomic-structure calculations affect many 
atomic data including Lande g-values, oscillator strengths and collision strengths. 
Eigenvectors computed ab initio are unfortunately seriously inaccurate for many 
complex atomic structures because of a multitude of configuration interactions and 
perturbations. They can however be improved with semi-empirical techniques. The 
method for the computation of empirical eigenvectors is well established and was 
developed in the first place as an aid in the classification of atomic spectra and to 
study the integrals inherent in the calculations. The well known method is to adjust 
Slater parameters by least—squares optimisation to obtain agreement between 
observed and calculated energy level differences. The optimised Slater parameters are 
then used in the Hamiltonian H-matrix to compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors for 
possible wavelength, oscillator strength or collision strengths calculations. Classical 
spectroscopy has applied the optimisation technique with great success to establish 
energy level designations but the demands of level classification on the method are far 
less stringent than for obtaining eigenvectors for oscillator strength calculations. 
Therefore its application to the calculation of oscillator strengths is open to criticism 
if not properly applied. The reason for this is that for level designation the user may 
be satisfied to learn the main LS, or other coupling scheme, basis—state contribution 
to the level. An approximate eigenvector may serve to label the level, but this 
information is not usually adequate to obtain oscillator strengths. This is because for 
oscillator strengths it is essential to know all the basis state contributions to the 
level, through the amplitudes of the eigenvectors, with a few per cent accuracy 
together with the phase of the eigenvector for both upper and lower configurations. 
Without these conditions being met the errors would be unacceptable. To achieve this 
end great care has to be taken in the parameter optimisation process as the 
eigenvectors will become meaningless if the Slater parameters are all allowed to drift 
to physically unacceptable values. Least squares fits are not unique: for if enough 
adjustable parameters are available all manner of solutions can be obtained, but only 
one will be correct in nature. Valid solutions can however be achieved if certain 
ground rules are observed.
To apply the parameter optimisation method it is first necessary to calculate an ab 
initio set of Slater parameters with a reliable method ensuring that that all the main 
strong or medium interactions are taken into account in the calculations by including 
all the necessary configurations. The parameters concerned are the centers—of—gravity 
energy (Eav ), the single—configuration direct (Fk) and exchange (Gk) 
coulomb-interaction radial integrals, the spin-orbit parameters (() and the 
configuration interaction (Rk) integrals. These are then adjusted using least squares 
48

optimisation codes so that calculated energy levels agree with measured ones. Eav 
generally presents no problem but the ( values are often small and, if left free, can 
absorb perturbations in a physically unacceptable manner. A sensible solution is to 
adopt ( values computed with the Blume-Watson method (18). Likewise small values 
of Fk and exchange Gk could be seriously affected by unrelated interactions and 
therefore may need restricting. The optimisation codes usually allow specified 
parameters to be tied together in such a way that their fitted ratios are allowed to 
vary in line with their ab initio ratios. Fixed ab initio ratios could be maintained for 
all Fk and or all Gk or else for Fk and Gk values between the same orbitals with 
considerable physical justification. Other prudent choices are either to vary all Rk 
integrals together in line with their ab initio ratios or else to fix them somewhere 
between 85% and 100% of their ab initio values. Usually, to be physically reasonable, 
the adopted Fk and Gk values should lie between 90% and 100% of their ab initio 
values but there can be exceptions to this criteria. For satisfactory results clearly 
there must be more measured energy levels than free parameters. Moreover the free 
parameters should also be sensitive to the available measured levels. This sensitivity 
can be checked from the matrix of partial derivatives of eigenvalues with respect to 
the parameters which is printed in some level-fitting codes (1). Optimisation is more 
likely to be feasible for complex configurations in which many energy levels are 
governed by a few parameters. For very complex configurations there may be too few 
parameters to adjust to obtain a satisfactory solution. The effects of far-off 
interactions may have to be modelled by the introduction of effective operators (see 
Ref.l pp 478 for a detailed description). Based on theoretical considerations these are 
added to the matrices to mimic systematic trends. For instance Trees (see Ref.l pp 
478) introduced a parameter with a L(L+1) dependence. Such parameters can be 
applied with care to reduce residual errors which would otherwise wrongly predict 
mixing for sensitively interacting levels.
Further insight into the problems can be gained by considering the specific examples 
arising in different groups of ions. Multiply—ionised atoms with complex structures 
such as dQ nl or fq nl with q>2 (eg: (19) Fe III to Fe VI 3dq nl ) are ideal for 
optimisation because the configurations consist of many levels which are gathered 
together into well defined regions and are situated well below the continuum. This is 
not the case for many neutral atoms such as Fe I (16,17) where single configurations 
extend from near the ground level right up into the continuum. The resulting 
perturbations, with unclassified levels lying in or near the continuum and from inner 
shell interactions, are a mystery. It is therefore not surprising that attempts to date 
to calculate oscillator strengths for Fe I are unsatisfactory. The problems for Fe I are 
probably not confined to eigenvector inadequacies but are also compounded through 
uncertainties in radial dipole integrals. Other less complex neutral ions involve 
perturbation problems which are also difficult to resolve conclusively. These result 
from the overlapping of complexes of different principal quantum number. In several 
ions levels of the lowest principal quantum number can reside in the continuum. It is 
dangerously easy to run a computer code and generate a set of numbers for such ions, 
but difficult to generate reliable data. Fortunately observational data may be more 
readily available for neutral ions. In Fe I for instance measured rather than calculated 
data should be trusted. On the other extreme for hydrogen, helium or lithium like 
ions, the simpler structures would not generally be studied with the aforementioned 
fitting techniques. The over-riding considerations are entirely different. For these 
simpler systems the degree of sophistication of the ab initio codes can be of 
paramount importance along with the quality of wavefunctions and added relativistic 
and QED (8—11) corrections. Such finesse however has little relevance to ions of 
intermediate complexity such as Fe X to Fe XII (20—26) as the best ab initio codes 
fail to predict energy levels with sufficient accuracy due to the dominance of 
configuration interaction problems. Furthermore each configuration in an ion may be 
subject to different influences which require different solutions. Those with high 
principal quantum number lying close to the continuum can be problematic since 
they can be subject to unknown perturbations from unidentified and unmeasured 
energy levels. This highlights the need for the future identification of these high 
49

energy levels, not because they necessarily contribute directly to observed spectra of 
interest to astrophysicists or other users, but because knowledge of their position 
allows the determination of their perturbation influence on levels of primary concern.
With optimisation completed and eigenvectors and Slater parameters adopted, 
independent checks as to their validity are needed. Measured oscillator strengths are 
available for many ions (27—29) and these can be compared with values calculated 
using the optimised eigenvectors. The usefulness of the comparison is however limited 
by the fact that the measured data itself is often subject to large error-bars and 
uncertainties and the eigenvectors are only one of the atomic quantities affecting the 
accuracy of the calculated data. Another check is to use the eigenvectors to calculate 
Lande g—values and compare these with measured values where they are available. In 
intermediate coupling Lande—g values are critically dependent on the eigenvector 
alues. The eigenvector representation in the adopted model will therefore not 
adversely affect the accuracy of atomic data for transitions between levels where the 
computed and measured Lande g-values are in agreement. For example, our recent 
calculations in the rare earth elements Ce II (30) and Yb II (31) used the comparison 
of calculated with measured Lande g-values to aid the least squares optimisation 
while in Fe II (32) similar comparisons were applied to check earlier results (33,34).
Although the method of Slater parameter optimisation is more usually essential for 
the more complex configurations there are examples where it may be needed to 
correct data for some levels in quite simple structures. For instance, oscillator 
strengths were calculated for beryllium-like ions (35,36) . Although their simpler 
structure meant that ab initio calculations could be made with acceptable accuracy 
for most levels, the 2s3p T and 2s3p 3P levels were found to be hypersensitive to 
mixing so that the precise eigenvectors obtained through optimisation were necessary.
6. SMALL OSCILLATOR STRENGTHS
Small oscillator strengths can be subject to gross errors if one of the levels is mixed 
with a level associated with a large oscillator strength. Imperfections in computed 
eigenvectors give rise to small predicted differences in the level’s composition and 
therefore greatly overestimate the smaller oscillator strength. On the other hand large 
oscillator strengths are relatively insensitive.
7. RADIAL DIPOLE INTEGRALS
The precision of the calculated radial dipole integrals will also affect the accuracy of 
oscillator strengths. These depend on the computed one-electron radial 
wavefunctions and not on the eigenvectors and so results from the least—squares 
fitting are not applicable to them. One radial integral can be computed for each 
transition array and contributions are summed for each transition. If these are in 
error then some general scaling of the oscillator strengths might be expected. Any 
resulting inaccuracies in the oscillator strength values tend to be systematic for an 
entire transition array and may vary with transition array. It is therefore worth 
critically examining measured oscillator strengths or lifetimes to see if they are 
sufficiently reliable to obtain scale factors for the adjustment of calculated values. 
There are a number of recent accurate lifetime measurements which can be utilised. 
For instance laser-excited fluorescence lifetime measurements for Fe II were used to 
infer an implied scaling down by 0.73 for Fe II oscillator strengths and slightly 
different scale factors were obtained for Fe I to Fe VIII (16,17,19,33,37). It is not 
however clear whether the necessary scaling is due to radial dipole integrals or 
interaction effects. Nevertheless this method of correction would seem to be a 
reasonable remedy for ab initio radial dipole integral errors. Semi-empirical methods 
such as Coulomb and scaled Thomas—Fermi are available to estimate values for these 
radial integrals. These estimates are often surprisingly good.
50

8. LENGTH, VELOCITY AND ACCELERATION FORMULATION
When calculating electric dipole matrix elements for oscillator strength calculations 
length, velocity or acceleration forms can be used. Given perfect wavefunctions they 
should be identical but, with the exception of simple atoms, wavefunctions are 
usually approximate and the consequent results are not in agreement. The quality of 
the wavefunctions is therefore a fundamental consideration. The accuracy of 
wavefunctions as well as other atomic quantities can depend on the method of 
calculation. In some cases variational wavefunctions can have sufficient accuracy to 
justify velocity—type oscillator strength calculations (which are sensitive to errors at 
small radius) but more frequently approximate wavefunctions like Hartree—Fock are 
chosen on the grounds that they can have the correct asymptotic form and hence be 
useful in length formulation oscillator strength calculations (see Ref. 1 pp 401). 
Length—type calculations have in fact been compared extensively in the literature 
with measured data and reasonable correlation has meant that these are often 
adopted. The acceleration values are unstable and seldom relied on.
9. APPLICATIONS TO COLLISION STRENGTH CALCULATIONS
It was also demonstrated, with collision strength calculations for Fe XIII (38,39), that 
the procedure involving the adjustment of Slater parameters to improve energy levels 
and eigenvectors can be applied to improve collision strengths as well since the 
collision target is described by the same eigenvectors. To carry out this project it was 
necessary to modify the DISTORTED WAVE (40) collision code and 
SUPERSTRUCTURE (14) atomic-structure code which mutually interface via a 
transformation code JAJOM (41) which processes their output. These codes were 
written at University College London. Similar adaptations were made to the Belfast 
CIV3 (13) atomic—structure code for possible interface with the Belfast close coupling 
R—matrix codes (42). Other collision strengths (43) were calculated for Fe XIX.
10. DISCUSSION
It is worth noting here that for line classification purposes only, many classic papers 
have been securely based on single configuration approximations, and that the mere 
adoption of such a single configuration model will usually not suffice for oscillator 
strength calculation. Furthermore before the advent of modern fast and 
large—memory computers restricted configuration sets were applied to oscillator 
strength calculations which should now be superseded. Errors can now be reduced 
through application of methods discussed in this paper while carefully considering all 
contributing factors. This can yield data which is useful especially when well resolved 
spectra are available and where the study of plasma parameters through the analysis 
of individual line intensities is the aim of the investigator. A contrasting requirement 
is for oscillator strength data to aid the understanding of lower resolution spectra 
consisting of blended emission or absorption lines. For this a "blanket” approach is 
sometimes adopted in which ab initio or very approximate computations are applied 
to understand absorption or emission around cosmic sources. In such computations 
data for transition arrays are sometimes included to which various perturbations and 
configuration interactions contribute very large errors. With some care the blanket 
approach can, taking advantage of the sum rules (see Ref 1 pp 424) provide a 
meaningful analysis but its limitations are severe. Not only is the wavelength 
distribution of the oscillator strength uncertain but also the effects of specific 
resonances obscure. The data which either has or can in principle be computed with 
higher accuracy become overlaid with a mass of inferior data. It is therefore 
worthwhile excluding as far as possible the data with larger error bars and focussing 
on a selection of the most reliable calculations. A matter of grave concern is the facile 
misuse of large computers to archive large quantities of low grade material into data 
banks which the uninformed may use.
51

With oscillator strengths it is not possible to define error-bars for large numbers of 
values as each individual value is affected in many ways: by different contributions 
from the various types of dependancy detailed above and especially by any level 
mixing effects. With these limitations in mind the user can critically select the 
particular values required for a problem and try as far as possible to avoid values 
(such as small oscillator strengths associated with poorly defined mixed energy levels, 
or those with small cancellation factors) before resorting to detailed line intensity 
analysis. Now that atomic structure codes and fast computers are generally available, 
important cases can be rerun to generate output revealing accuracy information (eg: 
eigenvectors, mixing and cancellation). This can allow inspection in greater detail 
before application to expensive projects. For those posessing the necessary 
atomic—structure codes input of the reported optimised Slater parameters can 
facilitate duplication of printed data which could also have been archived in a data 
bank. It should also be realised that the accuracy of published oscillator strengths can 
be improved whenever new observational energy level data becomes available to be 
included in the least—squares fitting procedure. Frequently the data available at any 
one time is lacking in important multiplets, or even all terms of a particular 
multiplicity, and quite generally important interacting configurations may be 
unclassified. Furthermore the availability of increased computing power permits 
improved models with more configuration interaction. The reduction of error-bars is 
thus an evolving process.
The crucial test for calculated oscillator strengths must come from comparison with 
laboratory measurements. Oscillator strengths, lifetimes and transition probabilities 
are now being measured by a number of new, more reliable, techniques. Some, such as 
laser-fluorescence, have excellent precision. Beam-foil and beam-gas measurements 
are constantly improving and supplying data for multiply—ionised atoms which are 
lacking for many ions. Historically experimental oscillator strength measurements 
have been contradictory but as techniques improve data for some ions converge to 
agreement. Fortunately for users, the National Bureau of Standards, Washington has 
maintained critical data compilations(27—29) and bibliographies for both measured 
and calculated oscillator strengths which are an invaluable aid in an area of science so 
full of uncertainties and yet so vital as a key to our understanding of astrophysical 
observations.

Atomic Structure Calculations 
in Breit-Pauli Approximation

Introduction
Results are presented of relativistic effects in one- and two-electron atomic systems using the 
low-Z Breit-Pauli (BP) approximation. In the structure calculations we include all one-body 
Breit-Pauli terms, i. e. ordinary spin-orbit coupling and the two non-finestructure contributions. 
Non-finestructure two-body terms are consistently ignored, whereas mutual spin-orbit effects 
— mutual spin-orbit coupling and spin-other-orbit coupling — are included in the atomic 
structure type calculations presented here but ignored in the collision-type approach. For 
the latter we use the BP variant of the R-matrix suite of programs (RM-BP, Scott and Taylor 
1982), for the former the Superstructure code (SSTRUCT, Eissner et al. 1974). Apart from 
level energies results to various degree of approximation are presented for radiative transitions.
2 
Formulation
In their classic Quantum Mechanics of One- and Two-Electron Atoms Bethe and Salpeter 
give a full account of the Breit equation and their low-Z Pauli form as approximations of a 
fully relativistic theory. In this paper only a few points of interest in deriving the BP terms 
are sketched. In another chapter of this volume Ian Grant deals with the state-of-the art for 
relativistic treatment of many-electron atomic structure and excitation.
2.1 Schrodinger and Dirac equation
An approach to atomic structure in Breit-Pauli approximation for N electrons in the electric 
field of a nucleus with Z protons starts with suitably bounded solutions
V = ^(7SLMsMl\tx, .. .r/y) 
(1)
of the time-independent Schrodinger equation
v—> r fi 
Ze v—a e 
/x
V--—A,------ + V —} V = EV, 
(2)
i.e. of a quantized non-relativistic energy expression HnT, where the symbols have the ususal 
meaning of rest mass, electric charge, angular momentum quantum numbers etc. Antisym­
metrization of V is readily achieved after expanding as a product of single-particle wave func­
tions, and it turns the coupled second-order differential into integro-differential equations.

as a perturbation leads to wave functions in intermediate coupling (IC),
= V(rSLJMj\x1,...xN),
(4)
which are eigenvectors of a Breit-Pauli hamiltonian H^p (® stands for position r and spin a of 
an electron). Such a hamiltonian can be derived in Dirac theory by retaining terms of absolute 
order a2 and a4, having exploited the low-velocity matrix representation
D(7°) = |G 
!>(,-)=(.»„ -jf) 
(5)
of the underlying Clifford algebra. These 4x4 matrices are composed of the Pauli matrices 
a*  and the associated identity I. We note that
Ry = —moc2 (= 13.59 eV) 
(6)
is the binding energy of the non-relativistic hydrogenic electron in the ground state; equally 
useful in subsequent conversions proves
ao = ——/« 
(= 0.529-10 8 cm),
TTIqC
(7)
which relates the Bohr radius ao to the Compton wave length of the electron.
The one pervading one-body contribution to BP order, though, follows simply — as the
third term after those of order moc2 and Ry — on expanding m =

'1-/32

‘mass-velocity’ term gives rise to one-body integrals cJJ), which are the expectation values of
an operator /(m) with radial component

(8)
Such a readily available quantity is of help when verifying reduced units used in some pub­
lication — the topic of the subsequent Section 2.2. The quantity /(m) will fall into place in 
Section 2.4.
Other one-body terms follow straight from the Dirac hamiltonian 4- 
and the two-body terms after suitably simplifying the 1/rij interaction. But as this paper is 
concerned with computational results we cast physics aside, summarising such preliminaries 
only in the form of number equations in Section 2.3 — which still bring out all the kinematic 
and scaling properties.
2.2 
Observables as reduced variables
For computational work one extracts pure number equations, choosing the most natural or 
convenient unit for one quantity of each canonical pair — and phase invariance settles the case 
for the canonical coniugate! Using Algol notation for brevity we define the following dimen­
sionless quantities instead of length, energy and angular momentum, parenthetically adding 
consequential redefinitions:
r := — 
(hence wave numbers & transform as k := k • Go)
ao 
n
E := 
(hence t := — where r0 = 
— 4.839 • 10~17-sec) 
(9)
Ry 
T0 
ac
56

In tables though physical rather than reduced quantities will still be displayed for clarity.
Except perhaps for the last redefinition in (9) this is only superficially similar to the 
procedure in special relativity: there the speed of light c may be absorbed in quantities like 
me2 or /3 = But in such a case the new quanties loose nothing of their physical nature, nor 
do constraints such as phase space invariance apply. Although relevant in a Dirac approach we 
need not be concerned with such niceties, as Breit-Pauli treatment is distinctly not Lorentz- 
invariant.
2.3 Methods and codes
Use of spherical spatial coordinates yields Hartree-Fock type radial equations for the non- 
relativistic problem, the size being determined by the specified configurations C = n(n^k)9fe- 
Then wave functions and operators factorize, and the angular portions can be worked out by 
angular momentum algebra and Racah techniques. All that remains to be solved are radial 
equations. Two approximations are adopted in the following:
• in SSTRUCT, an atomic structure code in intermediate coupling described by Eissner et 
al., one starts off with independent particle radial functions satisfying
r^^ + 2Z.,(>rr;z,A-)+ 1 
(l0)
|_drz 
r 
J
in a statistical model (SM) potential VSM(r) = 
.—with scaling parameters A/ or
r
perhaps even An/ (usually varied according to some functional F but in this paper kept 
at their default value 1.0 — which is tolerable for high residual charge z — Z — (N — 1)).
• RM-BP is an electron-ion collision code, modelled on the ordinary non-relativistic R- 
matrix approach (Burke and Robb 1978, Berrington et al. 1978), where the coupled radial 
integro-differential equations (ID) for the ‘colliding’ electron are expanded as NRANG2 
suitable basis functions within the range r—RA to which the target charge distribution is 
essentially confined. The equations that couple channels of a particular target state and 
collisional partial wave for some selected angular symmetry have often been outlined; 
Burke and Eissner (1983) write
[^2 - 
+ T + fcl?]Fi(r) = 2 "£F+ 
r')F,(r')l
j
+ £A.-,n/Pn/(r)tf/,/f; 
(11)
nl
the direct potential V is expanded in the usual way as spherical multipole potentials 
yxfnl, n'V') r), in the exchange term fWF orbitals Pni and Fj swap places, and the 
Lagrange sum with parameters AJ>n/ arises from orthogonality conditions imposed upon Fi 
for algebraic convenience. For a given angular symmetry the number NCHF increases with 
that of included target states. Formal extension to a BP hamiltonian is straightforward, 
Clebsch-Gordan coefficients providing for IC, but the number NCHF of ID’s more than 
doubles over the case of LS coupling: e.g. inclusion of hydrogenic ls-3d, i.e. of 9 target 
levels, leads to more than twenty channels for many sets of total angular momentum J 
and parity 7r. Methods and scope have been described by Scott and Taylor (1982) and 
general features and constraints discussed by Jones (1971). In the 7?-matrix approach 
one first provides a complete fundamental basis within the range RA. In the outer region 
beyond RA techniqes employed in codes for the Opacity Project and summarized by 
Berrington et al. (1987) have been implemented in the new version of the code. In this 
paper bound state solutions F-J7r(r) - Pnijji\r} are sought, which means solving an 
eigenvalue problem for channel energies kJ associated with channels i = (kih).

2.4 
The Breit-Pauli hamiltonian and scaling properties
To varying degree both approaches treat Breit-Pauli terms as perturbations. We start with 
the full BP hamiltonian, by adding a relativistic correction operator HTC — with the usual 
abbreviations for c[ontact], d[arwin], m[ass], o[rbit] and s[pin], and a prime indicating ‘other’ 
— to the non-relativistic hamiltonian:
N 
1 N
Hbp = 5nr+^2{/,(m)+/,(d)+yi(so)}+- J2{p0(so + soz)+^(ss')+fti(CS5')+S'v(d)+w(oo/)}-
(12) 
While accounting for all the one-body terms,
a2
/•(m) = --Vf
7rv2 
/.(d) = -^v?(i/n) 
(13)
/■(so) =
among the BP two-body operators only the finestructure (FS) terms are retained here:
gij(so + so') = -a2 < ( x pi ] • (si + 2sj) + x pA • (sj + 2s
*
)
I ' rij ' 
' rij '
gij(ss') = 2a2/ 
- 3(£‘ •

(14)

rij )
where = rt- - fj. There is little point worrying about the omitted 2-body terms as long 
as one has not pushed ordinary configuration expansion (CI) — since interelectron correlation 
scales as 1/Z — sufficiently far for BP terms to matter.
A further approximation has been made in the current collision type RM-BP calculations, 
where the two-body finestructure terms </(so + so') and </(ss') are also omitted, which clearly 
is not a serious omission for sufficiently high ionisation stages — apply scaling laws!
Having written | rather than ^2j>i the two-body sum — a difference of no great 
account as long as one deals with indistinguishable particles — smoothes the way towards 
the following verifying discussion. If one takes particle j for the ‘fixed’ nucleus then the 
mutual spin-orbit term <7ij(so) equals the one-body /t(so) on changing electric charge sign and 
magnitude (while center-of-mass considerations take care of factors two). Since we assume the 
‘nucleus’ j be at rest i experiences no other orbit and </tj(so') vanishes. So does the companion 
term gjifso) = 0, whereas spin-other-orbit term ^ji(so') — on changing /zb to protonic /zp or 
in general to the magnetic moment of the nucleus — becomes the magnetic contribution to 
the hyperfine structure (HFS). However HFS is ignored in this paper.
The all-important scaling laws follow at a glance, on observing that the length r scales 
as the inverse of Z: consider the hydrogenic radial equation in p = Zr, i.e. after absorbing Z. 
Hence all the one-body BP terms scale as q2Z4 and — a feature familiar from Hnr — the 
two-body contributions one power less in Z. This has obvious repercussions on the scaling of 
the BP components in IC wavefunctions expand perturbatively, observing in particular that 
the expectation value of /(so) vanishes for half-filled subshells nZ, and equally take note that 
the energy denominator will scale as Z rather that Z2 if there is no change in the principal 
quantum number for the dominant configurations.
The hydrogenic solution suggests and quantum defect theory establishes the relation
z2
Enl = 
(15)
as a powerful tool for expressing the energy of an electron bound by the potential of a ‘core’ 
or ‘target’ with residual charge number z Of course quantum defects p = n — v of a series will 
be modified at the low-n side by BP terms, and for H-like ions they will no longer by zero.

3 The low-lying levels in the H and He isoelectronic sequence
Favourite among ions with a value Z amenable to BP treatment are those of iron, which is 
of great astrophysical interest because of of its high stellar abundance. As we wish to explore 
trends along a sequence, in particular the scaling behaviour, aluminium with half the charge 
number Z of iron becomes a convenient next choice, also because of astropysical interest in it. 
The value Z — 13 makes it likely that two-body FS terms — ignored in the RM calculations 
— are still small compared to one-body spin-orbit coupling (as borne out in Table 3).
Table 1 summarizes the salient features of H-sequence atomic structure. Doubling Z to 
52 helps to highlight trends even when somewhat exceeding
«2Ze3ff < 1, 
(16)
the condition for the BP approximation to be valid. Clearly hydrogenic em+d scales rigorously 
as Z4. The bottom line of the table conveys a message that will be useful when assessing 
structure of He-like ions: BP terms affect quantum defects by values in the order of 0.005 at 
z ~ 25 and even less for smaller z, and this deviation also drops fast towards the series limit.
Selective results from extensive RM-BP bound state calculations for He-like Fe and Al 
are compiled in tables 2; for comparison effective quantum numbers derived from observation 
and (up to obitals 3d) from SSTRUCT calculations have been included. In IC calculations 
the dominant SL readily serves as a label on levels with the same symmetry J* . Thus the 
2-electron symmetries 1Pi°, 3Pi° and 3Di° can combine linearly to 3 distinct levels 1“ in an 
RM-BP calculation based on the 9 target states in table 1. Likewise the 4 symmetries 3P°, 
1D°, 3D° and 3F° make up the IC complex 2“. No attempt was made to fill gaps. In particular 
in the 9-state case those bound levels not associated with transitions presented in Section 4.1 
have been omitted.
Effective quantum numbers or quantum defects converge remarkably well with increasing 
correlation. Most noteworthy is the quality of the one-channel result for the ]S ground state, 
but then Is}l's 2S — close enough to unrestricted Hartree-Fock — with a H-like positive 
ion A+x is a big improvement over A+(X-1)ls2 1S. Higher levels {A+x ls}nl2S+1Lj in simple 
1-state calculations behave increasingly poorly, and the finestructure splittings are way off.

p(lsnZ) of He-like Al XII, calculated as in 
table 2a. RM-parameters for 1, 4 and 9 
levels were as follows: NRANG2 = 20 all 
and RA = 0.9, 2.2, 4.0 (as even the diffuse 
orbitals have dropped at this last radial 
value a smaller RA might have been more 
efficient for iso-electronic Fe in table 2a — 
as follows from p = Zr- invariance).
Fernley et al. (1987) discuss the trend of 
the quantum defect p = n — v along the 
sequence and why its value for 1P° is un­
usually small and can even be slightly neg­
ative — see their Fig. 2 in particular.
4 Radiative transitions
Electric quadrupole (E2) and magnetic dipole (Ml) transitions come into their own only in 
intermediate coupling, even though electric multipole transitions formally exist already in LS 
coupling. Moreover it turns out that variants of the familiar electric dipole (El) operator are 
also affected. As IC wavefunctions contain admixtures of order a2 radiative operators must also 
be expanded up to BP order. We add them in Ml transitions, but in the velocity formulation 
they are still left out.

We also consider oscillator strengths /abs or /erm; so as to avoid the need to distinguish 
between the absorption and emission oscillator strength one often prefers the symmetric (gf) 
value, by multiplying with the statistical weight g of the initial state:

Before turning to the main problem of BP corrections in the velocity form of electric 
multipole operators we discuss general features displayed in table 3: (i) as predicted it makes 
sense to omit #(so 4- so') in highly ionized species; (ii) S for spin-allowed transitions scales as 
Z~2 in accordance with (18); (iii) spin-forbidden transitions obey no simply scaling pattern.
Dwelling briefly on singlet-triplet mixing: it suffices to look at the state vector

. . . . (22)
whose second component alone causes El transitions (11So||7?||23Pi). Proportionality with 
o2Z8 for S at the low-Z end of the sequence changes quite drastically to Z2 with increasing 
charge, when numerator and denominator in (22) are both controlled by BP terms. Only for 
the denominator does it look very different near the neutral end, which usually scales as Z 
or Z2. In this case however terms of order a0 come about only if triplet and singlet orbital 
functions (r|2pT) and (r|2ps) are allowed to be different, an effect scaling as 1/Z because 
described by correlation configurations associated with some other complex.
Turning to the operator problems we note that (20) is based on the commutator for a 
non relativistic hamiltonian (2) with spherical components rK: thus such an operator can give 
the same radiative results as the length operator only in LS coupling, and this only for exact 
wave functions (1); approximate wave functions yield differences depending upon the choice of 
gauge for the electromagnetic four-potential A.
Let us start with transitions for hydrogen-like ions, i.e. with wave functions that are eo 
ipso exact. Table 4 displays the differences A in gf, which obviously scale as a2Z2. No simple 
manipulation of the transition energies in (17) or (20) can remedy this situation.
Table 5 contains radiative data for our two He-like ions from recent test runs of the RM­
BP code. Corresponding one-channel results are not good enough higher up the series to be 
worth showing. It can be seen that 4 ‘frozen cores’ give answers of comparable quality to those 
obtained with 9 levels, i.e. including n = 3 orbitals among the hydrogen-like target functions. 
The trend from length to velocity line strengths is qualitatively and it seems quantitatively 
reminiscent of the lesson drawn from table 4 and echoed in the SSTRUCT results.
For the spin-forbidden El transition n 1Sq <— n3Pi an analytic answer has been given by 
Drake (1976), who supports it by numerical results for the decay to ls21S as well as to ls2s TS in 
neutral helium. Drake shows that the transition amplitude in the length form describes both 
the ‘indirect’ part arising from spin-orbit mixing (22) and the ‘direct’ part, which contains 
spin-dependent relativistic corrections to the radiative operator.

i. e. by adding BP terms of relative order a2Z2 and a2Z to the non-relativistic velocity operator 
(20). Naturally enough IC wavefunctions (4) — as approximated in (22) — have to be used 
to evaluate the matrix elements of order o°, and LS wavefunctions (2) elsewhere.
4.2 Magnetic dipole transitions
Magnetic dipole transitions have become the most fascinating topic in Breit-Pauli work ever 
since Gabriel and Jordan (1969) correlated observed sharp lines in the solar soft X-ray spectrum 
with Ml decay of the first excited level 1s2s3Si of abundant He-like ions, challenging the 
previous view that this level can only decay by two-photon transitions — an assumption 
incompatible with sharp lines! Embedding the structural properties in a far broader context 
alongside J/V7, the particle that lead the way to the fourth flavour of quarks — Sucher 
(1978) tells the story of Drake’s pivotal role in unravelling conflicting concepts.

where £ is essentially the photon energy. It so happens that the two-body component Q11 does 
not contribute to our particular transition 1s2s3Si~> ls21S.
The matrix element of the ‘ordinary’ Ml operator of order q° vanishes, because this term 
in (27) is purely angular and the state |ls21S) — while orthogonal to |1s2s3Si) — is entirely 
isotropic. Therefore the terms of BP order in (27) remain the sole cause for the 1s2s3Si decay 
in He-like ions; in fact they give rise to 14 distinct radial integrals. The transition therefore 
scales as Z10: 6 powers coming from the energy factor and 4 from ~ r“2 in (26) when squaring.
Table 6 summarizes results in a number of approaches. While showing good results 
further down the table when only modestly complex configuration expansions involving pure 
SM orbitals are employed, it comes not unexpectedly that neutral helium requires a much 
greater effort. The label ‘ID’ in the trailing comment column marks a special approach, 
in which collision type bound orbitals Is, 2s and 2p have been included in a 28-configution 
64

expansion; these orbitals have been obtained in runs of the electron collision code IMPACT 
(Crees et al. 1978) and are of the kind dealt with in tables 2 obeying (11) — this way one builds 
up the He atom from He+ orbitals, which provides ‘frozen cores’, and the IMPACT orbitals. 
Eissner and Zeippen obtained this result when testing part of the SSTRUCT extension in 1981. 
With similar output from RM one would now get the same good answer. For comparison the 
table contains a second entry for neutral He: 28 configurations composed entirely of ordinary 
SM orbitals still give a poor result. For all ions correlation configurations had been included.
In half-filled shells nl the one- and two-body BP terms in (26) compete in (25) to the 
same orders in a and Z with components due to the ordinary (/ + 2s) (Eissner and Zeippen 
1981), which can lead to destructive interference in the transition amplitudes. This affects the 
calibration when using line intensity ratios in such ions for electron density diagnostics.
5 Conclusion
The paper grew out of a particular task, namely to provide bench marks before extending 
the new version of Scott and Taylor’s RM-BP code so as to include E2 and Ml radiative 
processes, all consistent up to Breit-Pauli order as discussed during a Cecam Workshop in 
1989 (Berrington et al.). The results shown in this paper give confidence that the code will 
be performing reliably in its main task: to provide intermediate coupling data for electron-ion 
collsion processes and for photoionization on a large scale — analytically the extension of the 
bound state regime into the continuum!
In the context of the Conference the results give insight to separate physical processes 
contributing in relativistic structure calculations.

Discussion
Professor Patrick Sandurs’ comment: Your hydrogenic result E2s1/2 7^ ^2P1/2 is at vari­
ance with Dirac theory: when expanding in powers of a?2, the two level positions must be the 
same to all orders.
Answer: Yes, they must — and they would if the SSTRUCT code retained terms up to 
order a2 in the eigenvalues of the H matrix. However expectation values of order a2 are re­
tained in the matrix elements, and the situation is made worse in the hydrogenic case because 
off-diagonal matrix elements contain nothing of order o°. Look at the submatrix for J = | 
(which of course reduces further according to parity), arranged in the same order as in table 1:

shows up as a separate second entry within the parentheses of our H matrix). However the 
off-diagonal elements (n'l | f(K) | nl) spoil the tidyness in the eigenvalues Enij on diagonalizing

+0 -|-terms of relative order a2Z2 from other np, where n > 2.
Thus the off-diagonal terms give rise to admixtures two orders lower in Z than the BP terms. 
Numerical cumulative integration errors, which can be estimated from deviations in the non- 
relativistic answers -Z2/n2 and the likes, are smaller than the BP effects; in our IBM double 
precision calculations relative errors remain below 10-7 (which coincides with the accuracy 
parameter specified as IT0L = 7 that controls the eigenvalue problem (10)), at least for all 
the ground states. Only at Z — 52 may the uncertainties grow by nearly 2 orders for the 
more oscillating and diffuse orbitals; this is insignificant compared to the rise of the BP terms 
at such a big value of Z. Another source of error is neatly avoided: apart from the obvious 
measure of distributing the fourth derivative in /(m) evenly over the two orbital functions the 
resulting second derivatives of (r|n/) = Pn/(r) are available from (10) as a simple expression. 
A final remark: for s-orbitals the integrand at r = 0 in (n's|/(m)|ns) is finite, and the integral 
can become fairly sensitive — to say nothing of (/(d)), which apart from a factor Z is entirely 
given by the slopes of the orbitals at r = 0: see (13). One checks the code for stable answers 
on varying the step length of the integration grid.

RELATIVISTIC CALCULATIONS of PARITY NON-CONSERVING EFFECTS in
ATOMS

Abstract
Atomic parity non-conserving (PNC) effects are produced by electronic weak interactions and lead to macroscopic mirror 
asymmetries. These PNC effects can be measured experimentally but in order to extract fundamental information about the weak 
force it is necessary to have accurate atomic calculations of the appropriate PNC El transition matrix elements. In this paper we 
give an over-view of relativistic calculations of PNC effects in atoms according to successive approximation schemes. From the 
combination of atomic PNC experiment and theory we derive an accurate value for sin^0w. the fundamental electro-weak mixing 
angle, which is in excellent agreement with the current world average.
1. Introduction
The Parity of a system describes its behaviour under reflection through the origin. This transformation 
is formally equivalent to a mirror reflection in a plane through the origin plus a 180° rotation about 
an axis perpendicular to that plane. Rotational invariance of physical systems means that a parity 
non-conserving (PNC) system is one that exhibts a mirror asymmetry. Of the four fundamental forces 
only the weak force is known to be parity non-conserving.
The effect of weak interactions in the atomic environment leads to small mirror asymmetries such as 
the rotation of plane polarised light in an atomic vapour. These effects, though extremely small are 
measurable because of their PNC signature. Recent advances in experimental technique have enabled 
high precision measurements of atomic PNC phenomena . Atomic PNC effects have a Z3 
enhancement so that experiments are performed on heavy atoms: currently, atomic PNC experiments 
have been perfomed on Cs, Tl, Pb and Bi (for a recent review of atomic PNC experiments see Hinds 
1989). The fact that these are all heavy atoms means that a theoretical treatment has to be fully 
relativistic.
The most important atomic weak interaction is described in the 'standard model’ (Glashow 1970, 
Weinberg 1967, Salam 1968, see e.g. Mandi and Shaw for an expostion) by the exchange of an 
intermediate Z° vector boson between the nucleus and an electron. The atomic Hamiltonian for this is 
given by

where Gf - 2.22x10-14 au gives the small size of the interaction, p(r) is a nuclear density, normalised

(1.2)
2. The Hierarchy of Approximations in MBPT
In this section we shall discuss the hierarchy of successive approximations that are normally made in 
an ab initio many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) calculation. We shall first discuss normal, parity 
conserving calculations before including PNC effects as well. As discussed by e.g. Bouchiat and Piketty 
(1986) the parity conserving physical quantities which are most relevant to a PNC calculation are El 
transition matrix elements and the hyperfine interaction constants. We shall accordingly concentrate 
on these.
The atomic Hamiltonian that we shall use is given by
H - E hD(i) + £ -1 
(2.1)
< 
->i 
*>
where
hD - c . B + rn c2 ( ft - 1 ) + VnJ r ) 
(2.2)
is the standard Dirac single particle Hamiltonian and VnttC(r) is the nuclear potential energy. As yet 
there has been little work with the Breit interaction included. In practice, instead of the 
inter-electronic Coulomb interaction an approximate electronic potential is used as a starting point and 
MBPT is then applied. The Dirac Hartree-Fock potential is often used as an initial approximation.
where N and Z are the number of neutrons and electrons respectively, sin26w is the fundamental 
parameter for the standard electro-weak model, and y5 is the matrix

1 \
(1.3)
1 ° /
When this matrix acts on a relativistic Dirac two component spinor it exchanges the top and bottom 
components so that the resulting orbital has the opposite nominal parity to the unperturbed orbital. 
This gives the PNC nature of the atomic weak interaction Hamiltonian.
The presence of atomic PNC weak interactions means that quantities which are normally parity 
forbidden can now occur. For example the 6s -> 7s Cs El transition is parity forbidden. In the 
presence of a PNC interaction the orbitals become parity mixed so that there is then a non-zero 
amplitude for this transition due to the opposite parity of the admixture:
< 7si/2 I "r I G Sf/2 > = < 7sI/2p I _r | bSj/? > + < 7si/2 I -r | 6s > 
(1.4)
where the ~ denotes a parity mixed orbital. The 6s -> 7s transition amplitude, which is proportional to 
Qw, can be measured experimentally. If the value of Qw can be extracted then a value for sin2^, can 
be obtained. However, in order to extract Qu. it is necessary to have a value for the PNC El transition 
matrix element. These have to be calculated separately and this is the task of atomic PNC theory 
calculations. The most accurate PNC measurments have been performed on Cs (Noecker et al. 1988) 
and as this is a single valence system the theory is relatively easy. We shall accordingly concentrate on 
Cs and also T1 which can be treated as a single valence system as well.

kl-Ite. Bine Hirtrec-Fock Equations
The standard starting point for a MBPT calculation is the Dirac Hartree-Fock (DHF) equations. For a 
single valence system it is most convenient to use a Vn_j DHF potential where only the N-l core 
electrons contribute to the electronic potential. The DF equations are given by
( hD + VHF ) | a > - ea | a > 
(2.3)
where

and

<2-5)

where P12 is the usual exchange operator. These differential equations can be solved by standard finite 
difference techniques.
2,2 The Random Phase Approximation
The next level of approximation in our hierarchy is to include certain single particle excitations to all 
orders. The resulting equations are often referred to as the Random Phase Approximation (RPA). The 
RPA equations are closely related to the Time Dependent HF equations (TDHF) for a time dependent 
perturbation.
There are two ways of viewing the RPA equations. One of the simplest is to consider a perturbation 
dV which we can include directly in the DHF Hamiltonian. If we expand the equation up to first 
order in dV for the wave functions and the eigenvalues we obtain:
( hD + dV + Nhf + dVHF ) | a 4- da > = ( €fl + 
) | a + da > 
(2.6)
Taking terms linear in the perturbation and rearranging we obtain, for the hyperfine interaction for 
example
( ea - bD-VHF> I <Ja > - h>q
 a > + V | a > - | a >< a | 
+ V | a > 
(2.7)
*
u £/ nr 
nr/i 
RPA
where = dVHF is the change in the self-consistent potential due to the perturbation h*w
 acting 
on the other core orbitals.
For a time dependent perturbation, such as a radiation field, we have to include an 'cd term
*
 on the 
left-hand side of the equation. There are now two possible excitations to be solved for : | da+ > and 
| da~ >. For an electric field we have:
( 
± cd - hD - VHF ) | da± > = -r | a > + Vrpa I a > - orthog. 
(2.8) 
where ’orthog.’ refers to the orthogonality terms that ensure that the excitations are orthogonal to the 
unperturbed orbital. V±Ap4 is given by
V*  |a> -
RPA
E ( < <* b± I g12 I b > + < b | g121 <5b+ > ) | a >. 
b.core
(2.9)
In all these RPA type of equations the excitations have to be split up into their different allowed 
angular momentum channels and each solved for separately.
To obtain the matrix element including the RPA correction, the operator simply has the appropriate 
RPA potential added to it. For example, for the hyperfine interaction one requires the expectation

value over the valence orbital:
pnc
< v I h* w’ + V I V > . 
(2.10)
RPA
For an El transition matrix element between valence states i and f the matrix element
<f I - r + V + | i > . 
(2.11)
RPA
is required.
Physically the V^ma potential gives the shielding correction to the El transition matrix element. In 
Figure 1 we give some of the MBPT diagrams that the RPA equations represent. It is straightforward 
to show that equations (2.7) to (2.11) will generate all the MBPT RPA El diagrams to all orders when 
the equations are solved to self-consistency. The inclusion of the cd term on the LHS of equation (2.8) 
gives the correct energy denominator for the diagrams. It is interesting to note that although equations 
(2.6) and (2.8) allow admixtures of the other core orbitals b into the solution for core correction | da > 
and | a± >, which is not allowed in the MBPT diagrams, the admixture of b into the excitation of a is 
exactly cancelled by the admixture of a into the excitation of b as long as the perturbation is 
Hermitian.
Figure 1, Some MBPT RPA diagrams
These RPA equations have been solved by several groups (e.g. Johnson et al. 1986, Dzuba et al. 
1984,1985, Hartley and Sandars 1990, Hartley and Martensson-Pendrill 1990) and the results are 
generally consistent. We shall present the answers later.
3,3 Lowest Qrdsr Correlation
All the equations used so far have been coupled differential equations that have been solved using 
standard finite difference techniqes. However, for the calculation of correlation it is necessary to 
include two particle effects and evaluating these using differential equations leads to severe difficulties 
(see e.g. Lindroth 1987,1988, Lindroth et al. 1987). One alternative solution is to use finite basis set 
techniques. This has been used by several groups in the past (Johnson et al. 1987, 1988a, Dzuba et al. 
1984,1985,1987J. The method described here was used by Hartley and Martensson-Pendrill (1990). 
It involves deriving a basis set by diagonalising a matrix representation of the DHF Hamiltonian (eq. 
2.3) as used by Salomonson and Oster (1989). This involves taking an atom in a finite space and 
representing the space on a discrete logarithmic radial grid. The radial part of the DHF Hamiltonian 
(2.3) can then be represented as a matrix in this space.
70

where
( F G ) - ( G f2 f3... fv g( g2 ga • • • 8a )•
The differential operator submatrix, D, is obtained by using finite difference numerical formulae and 
thus has contributions along a band a few points wide along the diagonal. The direct part of the DHF 
potential is obtained using DHF core orbitals obtained by solving equation (23) using standard 
differential equation techniques. This contributes along the diagonal of the potential submatrix V. The 
exchange part of the potential introduces off diagonal elements in V. Diagonalising this matrix to 
obtain the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues results in an ortho-normal basis set that is complete on the 
matrix space. For a given size of ’box’ the grid size can be reduced and the results extrapolated to 
derive a zero grid size answer. This can then be repeated for larger and larger box sizes and the 
results extrapolated to the physical result. In practice for a grid of 120 points and a box from 
r-exp(-12) to r-40 a.u. we found little appreciable change after extrapolation.
With this basis set it is possible to construct any MBPT diagram by explicit summation. The four 
lowest order correlation corrections are given in figure 2. Their effect can be expressed in terms of a 
non-local correlation potential

which depends, through ev on the orbital which it acts upon.
Figure 2. Lowest order correlation corrections
These four diagrams give the lowest order corrections of a DHF orbital towards a Brueckner orbital 
(BO) which has no single particle corrections to it to any order. The DHF orbital plus these lowest 
order corrections are often referred to as approximate BO’s.
The lowest order BO energy corrections are given by
- < V I E < V ) I v >
(2.14)
and the lowest order BO wave function corrections given by
| dv > - E I i >< i I £ ( V ) I v >

(2.16)
and
< f | -r | di > + < df | -r |i > 
(2.17)
respectively. It is straighforward to include the RPA corrections to the BO contributions by including 
the RPA correction potentials in the above expressions.
The results for all the contributions up to this level of approximation for Cs and T1 are given in Tables 
1 to 3. From this it can be seen that the lowest accuracy, which is for the hyperfine constants, is at 
5% for Cs but only around 10% for Tl. The lowest order BO calculations by W. Johnson et al. (1987) 
did not include the shielding corrections; their calculation also only summed explicitly up to I - 6 in 
their partial wave summation and extrapolated to obtain the higher / contributions. In the results 
presented here (Hartley and Martensson-Pendrill 1990) explicit summation was performed up to / - 10 
before extrapolation. It was found that the higher / > 6 values contributed more than is estimated 
from extrapolation. In their calculations for Tl matrix elements, Dzuba et al. (1987) had large basis set 
errors due to incompleteness which accounts for the large discrepancies with the numbers presented 
here. This problem has been corrected in their latest calculations.
L4 Beyond tte Lowest Order
To calculate even the lowest order BO corrections take a large amount of computing resources. To go 
beyond lowest order is no easy task. Blundell et al. (1988) have performed an explicit calculation of 
all third order MBPT corrections for Cs valence energies using a finite basis set constructed out of B 
splines. The accuracy obtained was 0.4% or better for the energies. However, this took an enormous 
amount of computing time and in general order-by-order calculations quickly become prohibitively 
large.
2.4.1. The Coupled Cluster Equations
One of the main alternatives to order-by-order methods is to use all-order equations. As discussed 
earlier, the RPA equations give the contributions of certain single particle diagrams to all orders. It is 
also possible to derive all order equations for two or more particle effects such as the Coupled Cluster 
(CC) equations (see e.g. Lindgren and Morrison 1986). These equations generate diagrams such as in 
Figure 3aZ>. If a Hermitian formulation for deriving the CC equations is used (Lindgren 1990) then 
certain additional diagrams are included as shown in Fig 3cd. These CC equations have been solved 
non-relativistically for the lighter alkali metals for single and two particle excitations ( e.g. 
Martensson-Pendrill et al. 1990Salomonson and Ynnerman 1990) but the accuracy for some 
quantites is still at the few percent level. It is only when certain three particle diagrams such as in Fig. 
3de are included that, for Na, the agreement goes to 0.01% for the eigenvalues and <0.2% for the 
hyperfine constants (Salomonson and Ynnerman 1990). Work is currently in progress on complete CC 
calculations for Cs and Tl.
Figure 3. Coupled Cluster diagrams: a and b are included in the standard CC equations, c and d are 
only included in the Hermitian formulation.

2.4.2. The Russian Bubble Method
The solution of the CC equations requires large computer resources of both time and memory. Rather 
than evaluating all these diagrams, many of which are negligibly small or cancelling, the Russian group 
at Novosibirsk identified the most important terms beyond lowest order correlation. These propagator 
diagrams (Fig. 4a) represent the shielding of the Coulomb interaction by the core in the lowest order 
correlation correction. These shielded correlation terms were then chained together as in Fig 46.
Figure 4a, The chaining of the bubble diagrams to give the screening of the correlation
Figure 4b, The chaining of the screened correlation diagram
It is not easy to calculate the chaining of the core ’bubbles’ of Fig 4a by conventional MBPT as the 
different time-orderings of the Coulomb interaction lead to non-trivial energy denominator terms. The 
alternative approach adopted by the Russians was to use the Feynmann propagator method that is 
normally used for QED calculations. This involves using fermion propagators; its different treatment of 
the energy denominator terms by using contour integrals enables the calculation of the bubble diagrams 
to all orders.
This method has been applied to the calculation of energy levels in Cs and T1 (Dzuba et al. 1989a, 
1988 respectively) giving accuracies of <0.2% (see Table 1). It has also been used to calculate El 
matrix elements and hyperfine values for Cs to give an accuracy of better than 1% (Dzuba et al. 
19896) (see Tables 2 and 3). This represent the most accurate ab initio MBPT calculation performed 
on Cs to date.

3. The Inclusion of PNC Effects in MBPT Calculations
As first pointed out by Sandars (1977) it is possible to include the PNC interaction directly in the DHF 
Hamiltonian. By separating out the terms of one power of GF one obtains the PNC DHF equations
( €a - hD - VHF ) | aP"c > = ( hPnc + VPncHF ) | a > 
(3.1)
The PNC DHF orbital | a^nc > has the opposite parity but the same j value as the orbital | a > (i.e. it 
has the opposite sign k value). If one now considers a parity mixed basis set consisting of each orbital 
plus its PNC correction then it is straighforward to show that this set is still ortho-normal to first order 
in GF :
< a | b > - < a + &Pnc | b + bPnc > = < a | b > + < tfnc | b > + < a | bPnc > - 
(3.2)
where the two PNC overlaps cancel due to the Hermiticity of the PNC DHF Hamiltonian. Thus it is 
possible to perform MBPT with this parity-mixed basis in the standard way. To pick out the required 
PNC corrections to an El transition one takes the standard MBPT El diagrams constructed with a 
parity-mixed basis set and expands them in powers of GF. The PNC corrections are all first order in 
Gf. This amounts to taking a parity conserving diagram and replacing each DHF orbital one by one by 
its PNC DHF counter-part. This is equivalent to performing MBPT with two perturbations: the PNC 
interaction and the El interaction.
LI PNC Corrections
PNC HF
The lowest order PNC El transition matrix element is obtained by replacing each valence orbital in the 
transition by its PNC HF counter-part. Thus we have for the Cs 6s -> 7s PNC El transition
< 7s1/2Pnc |-r | 6s1/2 > + < 7s1/2 |-r | 6slz/"c > 
(3.3)
The values for this are given at the top of Table 4 for Cs and T1 PNC El transitions.
PNCRPA
The next PNC term is found from the PNC RPA equations. There are two parts to this. The first 
one is the standard electric field shielding which can be included by replacing the dipole operator -r in 
the above by -r + The second type is where the PNC orbital occurs in the shielding diagram 
so that we have a correction of the type
< 7s1/2 | V+P"< | 6s1/2 > 
(3.4)
The results are also given in Table 4. It is interesting to note that this correction is very small for Cs 
but larger than the standard shielding correction for Tl.
PNC+BO
When considering PNC corrections with BO corrections there are several types of correction:
i) . PNC DHF valence orbital plus BO valence orbital. Thus we get the terms :
< 7si//nc I "r I <*6 s1/2 > + < <*7s
1/2 | -r | 6s1/2p"c >
ii)

The values for the PNC transitions are given in Table 4. The shielding potential terms can easily be 
included with these BO corrections as well as the V+pnc shielding term. These terms are also given in 
the table.
The large discrepancy for Cs between the results of Table 4 (Hartley et al. 1990) and Dzuba et al. 
19876 is due to basis set errors in the latter’s calculation. This has been corrected for in later 
calculations (Dzuba et al. 1989c).
3 JBeyondlowest Order pnc bq Corrections
As yet a full PNC Coupled Cluster calculation has not been performed though work is in progress in 
Indiana (W. Johnson, private communication). The most comprehensive PNC calculation performed to 
date is by Dzuba et al . (1989c) using the ’Russian Bubble Method’. In this calculation they evaluate 
the ’Russian Bubble’ diagrams for the BO and external PNC-BO corrections. The internal PNC-BO 
corrections and the structural radiation corrections are evaluated to lowest order only.
4, Results and Discussions
The list of all the PNC contributions so far discussed are given in Table 4 for the PNC transitions 
considered. If these values are to be used for an atomic determination of sin2^ then it is necessary 
to estimate the accuracy of the PNC values. The usual approach it to examine the accuracy of 
experimentally known values calculated to the same approximation as the PNC terms. As first 
discussed by Bouchiat and Piketty (1986) the geometric mean of the appropriate hyperfine constants is 
a better yardstick than the individual hyperfine constants for assessing the accuracy of PNC 
calculations as it has the same dependence on the wavefunction density at the nucleus as the PNC 
Hamiltonian. The calculated values of experimentally known El transition matrix elements and 
hyperfine interaction constants in the approximation of lowest order BO + shielding corrections have 
been given in Tables 1 to 3. However internal BO and structural radiation corrections were not 
included in these whereas they are included for the PNC calculations. For some quantities, such as the 
T1 p3/2 hyperfine constant these contriubutions make a large difference, but for most of them they are 
very small. We can thus estimate an accuracy of 4% for the Cs 6s -> 7s PNC El transition and about 
10% for the T1 6pi/2-7pi/2 and 6pi/2 -> 6p3/2 transitions to this level of approximation.
As mentioned above, the most complete PNC calculation on Cs is that of Dzuba et al. 1989c. Since 
their calculations of the experimentally known El transition matrix elements and hyperfine constants 
using their approach are accurate to 1% or less (Dzuba et al. 1989h) then this accuracy is assumed for 
the PNC calculation as well.
An alternative approach to PNC calculations has recently been used by Hartley and Sandars (1990).

They used a semi-empirical correlation potential in the relevant RPA type of equations which when 
combined with a semi-empirical correction factor leads to an accuracy of 2% for the PNC El 
transition matrix element.
4.1 An Atomic Determination of Sin26,
In Table 5 we give the latest theory calculations in units of Qw. Combining these with experimental 
measurements of EPrtC allows us to extract a value for Qw. Using the expression for Qw from 
Marciano and Sirlin 1983 which includes radiative corrections:
Qw - 
- 0.9793 N + Z ( 0.9793 - 3.8968 sin2 ) 
(4.1)
and taking the best value theory from Dzuba et al. (1989c) together with the most accurate 
experimental measurement on Cs (Noecker et al. 1988) we obtain an atomic physics determination of 
sin2^ given by
atomic physics: 
sin2#*,  - 0.226 ± 0.007 (exp) ± 0.004 (theory) 
(4.2)
where the first error is due to experiment and the second to theory. If we compare this with the 
current world average (Langacker 1989) of
world average: 
sin2^ - 0.2264 ± 0.0054 (exp)
then we see that there is excellent agreement.
Conclusions
An atomic physics determination of sin2#*,  has a great deal more importance then merely confirming 
the world average value ! It is dependent on interactions at a much lower momentum transfer, Q, than 
high energy particle physics measurements and represents an important test of electro-weak theory in 
this energy range. Perhaps of even greater interest is the fact that an atomic physics value could be 
sensitive to different parameters from particle physics, such as the mass of the top quark, for example, 
so that more accurate atomic experiment and theory could allow determinations of fundamental 
physical significance. Also, with out doubt, the need for accurate atomic calculations of PNC 
quantities has been a great spur to atomic structure calculations which have improved tremendously 
over the last decade. It is now possible to calculate energies for single valence systems to fractions of 
a percent and it is hoped to achieve this level of accuracy for other quantities in the near future as 
well. There is still plenty of work to be done though: we have to master heavy atoms with more than 
one valence electron yet!

HIGH PRECISION RELATIVISTIC ATOMIC STRUCTURE
CALCULATIONS USING THE FINITE BASIS SET APPROXIMATION
H.M. Quiney
Department of Theoretical Chemistry
University of Oxford
5, South Parks Road 
Oxford, 0X1 3UB
1. Relativistic Basis Set Methods
Most relativistic atomic structure calculations use some sort of finite dimensional 
single-particle basis. The well-known computer program of Desclaux and 
co-workers (Desclaux, 1975) and the GRASP2 package produced by the Oxford 
Atomic Theory Group (Dyall et al, 1990) are the direct decendaiits of earlier 
non-relativistic programs which employ finite difference methods and whose 
origins may be found in work pioneered by Hartree and collaborators. The 
current status of the published finite difference programs and their application to 
bound-state problems and to electron-ion collision models is reviewed in the 
lecture by Ian Grant in this volume.
Relativistic many-body problems have been the subject of active theoretical 
interest for the last decade. The Oxford Atomic Theory Group became involved 
in the development of practical methods for relativistic many-body perturbation 
theory in 1984, when we considered the relativistic extension of a simple model 
problem using finite basis set methods to represent the complete Dirac spectrum 
(Quiney et al, 1985). It was clear from this model calculation that a properly 
constructed square-integrable basis could be used to evaluate relativistic 
perturbation theory diagrams to high accuracy order-by-order, including all 
contributions from the positive- and negative-energy continua, without the 
quadrature problems which are encountered in brute-force finite difference 
calculations. Perturbation sums are evaluated using the basis set method simply 
by adding a finite number of discrete contributions from square-integrable 
wavepackets, and features of the relativistic perturbation theory which arise 
because of the filled negative-energy sea are readily incorporated simply by 
counting states. We have continued to pursue an algebraic approach, in which 
basis sets are constructed from analytic functions. This has allowed us to control 
the accuracy of our numerical procedures and to demonstrate that a sequence of 
calculations converges to a well-defined limit as the dimension of the basis is 
enlarged towards completeness. This approach does not, of course, represent a 
unique viewpoint on relativistic many-body perturbation theory using basis sets. 
Analytic methods have been developed by Drake and Goldman (1981, 1988) using 
different functional forms to those implemented in our codes. Piecewise 
polynomial basis functions have been employed by Johnson and his collaborators 
at Notre Dame in highly successful calculations of many-body and 
parity-non-conserving effects in the caesium atom (Johnson et al, 1988) and a

finite difference discretization procedure has been developed at Goteborg which 
has been applied successfully to relativistic many-body problems (Salomonson and 
Oster, 1989). We have persevered with our analytic approach because of its 
success in treating the atomic many-body problem, the direct applicability of the 
method to relativistic molecular models and the computational efficiency of the 
scheme when implemented on vector-processing machines (see the articles by 
Ishikawa, Wilson and Dyall et al in this volume for molecular applications). The 
method has also proved useful in the mathematical analysis of the relativistic 
finite basis set approximation (Grant, 1989).
This talk is about the design of practical finite basis set methods for atoms. We 
have named our prototype computer program SWIRLES, to honour one of the 
pioneers of relativistic atomic structure theory (Swirles, 1935). The general 
strategy is familiar to quantum chemists who perform molecular calculations 
using finite basis sets of Slater- or Gaussian-type functions. In relativistic atomic 
structure calculations, however, we emphasize the importance of a complete 
representation of the spectrum and of the systematic approach towards 
completeness of the basis. This should be compared with the widespread quantum 
chemical practice of using energy optimized basis sets which may not be enlarged 
in any systematic fashion and which often suffer from computational linear 
dependence.
The first version of SWIRLES is able to calculate bound-state energy levels and 
expectation values for closed-shell, average-of-configuration and simple open-shell 
problems. These calculations are comparable in both speed and accuracy with 
those produced by the finite difference program GRASP for any element up to 
about Z = 100. Unlike GRASP, the low-frequency Breit interaction may be 
included in the construction of the self-consistent field potential as a matter of 
routine with negligible computational overhead. This is possible because of the 
extensive use of recurrence relations in the evaluation of intermediate quantities 
for two-electron basis set integrals. The matrix structure of the Dirac-Fock 
equations and the subsequent diagrammatic expansion of the correlation energy 
are translated into a sequence of matrix multiplications which are built around 
library subroutines written in CRAY Assembler Language (CAL). The most 
CPU-intensive part of the calculation which transforms basis set integrals into 
reduced matrix elements runs at a substantial fraction of the maximum rate per 
processor on the CRAY X-MP/416, so that the remaining bottlenecks in the 
calculation are connected with some essential scalar manipulations and tests in 
the integral generation which ensure the accuracy of the calculation. The tensor 
algebra machinery introduced and refined by Grant (1970, 1988) for the 
Dirac-Fock problem has been adopted throughout SWIRLES. The heart of the 
program is a module called XKABCD. The input to this module consists of four 
sets of variables which define the basis set parameters, quantum numbers and 
expansion coefficients for the orbitals belonging to four distinct atomic symmetry 
types. All basis set integrals are generated as they are required and partial 
transformations performed on the lists to reduce storage. The output of 
XKABCD is a complete list of reduced matrix elements of all allowed tensor 
orders for both the Coulomb and low-frequency Breit interactions. It is then a 
simple matter to combine the reduced matrix elements together following the 
index structure prescribed by perturbation theory, multiply these contributions by 
the appropriate angular momentum coupling coefficient and add the resulting 
contribution to the diagrammatic expansion at a given order.
The program is structured for an order-by-order approach to the many-body 
problem. Starting with a many-body diagram at a given order, the angular and 
radial parts of the diagram are separated and the angular parts decomposed and 
evaluated according to the standard Yutsis-Vanagas-Levinson rules (Lindgren and 
Morrison, 1986). SWIRLES evaluates the radial parts and the two contributions 
are recombined to form the many-body diagrammatic components. Fourth-order 
in many-body perturbation theory represents a practical upper limit to this 
84

approach because of the complexity of the higher-order diagrams and the rapid 
growth in the number of terms. Another approach, which is popular in 
non-relativistic atomic and molecular theory, has been adapted to relativistic 
MBPT by Johnson et al (1988) and by the group at Chalmers (Salomonson and 
Oster, 1989), who sum some classes of diagram through all-orders in perturbation 
theory using the coupled-cluster ansatz (Lindgren and Morrison, 1986). Within 
an approximation which includes all single- and double-excitations in the 
correlation of electron pairs, the coupled-cluster approximation is a powerful and 
relatively straightforward technique which is able to recover the bulk of electron 
correlation corrections. A relativistic coupled-cluster extension of SWIRLES is 
currently under development which exploits the special features of our basis 
functions and much that is already known from non-relativistic quantum 
chemical studies. Order-by-order methods are attractive from a conceptual point 
of view because many-body perturbation theory diagrams represents a direct 
transcription of the standard rules of QED, but the practical problems associated 
with the complexity and poor convergence of the diagrammatic expansion may 
make coupled-cluster approximations the method of choice in many applications.
It is planned to interface the next version of SWIRLES with the angular 
modules of GRASP2, to produce a general atomic structure program for 
multiconfigurational, coupled-cluster and many-body perturbation theory 
calculations of complex atoms using analytic basis functions. We are currently 
investigating methods for the ab initio evaluation of quantum electrodynamic 
(QED) corrections in atoms. In view of the current precision of atomic spectra 
and the interest in QED effects in many-electron systems, more sophisticated 
computational techniques are necessary and crude approximations to the Lamb 
shift in many-electron systems are no longer adequate. Our preliminary work 
towards the calculation of radiative corrections in atoms is the subject of the 
second part of this talk.
2. Spinor Basis Functions
The first calculation of relativistic atomic structures using the analytic basis set 
approximation was made by Kim (1967) while he was a graduate student with 
Roothaan in Chicago. He had to contend with two main problems which 
appeared to undermine the matrix approach to the Dirac-Fock problem. Firstly, 
he commented that the computers of the day were too slow and too short on 
memory to make relativistic calculations of meaningful accuracy. Computer 
resources are now more powerful and more readily available than was imaginable 
in 1967, so this first problem is of no concern, at least for atoms. For molecules, 
however, computing power is still a problem and we have yet to see relativistic 
ab initio molecular orbital programs applied to chemically interesting systems 
containing heavy atoms. Clearly this situation is changing, and we have heard 
encouraging reports at this meeting from a number of groups working towards ab 
initio quantum chemistry. Kim noticed another more enduring problem which 
became the subject of active research throughout the 1980’s. Variational 
calculations based on the Dirac one-electron operator have a tendency to 
’’collapse”. The distinction between positive- and negative-energy solutions is 
lost, the spectrum exhibits wild fluctuations as the basis set parameters are 
adjusted and the correct non-relativistic limit of the spectrum is not recovered if 
the numerical value of the speed of light is allowed to tend to infinity. In Kim’s 
calculations, this problem manifested itself in the instability of relativistic basis 
set optimization procedures.
The situation was reviewed by Kutzelnigg (1984) and a number of methods have 
since been developed which reduce or eliminate the problem. I will consider only 
those methods which avoid variational collapse through a special choice of basis 
set; the alternative techniques, most of which are based on corrections to the 
Pauli limit of the Dirac equation, are now so numerous that they require careful 
consideration in their own right.
85

Kim chose as his radial basis functions modified exponential functions of the 
form
f”(r) = r1'+mexp(-<ir) 
[2.1]
where k, is the usual relativistic angular quantum number, 7 = [k;2 - (Zq)2]’, m 
is a positive integer, Z is the nuclear charge, a is the fine-structure constant 
and {(i} contains a chosen set of exponential parameters. Throughout the 
following discussion, we will ignore the spin-angular dependencies of the spinors, 
which are treated algebraically. There was no explicit connection between the 
functions belonging to the large- and small-component basis sets and it was 
found that satisfactory answers could only be obtained by imposing the 
additional constraint that solutions should satisfy the relativistic virial theorem. 
Later, it was demonstrated by Lee and MacLean (1982) that quantum chemical 
calculations may be performed using standard non-relativistic methods if the 
large- and small-component basis sets are related by the Pauli condition
{^(r)} . {a.p fL(r)} 
[2.2]
where the superscripts L and S refer to matched pairs of large- and small­
component basis functions, respectively, and the operator cr.p provides the 
off-diagonal coupling of the spinor components corresponding to the action of the 
relativistic kinetic energy operator cap in the absence of an external field and in 
the Pauli limit of the Dirac equation. This basis set prescription is now widely 
known as kinetic balance and avoids the worst aspects of variational collapse. It 
is not a sufficient condition to avoid all symptoms of variational collapse. Finite 
matrix approximations of Dirac single-particle states do not provide upper 
bounds to the exact eigenvalues; small "variational failures" of the order of an 
atomic unit are observed using kinetically balanced functions in heavy 
point-nuclear ions. For example, the solutions of the point-nuclear Dirac 
equation are singular at r = 0 and have non-integer power law behaviour. Such 
analytic behaviour may not be reproduced by the direct application of the 
kinetic balance approximation because it leads to singular matrix elements, 
particularly for the symmetry-type k = 4-1 and to small variational failures. The 
use of a uniform proton distribution reduces the size of the bounds failure but 
does not eliminate it completely for orbitals of « = +1 symmetry type (Ishikawa 
el al, 1986). It has been suggested that the use of a Gaussian distribution for 
the nuclear potential eliminates the variational problem entirely (Aerts, 1986), 
but I know of no published numerical evidence which establishes this when the 
kinetic balance prescription is observed rigorously. This approximation has the 
very important practical feature that no new integral types are required if 
Gaussian-type primitive functions are chosen as a basis for kinetically balanced 
molecular calculations (Aerts, 1986; Dyall et al, this volume). The disadvantage 
is that there is no physical basis in the choice of a single Gaussian function to 
model the nuclear potential, and the possibility remains that a more realistic 
empirical model of the nucleus such as the Fermi distribution would reintroduce 
small variational collapse problems. This area requires further study, but these 
comparatively minor details need not invalidate the kinetic balance approach.
Our experience of relativistic calculations using the finite difference approximation 
indicates that we must look carefully at the boundary conditions on orbital 
models, particularly at the nucleus. In finite difference calculations, the boundary 
conditions are an integral part of the solution algorithm, but in non-relativistic 
basis set calculations they seem to appear only incidentally, when we examine 
how well our calculation satisfies the "cusp condition" at the nucleus after the 
wavefunctions have been determined. We have found that the boundary 
conditions form an integral part of any valid relativistic finite basis set 
86

procedure. The analysis of kinetic balance provided by Stanton and Havriliak 
(1984) indicates that these small bounds failures introduce spurious errors 
O[(Za)4]. It is likely be some time before quantum chemical calculations are able 
to overcome the formidable technical difficulties which arise if we wish to 
evaluate all important corrections O[(Za)2], which represents the level of 
approximation we require in order to achieve a chemical accuracy of 1 milli­
hartree. The attractive feature of the kinetic balance approach is that it allows 
the recycling of most of the technology of quantum chemistry without substantial 
modification. This is particularly true of the algorithms for the generation and 
manipulation of two-electron matrix elements and methods to deal with the 
many-body problem and the construction of basis sets, which have been major 
technical preoccupations of computational quantum chemists for almost thirty 
years. It is likely that the only real problem in performing ab initio relativistic 
calculations of molecular properties to chemical accuracy will be found in the 
numerical complexity of these calculations, rather than in any deep problem of 
principle.
We may place the relativistic basis set approximation in a well-defined 
mathematical context if we combine the idea that the large- and small­
component basis sets for one-body model equations must be related through the 
action of a operator coupled with the requirement that physical boundary 
conditions determined by the algebraic form of the external field must be be 
imposed on the space of trial functions. This is equivalent to the familiar result 
that a complete basis set may be constructed from the discrete solutions of a 
differential operator, subject to appropriate boundary conditions. This is the 
essence of the Rayleigh-Ritz method which exploits the fact that the complete 
set of solutions obtained through the above prescription forms a basis in which 
to expand any arbitrary function which satisfies the same boundary conditions. 
This leads us to a discussion of S- and L-spinor basis sets for relativistic atomic 
calculations.
It is not widely appreciated that the completeness of Slater- or Gaussian-type 
basis sets in non-relativistic studies arises because these functions satisfy 
self-adjoint differential equations of Sturm-Liouville type. Another example is the 
less widely used non-relativistic Sturmian basis pioneered by Hylleraas (1930) 
and popularized by Rotenberg (1970) in high-precision atomic calculations. The 
functions which we term S-spinors and L-spinors have as their non-relativistic 
(Pauli) limits kinetically balanced sets of Slater functions and Sturmian functions, 
respectively, and have the same range of applicability in atomic calculations. The 
S- and L-spinors are also solutions of a self-adjoint differential equation: a 
generalized Sturm-Liouville form of the Dirac equation. The first demonstration 
that S-spinors, which are based on the discrete solutions of the point-nuclear 
Dirac equation, exhibit no trace of variational collapse was provided by Quiney 
(1987) and Grant and Quiney (1988). The validity of S-spinor and L-spinors 
expansions in the context of Sturm-Liouville theory has been discussed by Grant 
Sand by Drake and Goldman (1988). The latter authors call L-spinor 
ms ’’relativistic Sturmian functions" but there is no difference up to a 
multiplicative constant. The L-spinor functions form a complete basis for an 
exact expansion of the Dirac-Coulomb Green’s function, a fact which is implicit 
in the work of Wichmann and Kroll (1956) and explicit in the work of Hostler 
(1982, 1987) and Manakov et al (1984). The radial L-spinor functions have the 
general form
(N - /c)
= Cn« ^exp(-Ar) -(1 - 
. L>r)}
[2.3]
where the upper sign implies T = L, and the lower, T - S and the labels L 
and S designate the large and small components, respectively. The parameter A 
87

is the same for all n and fixed k but is an otherwise arbitrary real, positive 
constant. For practical purposes, A is usually taken to be of the same order of 
magnitude as the nuclear charge, Z. C is a normalization constant, Nn is the 
relativistic "apparent" principal quantum number, and Ln^(x) is the generalized 
Laguerre polynomial. The S-spinor functions are formed by choosing a set of 
exponential parameters, {Aj}, and the functional form of the L-spinor function 
with the smallest value of n permissible for symmetry-type k. For a < 0 the 
value of n = 0 is chosen; for n > 0 we choose n - 1. This forms a set of 
nearly-nodeless radial functions which are sufficiently flexible to represent the 
spectrum for realistic mean-field potentials but which uses relatively simple 
functional types. The general form of the unnormalized S-spinor radial basis is
m f r^ exp(-A-r) 
for k < 0
fL(r) = T 7
[ (A
*  + A^r) r'exp(-l|i) for n > 0 i = 1,2,...N(«)
1 
[2-4]
The superscript T takes the values L (large) and S (small) for a given angular
T 
symmetry-type, and radial dimension, N(«). The contraction coefficients 
are readily obtained from the explicit functional forms of the generalized 
Laguerre polynomials which appear in the L-spinor prescription. This reasonably 
simple basis possesses all the properties we require to avoid variational collapse 
problems, and provides a set which may, in principle, be extended towards 
completness in the limit N(/s) -* m. For k, = +1, for example, the required 
contraction coefficients are
= (2 - N)(27 + 1)/(2N - 2)
aS = -N(27 + 1)/(2N - 2) 
[2.5]
where
7 = (1 - Z2/c2)= and N2= 2 + 27 
[2.6]
Each basis set has particular advantages depending on the situation. The 
S-spinor is analogous to the non-relativistic Slater spin-orbital, and is a 
particularly good choice for calculations involving heavy, many-electron systems. 
It is this basis which has been adopted in the radial modules of the program 
SWIRLES. The L-spinor functions take advantage of the orthogonality and 
recursive properties of Laguerre polynomials, and is an ideal choice for 
high-precision calculations on few-electron systems. The orthogonality properties 
of L-spinors which result in sparse and banded matrices greatly reduce the 
effects of computational linear dependence in the basis, so that radial basis sets 
of several hundred functions per angular symmetry type may be used without 
problem.
The basis set parameters for S-spinor calculations must be chosen in a 
systematic fashion which ensures that the basis becomes complete in a 
well-defined limit and which controls the effects of computational linear 
dependence. The rather special choice of function ensures that much of the 
experience gained in the construction of systematic sequences of even-tempered 
88

basis functions may be transferred directly to relativistic electronic structure 
calculations. The even-tempered prescription
VVn-1 i = 
[2.7]
generates a suitable basis of dimension N if the parameters and satisfy
0^ -» 1 and -> cd 
[2.8]
in the limit N -* oo. In practice, if the value of any parameter /? in a sequence of 
calculations is close to unity, the basis becomes computationally linearly 
dependent as is evidenced by a striking growth in the magnitude of the orbital 
expansion coefficients and one or more of the eigenvalues of the basis set Gram 
matrix approaching zero. As a rough guide, the value of /3 should not be less 
than about 1.30 for a set of ten or more functions per radial symmetry type. 
The value of a merely scales the exponent values. In principle, basis set 
optimization using this scheme is very simple for finite sets, because there are 
only two free parameters for a fixed value of N. In practice, however, the 
regular spacing of the exponents and the high quality of a moderately large 
even-tempered set introduces deep multiple minima in the energy surface, which 
may cause the optimization procedure to sample regions where linear dependence 
is a problem. For atoms, optimization is pointless, since it is always easier and 
more profitable to extend the basis by increasing its dimension. For molecules, 
we contend that a strong case can be made for the use of large, flexible 
even-tempered sets, rather than compact energy-optimized sets, because of the 
need to use a richly detailed virtual spectrum in many-body calculations.
3. Many-Body Calculations Using S-Spinors
Self-consistent field calculations of the mercury ground state obtained using 
SWIRLES are presented in this volume by Ian Grant. These calculations 
demonstrate that the finite basis set approximation is competitive in both speed 
and accuracy with the finite difference approach embodied in the GRASP2 
program and that new areas of research are suggested. The Breit interaction may 
be included in the self-consistent field procedure as a routine part of any atomic 
structure calculation. Interesting and significant modifications of the orbitals 
energies and shapes are found if the potential includes low-frequency Breit 
contributions, but 
the total energy is not significantly changed 
from the
first-order result. It has been been demonstrated by Lindroth et al (1989) that 
the self-consistent 
treatment of the Breit 
interaction leads to important
contributions in calculations of the enhancement factor between the electric 
dipole moment of the electron and the corresponding moment in an atom. The 
most important consequence of treating the Breit interaction self-consistently is 
the substantial simplification in the relativistic many-body theory which results 
from the cancellation of some classes of diagram through all orders of 
perturbation theory, rather than the magnitude of the effects which are due to 
the modification of the orbitals. It is likely that calculations of transition 
probabilities will be sensitive to self-consistent Breit modifications because of the 
significant changes which are observed in the orbital mean radii, particularly for 
core electrons. We hope to examine this question in the near future.
The potential of this method is nowhere more apparent than in the calculation 
of many-body effects. Such calculations have been reported previously within the 
Dirac-Coulomb approximation (Quiney, 1987, 1988; Quiney et al, 1987, 1989, 
1990), but here we construct a no-virtual-pair relativistic many-body 
perturbation theory based on a Dirac-Fock-Breit reference function, and 
incorporating the Coulomb-gauge low-frequency form of the Breit interaction in 
the evaluation of second-order pair correlation corrections (see Quiney et al, 
1990).

The relativistic many-body shift from all sources, including the low-frequency 
Breit interaction is -1277 /z-hartree using the S-spinor basis set approximation, 
which compares well with the value -1254 p,-hartree derived from Drake’s 
calculation at this order of approximation. The agreement is poor, however, with 
the value of -1851 /z-hartree obtained by Lindroth (1988) using pair equation 
methods, and with similar estimates obtained using multiconfigurational 
expansions (Gorceix et al, 1987). Similar agreement with Drake, at the 2% level, 
has been found for He-like beryllium and zinc. The evidence suggests that 
relativistic many-body corrections are well-represented by low-order many-body 
perturbation theory if the Breit interaction is treated self-consistently throughout 
a calculation. The residual many-body corrections are dominated by higher-order 
non-relativistic contributions involving many interactions, in which relativistic
90

effects contribute comparatively little. The most likely source of the differences 
between the current calculations and those of Lindroth (1988) is the 
self-consistent use of the low-frequency Breit interaction in the former and the 
perturbative use of the Gaunt interaction in the latter. The differences between 
the basis set calculation and multiconfigurational expansions may be numerical 
rather than physical in origin, since the set of numerical configuration state 
functions is comparatively small due to the computational cost involved in 
high-precision MCDF calculations. It is difficult to define "relativistic shifts" in 
MCDF calculations because the method is founded on the variational principle 
and different basis sets are used in the non-relativistic, Dirac-Coulomb and 
Dirac-Breit models.
Many-body corrections evaluated with the low-frequency forms of the Coulomb- 
and Feynman-gauge interactions in no-pair theory may be substantially different, 
and some comment seems necessary to explain why I have chosen to use the 
low-frequency Breit interaction rather than the simpler Gaunt interaction. The 
recent discussion of this problem appears to have been prompted by Sucher 
(1989), who indicated that the Feynman-gauge form of the interaction should not 
be used in no-virtual-pair calculations of many-electron atomic structures 
because the leading order relativistic effects are incompletely determined. 
Lindroth and Martensson-Pendrill (1989) reported the remarkable result that 
gauge independence between the two forms of the interaction is restored in the 
low-frequency limit only at the expense of including negative-energy intermediate 
states in the Gaunt result, which is a domain in which this approximate 
interaction is not valid. Further analysis of this problem by Lindgren (1990) 
indicates that when a single-photon potential of the type used in atomic 
structure calculations is employed within the no-pair approximation, the 
Coulomb-gauge Breit operator represents the entire interaction, correct to O(a2), 
but when the Gaunt interaction is used we must include the lowest-order 
retardation correction, which contributes to irreducible crossed-photon Feynman 
diagrams, in order to restore gauge independence. This fundamental work is of 
practical importance in atomic and molecular calculations. It is very tempting to 
use the Gaunt interaction in self-consistent field and many-body calculations 
because no new integral types are encountered in basis set approximations, and 
because the retardation of the electromagnetic interaction is known to contribute 
only about 10% of the relativistic shift at the mean-field level of approximation. 
Such calculations would not, however, include all important relativistic 
many-body effects unless we use the interaction in negative-energy intermediate 
states where the Gaunt interaction is not valid, or we include the leading-order 
retardation correction. In either case, the apparent simplifications which we 
sought by using the Gaunt interaction are lost, and it seems clear that within a 
theory which neglects virtual-pair production, the use of the Coulomb-gauge 
Breit interaction is preferable in calculations of relativistic MBPT.
The presentation of relativistic many-body theory in this paper has had a 
essentially non-relativistic flavour. The general strategy of the calculations has 
followed closely the practices of quantum chemistry because so much is known 
about computational algorithms in this field. There seems to be little point in 
calculating relativistic or quantum electrodynamical corrections unless the 
non-relativistic parts of the calculation are satisfactory and the numerical 
procedures are carefully defined. The use of an analytic basis ensures that we 
may make a direct connection with very high precision calculations in the 
non-relativistic limit of the theory, so that the major features of the problem are 
accurately reproduced. Accurate relativistic corrections to total electronic energies 
are readily obtained if we adopt a theory based on Dirac spinors instead of 
non-relativistic spin-orbitals. The use of a two-body interaction operator which 
includes both the instantaneous Coulomb and frequency-independent Breit terms 
in both the specification of the self-consistent field atomic potential and in the 
evaluation of no-virtual-pair many-bodv perturbation theory diagrams leads to a 
theory in which, in principle, all O[(Za)2] corrections to the non-relativistic limit 
91

are recovered. Residual many-body corrections are due mainly to non-relativistic 
contributions which arise because of the truncation of the perturbation expansion 
or from uncalculated terms in the multipole expansion of the potential.
The clear challenge to atomic and molecular theory is to develop methods which 
enable the reproduction and interpretation of spectra to an accuracy comparable 
to that of current experiments. Continual improvements in experimental 
technique have been the motivation for the development of theoretical methods 
to model spectroscopic transitions in many-electron systems which are of interest 
to astrophysics and plasma physics and for the establishment of relativistic 
quantum chemistry. Advances in the fundamental models of physical interactions 
since the 1950's have led to experiments which are designed to measure parity 
non-conservation in atomic states caused by the weak electron-nucleon force and 
the possible existence of atomic electric dipole moments which would arise 
though the violation of symmetry under both parity and time reversal. An 
overview of parity violation in atoms is presented in the lecture by Hartley and 
Sandars in this volume. The other area in which relativistic many-body is 
essential is in the interpretation of data which aims to test the theory of 
quantum electrodynamics in strong external fields and in many-electron systems. 
Contributions which are attributable to QED corrections, particularly those 
known collectively as the Lamb shift, are now the largest source of uncertainty 
in high-precision calculations of few-electron systems. In the second part of this 
talk we examine the extension of the theory to the calculation of terms which 
are characteristic of relativistic electron theory and the theory of quantum 
electrodynamics, including retarded interelectron potentials, the polarization of the 
vacuum and electron self-interactions and describe our progress in developing 
numerical methods to deal with these problems.
4. Quantum Electrodynamics
When we consider effects which are essentially relativistic or quantum 
electrodynamical in origin, the "follow-your-nose" approach (Sucher, 1989) which 
has guided us until now lands us in trouble: the equations which govern the 
propagation of Dirac particles and the effective interactions between these 
particles may not be deduced by naive generalization of non-relativistic quantum 
mechanics. The underlying problem is that the notion of a "single-particle 
system" cannot be given physical meaning in relativistic atomic structure theory 
because of the presence of the filled negative-energy sea: valid relativistic models 
of atoms, molecules and solids are always infinitely-many-body problems which 
are most conveniently discussed within quantum field theory. So far, we have 
considered a simplified physical model in which the negative-energy many-body 
contributions have been neglected. A classical condition has been imposed which 
conserves the number of particles throughout an arbitrary sequence of unretarded 
interactions.
Quantum electrodynamics, which is the theory of fundamental processes involving 
electrons (all leptons) and photons, must be brought to bear in order to resolve 
the true role of the negative-energy states in the Dirac theory and the many 
divergences which are encountered in calculations of electrodynamic interactions 
(Schweber, 1961; Mandi and Shaw, 1984; 
Itzykson and Zuber, 1980). 
The
development of methods which generate a discrete representation of the Dirac 
spectrum suggests the exciting possibility 
that the rules of QED may be
transcribed into practical computational 
algorithms which are suitable 
for
modelling complex systems. The extent to 
which we may append the residual
effects of QED for many-particle systems to our simplified models of atomic and 
molecular physics raises difficult questions of both theory and practice. In this 
section, we discuss some relevent features of QED which arise in atomic 
calculations when we venture "beyond the no-virtual-pair approximation".
92

4.1. Electrons
The Green’s function for the non-relativistic Kepler problem in quantum 
mechanics is known in closed form (Schwinger, 1964). The relativistic Green’s 
function for the Dirac-Coulomb equation known only as a partial wave 
expansion, both for the linear (spinor) (Wichmann and Kroll, 1956) and 
second-order (scalar) forms (Hostler, 1982; 1987). Apart from many subtle 
problems of theory, the difficulties which arise in the accurate construction and 
manipulation of numerical representations of electron Green’s functions (or 
propagator functions) present the main obstacle in the development of relativistic 
QED calculations (Lieber, 1989).
In non-relativistic quantum mechanics, where the scalar wavefunction, satisfies 
the Schrodinger equation
W = ih $ 
[4.1]
the evolution of the wavefunction over a small time interval At is determined by 
the action of the operator exp(-iHAt/h). If the particle has the initial 
coordinates (rbti) then at some other time:
<12^2) 
= 
J K(r2,t2;r1,ti)V'(ri,ti)d3ri 
(t2 > ti)
<r2,t2) 
= 
0 
(t2 < t]). 
[4.2]
The kernel K(r2,t2;ii,ti) is the propagator function which carries the wavefunction 
to later times. For earlier times the non-relativistic propagator function vanishes; 
the future evolves from initial conditions specified at previous times. If we can 
find a complete, orthonormal set of solutions of the time- independent 
Schrodinger equation, = 6n^n5 the superposition principle allows us to 
express the propagation kernel as a spectral expansion
K(r2,t2;r1,ti) = 
^pn(r2)?>n(ri)exp[-un(t2 - ti)] (t2 > ti)
- 
0 
(t2 < ti)
[4.3]
This propagator forms the theoretical basis of quantum chemical calculations 
based on many-body perturbation theory. It is implicit in most non-relativistic 
calculations that we introduce a finite-dimensional representation of the complete 
spectrum in the expansion of the above propagator. Many-body perturbation 
theory may be developed from this starting point by combining propagators and 
states with instantaneous interactions and performing integrations over the 
time-interval (t2 - ti). The resulting energy denominators which appear in the 
perturbation theory expressions are characteristic of the finite dimensional 
representation rather than the original physical model. This procedure is 
equivalent to a slight modification of the physical model of a free atom which is 
removed in a well-defined limit. If we use a finite set of analytic basis functions 
which decay exponentially, we may imagine that we have introduced a weak 
confining potential which discretizes the spectrum at all energies. In the case of 
finite-difference or spline calculations the atom is placed in a box, whose radius 
is systematically increased until its presence is undetectable in the results of the 
calculation. In either case, these are realistic and controllable modifications of the 
model, since the idea of a free atom is itself an approximation to the 
93

experimental conditions. Both the finite basis and finite difference approximations 
are familiar techniques in the solution of integral equations (Hochstadt, 1973).
Construction of an approximate relativistic electron propagator using finite 
spectral representations requires special care. The Schrodinger equation is replaced 
by the Dirac equation which is, for an electron moving in a time-independent 
external four-potential with components A ,
(n - A / - mc)<x) = 0 
[4.4]
where ^(x) is the solution four-vector and the four-dimensional matrices 7^ 
satisfy
+ V/x = 
[4'5]
The metric tensor, g^, is defined by goo = 1; gn=g22= g33= -1- If we omit the 
external field, the electron propagator is known exactly for free-particles. If we 
absorb the time-independent external field into the specification of the zero-order 
problem, as we wish to do in bound-state problems in order to reduce the 
strength of the perturbation, the model which describes the time-evolution of the 
system is known in QED as the Furry bound-state interaction picture (Furry, 
1951; Schweber, 1964). There are two fields; one describes the localized creation 
and annihilation of electrons in a time-independent external field and the other 
defines the photon field. The interaction Hamiltonian, which specifies the 
interaction between the matter and radiation fields, constitutes the entire 
perturbation.
When we attempt to extend the idea of an electron propagator to relativistic 
particles, our instincts tempt us simply to replace the eigenvalues of the 
finite-dimensional representation of the Schrodinger equation with those of the 
Dirac equation, the scalar wavefunctions <pn with the spinors and the complex 
conjugates of the wavefunctions with the adjoint vectors, defined by
*
V’n = ^n70 
[4-6]
This naive prescription violates the physical requirements of the Dirac hole 
theory of the positron, in which of the negative-energy states are filled with 
electrons according to the Pauli Exclusion Principle and may not be used as a 
basis in which to expand the propagator for t2 > ti. We could just forget about 
the negative-energy states entirely, but then we have an incomplete 
representation of the propagator. This is the origin of the no-virtual-pair 
approximation which was been widely adopted in atomic calculations. It is 
stressed that such a theory leads to qualitative agreement with experiment for 
processes in atoms and molecules which arise through low-energy interactions and 
the deficiencies of the theory may be recovered, if required. With care 
(Martensson-Pendrill and Lindroth, 1989; Lindgren, 1990), the no-virtual-pair 
approximation yields all effects correct to O(Za)2. In high-energy interactions, 
where pair-creation is possible, the negative-energy states fulfil a vital role in 
ensuring the convergence of the theory, because many of the linear divergences of 
the unquantized theory are softened to logarithmic divergences in hole theory. 
Both the no-virtual-pair propagator and the propagator which ignores the Pauli 
Exclusion Principle in negative-energy intermediate states are solutions of the 
homogeneous Dirac equation and their difference is the propagator for times 
ti > t2- The hole-theory of the positron appears in propagator theory 
as a boundary condition on allowable solutions of propagation equation. 
The relativistic propagator for electrons, valid for all time intervals, is (Feynman, 
1949):
94

K(r2,t2;ri,ti) =
+ ^^n(r2)^n(r1)exp[-ien(t2 - tj)]0(t2 - ti) 
11
- ^^n(r2)^n(ri)exp[-un(t2 - tj]0(ti - t2) 
n
(t2 > ti)
(tl > t2)
[4.7]
The function 0(t) takes the value 0(j) = 1 for r > 0 and 9(r) = 0 for r < 0. 
In this theory, positrons appear not as holes in an unobservable infinite 
negative-energy sea but as electrons propagating backwards in time. Notice that 
in extending the definition to (ti > t2) a minus sign has been introduced, which 
is consistent with results from the original formulation of hole theory (Weisskopf, 
1939). In a finite basis set calculation, we replace the sums over a complete 
basis by finite-dimensional sums over a numerical basis according to the above 
rule, where the energy character of each of the square-integrable approximations 
is determined by its eigenvalue. From a computational viewpoint, this allows us 
to make a connection with the theory of quantum electrodynamics. In principle, 
we may construct approximations to the propagator and employ the rules of 
QED to translate Feynman diagrams into perturbation sums. The correct 
application of boundary conditions on the allowable forms for basis functions now 
becomes crucial, because the separation of positive- and negative-energy states is 
part of the physical model. Different formulae arise depending on whether the 
intermediate states are of positive- or negative-energy and some combinations of 
states are excluded when subsequent time-like integrations are performed.
The electron propagator function is conveniently represented as a contour integral 
over the Dirac Green’s function, G(x2,xi;z), in the complex energy plane and the 
boundary conditions of hole theory are embodied in the direction of the contour 
and in the poles and branch cuts in the complex energy plane. The conventional 
notation is:
- | S^(x2,Xj)
1 
2x1
dz G(x2,xi;z)exp[-iz(t2- ti)]7°
- K(x2?xi)
[4.8]
The contour of integration passes from z = (-® - ifl) through the origin of the 
complex plane to z = (-Foo -I- i£), where 6 is a small positive quantity. The 
integrand is analytic and holomorphic throughout the complex plane, except at 
isolated simple poles and branch cuts on the real line, and the contour may be 
deformed to any convenient path. The hole theory propagator is obtained from 
the contour integral representation by the application of Cauchy’s Theorem and 
the evaluation of the residues at the simple poles of the Dirac Green’s function.
Calculations of QED effects are a particularly severe test of the basis function 
method because any slight numerical pollution of either branch, which would go 
unnoticed in no-virtual-pair theory, is amplified when we calculate 
electromagnetic matrix elements involving negative-energy states. A part of the 
self-energy calculation, which we discuss later, involves sums which resemble 
well-known sum rules. The contribution from negative-energy intermediate states 
dominates the calculation.
95

4.2. Photons
In non-relativistic quantum mechanics, static electrons interact through an 
instantaneous Coulomb mechanism depending only on the inverse of the spatial 
separation between the particles. In quantum electrodynamics, we require a 
function which acts only on a relativistically invariant space-time interval 
Asu = 0 (Feynman; 1949, 1962), defined by:
(As12)2 = C2(ti - t2)2 - (n - r2)2 
[4.9]
It seems reasonable to replace the instantaneous Coulomb interaction
A 5(tl - t2) 
[4.10]
by a similar function which acts only on Asi2 = 0, so that the interaction is 
retarded by the finite speed of propagation
A 5(As12) 
[4.11]
Again, the "follow your nose approach" is wrong, because the Fourier transform 
of this interaction contains both positive and negative frequencies: we observe 
only photons with positive frequency. The negative-frequency components are 
removed by employing the result (Feynman, 1949), for times t2 > tf
00
Mx) = 1 (exp(-iwx)dw = lim J = S(x) + A [4.12]
| 
/I J 
£ ) q lf/l A vC
0
This is averaged with the corresponding result for times ti > t2 to obtain the 
static interaction valid for all time intervals ti2
^+(^sh) ~ ^A-[^+(cti2 - ri2) + ^+(~cti2 - 112)] 
[4-13]
where
As?2 = c2t?2 - r?2 
[4.14]
This relativistically invariant operator, which contains only positive frequency 
Fourier components, depends on the square of the space-time interval, Asi2. So 
far, the interaction has been between static charges. To obtain the Lorentz gauge 
interaction between moving charges, we replace the classical velocity, Vj with the 
matrix operator, Qj. The complete relativistic electron-electron interaction is
(1 - ai.a2)£+(As^2)- 
[4.15]
This is the Feynman gauge operator; the Coulomb-gauge form is discussed by 
Lindgren (1990). When the Fourier transform of the Coulomb-gauge interaction 
operator is taken, a potential between electrons is obtained in which 
contributions from scalar and longitudinal modes are eliminated and the 
instantaneous Coulomb interaction is recovered with the frequency-dependent 
Breit interaction as a correction to the potential. We shall develop the theory in 
Feynman gauge, because this leads to a more convenient potential for self-energy 
calculations of hydrogenic ions and the results are, of course, gauge invariant.
96

The interaction operator may be expressed as the four-dimensional Fourier 
transform
5+(As?2) = exp( -ik.x21)—[4.16] 
J (2tt)4 k2 + ie
where the limit e -» 0 is understood. The problem with using this interaction is 
that it leads to divergent matrix elements for some processes. It is usual to 
introduce a relativist ally invariant cutoff function into the integrand which 
eliminates the contributions from very large values of | k|. This parametric 
modification of the theory must be removed at the end of a calculation; if the 
result does not depend on the form of the cutoff then the result is considered to 
be valid. The one-parameter cutoff function which is commonly used in QED 
calculations leads to the modified interaction for photons
A+(As?2) 
= I exp( -ik.X2i)----- ----------------- -----------
J (2t)4 
[k2 + ie k2 - A2 + ie_
= 
- Dj(x2 - X1) 
[4.17]
The second term in the braces cuts off the interaction for k2 >> A2 and the 
modification may be removed in the limit A2 ®. The second equality defines 
the regulated Feynman photon propagator. The use of a parametrized cutoff 
functions provides an elementary example of the Pauli-Villars regularization 
prescription (Pauli and Villars, 1949) and is necessary because the intermediate 
quantities which are calculated in QED are frequently not those of physical 
relevence. The parameters which are attributed to the mass and charge of a free 
electron already contain radiative corrections summed through all orders in 
perturbation theory and no shift in the values of these parameters is allowed 
through QED interactions. In atomic systems, the QED effect which is largest in 
magnitude is the Lamb shift (Johnson and Soff, 1982), which is mainly due to 
the emission and reabsorption by a bound electron of a virtual photon; the 
self-energy. In an atomic calculation, we must subtract from the self-energy for 
the bound electron the corresponding self-energy for a free-electron wavepacket 
with the same probability distribution as the bound state, because this second 
counterterm has already been absorbed in the definition of the free electron 
mass. The unrenormalized self-energy of a free electron in state | a >, which is 
required later as a renormalization operator, is:
AEa(A) = f[ | ln(A2) + 
Ma >
= 
5m(A) < 
| Z? | h > 
[4.18]
which is clearly divergent in the limit A -♦ ®. This is chosen as the 
renormalization counterterm so that the electromagnetic shift in the energy of a 
free electron vanishes identically. Since AEa(A) is proportional to the expectation 
value of the relativistic matrix /?, the operator corresponds to a renormalization 
of mass. For a bound electron there is a residual shift due to the external field. 
The process of renormalization obviously raises deep philosophical and 
mathematical difficulties. The difference between the unrenormalized self-energies 
of the bound and free-olectron is a finite quantity which represents a change in 
the electron mass-energy due to binding and is called the electron self-energy. 
The unrenormalized quantities are logarithmically divergent with respect to the 
contributions from the radiation field and the regularization parameters serve 
97

only to manage the divergences on a temporary basis: they are unphysical 
features of the theory which are eliminated at the end of any valid calculation.
5. Self-Energy Calculations
The changing nature of the self-energy operator as different energy regions are 
sampled is the main origin of the numerical difficulties which are encountered in 
calculations of radiative corrections in atoms. A few sample calculations will now 
be examined to indicate the qualitative nature of these numerical problems.
At photon energies substantially less than the electron rest mass-energy, the 
intermediate states which contribute to the self-energy shift are predominantly 
non-relativistic in character. By making non-relativistic approximations for the 
self-energy of both a free electron and an electron in an external Coulomb field, 
Bethe (1947) derived the remarkable formula:
Kmax
AE„ = f V (E, - E„)< ° 1’1 -> < - |v| - > 
[5 J]
3%C J 
Em — En + k
0 m
for the radiative shift in the energy of the non-relativistic state | n >. The sum 
over {| m >} includes all intermediate states excluding the reference state, and 
the integration over k is interpreted as a principal value integral. The use of the 
velocity operator, v, indicates that a low-frequency dipole approximation has 
been made in the evaluation of radiation matrix elements. Since the integral has 
an upper energy limit of Kmax - me2 a.u., the low-frequency approximation does 
not seem justified, but Bethe later showed (Bethe and Salpeter, 1957) that the 
frequency-dependent parts of the interaction for the bound- and free-electron 
self-energy problems cancel and the correct shift is obtained in the dipole 
approximation. Bethe obtained a value of 1040 MHz in this approximation, 
which compares favorably with the modern experimental value of 1058 MHz, 
considering the approximations involved. An additional correction of -16 MHz to 
the theoretical value is also required at this order of approximation for vacuum 
polarization.
The non-covariant sharp photon cutoff is clearly an unsatisfactory device which 
may not form part of a consistent theory. In Bethe’s non-relativistic theory, 
however, it was justified on physical grounds by the argument that a fully 
relativistic calculation should be convergent (a finite shift is observed) which can 
only be true if the bound- and free-electron parts of the calculations are 
asymptotically equal in the high-energy region. This is a feature of the 
relativistic operator which we wish to exploit in calculations; in the very 
high-energy region where the photon energy is greater than the total electron 
energy, the effect of binding must become less important. As a second 
requirement it would be a great advance if a relativistic calculation could 
incorporate the qualitative features of Bethe’s calculation; the observable 
self-energy shift arises mainly through non-relativistic intermediate states and the 
effect of retardation and of the negative energy states on the observed shift is 
small.
The relativistic self-energy shift formula is (Baranger, Bethe and Feynman, 
1953):
AEn(A) = Re | -iar J^n(x2)7^S^(x2,xi)/ ^n(xi)Dp(x2 - xi)d3x2d3xjd(t2 - ti)
- 5m(A) < I I >| 
[5.2]
98

If the spectral expansion of the electron propagator and the Fourier transform of 
the unregulated photon propagator are substituted into the above expression and 
the time-like integration performed, observing the distinction between earlier and 
later times in the propagators, then the second-order energy shift derived by 
Weisskopf (1939) using transverse radiation gauge within the Dirac hole-theory is 
obtained:
AEn
< ^n|a exp(-ik.r)| $m> < ^m| a exp(+ik.r) | ^n>
_____ P_____________ 
P________________
m
Em ~ En + k
< ^n|a exp(-ik.r)| i/)m> < a exp(+ik.r) | ^n> 
££ 
P
m
En - Em + k
[5
This shift is ultimately renormalized by the subtraction of the divergent 
free-particle self-energy, 5m(A=oo)< 
\/3\ Vh > It is assumed that the sums
above exclude the reference state but include both transverse photon 
polarizations, It was within this hole-theory formulation that the first 
calculations of the self-enerey shift were made by Kroll and Lamb (1949) and 
French and Weisskopf (1949), and its familiar structure suggests that it may be 
possible to use finite basis sets to approximate the above sums as we often do in 
electron correlation studies. No photon cutoff parameter appears in this formula. 
The very early calculations of the self-energy based on the above prescription 
avoided the use of integral cutoff functions either by performing the calculations 
for the bound and free electrons in parallel using perturbed plane wave 
approximations or by calculating the 2s- 2pi/2 interval directly. These 
subtractions allow the elimination of divergent algebraic expressions which are 
common to both unrenormalized contributions.
A hint as to how we might proceed is provided by the paper of French and 
Weisskopf (1949), who define a ’’mass operator” which is used to renormalize the 
calculation of the Coulomb self-onergy shift. Their operator is:
AM =
a exp(-ik.r)| <pn> < ipm| a exp(+ik.r)
M_________
E°-Ho + k
a exp(-ik.r)| <pm> < ptn| a exp(+ik.r) 
______ p________
Ho - ES + k
[5.4]
where {^In} are solutions of
Ho <Pm — Em pm 
[5.5]
for the free-particle Dirac operator, Ho. The operator Ho appears in the energy 
denominators to distinguish between positive- and negative-energy free-particle 
states. The expectation value of this operator is defined for any state which can 
be expressed as a linear combination of free-particle Dirac spinors.
This approach has been criticized because the relativistic invariance of the theory 
is not obvious at every stage of the calculation (Schwinger, 1958). The original 
algebraic method of solution involves expansions of the intermediate states and 
the evaluation of matrix elements over many effective operators; Kroll and Lamb 
99

(1949), whose approach was similar to that of French and Weisskopf, list 
twenty-five operators, each of which is multiplied by fifty elementary integrals 
over the photon momentum parameter. The results of the two calculations named 
above are, however, identical to those obtained by the lowest-order corrections in 
modern QED, and it is possible that a similar strategy in a numerical treatment 
of the renormalization problem may be more fruitful than the straightforward 
implementation of the invariant cutoff methods described above. We shall see 
later that a brute force numerical approach is technically very demanding. The 
calculation of AEn may be made to lowest order in the Coulomb interaction if 
a number of simplifying assumptions are made. I will summarize the features of 
the lowest-order calculation from Feynman (1962) because they provide a 
qualitative description of the more complete calculation which we ultimately 
require.
A feature of Bethe’s non-relativistic calculation is that the mean excitation 
energy of intermediate states contributing to the shift is very much greater than 
the binding energy: for the non-relativistic s-states of hydrogen the mean 
excitation energy is about 17 Ryd, compared with 1 Ryd binding energy. For 
energies greater than this mean value, it is reasonable to treat the electron as 
free, and to include only the perturbation of intermediate states due to a single 
Coulomb scattering between the emission and reabsorption of the self-energy 
photon. This approximation becomes more accurate in the high energy region, 
where multiple Coulomb scatterings become less likely. The formula derived by 
Schwinger (1949) and Feynman (1949) for radiative corrections to scattering in 
an external potential, V, and in the limit of low momentum transfer
AE> = ~ S [‘"fe] + 53 
15-61
may be used for the energy shift due to photons with a lower cutoff energy /z. A 
second ultra-violet 
cutoff parameter A 
has been eliminated 
in the
mass-renormalization process. An infra-red regulator 
is necessary in this
approximation because there is a divergent probability that one or more real soft 
photons will be emitted in inelastic collisions. This apparent divergence is really 
only an artifact of making a free-particle approximation in the bound-state 
energy region, where it is not valid. For energies less than the cutoff /x, the 
relativistic scattering formula may be matched to the non-relativistic shift 
formula derived by Bethe. For an external Coulomb field,
< V2V > = 4ttZ | ^(0)| 2 = 4Z(Z/n)3. 
[5.7]
This is the origin of the well-known qualitative behaviour of the self-energy, 
which depends on the square of the amplitude at r = 0, inversely as the cube of 
the principal quantum number, n, and approximately as Z4, neglecting the weak 
logarithmic dependence.
An average excitation energy is defined in such a way that the calculations for 
the low- and high-energy regions match smoothly. Finite basis sets have already 
been employed by Broad (1985) and by Drake and Goldman (1988) in the 
numerical evaluation of this excitation energy, which is characterized by the 
so-called Bethe logarithm. We have found that the relativistic scattering formula, 
[5.6], may readily be pasted onto the low-energy formula by evaluating 
sum-over-states in the latter using a non-relativistic finite basis set 
approximation, and integrating over dk using an infra-red cutoff parameter, A. 
The two calculations match smoothly over a large energy range; a convenient 
place at which to join the results is at A = me a.u. The numerical value of the 
calculated radiative shift is not sensitive to the value of A chosen, but A should 
be large compared with the binding energy to justify the free-particle 
approximation and small compared with the rest mass energy so that the dipole 
approximation is valid. Within this basis set approach it is possible to reproduce 
100

the lowest-order contributions to the self-energy without explicit knowledge of 
the Bethe logarithm, so that the numerical values of 1051 Mhz obtained from 
earliest calculations of the 2s—2p interval are reproduced after correcting for 
vacuum polarization. A basis of 15 Slater functions is sufficient to achieve 5 
figure accuracy in this calculation.
The contributions from negative-energy states and low photon energy may be 
estimated by replacing the energy denominators Em - En + k with the 
representative value 2mc2. Only matrix elements of the operator a contribute 
significantly to the unrenormalized sum:
A
AE- _ V [ k2 — < n lal m > < m |a| n >
n>< 
" J k 2mc2
m 0
4J
y Ik2 — <nlal m > < m I n >
"J k 2mc2 
0
[5.8]
In the second expression, the sum over states includes both positive- and 
negative-energy intermediates, except the reference state, without restriction. This 
is a reasonable approximation because the sum over positive-energy states is 
smaller than the negative- energy sum by terms O[(Za)2]. Closure is now 
invoked to evaluate the approximate shift
AEn?<
k2
2mc2k
3P
4mc2
This contribution is very much larger than the observable shift and is strongly 
divergent with increasing cutoff. Retardation attenuates this term at very high 
energies, but it is striking feature of the problem that the contribution to the 
unrenormalized self-energy is dominated by negative-energy intermediate states 
and is independent of the strength of the applied external field. The physical 
effect is masked by the approximations which are made in arriving at this crude 
order-of magnitude result. Since the physical effect is obtained by subtracting 
two unrenormalized terms O(Za) to estimate an observable O[(Za)4ln(Zo')"1] the 
numerical requirements of this problem are severe.
Although these results are interesting, they do not really contribute anything to 
the development of numerical methods for the relativistic calculation of QED 
effects in atoms, other than to provide qualitative information about the 
self-energy integrand. It is straightforward to improve the accuracy of the above 
non-relativistic calculation of the lowest-order shift using a large Sturmian basis, 
since the required dipole integrals may be calculated exactly, but this is really 
only an indirect way of calculating the Bethe logarithm, for which very accurate 
methods already exist. The fundamental problem is to develop fully relativistic 
methods, because it is relativistic atomic structure calculations to which radiative 
corrections are to be applied. A number of schemes exist which attempt to 
approximate Lamb-shifts using a scaled nuclear charge, but it is the arbitrariness 
inherent in these schemes which limits agreement between experiment and theory.
101

The Lamb-shift corrections for atoms are of greatest interest in strong fields so 
the incorporation of terms of higher order in the Coulomb interaction are 
required.
The practical aspects involved in the direct numerical evaluation of the 
relativistic self-energy shift in a bound electron state are now assessed. 
Configuration space representations of the electron and photon propagator 
functions are presented in forms which exploit known results from the theory of 
angular momentum coupling, recurrence relations for the generation of amplitudes 
and which are compatible with the basis set approach to relativistic atomic 
structure calculations. The standard against which new methods in this field are 
to be judged has certainly been set by Mohr (1974), who calculated self-energy 
shifts for hydrogenic ions using a faithful transcription of the rules of QED into 
numerical algorithms suitable for computation.
5.1. Expansion of the photon propagator
Three of the four integrations which define the photon propagator may be 
performed analytically, with the result
| D^“(x2 - X1) = 
- 0(t2 - tj) 
exp(-ik(t2 - tO sin(kR)
[5.9]
where R = | r2 - rj. Combining this with a similar expression for the 
propagator for finite values of A and performing the time integrations with 
respect to a general harmonic factor exp(ia4] representing the time-dependence of 
the electron states, leads to the definition of an integrated interaction kernel
BA(n,r2;W) = dk 
- I]
rrr w + k/1 + A2/k2 7T+ A2/k2f t5-10]
No analytic expression for the integral over k could be found, either for the 
regulated or unregulated parts of the interaction. If a simple form were known, 
then an effective Breit-like potential would be recovered and the calculation of 
self-energy shifts greatly simplified. In subsequent calculations of the energy shift, 
the factor w appears as an energy difference between the reference state and an 
intermediate state; if w < 0 the principal value of the integral is implied. In 
this notation, the energy shift is the limit A h m of:

The notation of Grant (1988) has been adopted; jn(z) is a spherical Bessel 
function, as defined in Abramowitz and Stegun (1970). If we reserve the 
integration over k until later, as we did for the calculation in the style of Bethe 
(1947), the problem is reduced to the evaluation of the above angular factors 
and radial integrals of the form:

exchange matrix element of the interaction at fixed k

The partial wave-expansion of the matrix elements of - (1 - ai.«2)sin(kR)/R 
may now be combined with the energy denominators which occur in the 
expression for the integrated interaction kernel.
104

The evaluation of these matrix elements requires the evaluation of spherical 
Bessel functions for a very large range of argument and order values. For values 
of k up to about me a.u. , we have found that the required argument values lie 
in the range 0 < kr < 500 for Bessel functions in the order range 0 < v < 300, 
in keeping with the conclusions of Mohr in the part of the calculation which he 
calls the "low-energy region". The convergence rate of the partial wave 
expansion deteriorates as the upper limit of k is increased, and the convergence 
is not smooth. The evaluation of a single point in the integrand over k closely 
resembles a calculation of the sum-rule tor spherical Bessel functions
0D
]T(2n + l)|jn(x)|2 = 1 for all x 
[5.28]
n=0
A large number of terms contribute to the sum which are of similar magnitude 
and whose signs depend on a slowly oscillating phase factor. The magnitude of 
the terms which contribute significantly to the sum fall off rapidly once the 
order index is greater than a certain critical value which depends on the 
argument, z = kr.
For a fixed value of x, all spherical Bessel functions which contributes 
significantly to the energy shift formula may be evaluated using the recurrence 
relation
jn*i(x)  + jn-i(x) = (2n +l)x-ijn(x) 
[5.29]
which is stable only in the direction of decreasing n. Using Miller’s Algorithm, 
two arbitrary seed values for the Bessel functions are chosen and the recurrence 
applied for decreasing n until the value of jo(x) has been determined. The table 
of values is then rescaled to the value jo(x) = sin(xWx. The starting point, nmax, 
for this procedure is determined using a number of empirical rules for different 
value ranges of x. For small values of x, the power series representation for the 
Bessel functions is useful up to the first stationary point for each value of n, 
which occurs, approximately, at x = (2n4-l). Since the values of the spherical 
Bessel functions are required at many values of the argument, x, and for many 
values of the index, n, an algorithm may be constructed which moves the 
recursive dependencies to outer loops, allowing the efficient generation of tables 
of function values. Subroutines have been constructed to evaluate the spherical 
Bessel and spherical Hankel functions which commonly occur in QED calculations 
which are stable, efficient and accurate over very large ranges of argument and 
parameter values.
5.2. Numerical representations of the electron propagator
We have chosen to make a spectral expansion of the Dirac Green’s function 
using the L-spinor basis functions described earlier. A practical upper limit for 
the dimensions of the basis is of the order of 500 functions per angular 
symmetry-type. The dimension of the basis may not be extended indefinitely 
because the effects of computational linear dependence in the basis are manifested 
in very large expenaion coefficients and deteriorating orthogonality integrals 
between the approximate and exact solutions of the Dirac-Coulomb equation for 
bound-state functions. Compared with other basis set methods, however, this 
basis set is considered to be very large and is far more detailed than that 
required for the high-precision calculations of electron correlation discussed 
earlier.
Extensive use is made of stable recurrence relations in the construction of the 
Dirac matrix in a finite L-spinor representation. For a point-nuclear hydrogenic
105

model, we require overlap, potential energy and kinetic energy matrix elements 
as described in the accompanying lecture by Grant for the S-spinor basis. In 
order to simplify the presentation, we define the auxiliary functions Nn, Hmn(27)
and Grnn(27):
Nn = (n2 + 2n7 + /c2)? 
[5.30]
min(m,n)
Hmn(27) = £ 
[5.31]
k=0
Gmn(27) = r(2? *|
m + ^n 
[5.32]
and the related function hm(27):
m
k=0
In practice, the L-spinor algorithms embodied in the computer programs that we 
have written are based on the function hm(2V), but the presentation will be in 
terms of the functions Hmn(27) and Gran(27) for clarity. The principal difference 
between the two formulations is the explicit use of the gamma function, T(zj, in 
the formulae for Hmn(27) and Gmn(27), which may be avoided by the use of the 
recurrence relation for hmn(27):
h0(27) = 1
M2?) = 1 + m + 
-4 hm-i(27), m = 1,2,3,... 
[5.34] 
which ensures that very large or very small intermediate quantities are never 
required in the construction of the Dirac matrix. The required matrix elements 
for symmetry-type & are:

In the formulae above, the label T may take the values T = L or T = S, for 
the large and small component basis functions, respectively. The upper sign of a 
pair =f is chosen for T = L and the lower sign for T = S. The basis function 
labels m and n lie in the range [0,Nt>—1], where Nb is the dimension of the 
spinor basis. If either subscript in the auxiliary functions Hran(27) and Gmn(27) is 
less than zero, then the auxiliary function vanishes.
The above algorithm is sufficient to generate a point nuclear Dirac spectrum 
containing up to 500 positive- and 500 negative-energy discrete states per 
symmetry-type. The cost of constructing the matrix is negligible in this scheme, 
compared with the solution of the generalized matrix eigenvalue problem. Using 
the CRAY X-MP/416 at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, the spectrum for 
each value of ft costs less than two seconds of CPU time to generate.
The similarity between finite basis set and exact expansions of the Dirac 
Coulomb Green’s function is now discussed. The use of an analytic basis allows 
us to carry over qualitative results from non-relativistic electron scattering 
models regarding the convergence of expectation values with increasing basis set 
dimension. Existing methods for modifying the Dirac Coulomb Green’s function 
to that of the Hartree-Fock potential through iteration are also directly 
applicable.
The Dirac-Coulomb Green’s function is known only as a partial wave expansion.

and Mab(x) and Wab(x) are the regular and irregular Whittaker functions, 
respectively (Abramowitz and Stegun, 1970). It is this form which was used by 
Mohr (1974) in his non-perturbative calculations of the electron self-energy in 
hydrogenic ions.
In order to make contact with the discrete expansion methods which have 
recently become popular in atomic physics calculations, it is convenient to 
consider an equivalent but less well-known representation of the Dirac-Coulomb 
radial Green’s function, derived from the second-order Dirac equation. An 
integral transform is used to convert the product of regular and irregular 
Whittaker functions into a modified Bessel function:

[5.40]
An expansion for modified Bessel functions in terms of the orthogonal Laguerre 
polynomials is then adopted to replace the product of Whittaker functions by an 
expansion in a complete basis of exponentially weighted generalized Laguerre 
polynomials:

Km k | G j «> Y;+l(0,$i)J
where I = | k\ if k, > 0, I — -ft-1 if ft < 0 and j = | ft| -j.
Clearly, calculation of the Dirac-Coulomb Green’s function and the subsequent 
determination of the self-energy shift depends primarily on the accurate 
evaluation of four radial auxiliary functions per angular symmetry-type, either in 
terms of the Whittaker functions, or as expansions in Laguerre polynomials. 
Mohr has already devised algorithms for the evaluation of Whittaker functions 
over the regions of the complex plane which are sampled by his contour integral 
technique. The second method based on Laguerre polynomial expansions is 
familiar from our work on L-spinor representations of the Dirac equation, which 
yields a finite-dimensional approximation to the above expansions of the radial 
auxiliary functions, and is formally equivalent to it in the limit of a complete 
set.
All complete orthogonal polynomial sets, such as the generalized Laguerre 
polynomials,
[5.46]
satisfy an elementary three-term recurrence relation:
(n+l)Ln
*i(x)
 = [(2n+a+l) - x]L„(x) - (n+a)L„-i(x). 
[5.47]
This recurrence is stable for increasing degree, n, and has been implemented in 
our computer codes by scaling the polynomial values by the weight function 
exp(-x/2); the starting values for polynomials of degree 0 and 1 are trivial. 
Using this simple scheme, which may readily be vectorized for efficient 
computation, it is possible to generate the radial L-spinor amplitudes or 
auxiliary radial Green’s for any symmetry-type and for any value of the radial 
coordinate which is required in the subsequent numerical integrations. The 
accuracy and stability of the procedure was tested by evaluating numerically the 
110

orthogonality integrals over square-integrable pseudo-states; an accuracy of one 
part in 1012 is readily achieved using our numerical techniques.
The numerical integration scheme was based on the Romberg algorithm, 
extrapolating the Riemann sum to the limit of vanishing step-length. Numerical 
approximations to well-known relativistic sum-rules and perturbation sums were 
tested using this scheme, and found to be accurate to the required accuracy of 1 
part in 107 with modest computational cost, using basis sets of up to 500 
L-spinors per symmetry type. Obviously a more efficient scheme in most cases 
would be Gauss-Laguerre quadrature, but for testing we did not wish to be 
restricted to the matrix elements of very smooth, polynomial-like operators.
If we look more closely at this procedure, a feature is revealed which is not 
found in calculations of many-body corrections in atoms and molecules, which 
determine matrix elements by integrating over spatial coordinates and then 
evaluate perturbation sums over intermediate states. In this finite-dimensional 
numerical approximation to the Green’s function approach, we first sum over 
intermediate states (or whatever the expansion basis is), and then perform a 
numerical integration over spatial coordinates. Formally, the two approaches are 
equivalent, but the numerical behaviour of each is quite different from the other.
We may clarify these differences by concentrating on a single radial auxiliary 
function, S°(r2,ri;z). This algebraic function is typical of the numerical sum which 
we attempt to construct from a finite-dimensional L-spinor expansion of the 
radial Dirac-Coulomb Green’s function and we may easily simulate the effect of 
L-spinor basis set truncation error by terminating the sum in the auxiliary 
function after a finite number of terms have been added.

We see that the point wise convergence of the Dirac Coulomb Green’s function 
expansion is poor and not readily accessible to any of the usual methods 
available for the acceleration of convergence of such series. Similar observations 
are made if we work with a finite-dimensional spectral expansion of the radial 
auxiliary functions in terms of the L-spinors amplitudes derived from the 
numerical diagonalization of the Dirac matrix. It is initially puzzling that a 
function which is so poorly defined may be used to produce electron correlation 
111

energies to very high accuracy using many-body perturbation theory, but the 
numerical evidence supporting the use of the basis set method in many-body 
problems, both relativistically and non-relativistically, is overwhelming. The 
above illustration of the poor pointwise convergence of Laguerre polynomial 
expansions of the electron propagator suggests the following explanation for the 
success of the finite basis set method in usual applications of relativistic 
many-body theory; the argument is adapted from an analysis of L2 
approximations in scattering theory (Yamani and Reinhardt, 1975).
The asymptotic behaviour of the multipole expansion of a realistic atomic or 
molecular potential, such as the Coulomb or Breit potential, is proportional to 
1/r, where r is the distance to the point of expansion. Solution of the 
generalized matrix eigenvalue problem
H X = E S X 
[5.48]
for either the Schrodinger or Dirac kinetic energy operator and a bounded 
potential constructed from the nuclear and mean-field potentials involves the 
solution of a characteristic equation for the roots of a secular determinant. The 
eigenfunctions which result from this diagonalization form an orthonormal set, 
the radial parts of which behave like the product of a polynomial and an 
exponential decay factor. The eigenvalues form the abscissae of a generalized 
quadrature over the complete set. Heller and Yamani (1974) have demonstrated 
that, for example, if we discretize the non-relativistic Schrodinger operator, the 
abscissae form an approximate Gauss-Chebychev quadrature scheme; in general, 
we form a Gaussian-type quadrature determined by the detailed form of the 
operator.
Orthogonal polynomial or Fourier series expansions of a general function are 
optimal representations in a mean (least-square) rather than pointwise sense. The 
rate of convergence of the expansion averaged over an operator and some 
arbitrary function is determined both by the nature of the operator and by 
whether the arbitrary function is well-represented in the finite-dimensional space 
of the expansion set (Yamani and Reinhardt, 1975). The Coulomb potential and 
the multipole expansion of the Hartree-Fock potential are rapidly convergent 
with respect to basis set size if we use S- or L-spinors, because these expansion 
sets are orthogonal with respect to integration over the operator 1/r, which is 
the asymptotic limit of both the Coulomb and Breit potentials. If some other 
numerical method, such as finite-differences or piecewise polynomials, were chosen 
as an expansion set then we would expect that a much larger basis would be 
necessary. Within this larger basis, however, the accuracy of an MBPT 
calculation would be similar to that which we have found in S- and L-spinor 
calculations of modest dimension, because all these approaches are forming 
generalized quadratures of the same type, depending only on the Dirac-Fock 
operator, for example, and not on the numerical method of discretization. This is 
consistent with the comments of Johnson et al (1988), who remark that one may 
safely exclude high energy discrete states from MBPT summations without 
changing significantly the value of numerical calculations: the large basis of 
primitive functions is necessary only to provide accurate low-energy quadrature 
points. In the current analytic finite basis set approach, this is equivalent to 
stating that the spatial integrand implicit in any MBPT diagram is well 
approximated in the mean by a low-order generalized polynomial in each radial 
coordinate and a fixed exponential decay factor.
6. Calculation of the Coulomb-Field Self-Energy Shift
If we follow directly the relativistic extension of Bethe’s calculation, replacing the 
low-frequency dipole interaction with retarded electromagnetic matrix elements, 
the strategy for the development of numerical methods is:
112

a) 
Develop methods for evaluating integrals of the type Jjk) and I^(k)
b) 
Construct perturbation sum at fixed k by summing over discrete states
c) 
Integrate over k in the range [0^>) taking account of principal values
d) 
Renormalize, either after or during b) and c).
In self-energy calculations, the matrix elements of Step (a) have kernels 
involving spherical Bessel functions. We have investigated both analytic and 
numerical methods in the evaluation of the L-spinor matrix elements of the 
retarded Breit interaction. The primitive integral

appears useful, because the Laguerre polynomials may, in principle, be expanded 
and integrated term-by-term using the above formula. The function 2Fi(a,b,c;z) 
is the Gauss hypergeometric function
2Fi(a5b,c;z) = F(a,b,c;z)
r (a)T(b) Li rfc+n) iiT 
l°-zJ
n=0
The argument of the hypergeometric function, z = w2/(a2+ td2), always lies in 
the range (0,1) and a quadratic transformation exists tor the above parameter 
values which further restricts the range to (0,1/2). All required hypergeometric 
functions in this analytic approach may be generated by the application of the 
Gauss contiguous relations (Abramowitz and Stegun, 1970), by which means any 
function F(atk, b±m, c±n; z) may be evaluated from two seed values which are 
known accurately from the series or continued fraction representation of the 
hypergeometric function, for integer values (k,m,n). This approach is not 
satisfactory for polynomials of higher degree than about 20, however, because the 
polynomial coefficients which arise from the product of two Laguerre polynomials 
are huge, resulting in the severe cancellation of terms and a significant loss of 
numerical accuracy. The integral [6.1] also arises in determining the expansion 
coefficients of a bound electron state in a basis of spherical wave states: this 
result is of use in an alternative approach to mass renormalization, discussed 
later. The generating function for Laguerre polynomials;
CD
(1 - 
= £ ijixjz",
n=0
[6-3]
has already been used to determine the L-spinor matrix elements involving 
simple operators ([5.35]-[5.36]), but becomes unwieldy when the integrand 
involves spherical Bessel functions. We have been unable to devise a reliable 
113

analytic approach to the evaluation of the radial integrals which form the matrix 
elements of the retarded Breit interaction, so that numerical methods were 
developed.
The photon parameter, k, is continuous on (0/o), and the partial wave expansion 
of the radiation field is formally exact. For large values of k, the spherical 
Bessel functions which we have used as an expansion basis for the photon field 
emphasize deficiencies in the finite L-spinor basis which represents the 
electron-positron field. For any fixed value of the basis dimension, it is always 
possible to find a value of the photon parameter, k, where the results are 
sensitive to the value of the L-spinor exponential parameter, A. The value of A 
defines an approximate scale of length; increasing A decreases the effective radius 
of the box in which the system has been quantized, and increases the magnitude 
of each of the single-particle energies in the discrete spectrum. The rapid 
oscillations in the continuous spectrum of spherical Bessel functions are lost in 
the slow oscillations of the discrete L-spinor basis, and the basis set method 
fails. This is not a failure peculiar to the L-spinor approach: it is to be expected 
also in the finite difference or piecewise polynomial approaches which differ only 
in the methods used to construct the discrete amplitudes: if a discrete basis is 
used for the electron-positron field, the representation of the photon field will 
eventually oscillate too rapidly in the fixed integration grid. It is not possible to 
demonstrate that the numerical results are independent of the choice of the 
arbitrary parameters which define any finite basis set representation of the 
spectrum, so that the method is unreliable for high-energy interactions.
The apparent failure of this approach is linked to previous comments regarding 
basis set expansions as representations in a mean sense. We may no longer 
expect the same behaviour that is encountered in electron correlation studies, 
because the magnitudes of matrix elements over the discrete basis set and highly 
oscillatory spherical Bessel functions do not fall off rapidly as we add more basis 
functions. The calculation is moderately sensitive to the basis set parameters, 
because the spherical Bessel functions and the orthogonal polynomial functions 
are oscillatory functions which have many nodes; resonances are encountered. Put 
another way, the spatial integrand of the second-order self-energy shift at fixed 
photon energy no longer resembles a low-order polynomial function weighted by 
an exponential decay factor; the spherical Bessel functions are not 
well-represented by a low-order polynomial over the effective range of numerical 
integration, except at very low photon energies.
The brute force scheme for assembling the computational pieces into a finite 
basis set QED scheme was unsuccessful. The lesson to be learned is that basis 
set approximations form representations in only in the mean and that they 
resemble quadrature schemes of Gaussian type. If the spatial operator resembles 
the multipole expansion of the Coulomb or Breit operators which are encountered 
in electron correlation studies we can expect the basis set scheme to be 
successful. When the spatial integrand is highly oscillatory, it seems that the 
pointwise deficiencies of the spectral expansion of the Green’s function are 
emphasized, and the observed rate of convergence of any calculation is poor: it is 
then meaningless to perform the subsequent integration over the photon 
parameter, k. On reflection, it was probably foolish to try to construct the 
integrand at fixed k in the first place; a more sensible approach in view of 
previous experience with basis set expansions is to construct an effective spatial 
operator, decomposed into multipole contributions, by first performing the 
principal value integration over k.
Consider, for simplicity, the unregulated operator:
BA="(r„rI;») = Jdk
0
[6.4]
114

Instead of working with radial matrix elements [5.23-5.24], the partial wave 
analysis which was performed earlier [5.12 - 5.22] may be used to define an 
integrated multipole contribution to the Breit-like operator:
^(rj,r2;E) = J ji/(r1w)jj/(r2w) dw 
0
[6.5]
The structure 1/(E 4- w) arises from the sum-over-states expressions, where the 
parameter E takes the form of an energy difference between states. Again for 
simplicity, we assume that E > 0, noting that in the general case we take the 
principal value of the integral. No analytic expression for the above integral is 
known and no stable recurrence relation for integrals of this type is known to 
exist. The integrand resembles that of the discontinuous Weber-Schafheitlin 
integral (Watson, 1944), and any scheme which we devise should recover known 
forms in the limit E 0.
The spherical Bessel functions of the First Kind, jn(z), may be transformed into 
spherical Bessel functions of the Third Kind (spherical Hankel functions), hi(z), 
using the identity
jn(z) = |[hA(z) + hj(z)]
[6.6]
The primary integral is rewritten as
In(rbr2;E) = lA(rbr2;E) + lS(rbr2;E)
where
[6-7]
U(rbr2;E) = | I hi(ijk)jn(r2k) dk.
[6-8]
0
This integral is analytic everywhere on the complex k-plane, except at isolated 
poles determined by the sign and magnitude of the real number E. In order to 
restrict the auxiliary integrals to finite values, only the case ri > 1% is 
considered; it is clear that the original integral is symmetric in ri and 12.
There seems to be no conventional notation for spherical Bessel functions of
11 5

imaginary argument. It is convenient to define "modified spherical Bessel 
functions", ln and Kn:
jn(by eiT/2) = in In+|(by) in ln(by) 
[6.9]
< arg(by) < r/2
hi(ay e1"/2) = i- g Kn+i(ay):= ^(ay) 
[6.10]
-t < arg(ay) < x/2
Let
fW = I hI[(rik)jn(r2k)
[6.11]
For fx(k), we deform the contour of integration along the positive imaginary axis 
to some value of large magnitude and complete the contour by a quarter circle 
connecting the positive imaginary and real axes. For f2(k), the contour is 
deformed along the negative imaginary axis and completed by a quarter circle to 
large positive real values of k. It may be shown that the contribution from 
either arc vanishes as its radius is taken to infinity, so that only the integrals 
along the positive and negative segments of the imaginary axis need be 
calculated:
Jfn(k)dk = zj'f A(ye17r/2)dy

are related as a complex conjugate pair. Combining the integrals and eliminating 
all parts related as complex conjugates:

Consider the limit E -• 0 of the integral In(ri,r2;E). Many integrals for small 
absolute values of E are required in a self-energy calculation, because the scale 
of E is chosen such that E = 1 corresponds to the rest-mass energy of a free 
electron. Small values of E correspond to sums over low-lying bound and 
continuum states, and E > 2 corresponds to negative- energy terms in the 
second-order perturbation sum formula. Expanding the function w/(E+w), we

using an obvious notation for the lesser and greater of the pair {rbr2}. In the 
limit of small energy differences between single-particle states, we recover a 
structure which is familiar from atomic structure studies based on the Gaunt and 
low-frequency Breit operators. Unfortunately, the expansion which was made in 
powers of (E/cj) may not be used as a computational scheme for evaluating 
these radiative integrals, because the Weber-Schafheitlin integrals which appear 
in the series are divergent for inverse powers (E/u;)k whenever Re(2/z-k+l) < 0.
The deformation of the contour of integration along the imaginary axis allows us 
to define an effective potential for QED calculations which is similar to the 
low-frequency Breit interaction used in atomic structure theory, but which is 
valid for all single-particle energy differences, including those corresponding to 
virtual pair-creation. Since the resulting operator is very similar to the Breit 
operator, we now expect that the accuracy which is attainable using basis set 
methods to represent the intermediate electron states will be similar to that 
found in electron correlation studies. We have not eliminated the divergence 
problems, but rather transformed the divergent self-energy integral into a 
divergent partial wave expansion; each partial wave component is, however, 
finite. In order for the scheme to be successful, renormalization at the partial 
wave level is highly desirable, since we have abandoned the regulator and the 
known analytic divergences of the free-particle self-energy. The compact analytic 
expansion of the low-frequency Breit operator as a sum of products functions in 
the variables ri and r2 has been replaced by a two-dimensional tabular function 
of the radial coordinates for each value of E, together with analytic expressions 
for the angular matrix elements. The integral which defines the radial multipole 
components of the effective potential , In(ri,r2;E), may be readily evaluated using 
Gauss-Rational quadrature for any value of E, although special care is required 
around the limit E -♦ 0. For small values of E in the range [0,0.1], a 
combination of algebraic expansions and Newton-Cotes integration formulae 
makes possible the evaluation of the potential function over the entire energy 
range.
The expectation value of each partial wave contribution to the self-energy 
operator is finite if the regulated interaction is adopted, involving only 
perturbation sums over the matrix elements of non-singular bounded operators. 
The unrenormalized Coulomb field self-energy shift takes the form of a divergent 
partial wave expansion. We now outline a complete finite basis set calculation of 
the self-energy shift of a bound electron in a state labelled |^a>- 
Renormalization is achieved by adapting the non-covariant prescription of French 
and Weisskopf (1949) to the spherical wave expansion of the radiation field. The 
unrenormalized part of the relativistic self-energy shift is, from equation [5.2]:

free particle systems, respectively. In order to renormalize the mass of the bound 
state we expand | $%> in the complete basis of spherical wave free-particle 
states; the expansion is naturally restricted to free-particle states of the same 
symmetry-type as the bound state.

We subtract from the radiative shift of the bound state [6.21] the corresponding 
self-energy shift of each free-particle component of the bound state, because we 
define the self-energy shift of a free-electron to be identically equal to zero. 
Following French and Weisskopf (1949), the mass renormalization counterterm is
+ 
4(ri)4(r2)F(r1,r2;Ero-Ep)pm(ri)pp(r2)<pp|^a>
p in
4(ri)4(r2)F(ri,r2;Ep-Em)^m(ri)(0p(r2)<^p|^a>
p in
[6.26]
The index p runs over the complete set, but the sum over m excludes p, and is 
further restricted by the different formulae for positive- and negative-energy 
intermediate states. This prescription ensures that the identity of free electrons 
and positrons is preserved throughout the calculation. We call this physically 
motivated approach the Kramer’s renormalization prescription, to distinguish it 
from the covariant renormalization prescription embodied in the Feynman integral
119

cutoff technique. The observable shift, ASa, calculated using finite basis set 
representations of the external field and free-particle states is:
ASa - AEa — AMa.
[6.27]
This general prescription is now developed into a computational algorithm, 
suitable for the finite basis set technique. In practice, the subtractions implied in 
[6.27] may be matched, so that free-field contribution from the intermediate 
state labelled m renormalizes the contribution from the external-field state with 
the corresponding label, m, in order to minimize errors from truncation of the 
spectrum. It is assumed, for convenience, that the free- and external-field basis 
set representations have the same dimension.
Starting with the tensor decomposition of the M011er interaction matrix element 
[5.16], we define the auxiliary amplitude functions:

For the sake of clarity I will consider only the positive-energy sum over external 
field states implied by, [6.27]; the remaining terms are obtained by changing 
index labels. The integrations in [6.21] over the angular coordinates are 
performed analytically using the results summarized in equation [5.26]. A 
two-dimensional numerical integration over the radial coordinates rj and r2 is 
required, which can be carried out using the techniques developed for the 
GRASP package. The integrand is symmetric in the radial coordinates and has a 
discontinuous derivative along ri = r2. The numerical behaviour of the integrand 
is modified by the use of a finite photon regulator, and may be a useful 
numerical device if sufficiently large values of the regulator, A, may be used and 
if the limit A -> ® of the renormalized and regulated interaction may be found.

[6.31]
The sum over includes all symmetry-types, = {±1,±2,...}. There are three 
similar terms, Ta2, Ta3 and Ta4, which are calculated in addition to [6.31]. The 
terms are combined according to [6.27] so that only renormalized amplitudes 
appear in the final two-dimensional kernel. One of the remaining terms, Ta2, 
corresponds to the negative-energy external field summation in [6.21], and the 
remaining two terms arise from the positive- and negative-energy renormalization 
counterterms in [6.26]. We need calculate only a single, two-dimensional integral 
over a renormalized kernel to determine the observable shift, but in practice it is 
probably preferable to monitor the convergence of the series by performing an 
integration for each value of the symmetry label, fy.
As yet I am unable to provide numerical evidence that the resulting series in 
the parameter converges, but preliminary tests are encouraging and programs 
have been developed to evaluate the integrands of [6.21] and [6.26] within an 
L-spinor basis. I have also been made aware that a similar approach to the 
self-energy problem is under development at Goteborg using numerical basis 
functions (Lindgren, private communications, 1990). Although the techniques 
described in this report represent a formal step backwards to the non-covariant 
perturbation theory of Kroll and Lamb (1949) and French and Weisskopf (1949), 
the correct results obtained in those early calculations suggests that it is worth 
persevering, because the approach seems to be directly applicable to the 
numerical calculation of self-energy shifts in non-Coulomb fields. The elegant 
covariant techniques are well-suited to purely algebraic manipulations of QED 
corrections using well-known integral identities. Similar techniques have been 
used, with some difficulty, in the Coulomb-field problem, but this is possible 
only because the an exact representation of the Dirac-Coulomb electron 
propagator is available, enabling contour integration techniques to simplify the 
calculation. One approach for many-electron atoms is to expand a mean-field 
propagator in a Dirac-Coulomb basis, since the self-energy shift is dominated by 
the bare-nuclear charge and many of the analytic tools required for the 
Coulomb-field problem can be retained. If, on the other hand, QED calculations 
using the finite basis set approximation can be devised to give results in 
agreement with the covariant calculations of Mohr and others, then we will have 
a scheme in which single-particle, many-body and quantum electrodynamic 
effects in atoms may be calculated within a unified computational framework. It 
is this goal which remains the motivation for the current project, which aims to 
study quantum electrodynamical interactions in many-electron atoms and ions.

RELATIVISTIC CALCULATIONS OF ELECTRON IMPACT IONISATION
CROSS-SECTIONS OF HIGHLY CHARGED IONS

THEORY
In this paper we report calculations of electron-impact ionisation 
cross sections of highly charged positive ions, using a fully relativistic 
distorted wave method. In the processes we consider, a target N-electron 
ion interacts with an incident electron to give a (N-l)-electron ionised 
ion plus an ejected and a scattered electron. A relativistic expression 
for the cross section for this process has been given by Pindzola et al. 
(1) One starts from lowest-order QED theory, including the two Feynman 
diagrams depicted in figure 1, representing direct and exchange 
ionisation. The double line represents a bound orbital of the target ion, 
while the continuum electrons are represented by single lines. Let the 
subscripts b, i, e and f signify the bound, incident, ejected and 
scattered electrons respectively. Using standard notation, (2) the 
ionisation amplitude may be expressed as
S = -i 8( t +£.-£- £ ) M,

where 
M =Md - Mx,

In (3) and (4), is the electron energy minus the rest energy, the 
^(x)are Dirac bispinors and theYu are 4x4 matrices. The Lorentz gauge 
has been chosen for the photon propagator and integration over time and 
momentum transfer has been carried out. In this work we assume a MCDF 
approximation (3) to describe both the target and ionised ion 
structure, and run the GRASP <4) package to obtain the bound orbitals. 
The wave functions for the target ion (ionised ion) are taken to be a 
superposition of configurations <Xm (^n) with mixing coefficients Cm 
(dn). The continuum waves are taken to be in the form of relativistic 
partial wave expansions in which the radial functions satisfy the Dirac

of hydrogenic ions. The quantity I2cr, where I is the ionisation 
energy, varies slowly with the nuclear charge Z and is plotted for 
26 Y Z >/ 92 against X, the incident energy divided by the ionisation 
energy. The curves are labelled by the value of the nuclear charge. 
The curve marked NR is a non-relativistic calculation, ignoring 
screening, which is independent of Z. Figure 2 clearly illustrates 
the increasing importance of relativity as both Z and the incident 
energy are increased. The effect is progressively less marked for 2s 
ionisation (figures 3) and 3s ionisation (figure 4). The results shown 
in figures 2—4 do not include magnetic or retardation effects: only 
the Coulomb part of the interaction was retained. The effects of 
including these relativistic corrections to the electron-electron 
interaction are shown in figure 5, which shows a comparison between no­
exchange results with and without them, for Is ionisation, 47 >z Z >92, 
For each ion, the curves tend to diverge from each other when the 
incident energy exceeds about 250 kev. For H-like 0, Z = 92, the cross 
section has been measured <6) at an incident electron energy of 222 
kev, which corresponds to X=1.7. The experimental cross section is a 
factor of about 3.5 times higher than theory. A similar comparison for 
He-like U gives a result a factor of 5 higher. The reasons for these 
discrepancies is not understood. It is unlikely that the calculations 
are in error by this amount.

As an example of a multi-configuration case, we consider the 
transitions
2p53s (J = 1) -> 2p43s (J - 1/2)
in Ne-like Xe (Z = 54)
The initial state is taken to be an admixture of the two configurations 
(1) 
2p"2 2p3 3s and (2) 2p 2p4 3s, each outside a closed shell Core
Is2 2s2. The final state is an admixture of (3) 2p2 2p2 3s (4) 2p 2p3 
3s and (5) 2p4 3s.
Here 2p represents 2p (j=l/2) and 2p represents 2p(j=3/2).
The cross sections for two different values of the incident energy are 
shown in table 1. The transitions (1) —> (5) and (2) —> (3) have small 
cross sections since they involve double electron jumps and are only 
possible through configuration interaction.
It is hoped to extend these calculations to the case of electron impact 
excitation in future work.

Abstract
The new relativistic perturbation approach for the Dirac equation, which does not 
suffer from divergences in any order, is presented. The corresponding double 
perturbation theory, where the second perturbation is an additional potential, is 
applied to the potential curve of H2+. Relativistic changes of bond length and force 
constant are calculated and discussed. The equivalence of different paradoxical 
calculation- and explanation-schemes are numerically verified with high accuracy. 
Au2 is also discussed using, however, finite double perturbation theory within the 
effective core potential approach. Finally the small relativistic bond angle changes, as 
compared to the large bond length changes, are explained.
1. Introduction
In order to systematize, rationalize and finally understand the mass of experimental 
and theoretical data on matter, a hierarchy of simplifying models is needed. Concern­
ing the basic chemical data such as energies, geometries and interatomic forces in 
molecules and crystals, the nonrelativistic Schrodinger—Coulomb and the relativistic 
Projected-Dirac-Breit Hamiltonians within the framework of the Born-Oppenheimer 
approximation are useful starting points.
The differences between the rather well understood nonrelativistic model, and the 
more realistic relativistic model, are most clearly revealed with the help of 
perturbation theory. Traditionally, the Schrodinger model is used as the unperturbed 
equation in one component form. As is well known (compare e.g. the review by 
Kutzelnigg 1989), the transition from the four—component Dirac model to the one (or 
two) component Schrodinger (or Pauli, resp.) model is severely hampered by 
singularities, irrespective of whether ^the elimination or the transformation method is 
applied (Moss 1970). There, the physical constant a — c-1 -*  0 is used as perturbation 
parameter, although the relativistic Hamiltonian contains terms of order c and c2, and 
although the wavefunction is nonanalytic in c’1.
Therefore, one of us (Rutkowski 1986) has recently developed a new perturbation 
approach within a completely four-component framework, which is free from 
singularities and divergences. The essentials of this approach are described in sec. 2.

The above mentioned basic chemical parameters are defined by derivatives of the 
energy with respect to the nuclear positions. Relativistic changes of structural para­
meters and force constants are therefore given by double perturbation energies, where 
the first perturbation is relativity (p) and the second one is nuclear displacement (D). 
The corresponding double perturbation energy expressions are presented and discussed 
in sec. 3.
The so-called double perturbation interchange relations are of fundamental impor­
tance concerning the interpretation of relativistic changes of chemical parameters. The 
present approach is applied with high accuracy to the smallest molecular system, H2+, 
in sec. 4. The numerical equivalence and physical meaning of the complementary 
schemes is substantiated.
In the case of heavy molecules with very many electrons, ab initio approaches 
become unwieldy, and pseudopotential valence-only approaches are more recommend­
able. The interchange relation, and the equivalence of different paradoxical expla­
nations of the relativistic bond length contraction are verified for the Au2 molecule by 
a finite perturbation pseudopotential approach in sec. 5.
Bending force constants of molecular angles are typically an order of magnitude 
weaker than the stretching force constants of bond lengths. Nevertheless, and although 
the angular behavior of relativistic atomic orbitals is strongly influenced by spin-orbit 
coupling, relativistic bond angle changes are in general negligibly small, whereas 
relativistic bond length changes are of the order of (T^/c)2 (Pyykkd 1988). This emp­
irical paradoxon is rationalized within the relativistic Huckel approximation in sec. 6.
Our conclusions are presented in sec. 7.
2. Nonsingular Relativistic Pertubation Theory
We write the Dirac equation for a single electron or positron in an external field 
(V,A) in the following form:
(2.1) 
[mc2]^ = [/3(-h-(j — eV) -I- 7(cp — eA)]^ 
where v is the frequency factor, is a four-component spinor, and and 7 read in the 
standard representation as
(2.2) 
= [J2 ?2] = 
= D2 n2] - [a2?2] , T=f°2-n]
v 7 M [O2 — I2J 
1O2 O2J 1^2 I2J 
O2J
with the index 2 indicating 2x2-matrices. The energy of the electron or positron is 
given by
(2.3) 
E = me2 + e = + -h-tj or — -h-w ,
respectively. In order to allow for a nonproblematic transition between the relativistic 
and nonrelativistic models, also the nonrelativistic Schrodinger equation is written in 
four-component form (Levy-Leblond 1967). In the case of electrons it reads (compare 
eq. 2.1)
(2.4) 
[mc2]^0 = [/ftnc2 4- /3°(€° - eV) + 7(cp - eA)]4/°
The superscript 0 indicates the nonrelativistic model, 6° and are the nonrelativistic 
reduced energy and the nonrelativistic Dirac spinor. Its upper two components $$ are 
136

just the Schrodinger-Pauli nonrelativistic functions for a and spin, and the two 
lower components are given by ’I>9=(<7p/2mc)4'2. The difference between eqs. (2.1,2.4),
(2.5) 
AH = ^(e-eV) ,
is the nonpathological operator of relativistic corrections for electrons.
Introducing the relativistic pertubation parameter p with p=0 for the nonrelati­
vistic case and p=l for the relativistic case, eqs. (2.1) and (2.4) may be combined. (In 
later sections, p will denote the electron density, however.) In appropriate (2x2)—block 
form, the unified eq. reads
(2-6)
AeV

a(cp-eA) 2mc2+p(e^—eV)
—\])P
= 0
Contrary to the traditional approaches, relativistic, nonrelativistic and perturbation 
operators act here on the same Hilbert space.
Expanding 4' and € in a power series of p, we define the perturbation approach. It 
differs somewhat from the conventional Rayleigh-Schrodinger approach because of the 
peculiar appearance of e in the perturbation AH, eq. (2.5). The system of perturbation 
equations for the one-electron case was given by Rutkowski (1986a). By the standard 
procedure of perturbation theory, matrix elements of different perturbed functions can 
be substituted by each other, so that only the m'th order function = (<P®, 'I'®) is 
needed to determine the (2m+l)-st order energy. We here display just the first three 
relativistic perturbation energies for the common case of vanishing A
(2.7) 
ei = <$°|eV-c°|^> = <$°|op(V-f°)ap|^°>/4c2

=^.c-6
In the most serious case of a singular point-charge Coulomb potential, behaves 
as rs.e , and the perturbation functions behave as (Inr)1.^ near the singularity. 
Therefore all integrals remain finite. Especially we note that only overlap and simple 
potential integrals are needed, and that no high-order derivatives such as p2i appear in 
the present approach. Still, it must be admitted that the higher order perturbation 
functions need extended basis sets because of the weak logarithmic singularity, what is 
less desirable in numerical variation-perturbation calculations (Rutkowski 1986b). 
Finally we note that the e1 are exactly i! times the i’th Taylor coefficient of the power 
expansion of the relativistic energy in terms of c-2. So this perturbation approach 
converges provided the Taylor-expansion of the exact relativistic energy converges.
Finally we mention that the first order perturbation Hamiltonian in eq. (2.7) may 
be split up into
(2.10) 
op(eV-e°)ap = p(eV-e°)p + 4c2.hso = [T,eV-6°]+ + (T -V) + VVxp.a 
where the first, second and third terms on the rhs., respectively, are the mass-velocity, 
Darwin and spin-orbit terms of the conventional Pauli Hamiltonian. These terms have 
the well-known singularities at the origin of Coulomb potentials, which cancel each 
other if treated correctly.

3. 
Double Perturbation Theory
Rutkowski (1986c) and Jankowski and Rutkowski (1987) have generalized the 
one-electron approach to many-electron systems. The electron interaction was treated 
as a second perturbation. Quite successfull numerical applications to many-electron 
atoms have been published recently (Jankowski and Rutkowski 1989). Up to second 
order, relativistic and correlation effects are additive in this approach, except for the 
Breit correction.
This approach has now been extended to a general perturbing potential (Rutkowski 
and Schwarz 1990) where the potential is expanded in a power series of the parameter 
D. Examples are homogeneous external electric or magnetic fields, or changes of the 
electron—nuclear interaction due to changes of the form or of the position of the nuclei. 
Expanding the energy as
(3.1) 
E = Sr p /.Dp.Erp
the perturbation energies Erp of relativistic order r and potential order p can be 
symbolically written as
(3.2) 
E10 = <00|10|00>
20
(3.3) 
E = <00120100> + <10110100>
(3.4)

or
= <00111100> + 2<01110100>

or
+ 2{<02110110> + <02120100>}
138

The perturbation energies with inverted indices have the same symbolic form. | rp> 
is the perturbation function of r-th order in relativity and of p—th order in the 
potential. |ij| is a perturbation operator of orders i and j, respectively. The explicit 
forms are somewhat involved; they contain terms of lower order operators and lower 
order perturbation energies, multiplied by projection operators /V onto the lower 
components of the many-electron wavefunction. For details see Jankowski and 
Rutkowski (1987,1989), and Rutkowski and Schwarz (1990).
We now comment on the different perturbation energies. The first order energies 
consist of a single symbolic term. According to eq. (2.10) the relativistic first order 
energy contains p(V-E)p and the conventional spin-orbit term hso. For many electron 
systems, also two—electron terms such as hsoo, hss etc. appear, also terms of the type 
(Vi+Tj)Tj, but no terms of the type TjTi=pi4/4m2. That is, sums of the 
velocity-mass and Darwin terms are replaced by more well-behaved expressions. 
Similarly, no divergent expressions appear in higher orders.
The second order energies E20, E11, E02 consist of two terms. The original 
expression for the mixed perturbation energy,
(3.10) 
e" = <00111100> + <10101100> + <01110100>
where both first order functions |10> and |01> appear, can be simplified with the 
help of the double perturbation relation (Dalgarno and Stewart 1956)
(3.11) 
<10|01100> = <01110j00> ;
see the two different alternative forms presented in eq. (3.4).
The third order energies at least need the first order functions: E30 needs 110>, and 
there are three terms (see eq. 3.5); E21 (and E12) at least needs both 110> and |01> 
and consists of 5 terms (see eq. 3.6). The original expression for E21 (containing also 
the second order functions |20> and |11>) consists of 5 terms, too. In general there 
are rp+r+p terms for ErP. Thus, in order to "understand" the values of these pertur­
bation energies in a physical manner, one must at first develop an intuitive under­
standing of the sign and magnitude of these different terms. This will turn out not too 
difficult. However, one must also intuitively understand the sign and order of 
magnitude of the corresponding sum of terms. In how far a physical understanding of 
the numerical values of the total perturbation energies is achievable, will be discussed 
in the subsequent sections.
4. Relativistic Changes of Molecular Geometries. The Bond Length of
In the following, A shall always denote relativistic-nonrelativistic differences. For 
instance
(4.1) 
At = e - e°
is the relativistic correction to the energy.
The equilibrium geometry De of a molecule is defined by (dE/dD)p =0, where D 
are the internuclear geometric parameters like bond lengths or bond angles. From eq. 
(3.1) we obtain for the relativistic (p=l) equilibrium position
(4.2) 
£p=1 [p.DP-1.(Sr=0ErP)] =0.
139

Defining the nonrelativistic equilibrium geometry as = 0 so that E01 = 0, one 
obtains for the relativistic De the following recursion relation
(4-3)
ADe - De - - [Sr=1 Erl] / [Sp=2 p.DP 2 (Er=(, ErP)]
which yields
(4.4) -2.ADe = (EH/E02) + (E02E2i-EHEi2+3/4-(Ei1)2E03/E02)/(E02)2 + O(c’6) 
(4.4a) -2.ADe « 2E^_q/ k
where E^_q is the slope of the relativistic energy curve at the nonrelativistic 
equilibrium position, while the slope of the nonrelativistic curve vanishes at that point, 
(E°)q_q = 0. k is the relativistic force constant, k = d2E/dD2, and 
k = (kD=0 + kDe)/2'
For stable molecules, k>0. Therefore, the sign of ADe, i.e. whether there is 
relativistic bond length (or bond angle) increase or decrease, is determined by E’, i.e. 
to lowest relativistic order by E11.
4.1 First contribution to ADe
According to eq. (3.4), E11 consists of two terms. The first contribution is
(4.5) EU(1) = <00111100> = <^|op(5V/3D)op|^>/4c2
i.e. the expectation value of the geometric change d/dD of the relativistic correction 
operator apVap/4c2, i.e. <3hS0/5D> + <p|5V/$D|p>. For a cr-bond, the spin-orbit 
coupling is often rather unimportant, as in the present case of a s-s bond. 
<p^_o |p$o_> is the local kinetic energy density, which is positive everywhere; for a 
bonding orbital it is very small between the nuclei, so it mainly weights the region 
behind the nuclei. 9V/5D is positive between the nuclei and negative behind them. 
Consequently, En(l) is negative or bond expanding.
Another chain of reasoning is the following: the analogue of the present term 
op(V—E00)op in the conventional Pauli approach is hmv + hd + hso. The mass—velocity 
term hmv~p4 does not contribute because <?(hmv)/dD = 0. As already mentioned, the 
spin—orbit interaction is not important in the underlying case. The Darwin—term hd is 
strongly localized at the Coulomb singularities of the nuclei, and d(hd)/#D measures 
the change of slope of the density on the nuclei between the bond and the back side:
(4-6) 
Ztt/8 (|p^ondl - IPbackl) ■
Since the slope is steep on the back side and small on the bond side of the nuclei for a 
bonding a orbital, we again arrive at the conclusion, that En(l) should be negative. 
Indeed, for the IV molecule, very accurate calculations (Rutkowski and Schwarz 1990) 
yield
n 
2
(4.7) 
E (1) = - 0.09225 a
140

4.2 Second contribution to ADe
For the second contribution to E11, there exist, as mentioned above, two alternative 
expressions. The one is
(4.8) EU(2a) = 2<10|01|00> = 2<’f_J_°| dV/dD |^°>/4c2
= jphf.zVp.dv3
If
3V/3D = Fni is the electrostatic Hellmann-Feyman Coulomb force, which acts on the 
relativistic first order change of the electron density, 2$|°^$0/4c2 = Arp.
Covalent bonds are usually due to overlapping, partially occupied s- and p-type 
atomic valence orbitals. In general, these are relativistically contracted (Rose et al. 
1978, Schwarz et al. 1989). So we may assume with some justification that the 
corresponding bonding molecuar orbitals are relativistically contracted, too. 
Consequently En(2) should be positive and bond-contracting (Schwarz 1988). An 
accurate calculation on IV yields
11, x 
2
(4.9) 
E (2a) = + 0.16402 a
So we may say: the a—bond in H2+ is shortened relativistically, because the 
bond—contracting Hellmann-Feynman force, resulting from the nonrelativistic 
Coulomb interaction between the nuclei and the relativistically contracted valence 
electron charge cloud is more important than the relativistic Darwin reduction of the 
interaction between the nuclei and the nonrelativistic charge distribution in the spatial 
vicinity of the nuclei.
A completely different explanation of the relativistic bond contraction can be based 
on the alternative expression
(4.10) 
EU(2b) = 2<01110100> = 2<^/1 ap(V-E°°)ap/4c2- EW | ^°>
- j[«rpVop/4c2- E°°.p2/4c2- E10].dp°°/dD.dv3
The terms in the brackets under the integral represent the relativistic first order 
perturbation, 1101, which acts on the nonrelativistic change of electronic density with 
bond length, dp^/db = 2^$i^oo.
The relativistic perturbation is energy lowering in the vicinity of the nuclei (see 
Schwarz et al. 1989). Concerning dp/3D, we should distinguish between two cases, 
hydrogen atoms without occupied core shells, and "normal" atoms with occupied cores. 
In the case of hydrogen, the density around the nucleus increases significantly upon 
bond formation (Kutzelnigg and Schwarz 1982). In the case of "normal" atoms, the 
Pauli principle, or alternatively the orthogonality constraint of orbitals, results in an 
overall keeping the valence electrons of atom A out of the core volume of atom B. But 
the orthogonality constraint results nevertheless in some local density increases, 
especially in the nuclear vicinity. Consequently En(2b) is expected to be positive.
Again we may also use the Pauli form of the perturbation operator for an alterna­
tive reasoning. The most important term in the underlying case is the mass—velocity 
operator, hmv = -T2/2c2. In the case of bonded hydrogen atoms, electronic density and 
curvature of wavefunction are in general strongly increased near the nuclei, so that 
En(2b) should be positive and bond contracting. In the case of bigger atoms with 
occupied core shells, the overlap of an atomic valence shell with the occupied core of an 
adjacent atom leads to the so-called Pauli repulsion. This happens because of the 
(nonrelativistic) kinetic energy increase accompanying the increase of curvature which 
141

is caused by orthogonalization of the valence orbital on the adjacent core. Relativity 
(hmv) will therefore cause a reduction of the Pauli repulsion. Those parts of space 
contribute most to this relativistic bond contraction where T is large, and where 
—T2/2c2 is most important. It is interesting to note that (within the framework of low 
order perturbation theory) the relativistic bond contraction originates in the very tails 
of the valence orbitals near the nuclei, while the outer core shells contribute much to 
the nonrelativistic Pauli repulsion. So we arrive at a slightly different rationalization 
than Pyykkb et al. (1981).
The accurate evaluation E11(2b) yields
(4.11) 
EH(2b) = + 0.16397 ft2
which differs by only 5.10’5.a2 from the result (4.9). Here we may say: the a—bond in 
H2+ is shortened relativistically, because the bond-contracting action of the relativistic 
correction of the Hamilton on the increased nonrelativistic electronic charge density 
near the nuclei (an increase which happens in most cases, when a—bonds are formed) is 
more important than the bond expanding action of 5(AH)/<?D on the unperturbed 
density.
4.3 Furt 
her remarks on relativistic changes of bond lengths
Summarizing, if we denote relativistic changes by A and bond length changes by 6,
we may write
(4-12)
EH = j{ ^(AH).p + (AH).fy>}.dv3 = ^AH.p.dv3
or
(4-13)
En = j{ A(<5H).p + (£H).Ap}.dv3 = Ajffi.p.dv3
with
AH = Hrel — Hnrel, Ap = /el-pnrel
(4-14)
<5H = 5H/3D 
, Sp = dp/dD
Thus, relativistic bond length changes may be either rationalized as the variation with 
bond length (6) of the expectation value of the relativistic perturbation hamiltonion , 
<5<AH|/?>, or alternatively as the relativistic correction (A) of the expectation value 
of the Hellmann—Feynman force, , A<flH|p>.
Concerning the next higher order terms in eq. (4.4), numerical calculations on Ha+ 
(where the small spin-orbit contribution to E21 has been neglected) yielded
21 ,„02 
2
E /E 
= -0.047 A
(4.15) 
- EnE12/(E°2)2 
=+1.216 A2
0.75(E12)2E03/(E02)3 = - 1.237 A2.
As a rule of thumb, relativistic effects in the valence shell of heavy atoms scale with 
A = (Zn)2 (Schwarz 1990, Pyykb 1988), where Z is the unscreened nuclear charge. 
Accordingly, we expect significant contributions to ADe from E12 and E03, i.e. from the 
relativistic and the bond length changes of the force constant, Ak and anharmonicity, 
respectively. We note that Ak of many heavy molecules is not just a small correction, 
but is a drastic change. For instance, Schwerdtfeger et al. (1989) found for Au2 at the
142

SCF level k° = 0.57, k™1 = 1.37 N/cm and Ak/k = 1.74 A2 (the values are increased 
by electron correlation, the experimental value being k = 2.11 N/cm).
5. Relativistic Bond Length Changes in the Effective Core Potential Approach. Au»
Using an effective Hamiltonian means that both the operators and the 
wavefunctions have been subject to some transformation. Accordingly, physically 
meaningful quantities like E11 should remain invariant, whereas different contributions 
to it need not be invariant individually. In the pseudopotential or effective core 
potential approaches, for instance, the ab initio relativistic correction operator mainly 
acting in the vicinity of nuclei is simulated by a centrosymmetric potential for each 
atom which is attractive in the outer-core/inner—valence-shell region. Consequently 
H11 will be dominantly positive in this region where we have, in general, electronic 
density accumulation for a-bonded systems. Therefore, the first term in eq. (3.4) will 
no longer be negative as in the ab initio approach, but will be significantly positive, 
while the second term will be significantly smaller in magnitude than its ab initio 
counterpart.
In order to present a numerical example, we have performed accurate 
pseudopotential calculations on Aua at the relativistic CI level. The Au atom is treated 
as a one-electron system with 78 electrons in the polarizable core. The parameters for 
the effective potential of the core including relaxation and Pauli repulsion were taken 
from Preuss et al. (1990). The different perturbation energies were calculated by the 
finite perturbation method at different internuclear distances at the relativistic and 
nonrelativistic levels. We obtained
(5-1)
’ E 1« 0.018 a.u.
11 x
E (1)
= + 0.018 '
EU(2a) = + 0.001
EU(2b) = + 0.000 ,
First, En(2a) and En(2b) are approximately equal. Second, the numerical results 
corroborate our intuitive expectations concerning the sign and relative magnitudes of 
the En-terms. Third, these results refute the reservations of Christiansen and Ermler 
(1985) against the double perturbation scheme.
Our calculated relativistic bond length contraction for Au2 is —.31X the breakup of 
which into contributions is shown in the following table:

In Christiansen and Ermler’s effective core approach, Au is treated as an 
eleven-electron system with 68 electrons in a frozen core. We note that different 
effective core potential approaches yield quite different individual contributions, but 
rather similar results for the final values of E11 or ADe.

6. Relativistic Changes of Bond Angles
Nonrelativistic p—AOs are triply degenerate. Those linear combinations which are 
orthogonal in Hilbert space, and which allow for maximum overlap with neighbouring 
atoms, are the px, py, pz ones. They are orthogonal in real space. Consequently atoms 
from the right side of the periodic system, which form pa-bonds, tend to form 90° 
bond angles.
Spin-orbit coupling breaks the orbital degeneracy. p3/g spinors have less 
pronounced directional properties, their quadrupole moments being only half as large 
as those of the px, Py, pz-AOs. The pl/2 spinor even has a spherically symmetric 
density. Therefore the question arises, whether spin-orbit coupling will modify the 
bond angles, which are comparatively soft with small bending force constants k(0). It is 
well known that spin-orbit coupling yields significantly weaker and longer bonds in 
many cases (Hafner et al. 1981, Schwarz 1990). Since bond lenghts D are in general 
stiffer than bond angles 0, with k(D) >> k(0), one may expect quite large relativistic 
bond angle changes A0.
The numerical findings in the literature (see the review by Pyykkb 1988) as well as 
unpublished results from this laboratory seem to indicate, however, that in most cases 
relativistic changes of bond angles are small, and in general smaller then 2° even for 
the heaviest molecules. Recently, Balasubramanian (1988) found a relativistic bond 
angle change of 10° for an excited triplet state of PbH2. However, we could not repro­
duce such a large value, our biggest A0 for excited states of PbH2 being smaller than 4° 
(Collignon 1989).

In order to better understand the low sensitivity of bond angles on relativity, 
especially on spin—orbit coupling, we will use a simple model of the 
LCAO-MO-Huckel-Walsh type for an ALj-molecule. We assume a minimal basis of 
S, Px, Py, Pz AOs on the central atom A, and a single a AO on each ligand L. The two 
most important parameters are 1) the resonance parameter K for the interaction 
between the s/p-AOs of A and the <r-AOs on L, and 2) the spin orbit coupling 
constant A of A. For more details see Collignon (1989).
Total energies with and without spin-orbit coupling as a function of the bond angle 
for systems with 4 to 8 valence electrons are shown in Fig. 1. The relativistic bond 
angle changes A# for 6- and 7-electron systems are plotted as a function of A/K in 
Fig. 2.
For small spin-orbit parameters the interaction is obviously quenched by the 
molecular field so that the bond angle change is only of second order in A. In a basis of 
real functions px, py, pz the matrix-elements of the spin-orbit operator are purely 
off-diagonal. There is no linear diagonal spin-dependent contribution. Except for 
nonrelativistic molecular orbital (near-) degeneracy, where first-order degenerate 
perturbation theory applies, A can appear in the energy only in the second order. If the 
total energy of the molecule is represented as a function of bond angle 0 and 
spin-orbital coupling A of the form, as obtained from nondegenerate second order 
pertubation theory,
(6.1) 
E = f(0) + g(0) • A2
we obtain for the change of bond angle with A

However, even for the heaviest atoms of the periodic systems, A is not much bigger 
than typical K values. In contrast, the bond length changes which are mainly due to 
the velocity-mass and Darwin, or pVp-terms, are a relativistic first order effect and 
are detectable already for much smaller relativistic corrections.
7. Summary and Conclusions
We have presented a relativistic pertubation approach which does not lead to 
singular terms even in higher orders. The corresponding double perturbation approach 
yields the energy coefficients for a description of relativistic changes of many properties 
of atoms and molecules. Second order energy coefficients consist of two terms, third 
order pure, and mixed, perturbation energies consist of 3, and 5 terms, respectively, 
and fourth order pure and mixed energies, resp., consist of 5 and 7-9 terms. For the 
m-th order energy, at least perturbation functions of the [m/2]-th order are needed. 
In general, there exist several different equivalent formulae.
145

Because of the increasing number of terms with increasing order, only second order 
effects seem to offer the possibility for an intuitive, direct understanding in basic 
physical terms. Relativistic changes of molecular structure belong to this class of 
effects. The relevant parameter is the second order mixed pertubation energy, first 
order in relativity and first order in the change of molecular structure.
The first contribution En(l) to this E11 is the expectation value of the relativistic 
correction to the Hellmann Feynman force operator for electron-nuclear interaction. In 
ab initio approaches this relativistic correction to the force is mainly due to the Darwin 
effect. In special cases, also the spin-orbit coupling may become important. Since the 
Darwin effect is destabilizing, it will in most cases lengthen the nonrelativistic bond 
distance. Since the Darwin opperator acts only at the nuclear positions (or in the 
vicinity of the nuclei, if the equivalent expression of the present approach is used) 
En(l), will be important for those bonding orbitals which have considerable density at 
the nuclei. Because of the core orthogonalization tails, this is the case for all a-bonds, 
irrespective of whether they originate from s, p, or d valence AOs.
In semiempirical or pseudopotential approaches, however, where one uses an 
effective or a model Hamiltonian (Durand and Malrieu 1987), the situation is quite 
different. Here the relativistic correction to the effective Hellmann—Feynman force 
between atomic cores and valence electrons is predominantly stabilizing and most 
important in the inner valence-shell region. Therefore the first contribution to E11 is 
positive and bond shortening. This is no contradiction to the ab initio result: only the 
physically relevant total value of E11 is uniquely defined, but not the individual formal 
contribution En(l).
The individual contributions En(l) and En(2) obtained using different effective 
core potential approaches do not only differ from their ab initio counterparts, but also 
differ from each other. The changes of specific values of En(2) are compensated by 
opposite changes of En(l), and the values of the total En-eorrection are (almost) inde­
pendent of the calculational approaches used.
The second formal contribution En(2) to relativistic changes of molecular structure 
can be represented by two equivalent, but very different expressions. Of course, both 
expressions must yield the same value, En(2a) = En(2b), and numerical calculations of 
sufficiently high accuracy are fully consistent with theory. In the present case, En(2a) 
describes the structural change as due to the nonrelativistic Coulomb- 
Hellmann-Feynman force acting on the relativistic modification of the molecular 
charge distribution. In many cases, both the atomic and molecular charge distributions 
contract relativistically. However, it is an unjustified oversimplification to assume that 
the relativistic molecular charge correctian is given by the sum of relativistic atomic 
charge corrections. Anyhow, in ab initio approaches En(2a) is strongly bond 
contractiong for many molecules. It overcompensates the bond expanding term En(l). 
In effective core approaches, on the other hand, En(2a) is smaller in value than En(l) 
and in general only modifies the bond contracting En(l)-term slightly.
The alternative is to consider En(2b), thereby relating the relativistic change of 
molecular structure to the relativistic energy correction due to the "bond charge", that 
is the change of electronic charge distribution accompanying the change of internuclear 
distances. It must be kept in mind that bonding does not only affect the "valence 
electronic charge distribution" in the outer spatial "valence region" but also in the 
"inner core region" near the nuclei. These small inner portions of the "bond charge" 
become decisive for operators which heavily weight the inner core regions. This is the 
case, for instance, for the nonrelativistic Hellmann-Feynman force (as demonstrated 
by Spackman and Maslen in 1985), and also for the ab initio form of the relativistic 
correction to the Hamiltionian. Since the stabilizing velocity—mass contribution domi­
nates over the destabilizing Darwin contribution, and because of the factor 2 in 
eqs.(3.4), En(2b) turns out to be bond-contracting in the majority of cases, and to 
overcompensate En(l). On the other hand, in the effective core potential framework, 
the relativistic correction of the Hamiltonian is energy lowering in the core/valence 
border region, where the bond density is already small. Consequently, in the latter 
frame work, En(2b) is small or even slightly negative, i.e. bond—expanding.
146

Summarizing, different theoretical and computational schemes lead to agreeing 
numerical results, and they lead to logically consistent and equivalent, but quite 
differently looking - even paradoxical, complementary ways of explanation in 
physically evident terms. Some care is needed, however, in order not to stumble into 
conceptual inconsistencies.
Our discussions have focussed upon changes of bond lengths. Although bond lengths 
are in general stiffer than bond angles, the latter ones are in general less sensitive to 
relativistic corrections. The qualitative explanation for this fact in the LCAO—MO 
framework is that in the standard real AO basis the spin-orbit matrix elements are 
angle dependent but off-diagonal, while the velocity-mass & Darwin matrix elements 
do not vanish on the diagonal and are in general more bond—length sensitive than 
bond—angle sensitive.

INTRODUCTION
The majority of relativistic electronic structure 
calculations on atoms and ions have been done using finite 
difference numerical methods (Desclaux, 1973; Grant et al., 
1980). They will remain important, especially in atomic 
calculations, because effective means have been devised for 
augmenting them to account for correlation effects by, viz., 
multiconfiguration expansion and many-body perturbation theory 
(MBPT) techniques.
Recently the basis set expansion Dirac-Fock (DF) self- 
consistent field (SCF) method has been developed sufficiently to 
approach numerical methods in accuracy (Quiney, Grant and 
Wilson, 1989a; Ishikawa et al., 1985, 1988; Goldman, 1989). The 
DF basis set expansion method provides a simple alternative to 
direct numerical approaches to atomic structure calculations, 
and it can be extended in a straightforward way to molecular 
calculations.
The following section outlines our research on the Gaussian 
basis set expansion DF method (Ishikawa and Quiney, 1987; 
Ishikawa and Sekino, 1988, 1990) for efficiently determining 
relativistic SCF wavefunctions. The final section outlines the 
relativistic MBPT method for improving DF wavefunctions to 
account for Coulomb correlation effects.
DIRAC-FOCK GAUSSIAN BASIS SET EXPANSION CALCULATIONS
Gaussian-type functions (GTF) are employed in most 
multicenter Hartree-Fock (HF) basis set expansion calculations 
for reasons of computational economy, and a number of efficient 
Gaussian integral evaluation packages are available. However, 
it is also well-known that the behavior of GTF near the origin 
is inappropriate to properly represent a cusp in the familiar 
point nucleus approximation. Consequently, an expansion in GTF, 
to represent that behavior, must employ a relatively large 
number of functions (Wilson, 1987).
The Effects of Relativity on Atoms, Molecules, and the Solid State 
Edited by S. Wilson et al., Plenum Press, New York, 1991

The use of GTF in DF SCF calculations (Malli, 1979) on 
atoms and molecules is likely to prove more difficult than in 
the nonrelativistic case if nuclei are modelled as particle 
points. The cusp at a point nucleus is infinite in relativistic 
wavefunctions. For heavy atoms and heavy-atom-containing 
molecules, the high nuclear charge creates a more pronounced 
cusp (Schwarz and Wallmeier, 1982). Therefore a number of GTF 
of high exponent must be included in a basis set to mimic, in 
the least-squares sense, the wavefunction near the origin 
(Ishikawa et al., 1985).
In the DF scheme, the behavior of an electron in a central 
field potential, V, is described by a radial DF equation of the 
form (Kim, 1967),
Hr 0nk(r) “ enk ^nk(r) 
where 
with 7T = -d/dr + k/r and ir+ = d/dr + k/r
(1)
(2)
Here
«nk(r)
pnk(r)
Qnk(rl
(3)
The radial functions Pnk(r) and Qnk(r) are referred to as the 
upper and lower components, respectively, c is the speed of 
1ight.
In calculations on sw states, P(r) is expanded in Is GTF, 
{xLi(r)) = (r exp(-ajr2)},
P(r)
? r exp (-air2) ^i
(4a)
where N is the number of GTF. In previous studies of hydrogenic 
systems, P(r)/r and Q(r)/r have been expanded in the same sets 
of from 1 to 14 Is GTF. With each expansion, the exact ls-j/2 
energy was obtained as a minimum (Ishikawa et al., 1985). such 
results are obviously spurious; a single GTF is a grossly 
incorrect form for the solution of either the Dirac or the 
Schrodinger equation.
A criterion of basis set "balance"
xsi(r) = 7Tk+ xLi(r) 
(4b)
has been proposed (Lee and McLean, 1982) to avoid spurious 
solutions as well as blatant "bounds failure." This "balance" 
criterion suggests that the lower component be expanded in
{xsi(r)) = {irk+ r exp(-a£r2)) = {r2 exp(-ajr2) },
Q(r) = S r2 exp(-a£r2) rji 
(5) 
150

where in equations (4a) and (4b), {%!} and {r^^} are linear 
variation parameters. The balanced GTF expansions, (4a) and 
(4b), have been used in the point nucleus approximation (Aerts 
and Nieuwpoort, 1985; Ishikawa et al., 1985).
With the point representation of the nucleus, both the 
exact P(r)/r and Q(r)/r have an infinite cusp at the origin. 
Variational solutions approximated by (4a) and (4b) fail to 
satisfy this condition because P(r)/r approximated by (4a) has a 
finite value and zero slope at the origin while Q(r)/r as 
represented by (4b) vanishes (Ishikawa and Quiney, 1987). 
Expansions (4a,b) therefore require some high exponent GTF to 
approximate the behavior of the exact wavefunction near the 
origin, and thereby to reproduce the relativistic kinematics. 
In calculations on P|/2 states, the intuitive choice for the 
expansion of P(r)/r is the 2p-radial GTF, {r exp(-a-[r2)},
P(r) = S r2 exp(-a£r2) 
(6a)
Q(r)/r is expanded in "extended11 kinetically balanced GTF (Aerts 
and Nieuwpoort, 1985), {exp(-a|r2) } and {r2 exp(-a-[r2) },
Q(r) = S r exp(-a-[r2) T]j_ + S r3 expf-a^r2) 
(6b)
If P(r) is expanded in N GTF, (6b) requires that Q(r) be 
expanded in 2N GTF. The balanced GTF expansion, (6a,b), has 
been used in atomic and molecular DF calculations in the point 
nucleus approximation (Aerts and Nieuwpoort, 1985). The 
variational solution approximated by (6a,b), however, fails to 
satisfy the infinite cusp condition. P(r)/r approximated by the 
expansion (6a) vanishes at the origin, whereas Q(r)/r 
represented by (6b) has a finite value and zero slope there 
(Ishikawa and Quiney, 1987).
The balanced basis expansions, (4a,b) and (6a,b), are well 
defined only as c approaches infinity (Ishikawa and Quiney, 
1987; Quiney, 1988) because they are derived from criterion (5), 
valid only in the limit. Recent work has focussed on choosing 
basis sets for upper and lower components of the wavefunction 
which are balanced in the sense that the relativistic 
wavefunction approaches the wavefunction obtained with the 
Schrodinger Hamiltonian as the speed of light approaches infinity 
(Lee and McLean, 1982; Mark and Schwarz, 1982 ; Dyall et al., 
1984; Aerts and Nieuwpoort, 1985; Stanton and Havriliak, 1984).
It is not necessarily true that the use of a basis set 
which is balanced in this sense must lead to a solution of the 
DF equations, nor that spurious solutions are precluded for 
finite c. The following example illustrates the point. In 
calculations on the ls^/2 state of the hydrogenic systems, use 
of a single Slater-type basis function of integer power, 
r exp(-?r)/ in the expansions of both the P(r) and Q(r) gives a 
balanced basis expansion, and produces the exact Is^/? energy as 
a minimum when £= Z/[l-(Z/c)2]i/2. Although the infinite cusp 
is absent, the variational solution is a reasonably accurate one 
for small nuclear charge, Z. However, the solution is an 
incorrect form for the wavefunction for the large Z case in 
which the infinite cusp is more pronounced (Ishikawa and Quiney, 
1987). This example illustrates how failing to impose correct 
boundary conditions on basis functions can lead to spurious 
solutions. Achieving the limiting energy alone is no guarantee
151

that the variational solution has converged to the true 
wavefunction. Attention must be given to satisfying the 
relativistic boundary conditions for finite c (Quiney, 1988; 
Ishikawa and Sekino, 1990).
Ishikawa et al. (1987, 1990) and Quiney (1988) have 
stressed that the criterion for basis set balance, (5), is well 
defined only as c approaches infinity; it can lead to a 
relationship between upper and lower component basis sets which 
need not produce the correct wavefunction at finite c. For an 
electron in an external field V, the radial upper and lower 
components of the Dirac four-spinor are related by
Q(r) = 
[2c2 - (V - €)]"1 c%k+ P(r) 
(7)
Basis set balance criterion (5) emerges from Eq. (7) as c -*  «, 
and thus is valid at the nonrelativistic limit; the wavefunction 
is not thereby constrained to satisfy the relativistic boundary 
when the speed of light is finite (Ishikawa and Quiney, 1987).
Ishikawa et al. (1987,1990) and Quiney (1988) have examined 
the implications which imposition of correct boundary conditions 
on DF solutions may have on basis set selection. With a point 
representation of the nucleus, basis sets of Slater- or 
Gaussian-type functions with integer power of r are not suitable 
for DF calculations because they are unable to satisfy the 
relativistic constraint (Eq.(7)), and thus, cannot reproduce the 
relativistic boundary.
With a point representation of the nucleus, a form of basis 
function which reproduces the relativistic boundary for finite c 
and is "kinetically balanced" as c approaches infinity, is the 
noninteger "S-spinor" (Quiney et al., 1989a; Grant and Quiney, 
1988) ,
xT(r) = rP exp(-£r)[AT + BT£r], p = +(k2 - Z2/c2)1/2 
where T = L or S, for the radial upper or lower components, 
respectively. Here A^ and are functions of k, nuclear charge 
Z, and c.
The precise conditions under which the "kinetically 
balanced" GTF of (4a,b) and (6a,b) can be made to reproduce the 
relativistic boundary associated with the point nucleus model 
for finite c is not known. The infinite cusp, however, is an 
artifact of the point nucleus model, and the boundary condition 
on the wavefunction at the origin can be changed by abandoning 
that model. In the change the difficulty of approximating the 
boundary with GTF is eliminated. In recent work, we have 
emphasized alteration of the boundary conditions such that 
"kinetically balanced" GTF become the best form for basis 
functions (Ishikawa et al., 1985; Ishikawa and Quiney, 1987). 
Representing the nucleus as a finite body of uniform proton 
charge does that. In the finite nuclear model "kinetically 
balanced" GTF of integer power of r are appropriate basis 
functions because imposition of the finite nuclear boundary 
results in a solution which is Gaussian at the origin.
In the uniform charge model of the finite nucleus, the 
potential inside the nucleus is
1 52

Vin = -(Z/2R)(3 - r2/R2)
Here R, the nuclear radius, is given by
R = 2.2677X10-5 A1/3
with A the atomic mass number. The potential outside the 
nucleus is Coulombic, VOU£ = -Z/r. With this representation of 
the potential, the exact sjy2 solutions near the origin are 
(Bohr and Weisskopf, 1950)
P(r)/r = 1 + g2r2 + g4r4 + ... 
(8a)
Q(r)/r = fxr + f3r3 + .... 
(8b)
so that, for a arbitrary parameters (Ishikawa and Quiney, 1987),
P(r) 
= r + g2r3 + ... 
r exp(-ar2)
Q(r) 
= f^r2 + f3r4 + ... 
r2exp(-ar2)
In (8a,b), P(r)/r has a finite value and zero slope at the 
origin, whereas Q(r)/r vanishes there.
The Pi/2 solutions near the origin may be represented as, 
P(r)/r = r + g3r3 + ... 
(9a)
Q(r)/r = f0 + f2r2 + . . . 
(9b)
Then the upper and lower components may be written
P(r) = r2 + g3r4 + ... r2 exp(-ar2)
Q(r) = fgr + f2r3 + 
r exp(-ar2) + r3 exp(-ar2)
In Egs. (9a,b), P(r)/r vanishes at the origin, whereas Q(r)/r 
has finite value and zero slope there. The behaviors of the 
exact solutions, (8a,b) and (9a,b), near the origin are 
precisely what the balanced GTF expansions, (4a,b) and (6a,b), 
provide. Thus a Gaussian basis, balanced in the sense we have 
suggested, provides a natural description of the wavefunction 
within the nucleus (Ishikawa et al., 1985).
Klahn and Morgan (1984) have postulated that the rate of 
convergence of a variational calculation is determined by how 
quickly the basis functions replicate the analytic structure of 
the unknown function one is trying to approximate. A GTF 
expansion mimics exactly the behavior of the wavefunction near 
the origin of a uniformly charged spherical nucleus. This is 
the very reason why DF GTF expansions, with a finite nucleus, 
exhibit fast and smooth convergence.
Using the expansion schemes, (4a,b) and (6a,b) together 
with the uniform charge model of the finite nucleus, we have 
performed calculations on neon, systematically enlarging the GTF 
basis sets (Ishikawa and Sekino, 1988). The DF spinors have 
been expanded in GTF basis sets of van Duijneveldt, optimized in 
nonrelativistic calculations. Table 1 shows the orbital and 
total energies. The total energy in each instance is an 
upperbound to the numerical limit. It decreases steadily toward 
153

the numerical limit as expansion size increases. The largest 
basis set, (14s9p), gives a total energy of -128.69166 a.u., 
near the numerical limit (-128.6919 a.u.).
Matsuoka and Huzinaga (1987) have proposed an expansion 
scheme for k > 0 states,
Qk(r) = S [ (n + l)rn-1 - 2a£rn+1] exp(-a£r2) J7|, n = k+1 
(6c)
This form of expansion was proposed by Stanton (1984), who 
observed bounds failures in calculations on several P1/2 states 
in which the point nuclear approximation was employed. The 
extent to which variational failures occur is greater for larger 
Z, where the cusp is pronounced; for small Z the collapse is not 
noticeable. The Q(r) as expanded in (6c) cannot satisfy the 
relativistic boundary associated with the point nucleus for a 
finite value of c because Q(r)/r (nonzero) constant as r 0, 
whereas the exact Q(r)/r -> « as r -► 0, in the point nucleus 
approximation. Failure to satisfy the relativistic boundary is 
a consequence of using expansion (6c), derived from the kinetic 
balance criterion (5), and valid only for c -► «> (Ishikawa et al., 
1990).
When the point nucleus approximation is forfeited in favor 
of the finite uniform charge representation, expansion (6c) 
becomes more appropriate. However, it is not flexible enough to 
reproduce the correct behavior near the origin. The ”contrac­
tion" coefficients in (6c), derived in the nonrelativistic 
limit, are unsuitable at finite c. Consequently, DF 
calculations which employ expansion (6c) are susceptible to 
variational failure.

In contrast, the uncontracted expansion (6b) can represent the 
exact wavefunction near the origin because of the flexibility 
conferred by parameters and {o>j} in the variational process 
(Quiney, 1988).
In order to examine the bounding property associated with 
the two expansion schemes, we have performed two sets of DF 
calculations on highly ionized and neutral atom species using 
either (6a,b) or (6a,c) for k > 0 symmetries along with (4a,b) 
for k < 0 symmetries. The method which employs "uncontracted" 
expansions, (4a,b) and (6a,b) is referred to as the method 1, 
and that which employs "contracted" expansions, (4a,b) and 
(6a,c) as method 2.
Table 2 displays the results of calculations on the six- 
electron neutral C atom and Hg+74 ion in their closed-shell 
configuration, (Is^) 2 (2s1/2) 2 (2Pl/2) 2 • The total energies of 
these systems computed by method 1 agree with the numerical DF 
limits. The energies of neutral C atom computed using method 2 
agree exactly with those computed with method 1, showing no sign 
of variational failure. However, the energies of Hg+74 ion 
computed with method 2 exhibit variational failure; the 
calculated total energy lies 0.048 a.u. below the numerical 
limit.
For both methods 1 and 2, there is a clean separation of 
negative and positive energy branches of the spectra of the six- 
electron systems (Ishikawa et al., 1990). The results indicate 
that the basis functions for the large and small components need 
not be matched in pairs to obtain a clean separation of the 
spectrum.
Matsuoka and Huzinaga (1987) and Mohanty and Clementi 
(1989) have performed DF GTF basis set calculations on a series 
of neutral atoms using expansion method 2. Their results show 
no sign of variational failure for neutral atoms up to Rn, 
whereas, in the present study, the highly ionized, high-Z 
species, Hg+74, shows failure clearly. To determine whether 
calculations on neutral Hg exhibit variational failure, we have 
used method 2 in DF calculations, enlarging the basis set 
systematically (Ishikawa et al., 1990). As expansion length 
increases, the total energy converges monotonically to the 
numerical limit. In each instance, the computed total energy is 
an upperbound to the numerical limit. Our results on the 
neutral Hg atom, taken with the results of Mohanty and Clementi 
(1989) on the neutral heavy elements indicate that, even when Z 
is large, neutral species do not exhibit a tendency to 
variational collapse. The shielding effect of a large number of 
electrons seems to reduce the magnitude of variational collapse 
to negligible size.
In summary, expansion method 1 does not show any sign of 
variational failure in any application. It can be applied to 
highly ionized, high-Z species, for which high precision 
calculations are often essential. A disadvantage is that, as 
the basis set becomes large, for spinors of k > 0, calculations 
using the method become unwieldy. An additional disadvantage 
lies in the fact that the basis functions for the upper and 
lower components are not matched in pairs, and therefore half 
the negative energy solutions do not have a positive energy 
counterpart.

Slow convergence in perturbation theory calculations of 
properties which involve summation of the negative energies 
could result. Method 2 appears to be free of significant 
variational failure when applied to neutral species. It is 
computationally simpler than method 1, and hence suited to 
calculations on neutral heavy atom species. A disadvantage is 
that it may show variational failure in studies of highly 
ionized, high-Z species. The basis functions for the upper and 
lower components are, however, matched in pairs, and a clean 
separation of the spectrum is obtained.
RELATIVISTIC MANY-BODY PERTURBATION THEORY CALCULATIONS
Dirac-Fock wavefunctions provide results which may be 
directly compared to those obtained with the most popular 
nonrelativistic computational method, the Hartree-Fock method. 
But accurate treatment of atomic and molecular systems requires 
that DF treatments be refined to include the effects of electron 
correlation.
Accurate treatment of many-electron atoms requires 
techniques which are computationally tractable and capable of 
recovering nearly all of the correlation energy. Two methods 
proven successful in treating relativistic many-body problems 
are the variational and perturbative types, configuration 
interaction (CI) (Beck and Cai, 1988) and many-body perturbation 
theory (MBPT) (Johnson et al., 1987; Quiney et al., 1987). MBPT 
developed from field theory and QED and thus provides a natural 
framework within which to treat relativistic effects. It was 
introduced into atomic physics by Kelly (1963). MBPT is 
employed to calculate electronic properties because it is 
computationally efficient, and because the formalism is well 
developed (Kelly, 1969). It is size consistent (Bartlett, 
1989), but not variational. An advantage is that perturbation 
theoretical formulations are most often applied to account for 
fine effects; MBPT is therefore a natural form with which to 
approach the correlation problem. MBPT is probably best suited 
for the analysis of correlation effects in many-electron systems 
because it permits a decomposition of the correlation energy of 
a system into component contributions.
MBPT is less studied with basis sets than with the finite- 
difference approach. Basis sets, however, have some advantage 
156

over finite-difference methods in MBPT calculations in that the 
infinite summations over bound and continuum states which appear 
in finite difference calculations are replaced in basis set 
calculations with summations over a finite pseudospectrum 
(Johnson and Sapirstein, 1986; Quiney et al., 1987). MBPT up to 
third order has been applied to relativistic many-body 
calculations using basis set expansion DF wavefunctions as 
reference states (Johnson et al., 1987; Quiney et al., 1987; 
Ishikawa et al., 1989). It is a tractable technique for 
recovering correlation energy. In highly ionized systems the 
perturbation expansion converges rapidly; a substantial fraction 
of the correlation energy in these systems is recovered with the 
second order term (Ishikawa et al., 1989). Thus, a finite basis 
set expansion approach to relativistic DF and MBPT calculations 
may be regarded as an accurate and versatile approximation 
technique.
The usual starting point for the development of 
relativistic MBPT calculations is the time-honored Dirac-Coulomb 
Hamiltonian (HDC). The leading effects of transverse photon 
exchange, however, may be included in the zero-order Hamiltonian 
by adding the Breit operator to the instantaneous Coulomb 
operator (Quiney et al., 1989b). This approach has the 
advantage that all effects through order a2 are included in the 
Hamiltonian. The use of such a zero-order Hamiltonian in 
variational calculations naturally leads to DF equations which 
include the Breit interaction. As Quiney, Grant and Wilson 
(1987) have pointed out, incorporating the Breit term in the SCF 
process results in the Coulomb and Breit interactions being 
included in the SCF potential to the same order. Thus the 
instantaneous Coulomb and Breit terms are treated on an equal 
basis in the two-electron interaction for relativistic many-body 
perturbation theory calculations.
The starting point for our development of relativistic MBPT 
calculations in c-number theory is the relativistic "no-pair11 
Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonian (HDq ), originally introduced to avoid 
the "continuum dissolution" problem associated with relativistic 
many-body calculations (Sucher, 1980).
HDC+ = 
? hD(i) + 
L+( S 1/rij ) L+
where L+ = L+(l)...L+(N). HDC is the sum of Dirac one- 
electron Hamiltonians
hD = ca.p + 0 c2 + Vnuc
and the instantaneous Coulomb interaction between electrons is
ve-e = V^ij
with L+(i) the projection operator onto the space spanned by the 
positive energy eigenfunctions of the DF operator. The no-pair 
Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonian, then, treats one-electron effects 
relativistically, two-electron effects being "nonrelativistic". 
The correlation energy induced by the Breit interaction is 
significant for inner-shell spinors of heavier systems. In the 
present work, however, we neglect that interaction.
Negative energy states, as part of the complete set of 
states, play a role in many-body calculations. Contributions

In q-number theory, the normally ordered second-quantized 
"no-pair" Hamiltonian
Hjj = S frs[r+s] + 1/4S < rs II tu >[r+s+ut]
may be employed in relativistic MBPT calculations (Quiney, 1988; 
Sucher, 1987). Here frs and < rs n tu > are, respectively, one- 
electron DF and antisymmetrized two-electron Coulomb interaction 
matrices over the Dirac four-component spinors, r, s, t, and u. 
Normal ordering implies that, in the vacuum state, annihilation 
operators are moved to the right of creation operators as if all 
anticommutators vanish. The Fermi level is shifted to the 
highest occupied positive-energy state. The creation operator 
then appears to the right of a normally ordered set when it 
refers to an occupied positive-energy state, while the 
annihilation operator remains on the right for a positive-energy 
virtual state. In this form the no-pair Hamiltonian is 
restricted to contributions from the positive-energy branch of 
the spectrum.
The no-pair approximation is a natural extension of 
nonrelativistic many-body theory (Sucher, 1987). Diagrammatic 
summation is done within the subspace of the positive energy 
branch of the spectrum. In linked-cluster MBPT, both Brandow 
and Hugenholtz diagrams utilize antisymmetry, and thus provide 
compact diagrammatic notation. With Goldstone diagrams, 
however, there is no explicit use of antisymmetry. The diagrams 
involve only ordinary one- and two-electron matrix elements 
which connect one-particle states. They are, therefore, most 
closely related to the original Feynman diagrams. In recent 
studies, Goldstone diagrams have been summed to compute Dirac- 
Coulomb correlation corrections up to third order (Quiney et 
al., 1988; Ishikawa et al., 1989).
There is numerical evidence that, for all but the lightest 
systems, the second order MBPT correction represents the bulk 
( > 95% ) of the correlation energy. In Ne, for instance, the 
second order correction recovers more than 99% of the 
11 experimental" total correlation energy. In the present study 
on the neutral He, Ne, Ar, and Kr atoms, Goldstone diagrams are 
summed to second order.
In nonrelativistic MBPT, the use of single configuration 
Hartree-Fock wavefunctions as a reference for perturbation 
theory calculations is well justified by the fact that the most 
commonly used definition of correlation energy refers to the 
difference between the Hartree-Fock and exact nonrelativistic 
energies. In our relativistic MBPT calculations, single 
configuration Dirac-Fock ground state reference wavefunctions 
are employed as a starting point. Virtual spinors in our 
studies are calculated in the field of the nucleus and all 
electrons (VN potential). Our relativistic MBPT calculations 
may, then, be directly compared to those obtained with the most 
popular nonrelativistic MBPT calculations, facilitating an 
understanding of relativistic effects, correlation effects, and 
their interaction in heavier systems.
158

We have performed relativistic MBPT calculations on rare 
gas atoms in which the basis sets employed have been systematic­
ally expanded. Representative results of DF and second order 
MBPT calculations on He, Ne, Ar, and Kr atoms with even- or 
well-tempered GTF basis sets are shown in Table 3. The speed of 
light used to obtain the relativistic results was c = 137.0370 
a.u. To simulate the non-relativistic limit, a value of c of 
104 a.u. was used. An even-tempered (14sl0p8d7f6g5h4i) GTF 
basis set was employed in the He calculations. For the Ne, Ar 
and Kr calculations basis sets, respectively, of 
(14sl0p8d6f5g4h4i), (16sllp9d7f6g5h) and (16sl3p8d7f6g5h) well- 
tempered GTF were used.
Lindroth (1988) has used relativistic pair equations to 
compute the second order Coulomb correlation correction (E2) of 
He using a partial wave expansion with =4. E2 thus 
obtained was -0.036965 a.u. Our second order energy, -0.36911 
a.u. obtained with Lmax = 4 (a 14sl0p8d7f6g basis set) agrees 
with the value reported by Lindroth. The error in the second 
order energies due to basis set truncation is about 0.15%.
Using finite difference pair equations, Lindgren and 
Salomonson (1980) have computed the nonrelativistic second order 
correlation energy of Ne with a partial-wave expansion having 
Lmax = The second order energy obtained, -0.38355 a.u., may 
be compared to our nonrelativistic result, -0.38018 a.u. Das et 
al. have estimated the "experimental" correlation energy of Ne 
to be -0.3890 a.u.
Quiney et al. (1989b) have computed the second order Dirac- 
Coulomb correlation energy of Ar with a large STF basis set 
consisting of 17 s-spinors of each symmetry type, up to Lmax = 
3. The point nucleus approximation was employed in the 
calculations. A second order energy of -0.639424 a.u. was 
reported. This value may be compared with our second order 
energy, -0.63383 a.u. obtained with Lmax = 3. Assuming the 
effect on E2 of treating the nucleus differently is small, the 
discrepancy of 0.0056 a.u. between the results is best 
attributed to basis set truncation error in our calculation.
For every system listed in Table 3, the Coulomb correlation 
energy computed using the no-pair Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonian is 
different from that computed at the nonrelativistic limit. The 
difference represents interference between relativistic and 
correlation effects. In helium this nonadditive contribution is 
about IO"6 a.u.; it increases in Kr to 10"2 a.u.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Theoretical methods developed for electronic structure 
studies of truly many-electron atoms must be able to account for 
relativistic and electron correlation effects. They must be 
computationally efficient because they will eventually be 
applied to high-Z neutral atoms. And they should be capable of 
being extended in a straightforward manner to the study of 
molecules. The present study has employed one such approach, 
the solution of the Dirac-Fock equations by expansion in 
Gaussian-type functions and many-body perturbation refinement of 
the solutions.

Dirac-Fock SCF calculations by conventional expansion in a 
basis exhibit variational failure. The major barrier to the 
development of ab initio relativistic quantum chemistry in the 
past decade has been the lack of a basis set expansion scheme 
which prevents variational failure and the appearance of 
spurious solutions. The work we report here should convey the 
idea that no substantial problems remain; our Dirac-Fock GTF 
basis expansion method together with its MBPT refinement is a 
reliable, accurate and versatile approximation in relativistic 
quantum mechanics.

Satisfying the virial theorem is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition for the 
variational minimum. In general, there are more than one set of nonlinear parameters 
(i.e., basis function exponents) for which the virial theorem is satisfied. The 
Hartree—Fock energy is optimal only for one of these sets. For this reason, the virial 
theorem has rarely been used in the Hartree-Fock energy minimization processes.
In his pioneering work on Dirac-Fock basis set expansion calculations, Kim (1967) 
introduced the idea of using the relativistic virial theorem to identify the best 
Dirac-Fock energies. This was most likely necessary because, in earlier work, 
relativistic self-consistent-field calculations which used an analytic basis were 
plagued by the problem of variational failure, a phenomenon that the computed total 
energy falls below the numerical limit. In our case, the Dirac-Fock basis set 
expansion method (method 1) provides an upper bound to the numerical limit, and 
thus, the relativistic virial theorem has not been explicitly used to minimize the total 
energy. We do, however, evaluate the relativistic virial to assess the quality of a 
given basis set used in the Dirac-Fock GTF basis expansion calculations.
In our Dirac-Fock calculations, we have been using both even— and well— tempered 
Gaussian basis sets that are moderately large. The number of non-linear parameters 
involved in the even— and well— tempered basis sets are two and four, respectively. 
And they can easily be energy optimized without the explicit use of the virial 
theorem. For the optimal nonlinear parameters, the relativistic viral theorem is 
usually satisfied to 7 figures of accuracy.
In a recent work, Goldman (1987) exploited the relativistic virial theorem to 
construct a new optimization technique for basis set exponents in Dirac-Fock 
expansion calculations. This procedure may become essential if one tries to optimize 
each basis set exponent individually.

We have so far observed no bounds failure for 2pi/2 states using your method 2, with 
a Gaussian nuclear charge distribution. Could the failure be due to the uniform 
sphere model of the nucleus that you are using? This would arise because of the 
change of the potential from harmonic to Coulombic at the nuclear boundary, making 
Gaussians inappropriate functions, whereas for a Gaussian nuclear model, the 
potential remains an even function of r, no such change occurs, and Gaussians remain 
appropriate functions for all r.

We have introduced the finite nucleus of uniform proton charge distribution in our 
Dirac-Fock GTF basis expansion calculations primarily because the boundary 
conditions associated with the uniform charge model are most suitable for the 
kinetically balanced Gaussian—type functions.
In the uniform charge model, the Dirac-Fock wavefunctions expanded in terms of the 
balanced GTF are the most accurate representation inside the nucleus. However, the 
solutions of the Dirac equation with a uniform charge model have discontinuities in 
the second derivative and higher at the nuclear boundary. I do not know if this is the 
reason why method 2 causes the bounds failure for 2pi/2 states. We will look into this 
possibility in our future study.

INTRODUCTION
The majority of research in ab initio quantum chemistry is performed on 
molecules containing light atoms, and indeed a large part of chemical research gen­
erally is concerned with such systems. Ab initio quantum chemical calculations are 
limited by the performance of computer hardware and software, and advances in 
these areas have increased the scope of quantum chemistry to the point where it 
is now possible to perform accurate calculations on systems containing the lighter 
transition metals. However, there are many important chemical processes involving 
heavy elements, and here another obstacle to accurate quantum chemical calcula­
tions presents itself — the increasing importance of relativistic effects with increas­
ing atomic number.
The chemical effects of relativity have been extensively documented (for ex­
haustive reviews see Pyykkd 1978, 1986, 1988, Pitzer 1979, Pyykkd and Desclaux 
1979). The traditional methods of computational chemistry are clearly inadequate 
for the description of important phenomena such as relativistic orbital contractions 
and spin-orbit splitting — effects that may decisively influence structure as well as 
reactivity of heavy-atom molecules. Yet molecules containing heavy atoms are im­
portant in a number of areas of chemistry, such as catalysis and surface chemistry. 
The need for accurate quantum chemical calculations in these areas has motivated
167

recent theoretical and methodological developments which are aimed at overcoming 
the obstacles to a relativistic treatment of systems containing heavy atoms.
One widely-used approach to calculations on molecules containing heavy 
atoms is the relativistic effective core potential (RECP) method. While this method 
has considerable advantages, there are situations in which it is inappropriate, and 
in most applications spin-orbit splitting is not included. Effective core potential 
methods also need calibration against ab initio calculations for validation. An all­
electron relativistic method is clearly required, both for rigour and understanding, 
and in evaluating alternatives.
Numerical methods have been used successfully in atomic Dirac-Hartree- 
Fock (DHF) calculations for many years (Desclaux 1975, Grant et al. 1980). Some 
DHF calculations using numerical methods have been done on diatomic molecules 
(Laaksonen and Grant, 1984, Sundholm et al. 1987, Sundholm 1988), but while 
these serve a useful purpose for calibration, the computational effort in extending 
this approach to polyatomic molecules is prohibitive. An alternative more in line 
with traditional quantum chemistry is to use an analytical basis set expansion of the 
wave function. This approach fell into disrepute in the early 1980s due to problems 
with variational collapse and intruder states, but has recently been put on firm 
theoretical foundations (Grant 1986, Grant and Quiney, 1988, Quiney 1988). In 
particular, the problems of variational collapse are well understood, and prescrip­
tions for avoiding the most serious failures have been developed. Consequently, it 
is now possible to develop reliable molecular programs using basis set methods. We 
describe such a program in this paper, and report results of test calculations to 
demonstrate the convergence and stability of the method.

The term which contributes at the next order, (9(c-2), is the Breit interaction, 
whose contribution to the energy comes mainly from the region near the nuclei. 
For present purposes, the Coulomb interaction is an adequate description of the 
electron-electron interaction. Writing the 4-spinors in terms of large and small 
component 2-spinors jL andjs,

where the superscripts L and S indicate large and small components respectively, 
we obtain for the matrix elements of the one- and two-electron operators

CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION
There are a number of alternatives to be considered in the implementation 
of the Dirac-Fock method in a basis set, such as choice of basis function type and 
nuclear model, relations between small and large component basis functions, form 
of spinor expansions, transformation from the scalar to the 2-spinor basis, inclusion 
of double group symmetry (including time-reversal symmetry), details of integral 
storage and transformation and SCF method. We discuss these alternatives in the 
following subsections.
Basis function type and nuclear model
The principal causes of variational collapse in the attempt to solve the Dirac 
equation are the failure to satisfy the boundary conditions at the nucleus (Grant and 
Quiney 1988), and the failure to ensure the proper relations between the large and 
small component basis functions (Ishikawa et al. 1983, Dyall et al. 1984, Stanton 
and Havriliak 1984). The second point will be addressed in the next section.
Numerical solutions of the Dirac-Fock equations have the boundary con­
ditions built in, so that any spherically symmetric model of the nuclear charge 
171

distribution may be employed. For finite basis set approximations, these boundary 
conditions will determine the form of the basis functions. Thus, the choice of basis 
function type and nuclear model are interrelated.
The traditional model used in electronic structure calculations for the nu­
clear charge distribution is the point nuclear model, which gives rise to the cusp 
in the non-relativistic electronic wave function at the nucleus. In the solution of 
the electronic Dirac equation, this cusp is replaced by a singularity, which has to 
be modelled by the basis functions. For atoms and diatomics, Slater-type functions 
with non-integral exponents of r should be used, such as the S-spinors or L-spinors 
advocated by Quiney et al. (1989). While these are convenient for atomic calcu­
lations, and may also be useful for diatomic molecules, their use for polyatomic 
systems would be computationally intractable.
The alternative to the point charge model for the nucleus is to use some kind 
of charge distribution with a finite radius, for which the wave function is no longer 
singular at the origin. For the purposes of electronic structure calculations, the 
details of the model for the nuclear charge distribution are not critical, provided 
they approximately represent the real distribution *.  The most popular models in 
atomic structure calculations are the uniformly charged sphere model,
* This will not necessarily be true, of course, for properties such as nuclear 
hyperfine structure and parity non-conservation effects, which may be sensitive to 
the nuclear model.
pnuc(r) = po, r < r0
= 0, r > r0
and the Fermi distribution,
pnuc(r) = po[1 4- exp((r - u)/c)]-1.
Visser et al. (1987) have investigated the use of a single Gaussian function for the 
nuclear charge distribution in basis set DHF calculations,
Pnuc(r) = po exp(rjnucr2).
None of these models is anything but a crude representation of the nuclear charge 
distribution, but they are adequate for electronic structure calculations. The jus­
tification for the use of the uniform and Fermi models is that they have been used 
in the fitting of nuclear scattering data to obtain gross nuclear dimensions. The 
parameters ro for the uniform distribution, a and c for the Fermi distribution, and 
rjnuc for the Gaussian distribution are determined from these fits to nuclear scat­
tering data. The effect of the choice of finite nuclear model on the energy is not 
large, as shown by some numerical calculations for Hg79+ using a modification of 
the GRASP program (Dyall et al. 1989), given in table 1. The nuclear size effect 
is of the order of 2 Eh, but the effect of the shape of the nuclear boundary is only 
of the order of 20 mEh-

The relation between the choice of basis functions and the nuclear charge 
model may be clarified by the following analysis. The nuclear potential for any 
finite nuclear charge distribution may be expanded in a power series about the 
origin,
Vnwc(r) = vq + v2r2 + v3r3 + . •. •
Note that there is no term linear in r, so that for small r, regardless of the details 
of the nuclear model, the potential is approximately harmonic. The solutions of 
the Schrodinger equation for a harmonic potential are Hermite Gaussian functions; 
the solutions of the Dirac equation are not, but may be represented by Gaussian 
functions. At very short range, then, Gaussian functions will be appropriate basis 
functions. If all terms of odd order in the series expansion of the nuclear potential 
have zero coefficients, then the solutions of the electronic Dirac equation for a many­
electron atom are either pure even or pure odd functions of r. Both the uniform 
and the Gaussian nuclear charge distribution have such an expansion inside the 
nuclear radius. The series for the uniform model is only valid inside the nuclear 
radius, but for the Gaussian nuclear model the series is valid for all r. Solutions 
of the Dirac equation with a uniform nuclear model will have discontinuities in 
the higher derivatives at the nuclear boundary, but for a Gaussian nuclear model, 
the solutions will be continuous and differentiable to all orders for all r. The Fermi 
distribution, on the other hand, has terms of odd order in the series expansion, which 
will introduce elements in the solutions which have cusps in the higher derivatives 
at the origin. Use of the Gaussian nuclear model thus leads to solutions which 
are mathematically more well-behaved than the other two models, and as a result, 
expansion of the solutions in a finite Gaussian basis set is likely to have superior 
convergence properties.
One further, practical consideration in the choice of nuclear model needs 
mention. The calculation of many-centre nuclear attraction integrals would have to 
be done numerically for the uniform and Fermi models, whereas for the Gaussian 
model, the integrals may be evaluated using existing technology, since they require 
only straightforward changes to the expressions for point nuclear integrals.

Kinetic balance
Many of the problems with variational collapse and intruder states disap­
peared, once it was established that the small component basis functions must at 
least be related to the large component functions (Ishikawa et al. 1983, Dyall et al. 
1984, Stanton and Havriliak 1984) by the condition now known as kinetic balance,
(19)
Most of the remaining problems relate to the nuclear boundary conditions discussed 
above. Kinetic balance is, however, only a zeroth-order or non-relativistic approx­
imation, which is useful when the potential Vnuc is much smaller than 2c2. A 
relation which more accurately represents the small component where the potential 
is large (Ishikawa et al. 1983, Dyall et al. 1984), derived from the one-electron 
Dirac equation, is
{/} D { [2c2+e-Vrn“c]_1<7.V/}. 
(20)
With a Gaussian nucleus, kinetically balanced Gaussian basis functions do not sat­
isfy this relation, but they still provide a good representation of the small compo­
nent.
Applying a. V to jj-coupled 2-spinors composed of spherical harmonic Gaus­
sian functions of the form
\n,£,m(r,^, </>) = A/Vn-1exp(-(r2)^m(0,^),
with n = + 1, yields the following results. For the j = 
| spin-orbit components
of the large component 2-spinors, the small component 2-spinors are composed of 
functions 
, with appropriate values of mf. The small component basis
functions in this case have one more unit of angular momentum than the large 
component basis functions. For the j = £ — ± spin-orbit components of the large 
component 2-spinors, the small component 2-spinors are composed of functions 
and Xn-i,t-i,m' • In this case, the small component basis functions 
have one less unit of angular momentum than the large component basis functions, 
but they are also composed of two radial functions rather than just one. Thus, 
the Is 1/2, 2p3/2, 3d5/2, ...large component 2-spinors generate 2pi/2, 3d3/2, 4/5/2, 
...small component 2-spinors; but the 2pi/2, 3d3/2, 4/5/2, ...large component 2- 
spinors generate lsi/2, 2p3/2, 3d5/2, ... andSs-^, 5d5/2, ... 2-spinors. Kinetic 
balance also requires equal exponents for corresponding large and small component 
Gaussian functions.
If we consider the scalar Gaussian basis functions of which the 2-spinors are 
composed, there are 2£ + 1 large component basis functions for each £ value, if the 
two spin-orbit components share the same basis functions. By the above rules, these 
generate 6^+1 small component basis functions, except for 5, which generates 3 
basis functions. The total number of basis functions for a given £ shell is then 8^ + 2, 
174

which represents an approximately fourfold increase in the basis set size over the 
corresponding nonrelativistic basis set size of 2^ + 1 spherical harmonic Gaussians. 
If the two spin-orbit components do not share the same basis functions, we must 
add 2^ + 1 functions to the large component basis, making a total of 10£ + 3 basis 
functions, which is an almost fivefold increase.
For example, consider a non-relativistic basis set consisting of 15 s, 11 p, 6 
d and 3 f functions, which has a total of 99 basis functions. With common basis 
functions for the spin-orbit components in the large component set, the correspond­
ing relativistic basis set would have these 99 functions for the large component set, 
and the small component set would consist of 11 s, 21 p, 14 d, 6 f and 3 g pure 
spherical functions, and 11 3s, 6 4p and 3 5d “contaminants” — a total of 257 ba­
sis functions for the small component. Including both components, the relativistic 
basis set would consist of 356 basis functions. Without the use of common basis 
functions for the spin-orbit components, the relativistic basis set would consist of 
440 basis functions in total.
In a contracted basis set, it would generally be necessary to have different 
contracted functions for the two spin-orbit components of a given shell. Both the 
large and small component functions would have different contraction coefficients, 
including the contaminants (which belong to one spin-orbit component) and the 
pure spherical functions (which belong to the other). If we contracted the above 
non-relativistic basis to 6s5p3d2/, for example, the relativistic contracted basis 
would have 80 large component basis functions and 130 small component basis 
functions, a total of 210 basis functions, compared with 43 basis functions for the 
nonrelativistic contracted basis. Thus, contraction as a space-saving mechanism is 
not quite as advantageous in a relativistic calculation as compared with a nonrela­
tivistic calculation, owing to the need to duplicate the large component set for all 
basis function types except 5.
Choice of spinor expansion
The expansion of the components of the 4-spinors | j ) in a basis set can 
be done in three ways: independent expansions for each of the four components, 
expansion in terms of 2-spinors, as outlined in this paper, and expansion in 4- 
spinors, where each component is fixed in relation to the others. Since the last 
of these has not been much used, we will focus on the first two. Atomic finite 
basis calculations (see Pyykkd 1986 for references) have usually exploited atomic 
symmetry, and expanded only the radial parts of the large and small components 
in a basis. These use equal length expansions for the large and small components. 
Some molecular calculations have also used a 2-spinor basis (Hegarty and Aerts 
1987).
Early molecular calculations (Mark et al. 1980, Lee and McLean 1982) used 
separate expansions for each of the four spinor components. This corresponds to 
carrying out the entire calculation in the scalar basis. It inevitably means that the
175

basis set expansions for the large and small components will have different lengths. 
For example, consider the case of a single 5 function for the large component. This 
requires a p-type function in the small component, which consists of three functions: 
pi, po and p-i. If these are coupled to the spin to form jj-coupled 2-spinors, we 
get two functions for the pi/2 and four for the p3/2 spin-orbit components of the 
p shell. Only the pi /2 set are used to represent the small component for the large 
component s function. The p3/2 functions form a basis for a “negative-energy” 
(or positron) state of symmetry j = 3/2, which will also appear in the spectrum 
along with the desired states. If the basis is ill-chosen, these extra states may 
not even be confined to the negative continuum, but appear instead as intruder 
states in the bound state region or in the positive continuum. A classic example of 
intruder or spurious states is the calculation of the hydrogenic states for j = 
|
by Drake and Goldman (1982), who observe a state degenerate with the state of 
the same j, but different £ value — for instance, a pi/2 state degenerate with the 
lsi/2 state. The features of this approach, then, are that it gives an unbalanced 
representation of the two branches of the spectrum, with a better description of 
the negative continuum, which is of no interest for molecular properties, than of 
the bound states and positive continuum. More than that, the extra functions will 
give rise to extra eigenvalues, which may occur as intruder states in the parts of the 
spectrum which are of interest, as Grant and Quiney (1988) have warned.
Some more recent 2-spinor based calculations, both on atoms (Ishikawa and 
Sekino 1990) and molecules (Visscher et al. 1990), have also employed different 
expansion lengths for the large and small components. Their expansions have a 
better representation of the negative energy states than the positive energy states. 
Experience has generally shown that, provided the basis functions are appropriate 
for the boundary conditions, the intruder states are to be found in the negative 
continuum. However, the physical states of interest may be distorted by the higher 
density of states in the negative continuum (see Stanton and Havriliak 1984), and 
mask problems of variational collapse or bounds failure. A more serious problem 
arises in the treatment of electron correlation if the negative continuum is to be 
included, for example in perturbation sums. Calculations of this type go beyond 
the no-pair approximation, i.e. they include contributions from creation of electron­
positron pairs (see Grant and Quiney 1988 for a discussion). While the inclusion of 
the negative continuum is not likely to be of importance for molecular properties, 
the distortion of the positive spectrum, which results from the higher density of 
states in the negative continuum, may even affect calculations that do not include 
it.
Though the seriousness of the problems that may arise from the use of dif­
ferent length expansions will depend on the nature of the calculations, we believe it 
is wise to avoid any possible problems by ensuring that the large and small compo­
nent spinor basis sets are of the same length, which means using jj-coupled atomic 
2-spinors as a basis for both large and.small components in matched sets.
Transformation to 2-spinors
The considerations of the previous section affect only the final representation 
176

of the eigenstates of the system under study. In the process of the construction of 
these eigenstates, it is not necessary to keep all quantities in the 2-spinor basis. In­
deed, there may be some advantages in using the scalar basis at various stages in the 
calculations. Computationally, the transformation to 2-spinors is not expensive, as 
the transformation matrix is very sparse. The transformation will scale only as the 
number of indices to be transformed. The point at which the transformation is done 
will then be determined by the practical considerations of storage and efficiency.
In a direct SCF procedure, the transformation can be done while the Fock 
matrix is being constructed; in conventional SCF, there are two points at which the 
transformation to 2-spinors may be done. The first is at the stage of two-electron 
integral generation; the second is after construction of the Fock matrix.
The decision of whether or not to transform the integrals will be influenced 
by a number of factors, but the overriding consideration will be that of disk space, 
given the much larger basis sets needed in a relativistic calculation. Most molecular 
integral codes generate integrals over real basis functions, which may be Cartesian 
or spherical functions, atom-centred or symmetry-adapted functions. Since the jj- 
coupled 2-spinors are complex, the permutational symmetry of the integrals will be 
reduced after the transformation, and hence the number of values to be stored will 
increase. Time-reversal symmetry regains one degree of permutational freedom. If 
the integrals are generated over symmetry functions, then the fact that the 2-spinor 
functions are generally distributed between fewer irreducible representations in the 
double group than the scalar functions are in the single group will, in general, 
mean an increase in the number of values stored. These increases are offset by 
the reduction in size of the small component basis upon transformation. It is not 
immediately clear that transformation will inevitably increase the total storage 
requirements, but it may do so. The transformation would be implemented either 
at the same stage as the spherical harmonic transformation, since it is of a similar 
nature, or after the symmetry transformation (if the integral code includes this).
If the integrals are kept in the scalar basis, then the Fock matrix must be 
transformed instead. Since the construction of the Fock matrix is the most time­
consuming step in a conventional SCF calculation, it is important to make it effi­
cient. Use of unordered integrals in a non-relativistic calculation does not permit 
vectorization; to achieve this, ordered integrals or supermatrices are used. Due to 
the large basis sets needed for relativistic calculations, the extra disk space required 
for integral ordering may not be available. When constructing the Fock matrix in 
the scalar basis, however, each (ab\cd) integral with distinct indices contributes 
in 36 unique places. It is then possible to vectorize the construction of the Fock 
matrix using sparse vector operations. While the gain in speed from vectorization 
is smaller than that obtained from the use of ordered integrals or supermatrices, it 
is nevertheless substantial.
IMPLEMENTATION
Our program uses for the scalar basis spherical harmonic Gaussian functions, 
177

which are symmetry-adapted for D2h and its subgroups. The jj-coupled 2-spinors 
constructed from these are symmetry functions for the corresponding double group. 
Linear molecules are treated as a special case. The nuclear charge distribution is 
a single Gaussian with an exponent chosen to match the rms radii of the Gaussian 
and the nucleus, given by
f/nuc — 3/(2rrm5). 
(21)
The nuclear rms radius is fitted to a function of the nuclear mass:
rrms = (r2)± = 0.836A1/3 +0.57 
(22)
where A is in amu and rrms is in fm. This formula is appropriate for the Fermi 
2-parameter distribution. The one-and two-electron integrals, which are generated 
by an adaption of MOLECULE (Almlof and Taylor, unpublished), are kept in the 
scalar basis. The Fock matrix is constructed in the scalar basis, then transformed to 
the 2-spinor basis. Each (double group) symmetry block of the Fock matrix is sym­
metrically orthonormalized, and diagonalized using standard EISPACK routines. 
Density damping has been implemented to accelerate convergence.
RESULTS
Testing of any new program requires comparison of a number of calculations 
of various types with known results. For atoms, the adapted GRASP program 
(Dyall et al. 1989) was used to obtain numerically accurate Dirac-Fock-Coulomb 
energies with a Gaussian nuclear charge distribution for comparison with results 
from the present program. For molecules, fewer results exist for comparison. The 
numerical diatomic calculations of Laaksonen et al. (1984) and Sundholm (1988) 
were used for comparison. All calculations were done with uncontracted basis sets.
One-electron calculations
The first sets of calculations were performed on one-electron systems. Tables 
2 and 3 give results for the Is orbital of H and Hg79’1’. The basis sets for H were 
taken from Partridge (1989), while those for Hg79+ were obtained by scaling the H 
sets. The results converge from above on the exact solution in both cases. For H, 
the error in the total energy, due to basis set truncation, converges more slowly than 
the error in the relativistic correction, as the basis set size is increased. Clearly, non- 
relativistic basis sets for H do not need modification for use in the Dirac equation. 
For Hg79+, however, the error in the total energy is almost entirely due to the error 
in the relativistic correction. The basis set clearly does not describe the relativistic 
contraction of the Is orbital well. We optimized the scale factor for each basis, with 
results as given in Table 4. Some 25% of the missing energy is recovered by this 
procedure, but the error in the relativistic correction still dominates the error in the

total energy. This indicates that nonrelativistic basis sets need to be re-optimized, 
at least for the core orbitals, if they are to be used in DHF calculations.
Results of calculations on the 2pi/z and 2ps/2 orbitals of Hg79+ with a few 
different basis sets are given in table 5. The basis sets were taken from atomic 
calculations on Pb (Faegri 1987). Here, the effect of spin-orbit splitting on the basis 
sets may be seen. The error for the 2pi/2 is much larger than that for the 2p3/2, 
even when the most diffuse function is replaced by a tighter function. Matsuoka and 
Okada (1989) found it necessary to add two tight p functions to the non-relativistic 
basis sets of Faegri (1987) in order to sufficiently reduce the eigenvalue errors for 
the neutral 6p block elements. Clearly, the basis set requirements for the two spin­
orbit components are different, which implies that, in a contracted basis, it will be 
necessary to use different contractions for the 2pj/2 and 2p3/2 functions.
Strict kinetic balance requires the 2p±/2 small component basis functions to 
be composed of a Is and a 3s function in a fixed ratio. It may be argued that the 
3s could be represented as a linear combination of Is functions, and therefore may 
be omitted. We have investigated the effect of omitting the 3s part of the small 
component spinor for each basis set size. The results are also given in Table 5. 
The importance of the 3s decreases with increasing basis set size, as is expected. 
With large enough basis sets, we conclude that the 3s may be omitted, but for

smaller basis sets, which may be necessary for molecular calculations, it may still 
be beneficial to retain the 3s. It is important also to note that omission of the 3s 
does not cause bounds failure: to the contrary, the energy increases when it is left 
out. We should emphasize that the coefficients of the Is and 3s functions in our 
calculations are not independently varied, as in the recent work by Ishikawa and 
Sekino (1990). Our approach is equivalent to their method 2.
Finally, some calculations were done on and HeH+. The s basis sets 
were taken from Partridge (1989), and the p basis sets were chosen in the range 
normally used for polarization functions on H. The results are given in Tables 6 and 
7, along with the numerical results of Laaksonen and Grant (1984). Though these 
calculations do not approach the basis set limit, they at least demonstrate that 
there are no problems with variational collapse. Even when the difference between 
the 7 s and the 15s basis results is added to the 7s4p result, as an estimate of the 
truncation error in the s set, the energy is still above the numerical value.
Many-electron systems
We have done several series of calculations on many-electron atoms, to in­
vestigate the trends in basis set errors with basis set size and with atomic number. 
Results of a representative set of calculations, for 10-electron systems with Z = 10, 
20, 40 and 80, are given in Table 8. The Ne basis sets were taken from Partridge 
(1989). The basis sets for the ions were energy optimized in non-relativistic finite 
nucleus atomic calculations. Our results for Ne are consistent with those of Hegarty 
and Aerts (1987). The results are presented in terms of the basis set truncation 
error and the error in the predicted relativistic correction for each basis set. The 
trends with atomic number demonstrate again that for the heavy atoms, the er-

ror in the total energy comes mainly from the non-optimal nature of the basis for 
relativistic calculations. However, the fractional error in the relativistic correction 
increases slowly with atomic number: for example, the error for Hg is only twice 
that for Ne.
Most of the testing has been on atomic systems. We present also a few 
calculations on molecular systems, H2 and H2O, in Tables 9 and 10. For H2, the 
numerical results were taken from Sundholm (1988). The basis set for H2, which is 
the same as that used for is modest in size — the basis set truncation error is 
5.5 mEh, but the relativistic correction is accurate to 0.4 pEh. Using the previous 
7s basis results for H atom, we obtain a result for the relativistic contribution to the 
binding energy of 1.1 //Eh, in agreement with the numerical result to better than 
0.1 microhartree. Thus, while the absolute value of the relativistic correction may 
not be accurate due to an inadequate description of the region near the nucleus, 
the relativistic contribution to the binding energy is well predicted. Of course, 
relativistic effects are very small for H2, but nevertheless, this result may carry over 
to other molecules. It may be that the re-optimization of the core basis sets, found to 
be necessary in the calculations on Hg79+ in order to obtain accurate core energies, 
may not be as critical for relativistic contributions to chemical binding. Indeed, 
Schwarz et al. (1989) comment that the principal differential screening effects that 
cause expansion or contraction of atomic valence orbitals due to relativity come 
from the valence and sub-valence shell, and not from orthogonality tails. This 
implies that a relatively poorer description of the core may not significantly affect 
calculated chemical properties, and that non-relativistic basis sets may be used

in relativistic calculations without re-optimization. The results of Matsuoka and 
Okada (1989) on heavy atoms show that the valence eigenvalue errors are of the 
order of a few mEh when a large nonrelativistic basis is used without modification, 
and the improvement on correction of the major deficiency in the core basis gives 
at most ImEh improvement. Moreover, the eigenvalue errors are all in the same 
direction, so that some cancellation of basis set truncation errors occurs in the 
relative energies. Further investigation of the use of non-relativistic basis sets is 
necessary, particularly in molecular calculations.
While there are no calculations for H2O to which we can compare directly, 
the computed relativistic correction is reasonable when compared with the sum of 
the relativistic corrections for the atoms, which is dominated by the contribution 
of 56 mEh from oxygen. The correction is consistent with the results obtained for 
atoms, that the relativistic correction to the energy is underestimated in basis set 
calculations, and converges from above on the true value as the basis set is enlarged.
CONCLUSIONS
In this article we have discussed some of the principles underlying finite 
basis Dirac-Fock calculations, and described how these have been implemented in 
a computer program. Although dealing mostly with atoms, our test calculations, 
as well as results obtained by others using similar approaches, clearly demonstrate 
the feasibility of carrying out high-quality Dirac-Fock calculations for molecules. 
The main obstacle to such calculations today appears to be the lengthy basis set 
expansions required. At the Dirac-Fock level the storage problem this creates can 
be largely overcome by resorting to direct SCF methods. We feel confident that, 
with further development, routine quantum chemical calculations of high accuracy 
for molecules containing heavy atoms will soon be a reality.

ABSTRACT
An open shell version has been developed for the MOLecular Hartree-Fock- 
DIRac program package MOLFDIR©. This program, originally developed as a 
closed shell program in 1985, can be used to calculate all-electron four- 
component Hartree-Fock-Dirac Self Consistent Field solutions for - in principle - 
molecules of general shape and uses separate gaussian basis sets to expand 
the large and small component functions. In practice basis sets are chosen to be 
kinetically balanced; technically, the program is not restricted to such basis sets. 
Implementation, advantages and limitations due to the Dacre and Elder 
algorithm for integral evaluation and Fock matrix set-up are discussed and 
results of test calculations are presented.
INTRODUCTION
In general there are several methods to study molecular relativistic effects (Pyykkb, 1986). 
We want to use an ab initio method with as few approximations as possible. In addition to 
the scientific desirability of staying close to the underlying physical model, it is often useful 
to carry out reference calculations in order to evaluate more approximate methods. In this

article we will describe the open shell extension to the MOLFDIR program package, which 
has been designed as a research program to perform MOLecular Fock DIRac calculations 
(Aerts, 1986). The Fock Dirac method can be considered as the relativistic analogon of the 
non-relativistic Hartree Fock method. The package is being extended to include correlation 
effects.
The relativistic effects are included by using the Dirac-Coulomb hamiltonian (in atomic 
units):
HD = X(c« i • P i + P imc2 + vi) + 
i 
i<j
In this equation, c is the velocity of light in vacuum, m is the mass of an electron, Vi is the 
electrostatic potential felt by electron i due to the nuclei, oq and Pi are the Dirac matrices for 
electron i, and ry1 is the Coulomb interaction between electrons i and j.
The two-electron part of this hamiltonian is not relativistically invariant. As a correction, the 
Breit interaction term may be included in the hamiltonian.
The program package has been applied to a number of different systems. At this moment we 
are very much interested in the series CH4 - PbH4 since the influence of relativity grows 
systematically important in otherwise almost identical molecules; also, for these systems data 
are available from other calculations (Aguilar-Ancono et al., 1983; Desclaux and Pyykko, 
1974; Fernandez et al., 1985) which make these systems useful for comparison.
Next planned are Fock-Dirac calculations on the f11 states of EuO69’ relevant for the optical 
properties of the Ba2GdNbO6:Eu system. Extensive non-relativistic model calculations have 
been reported by Van Piggelen (1978). Our main interest is getting information on the effects 
of relativity on his results.
Evidently, the program must be able to handle open shells such as the open f shell of Eu. In 
practice, such an open shell can give rise to a very large number of configurations and states, 
which in turn makes it tedious to perform SCF calculations on all those states separately.
Since a multiconfiguration approach will be necessary anyway, it is also not a fruitful way to 
go-
Instead we have decided to use an average of configuration open shell formalism for the 
SCF part of the package; the resulting average orbitals can be used as a basis for further CI 
or MCSCF studies to incorporate the correlation effects.
The use of an average of configuration formalism has several advantages:
186

- from our experience with non-relativistic calculations on dn and f11 shells it appears that 
the use of average orbitals offers a balanced description for the manifold of many­
electron states arising from these configurations;
- the computational complexity of the use of different orbitals for different states in 
further calculations (CI, transition moments) is avoided.
- with some restrictions, it is possible to use the efficient Dacre & Elder algorithm.
The average of configuration open shell method has been implemented in the MOLFDIR 
program package. Molecular CI or MCSCF studies using the Dirac-Coulomb (and Breit) 
hamiltonian are scheduled.
BASIS SETS
The program package works with two distinct sets of scalar (contracted) cartesian gaussian 
functions: a large component set {g} and a small component set {g^}. It is only possible to 
contract functions centred on the same atom with the same angular momentum value. 
General contraction, however, can be applied and has - especially in the case of relativistic 
basis set calculations - significant advantages (Visscher, 1990). The two-electron repulsion 
integrals are calculated over the functions belonging to these sets.
From these two scalar sets two new sets of symmetry adapted basis spinors are constructed 
using the Dirac double group. The spinors can be divided in two sets with the following 
structure:
{%a}= {Xj}+ {%s}
k 0
187

(f o
{Xs) = <
0
/y S a
A s
k X
xV’XsH xs.’=£g’c’
i 
i
Each non-zero component of these basis spinors consist of a linear combination of the basis 
functions from set {} or set {g^}.
Apart from the structure as described and the constraint to gaussian primitives, there are no 
restrictions on the choice of the basis spinors. In practice the basis set is chosen to be 
kinetically balanced (Visscher et al., 1990) with respect to the large component: the small 
component basis set includes all functions a.p The coefficients of the 1-1 and 1+1 basis 
functions resulting from o • p operating on a large component function will in practice have 
separate variational coefficients.
DACRE AND ELDER METHOD
The program package uses the Dacre & Elder method (Dacre, 1970; Elder, 1963). This 
method consists of the following steps:
- calculate the two-electron repulsion integrals over the (contracted) gaussian functions;
- reduce the integral list by using the spatial symmetry operations of the point group 
(skip integrals which are zero by symmetry and calculate only the non zero integrals)
- build the skeleton Fock matrix using the reduced integral list
- complete the Fock-matrix by applying the symmetry operations to the skeleton Fock 
matrix
- transform the Fock matrix to the symmetry adapted basis.
The contributions of the non-unique integrals are generated by applying the symmetry 
operations to the skeleton Fock matrix. This will work only if the density matrix is 
symmetric with respect to all applied symmetry operations. In practice, this means that also 
the Fock matrix must be symmetric with respect to the same symmetry operations, and the 
energy expression upon which the SCF procedure is based must treat all sub-representations 
from a given representation in the same manner.
188

The obvious advantages of the Dacre and Elder scheme are that only the reduced list of 
integrals is needed, and that these integrals will be real.
A disadvantage is that only closed shell and symmetrically averaged open shell systems can 
be handled easily.
AVERAGE OF CONFIGURATION OPEN SHELL METHOD
Let k and 1 refer to closed shell orbitals, let m and n refer to open shell orbitals, and define 
Q.. s J - K.. in which J and K are the usual coulomb and exchange integrals. Define the 
one electron Dirac operator as hD = cot • p + flmc2 + V, and its matrix representation in 
the orbital basis as HDij.
Consider the following energy expression: 
k kl
(ZH“+laf£Q„, + £Qk;
_ m 
mn 
km _
This energy expression is almost the same as the one Roothaan (1960) proposed, the 
differences being that in this energy expression the summations run over spin-orbitals, and 
that this energy expression contains only one (instead of two) coupling coefficient.
We restrict a and f in this expression in such a way that the energy expression corresponds 
to the average energy (McWeeny, 1989) of all single determinants formed from a specified 
set of open shell orbitals and a specified number of open shell electrons; all 
subrepresentations belonging to a representation occur in the set of open shell orbitals so that 
the density and Fock matrices will automatically be totally symmetric. Presently it is only 
possible to specify one a and one f (so all open shell orbitals will have the same fractional 
occupation number).
As usual, the SCF equations are derived by locating the stationary point of the expectation 
value of the total energy <E> with the orbital orthogonality constraint (i Ij) = 8...

We get the following expression for the total energy:
E = Tr[HDDc] + |Tr[QcDc] +
Tr[HDD°] + yaTr[Q°D°] +
Tr[Q°Dc]
In the SCF process, in each iteration both the closed-shell Fock matrix and the open-shell 
Fock matrix are diagonalized. From the two sets of eigenvectors we select the open shell 
orbitals either by eigenvalue or by overlap with a set of user specified vectors. The overlap 
selection is necessary in order to be able to create open shells with orbital energies lower 
than that of the highest closed shell (for example, states containing core holes or low lying f- 
shells in Lanthanides). After the selection, the set of occupied orbitals is re-orthogonalized.
EXAMPLE OF AVERAGING
As an example of the averaging method, consider a carbon atom (with configuration 
Is2 2s2 2p2). Relativistically, the p orbitals are split into the P3/2 and the P1/2 orbitals (or 
into the Eiu and Fu orbitals if we use the Dirac double group corresponding to the Oh point 
190

group). Consider the configuration Is2 2s2 2p3/22 where we have four open shell orbitals 
available for 2 electrons. This gives rise to six determinants each of which yields a different 
energy expression. The average of these six expressions yields the desired totally symmetric 
average energy expression.
By this construction, the Fock matrices and the resulting density matrices will be total 
symmetric and we will be able to use the Dacre & Elder method without further precautions.
TEST CALCULATIONS ON THE C AND SN ATOM
The average of configuration open shell method has been implemented in the MOLFDIR 
package, and test calculations on the C and Sn atom have been performed.
For the tests on the C atom, we used a large component basis (10s, 5p) contracted to (8s, 
4p); the small component basis consists of (5s, lOp, 5d) and is left uncontracted. For the 
tests on the Sn atom, we used a large component basis (15s, lip, 6d) contracted to (11s, 
9p, 5d); the small component basis consists of (1 Is, 17p, lid, 6f) contracted to (10s, 13p, 
lOd, 5f). Both total basis sets are kinetically balanced with respect to the their large 
component sets. The contraction coefficients are taken from an uncontracted relativistic Fock 
Dirac calculation.
In table 1 we list the total energies for the p2 - average from our results and from Desclaux 
(1973) for comparison. In this table NR stands for non-relativistic and FD stands for Fock 
Dirac. The large discrepancy with respect to Desclaux' numerical results in the non- 
relativistic total energy of Sn is due to the fact that we have contracted the basis according to 
the relativistic solutions.
In fig.l, fig. 2 and table 2 the results of calculations on several averages and states which 
can be handled by the program are presented. Note that some averages (for example, the 
Is2 2s2 2P1/21 2P3/21) cannot be handled yet since we have the restriction that all open 
shell orbitals should have the same fractional occupation number.
After performing the calculation on the first average (the level in the first column) we have 
used the average orbitals from this calculation to start the SCF calculation in the next 
column. In the figures, the relaxation energy (the change in total SCF energy by optimizing 
the orbitals) is given in parentheses. Likewise, in the third column the number in parentheses 
is the relaxation energy with respect to the results from the second column.

One expects that in the case of the carbon atom, where the orbital energies of the p 1/2 and 
P3/2 orbitals are almost identical, the ground state will not be the singlet p 1/22 state since the 
singlet coupling will lead to an increase in total energy. In the case of the tin atom, the orbital 
energy of the P1/2 is much lower than the orbital energy of the P3/2 orbital due to a large 
spin-orbit coupling, which over compensates the rise in energy due to the singlet coupling, 
so one expects the p 1/22 state to be the ground state. From the data in table 2 and figures 1 
and 2 it is clear that our results confirm these expectations.
It is interesting to note that all relaxation energies are extremely small, which justifies our use 
of average orbitals in these calculations.
CONCLUSIONS
We have found that we can efficiently use the Dacre & Elder scheme for performing self 
consistent average of configuration open shell calculations. Such calculations generate 
average orbitals for further CI studies, and yield interesting and useful information by 
themselves. The average of configuration formalism is shown to work extremely well for the 
test systems chosen.
Currently, we are (the program is) working on some more interesting systems and more 
production runs are planned in the near future. The code necessary to perform the 
projections to specific states by CI calculations in the open shell manifold is being 
developed.

ABSTRACT
General contraction is a well known means to reduce the computational effort for 
calculating electronic wave functions using basis set expansion techniques. In 
contrast to fixed contraction, optimal flexibility is available in constructing the 
"best" basis functions from basis set primitives. For relativistic four-component 
Dirac-Hartree-Fock calculations (and beyond), the variational space may consist 
of separate basis functions for the "Large” and "Small" component bases. The 
choice, and therefore also the contraction, of the Small component basis relative 
to the Large component basis is non-trivial. In particular in the case that "Kinetic 
Balance" is used to define the Small component basis relative to the Large 
component basis contraction imposes a severe problem, because the better the 
contraction of the Large component, the worse the kinetically balanced Small 
component counterpart becomes. Solutions to this dilemma are provided and 
have been implemented. Figures on reduction in the computational effort are 
given.
1. INTRODUCTION
In the eighties a growing interest has been developed into relativistic effects in 
chemical compounds (atoms, molecules and the solid state). In order to be able 
to calculate the relativistic electronic wave functions of atoms and molecules 
computer programs [1] have been devised that could tackle a specific category
The Effects of Relativity on Atoms, Molecules, and the Solid State
Edited by S. Wilson et al., Plenum Press, New York, 1991 
197

of systems, mainly atomic programs , both based on numerical integration of the 
Relativistic Hartree-Fock equations or on basis set expansion, and programs for 
linear molecules . Programs for general molecules have been very few , the only 
known production program to calculate complete all-electron four component 
Hartree-Fock-Dirac SCF wave functions with kinetic balance has been reported 
in 1985 [2]. Main reason is of course the tremendous computational effort to 
produce accurate solutions for such systems. Yet such calculations are 
becoming more and more feasible, both due to improved computer hardware 
and to theoretical developments. Here it is shown, that general contraction can 
be employed elegantly to reduce both the Large and Small component basis set 
sizes, yet keeping both sufficient variational freedom and kinetic balance.
2. KINETIC BALANCE
Although the Dirac operator and the Schrodinger operator are operators in 
different mathematical spaces, a correspondence exists between the solutions 
of the Dirac equation for large c, and the solutions of the Schrodinger equation. 
Without taking too much mathematical scrutiny, this is easily demonstrated by 
using the "method of the small components".
{c a.p - |3moc2 + q(|) }? = W Y 
(1)
is the Dirac equation. Shifting the energy by the rest mass energy moc2 of the 
electron and defining T'l and H's as the Large component and Small 
component of the positive energy solutions respectively, this equation, written in 
bi-spinor form becomes:
■q<b cu.p ippj rH'L 
co.p q(|)-2m0c2 H',. Ts
which in the limit c —> <*>,  becomes
{q<|)+ (2m0)’1(G.p)2}H'L= ETl
This is equal to the Schrodinger equation for the two-component 'Pl-
{q<|>4- (2m0)’1p2}'PL = ETl
(2)
(3)
(4)
198

since
(a.p)(o.p) = p2 
(5)
Thus 'Pl > the upper part of the Dirac solution, equals the Schrodinger solution 
'Pnr when c is infinite.
If a basis set expansion is used to approximate the solutions of this equation and 
basis sets {4>l} and {<J>s} are chosen to expand 'Pl and Ts then the matrix 
representation of the product (o.p)(o.p) in equation (5) no longer equals the 
matrix representation of p2, unless {<|>s} is carefully related to the basis {<J>l}- In 
particular, for a basis defined by
{0S} = {o-P W U {0,, i=1 ,k} 
(6)
equation (5) can be mimicked exactly:
[o-PIls [o.p]sL = [P2]ll 
(7)
provided the so constructed basis functions remain regular.
In practise, when using gaussian basis functions rne’ar2 in the Large component, 
we use the kinetically balanced Small component rn’1e’ar2 (if n >0) and rn+1e' 
ar2 gaussian basis functions as separate basis functions. This extends the basis 
{0s} beyond strict kinetic balance, which is established by chosing {0s} = {°P 
0l}. In the strict kinetic balance approach one would have to take only one 
combination of the rn'1e‘ar2 and rn+1e’ar2 gaussian basis functions.
Using kinetic balance guarantees that for c —> °° the Schrodinger limit is 
obtained even in a basis set approximation, but it does not guarantee a 
sufficiently good approximate solution for a finite value of c. In fact strict kinetic 
balance cramps the basis set more as relativistic effects grow. On the other 
hand, letting kinetic balance slip for, let's say, the most relativistic orbitals while 
keeping it for the intermediate and valence orbitals is tempting, but one may lose 
control over the process as a whole, risking spurious solutions to intrude.
3. GENERAL CONTRACTION
Basis set contraction is the technique by which primitive basis functions are 
combined into compound basis functions. The gain is a smaller number of 
improved basis functions at the expense of loss of variational freedom. The 
199

technique is applied frequently, in particular for molecular systems, using 
Gaussian primitives. In the usual sequential contraction the basis is partitioned 
in groups of functions, which are then combined into compound functions, using 
each primitive only once in any compound function. If, occasionally, a primitive is 
used more then once no use is made of this fact for reducing the subsequent 
calculations of integrals.
In a general contraction scheme [3], the primitives may (or may not) be 
partitioned into groups, but within each group each primitive may be used in 
more than one combination with the other primitives up to the number of 
primitives in that group. In subsequent integral calculations use is made 
explicitly of the fact that the primitives are the same for all combinations in a 
group. In this way, the primitives in the basis set can be exploited better. The 
necessary additional transformations during the calculation of the integrals over 
the contracted basis take hardly more computational effort, especially when the 
transformations can be carried out in core memory, which nowadays is usually 
large enough for this purpose.
4. CONTRACTION OF THE LARGE COMPONENT BASIS
Whether or not general contraction is applied, contraction of the large com­
ponent basis for a Dirac-based four-component electronic wave function 
calculation is straightforward and analogous to the corresponding non- 
relativistic Schrodinger basis. In principle the same considerations apply.
Our approach is to base the contraction coefficients for a molecular calculation 
on the results of previous atomic calculations in large basis sets. By using the 
occupied atomic orbitals as basis functions one keeps a good description of the 
inner orbitals in the molecule. For describing the binding region one can either 
add diffuse functions or use atomic victuals.
In this approach some differences occur with respect to a non-relativistic 
calculation. Implementation independent is the fact, that the innermost atomic 
solutions of the Dirac equation (using a point charge for the nucleus) are 
divergent at the origin. Representing such functions approximately by gaussian 
basis functions takes a lot of them. This situation becomes worse the larger the 
nuclear charge. This calls for heavier contraction involving more primitives (in 
total) than in a corresponding non-relativistic calculation.
Implementation dependent is the fact, that radially equal primitives will be used 
in different spin-angular symmetries (i.e. j = I ± 1/2, such as pv2 and P3/2, ds/2 
and d5/2 etc.), so that some "best" contraction for a j = I -1/2 ("P1/2") is not at all 
the optimum contraction for a j = I + 1/2 ("P3/2") basis function. General 
contraction can, in principle, be used to construct "best" basis functions for both j 
= 1-1/2 and j = I + 1/2 symmetries, using different contractions on the same 
primitives.
200

In our program an overlap criterion is used to decide whether the radial parts of 
the j = I -1/2 and j = I + 1/2 are significantly different. If they are the two functions 
are used as separate basis functions.
5. CONTRACTION OF THE SMALL COMPONENT BASIS
Kinetic balance for basis sets as defined in equation (6) is in principle 
independent of the fact that contraction is used. But applying the prescription for 
constructing a kinetically balanced basis set from a given Large component 
basis may cause unexpected problems if contracted gaussians are used instead 
of gaussian primitives. This has to do with the singular character of the 
innermost atomic orbitals. Suppose one systematically contracts one large 
component basis set function to represent the large component part of the 1 s-i/2 
orbital for successively improved (i.e. enlarged) basis sets. Continuing this 
process one should end up with successive improvements of the large 
component of the exact 1S1/2 orbital. The kinetically balanced small component 
function defined by o.p1s-|/2, however, diverges as r (T2) (with y= (k2- Z2/c2)1/2) 
and is therefore too singular to be used for calculating matrix elements 
(including the norm of the orbital). So the large components of nearby exact 
solutions cannot be used to construct the small component by kinetic balance.
In practice the situation is not at all so severe, but the better the individual 
contracted large component functions, the "worse" the individual kinetically 
balanced small component functions become, as is shown in table 1. Those 
results confirm our earlier results [2] but are in contradiction with those recently 
reported by Ishikawa et al. [4].

General contraction can help here too. Because usually more than two 
primitives are involved in a contraction, one even reduces the basis set size 
(relative to not contracting) if for each large component function two small 
component functions are included in the small component basis. One of these 
can be chosen kinetically balanced (securing kinetic balance for the basis as a 
whole), the other arbitrary, but orthogonal (or any linear combination of such 
solutions).
This way one keeps all the benefits of overall kinetic balance, while reducing the 
small component basis according to the same guide-lines as used for reducing 
the large component basis by the contraction.
In our approach the overlap is calculated between the small component parts (b) 
of the atomic SCF orbitals, calculated using an uncontracted basis, and the 
small component functions (a) which kinetically balance the present large 
component basis. If the overlap is large, only the kinetically balanced functions 
are used, if the overlap is too small both the atomic solutions and the kinetically 
balanced functions are used as separate variational small component functions. 
In this way one retains the complete atomic solution in the basis.
6. AN EXAMPLE
As an example to illustrate the method described above we have chosen two 
calculations on group IV tetrahydrides. More details of the bondlength 
optimization calculations on this type of molecules will be presented elsewhere.
The symmetry of this type of molecules is Tj and calculations on the molecules 
were carried out in this symmetry.
Atomic calculations were carried out in Oh symmetry, which is the highest 
symmetry point group implemented in the molecular program.

INTRODUCTION
Most electronic structure calculations on molecules are 
done with basis sets of Gaussian type functions (GTF). Multi­
center integrals over GTF are easily evaluated. However, 
Gaussians behave correctly at neither short nor long range; 
longer expansions in GTF than in exponential functions are 
required to attain similar accuracy. Much of the additional 
length is due to functions added simply to represent the region 
very near the nucleus. Primitive functions which represent this 
region may be grouped for the purpose of self-consistent field 
(SCF) and correlation correction procedures; the grouping is 
known as contraction. Contraction reduces integral storage 
requirements and time needed for SCF and post-SCF steps. 
Extensively characterized sets of contracted GTF for molecular 
calculations (Dunning and Hay, 1977; Wilson, 1987) exist.
The approach to contraction for molecular calculations has 
been articulated by Pople et al. (1980), Huzinaga (1984), and 
Dunning (1971). Functions which represent the core region are 
extensively contracted while valence functions are left 
uncontracted to provide flexibility in describing electronic 
changes which attend processes of bond formation or ionization. 
Even extensively contracted basis sets can, when corrected for 
truncation of the polarization series and for valence shell 
correlation effects, yield accurate bond dissociation and 
ionization energies (Pople and Curtiss, 1988).
In nonrelativistic atomic calculations which employ the 
basis set expansion method, exponential or Slater type functions 
(STF) are employed. STF can reproduce the cusp condition on the 
wavefunction at the origin, and they decay properly at long 
range. In relativistic atomic calculations, on the other hand, 
GTF basis sets have advantages. In heavy atoms the point 
nucleus approximation is often discarded in favor of a finite 
nuclear model. With the uniformly charged sphere model the 
wavefunction near the origin is Gaussian (Ishikawa and Quiney, 
1987). Basis sets of GTF used with that model can be more

Edited by S. Wilson et al., Plenum Press, New York, 1991 
207

compact than those used with a particle point model (Ishikawa et 
al., 1985). In addition basis sets of GTF do not exhibit the 
tendency to linear dependency shown by basis sets of STF 
(Wilson, 1988). Atomic calculations usually aim at accounting 
in some way for correlation effects. When those effects are 
treated by diagrammatic many-body perturbation theory (MBPT), 
the large virtual orbital coefficients characteristic of near 
linear dependence can introduce significant round-off effects 
into sums for third- and higher order diagrams.
The technique of basis set contraction has not been widely 
employed in atomic calculations. Atomic calculations which aim 
at high accuracy employ the largest practical basis sets. Yet, 
provided the error introduced by basis set contraction is kept 
to a fraction of the absolute error in an atomic calculation, 
contracted basis sets should provide a useful means of curtail­
ing computation time. Basis sets of GTF contain functions of 
high exponent which are needed to describe inner core dynamics 
in DF calculations but which are not needed to describe correl­
ation effects. This hypothesis has motivated us to study the 
use of contracted functions in accurate calculations.
Ishikawa et al. (1990) have recently reported calculations 
on neon, argon and germanium with basis sets derived for 
molecular calculations. Some results from that study appear in 
Table I. The basis sets employed are McLean and Chandler’s 
(1980). The contracted basis sets reproduce the relativistic 
correction well. However, they give relatively poor values for 
second and third order MBPT energy corrections, some in error by 
more than 30%. These basis sets have been derived to reproduce 
valence, but not core or core-valence, interactions. Caution 
must be taken in using them in calculations which must recover 
core correlation energy. Basis sets contracted for accurate 
calculations on atoms must rely on slightly different criteria 
than those contracted for molecular calculations. A basis set 
must have flexibility in the core as well as the valence region 
and must contain functions which have significant amplitude in 
all regions in which electrons are to be correlated.
To test the feasibility of doing accurate DF and MBPT 
calculations on atoms with contracted GTF basis sets, we have 
performed HF SCF and second and third order MBPT calculations on 
ground state argon with moderately large well-tempered (Matsuoka 
and Huzinaga, 1987) GTF basis sets of s- and p-type functions. 
The calculations have been repeated with several contracted 
versions of the basis sets. Finally, DF and second order MBPT 
calculations have been done with each basis set augmented by a 
partial-wave expansion in functions of up to h-type.
In a number of atomic calculations the major source of 
error may be laid to truncation of the partial-wave expansion, 
rather than, for instance, truncation of the perturbation 
series. The point at which the series in higher angular 
momentum functions is ended is ordinarily determined by the time 
available for computation. Basis sets contracted such that 
energy loss due to contraction is a minor source of error, may 
permit a longer partial wave expansion, hence a more accurate 
energy determination than would have been possible with an 
uncontracted basis set.

COMPUTATIONAL
The N-electron Hamiltonian for the DF and MBPT calculations 
is the Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonian. In its use the assumption is 
made that negative energy states are filled. In the MBPT 
calculations the Hamiltonian is partitioned (Miller and Plesset, 
1934) as
H = Ho + H*

Fd is a DF one-electron Hamiltonian. Basis sets were balanced 
as outlined by Ishikawa et al. (1985) and Quiney et al. (1987). 
Application to contracted GTF is a direct extension of the 
application to uncontracted basis sets. The large component 
radial orbitals, Pk(r), are expanded in a basis of contracted 
GTF, (XLki(r)):
Pk(r) = S XLki(r).

similarly expanded in a basis {XSkjJ;

The finite nucleus model described by Ishikawa et al. 
(1985) was employed in the relativistic calculations; a point 
nucleus model was assumed in the nonrelativistic calculations. 
A VN potential was used in the determination of the virtual 
orbitals in the relativistic calculations, and Goldstone 
diagrams (Goldstone, 1957) were summed to compute perturbation 
corrections. Summation was done within the subspace of the 
positive energy branch to eliminate the "continuum dissolution" 
problem, and the no-pair approximation has been used (Sucher, 
1980). The value of the speed of light used in the relativistic 
calculations was 137.0370 a.u.
Contraction coefficients were optimized using the HF SCF 
energy as criterion. Optimization was done iteratively on 
individual coefficients. Contractions were performed on s- and 
p-functions of the (16sllp) basis set indicated in Table II, and 
on p-functions of the (16sl2p) basis set. In each case, the 
contracted basis set was derived by grouping the functions of 
highest exponents.
DISCUSSION OF RESULTS
Table III shows the results of nonrelativistic calculations
210

on ground state argon. The (16sllp) and (16sl2p) basis sets 
yield energies 1-2 millihartrees shy of the Hartree-Fock 
limit, which has been estimated as -526.8175 a.u. (Froese- 
Fischer, 1977) and -526.818 a.u. (Desclaux, 1973). The 
calculated second order perturbation correction, E^, is about a 
millihartree above its s,p limit, for which there is no exact 
estimate. Contraction of the s-functions to [14s] and to [12s] 
results in degradations of SCF energy and in MBPT energies which 
are negligible compared to the error arising from truncation of 
the basis. Contraction of the p-set from (lip) or (12p) to 
[lOp] results in larger, still minor, errors in E2 and E^. The 
effects of s- and p- contractions is approximately additive.
Results of relativistic DF and second and third order MBPT 
calculations are presented in Table IV. Desclaux (1973) has 
reported an energy of -528.683 hartree as the numerical Dirac- 
Fock limit for ground state argon. As expected, contraction of 
the s-functions of the basis set has a slightly greater effect 
on the DF energy than on the HF. Relativistic E2 and E3, 
however, are no more affected than nonrelativistic. Contraction 
of the (12p) set to [lOp] has a greater effect on correlation 
corrections than does contraction of the (16s) to [12s]. The 
absolute error in relativistic E2 and E3 arising from contrac­
tion of the p-functions is about the same as the absolute error 
in nonrelativistic E2. The relative error is, therefore, 
smaller in the relativistic case. A calculation in which the 
partial-wave expansion is truncated at g- instead of h-type 
functions is reported to indicate the magnitude of error in 
truncating the basis in that respect. The contraction error 
found in even the most severe contraction we report here is 
small compared to the error arising from truncation of the 
partial-wave series.
The error introduced by contracting the p-functions is not 
reduced by expanding the primitive basis set from (lip) to (12p) 
before contraction. Contraction of the larger primitive basis 
set does, of course, result in lower SCF energies. Dyall (1990) 
has suggested that the relatively large error induced by 
contraction of the p-set may derive from the fact that these 
functions must not only describe the 2p orbital properly, but 
must also serve to correlate the Is electrons. That being the 
situation, correlation might be improved by increasing the 
number of contracted primitives by one, and adding to the basis 
a function solely for Is correlation. An alternative would be 
to contract the p-functions in two ways, one to describe the 2p 
orbital, the other to optimally correlate the Is.
We have explored the first of these alternatives. The 
(16sl2p) basis was contracted to [14s9p]. Then an additional p- 
function of exponent 583.39666, chosen to optimize E2, was added 
to produce the basis set labelled [14sl0p
*]
 in Table III. The 
nonrelativistic second and third order MBPT energies displayed 
in Table III do not improve upon those obtained with the 
[14sl0p] basis set of conventional construction. The idea 
presented in the comment merits further exploration, but the 
indication from this single calculation is that contraction of 
the s-set does not reduce the correlation energy significantly 
because the functions contracted are not in the active space; 
the p-functions are, and contraction is restricting the space.

The contractions reported here are modest, but they save 
enough time to permit a longer partial-wave series for second 
and third order MBPT calculations. The initial expectation that 
the s-set can be extensively contracted with negligible loss in 
accuracy is supported by this study. The p-set contains fewer 
high exponent functions, but a contraction can be made which 
induces an error of less than a percent in the correlation 
calculations. It will clearly be feasible to augment the higher 
angular momentum functions used to generate the virtual space 
with a contracted set of high-exponent GTF. The result will be 
correlation energy estimates which are more accurate than those 
to be obtained with uncontracted basis sets.

Much of the Is correlation comes from terms involving p functions, so that the inner p 
basis functions are playing a dual role. If they are contracted to describe the 2p 
orbital, the Is correlation will be adversely affected. Have you tried contracting the p 
functions for the 2p, and then adding an extra tight p function for Is correlation, or, 
contracting the innermost 3 or 4p functions to 2 functions, one for the 2p orbital, and 
one for Is correlation (by maximizing the radial overlap, for example).

RELATIVISTIC MANY-BODY PERTURBATION THEORY OF ATOMIC AND
MOLECULAR ELECTRONIC STRUCTURE
Stephen Wilson
Rutherford Appleton Laboratory
Chilton, Oxfordshire, 0X11 OQX, England
1. Introduction
Over the past thirty years, the many-body perturbation theory has emerged as one of 
the principal techniques for attacking the electron correlation problem in atoms and 
molecules. When formulated within the algebraic approximation (that is, the 
approximation in which the single particle state functions are parametrized by 
expansion in some finite set of basis functions transforming the integro-differential 
Hartree-Fock equations into a set of algebraic equations for the expansion 
coefficients) the many-body perturbation expansion (Wilson and Silver 1976, Wilson 
1984 and references therein) is a particularly accurate, flexible and efficient 
procedure.
For systems which contain heavy atoms, the non-relativistic quantum mechanics on 
which almost all contemporary treatments of electron correlation are based, is 
inadequate because the mean speed of core electrons is a substantial fraction of the 
speed of light, so that a fully relativistic electronic structure theory is required. The 
proper treatment of relativity and quantum electrodynamic effects will demand 
increasing attention in the years ahead, since these may be more important than 
electron correlation in heavy elements and are thus an essential ingredient of an ab 
initio electronic structure studies for the lower rows of the Periodic Table. A great 
deal of research over the past decade has been directed towards the development of a 
relativistic many-body perturbation theory formulated within the algebraic 
approximation. As illucidated in sections 2 and 3, problems of principle have been 
largely resolved and the remaining problems are primarily of a computational nature.
In this paper, we address some of the considerable computational demands of the 
relativistic electron correlation problem, giving particular attention to the molecular 
case. Relativistic molecular structure calculations are sometimes regarded as two 
orders of magnitude more demanding than the corresponding atomic structure 
calculations (Kim 1989). Even non-relativistic calculations of the electronic structure 
of molecular systems containing heavy atoms demand considerable computational 
resources.
This work compliments a series of papers devoted to the computational 
implementation of the non-relativistic many-body perturbation theory of electron 
correlation effects in atoms and molecules within the algebraic approximation. The

papers in the series (Silver 1978ab, Wilson 1978, Wilson and Silver 1979, Wilson and 
Saunders 1980, Moncrieff et al 1989, Baker et al. 1990a, see also Wilson 1981, 1983, 
1985, Baker et al 1990b) have been concerned with the design of efficient algorithms 
for the non—relativistic electron correlation problem.
The outline of this paper is as follows:— In section 2, we briefly describe the 
background to the relativistic electron correlation problem. An overview of the 
relativistic many-body perturbation theory is given in section 3 and some recent 
results described. In section 4 and 5, we discuss two of the computational aspects of 
relativistic many—body perturbation theory calculations. In section 4, we describe the 
a technique for the exploitation of the numerical linear dependence which is always 
present in the matrix of two-electron integrals. This technique can be used to reduce 
both the processing times and the storage requirements for relativistic electronic 
structure calculations. The use of parallel processing techniques is considered in 
section 5. By employing both vector and parallel processing execution rates in excess 
of 2000 million floating point operations per second can be achieved in 
non—relativistic many—body perturbation theory calculations on the most powerful 
contemporary computers. Finally, a summary is given in section 6.
2. The relativistic electron correlation problem
Following the development, in the mid 1950’s, of the many—body perturbation 
theory, by Brueckner (1955), Goldstone (1957), Hugenholtz (1957) and others (see, 
for example, March, Young and Samphanthar (1967)), from the quantum field theory 
of Feynman (1949), Dyson (1949) and Wick (1950), the first applications to atoms 
were reported, in the early 1960’s by Kelly (1963). He generated numerical solutions 
to the radial Hartree—Fock equations using finite differences, which he then used as a 
reference for a perturbative treatment of correlation effects. The integration over the 
continuum states formed the most demanding part of these calculations.
In the late 1960’s, the first applications of the many—body perturbation theory to the 
molecular electronic structure problem were also reported by Kelly (1969). He 
performed molecular calculations on systems containing only one non—hydrogenic 
atom, which was used as an expansion centre, and treated the hydrogen nuclei as 
additional perturbations.
Applications of the method to arbitrary molecular systems awaited the introduction 
of basis set expansion techniques, that is the algebraic approximation, of the type 
which are traditional in molecular electronic structure theory. This was achieved in 
the mid—1970’s by Kaldor (1975) and by Silver and his coworkers (Wilson and Silver 
(1976, 1977) and references therein).
Until the late 1970’s, the '’standard” approach to the correlation problem in 
molecules was the method of configuration mixing or configuration interaction. 
However, the rapid increase of the dimension of the hamiltonian matrix with 
increasing number of electrons in the system and number of basis functions, limited 
the applicability of the method to small systems and small basis sets unless the 
configuration expansion was severely truncated. A perturbative analysis indicates 
that only double excitations contribute to the energy in second and third order and 
thus limited "double excitation" configurations was a widely used approach. Today 
many—body perturbation theory has emerged as the standard approach. "Nowadays, 
many thousands of quantum chemistry calculations are performed on small and 
medium—sized molecules within the framework of perturbation theory. Such programs 
have become standard tools for many research workers ..." (Knowles, Somasundram, 
Handy and Hirao, 1985)
However, it soon became apparent that the major source of error in these calculations 
was attributable to basis set truncation effects. Research was first directed towards 
even-tempered and universal basis sets (Silver and Wilson 1978) and then systematic 
218

sequences of even-tempered basis sets (Wilson, 1980a, 1980&) and their completeness 
properties. For atoms and small molecules the errors associated with truncation of the 
basis set were reduced to the level where relativistic corrections became important for 
all but the lightest atoms and systems containing them (Wilson and Silver 1980, 
1982).
Relativistic effects are almost always introduced into molecular electronic structure 
studies by means of perturbation theory. This approach is frequently employed in 
atomic studies also. This was the approach which we began to explore in the early 
1980s (Cooper and Wilson, 1982a6), but then became convinced that it is essential to 
use methods which build in relativity at the orbital level from the outset if reliable 
results are required. At that time, some Dirac—Hartree—Fock calculations were 
performed for atoms but they employed finite difference methods which preclude their 
application to arbitrary molecular systems (Grant et al, 1980). Furthermore, because 
finite difference calculations do not afford a representation of the complete spectrum, 
a description of electron correlation effects was obtained by using a 
multi configuration wave function.
By invoking the algebraic approximation, that is by using a finite basis set, the 
relativistic electronic structure methods can not only be applied to molecules but also 
a representation of the complete Dirac spectrum is obtained allowing many-body 
perturbation theory treatment of correlation effects with all its theoretical and 
computational advantages. However, it has been known since the pioneering work of 
Kim (1968) that the use of basis set expansion techniques in relativistic calculations 
requires particular care. In a series of papers with the general title ’’The Dirac 
equation in the algebraic approximation" (Dyall, Grant and Wilson 1984abc, Quiney, 
Grant and Wilson 1985, 1987ab, Wood, Grant and Wilson 1984, Laaksonen, Grant 
and Wilson 1988), we have investigated this problem in detail.
The most frequently employed realization of the algebraic approximation in 
non—relativistic molecular calculations is the L.C.A.O. approximation in which 
molecular orbitals are approximated by some Linear Combination of Atomic 
Orbitals. In the relativistic case considerable care is required in the implementation 
of the algebraic approximation if the so-called "finite basis set disease" is to be 
avoided and a clean separation of the two branches of the spectrum is to be 
maintained. It emerges that this separation can be achieved if a spectral method is 
employed. According to the recent monograph by Mercier (1989), the term "Spectral 
methods is the name given to a numerical approach to the solution of partial 
differential equations. In this approach the solution to the equation is approximated 
by a truncated series of special functions which are eigenfunctions of some differential 
operator.". The key to the successful implementation of the algebraic approximation 
in relativistic calculations is to use basis functions which are themselves solutions of a 
one—electron Dirac equation. Now the separation into the two branches of the Dirac 
spectrum is determined both by the finite value of the speed of light and the strength 
of the external field. (Problems occur for superheavy atomic nuclei with very high Z 
(Greiner, Muller and Rafelski 1985) but are not considered here.) The admissible 
forms for the radial basis functions are constrained by these requirements. The basis 
sets which seems to have the most general applicability to relativistic atomic 
structure theory consist of the exponential—type functions

defined limit (Klahn and Bingel 1977ab, Schmidt and Ruedenberg 1979, Wilson 
1980ab)). The non—relativistic limit of the relativistic exponential-type function 
basis set is a ’’kinetically balanced” set of exponential—type functions (Stanton and 
Havriliak 1984, Quiney 1988, Wilson 1988). The dimension of the radial basis for 
symmetry—type k is M .

3. Relativistic many—body perturbation theory
In our first relativistic many—body perturbation theory calculation employing the 
algebraic approximation (Quiney, Grant and Wilson, 1985), it was demonstrated in a 
study of a simple hydrogenic model problem that the discrete representation of the 
complete spectrum, comprising the bound states and the positive— and 
negative-energy continua, provided by the analytic basis set method greatly 
facilitates the evaluation of the algebraic sum-over—states expressions corresponding 
to each of the diagrams (Quiney, Grant and Wilson 1989abc).
In further work, we presented calculations within the independent electron model 
using both the Dirac—Coulomb and the Dirac—Breit hamiltonians (Quiney, Grant and 
Wilson 1987ab, 1989abc). It has been known for many years that the 
frequency—independent Breit interaction may be incorporated into the self—consistent 
field equations for atoms, but this approach has until recently been regarded as too 
demanding computationally in finite—difference calculations; first-order perturbation 
theory has been the method of choice. In the algebraic approximation, we have 
demonstrated that the self-consistent treatment of the Breit interaction is preferred 
to the usual method which treats the Breit interaction as a first-order perturbation 
to the Dirac-Coulomb operator.
Relativistic many—body calculations based on the Dirac—Coulomb hamiltonian and 
including energy shifts which arise through the creation of virtual electron—positron 
pairs have been reported by Quiney (1988) and Quiney, Grant and Wilson (1987b, 
1989ab). Very recent calculations (Quiney, Grant and Wilson 1990), which are 
discussed further below, reveal that the terms in the perturbation expansion 
corresponding to the self-consistent modification of the one-electron orbitals due to 
the Breit interaction result in the most significant relativistic many—body effect.
The principal advantage of the algebraic approximation technique described here is 
that the two—electron integrals over the basis functions which are required in 
many-body theory may be evaluated both efficiently and accurately. The 
transformation of the integrals over basis functions into relativistic matrix elements 
may be performed using linear algebra techniques, so that the scheme may be 
programmed for high performance on vector and parallel processing computers 
(Quiney 1990, Wilson 1990). Many of the developments embodied in non—relativistic 
electronic structure computer codes (Wilson 1990) are transferred to the relativistic 
method without substantial modification. We suggest that this method has 
advantages over the alternatives (e.g. Johnson and Sapirstein 1986, Salomonsson and 
Oster 1989) on the grounds of simplicity and computational efficiency.
The negative-energy states are taken to be filled in the true vacuum state. The 
events which occur in a relativistic many-body system are conveniently described 
within the particle—hole formalism in which the negative energy continuum and

occupied positive energy states are taken to be below the Fermi level. Unlike the 
non—relativistic particle—hole formalism, the relativistic extension involves no 
restriction on particle number because virtual excitations from the negative energy 
sea must be considered. If we take the electron-electron interaction to be 
instantaneous, that is either just the Coulomb interaction or the sum of the Coulomb 
interaction and the frequency-independent Breit interaction, then the diagrammatic 
representation of the second-order energy for a closed—shell system is given in 
Figures 1 and 2. In Figure 1 the second order diagrams involving singly excited 
intermediate states are shown whilst in Figure 2 the second order diagrams which 
involve doubly excited intermediate states are displayed. In order to keep the time 
ordering of events obvious when working beyond the no virtual pair approximation, it 
is most convenient to use "open” Goldstone diagrams. In these diagrams, upwards 
directed lines are used to represent single particle states in the positive—energy 
branch of the spectrum and downward directed lines represent states in the 
negative-energy branch. All of the diagrams given in Figures 1 and 2 arise in second 
order when an arbitrary single determinantal function is employed as a reference for 
the perturbation expansion.
Diagrams (a)—(d), which arise in the no virtual pair approximation, describe single 
excitations creating a hole in the positive—energy branch below the Fermi level and a 
particle above the Fermi level. Diagrams (e)—(h), which represent effects that can be 
said to go beyond the no virtual pair approximation, describe the formation of a 
virtual electron—positron pair by creation of a hole in the negative-energy branch of 
the spectrum. Diagrams (i)-(l) involve double excitations. Diagram (i) arises in the 
no virtual pair approximation, diagrams (j) and (k) describes the creation of one 
virtual pair, and diagram (1) the creation of two virtual pairs.
For calculations using a bare nucleus reference function, the diagrams containing the 
single—particle potential, represented by a cross, do not arise. For calculations based 
on a Dirac—Hartree—Fock—Coulomb or Dirac-Hartree—Fock— Breit reference function 
there is not an exact cancellation between diagrams containing "bubbles” and 
’’crosses” because the polarization of the negative-energy sea is not accommodated 
within the self-consistent field potential. Labzovskii (1971) pointed out that although 
the familiar cancellation of single—particle insertions occurs within the 
positive-energy branch of the Dirac spectrum when the Dirac-Hartree-Fock 
(—Coulomb/—Breit) method is employed, this cancellation does not occur in the 
negative-energy branch.

Very recently, we have reported relativistic and non—relativistic many—body 
perturbation theory calculations using systematically constructed basis sets of 
exponential—type functions for the ground state of the argon atom (Quiney, Grant 
and Wilson 1990). The relativistic calculations employed both the Dirac-Coulomb 
and the Dirac—Breit hamiltonian.
At the independent electron model level, the difference between the 
Dirac—Hartree—Fock—Coulomb energy and the Dirac—Hartree—Fock—Breit energy 
was found to be to 0.132365 hartree. The difference between the sum of 
Dirac—Hartree—Fock—Coulomb energy and the first-order Breit energy and the 
Dirac—Hartree—Fock—Breit energy is only 40 //hartree. The effect of the Breit 
interaction is most pronounced in the spinor energies and in the shapes of the spinors 
as reflected in the expectation values of rk. For the inner shell spinors, changes of 
about 0.1% are observed in the expectation values of rk when the Breit interaction is 
included. A similar conclusion was reached by Lindroth et al (1989) in studies of 
hyperfine interactions.

analysis of the second-order pair energies obtained from relativistic many-body 
perturbation theory calculations using the Dirac-Coulomb hamiltonian and the 
Dirac—Breit hamiltonian, respectively. Both relativistic calculations used the no 
virtual pair approximation.
Second-order pair correlation energies obtained from a non-relativistic calculation 
and from relativistic calculations employing basis sets of functions with s, p, d and f 
symmetry (the largest basis sets considered by Quiney, Grant and Wilson (1990)) are 
displayed in Figures 8, 9 and 10, respectively. In these Figures, the ordinate has a 
linear scale in millihartree.
The differences between the second—order pair correlation energies for the ground 
state of the argon atom from calculations using the Schrodinger hamiltonian and 
those using the Dirac—Coulomb hamiltonian are shown in Figure 11. The basis sets 
employed in these calculations contained exponential—type functions of s, p, d and f 
symmetry type. In Figure 12, the differences between the second-order pair 
correlation energies from calculations using the Schrodinger hamiltonian and those 
using the Dirac—Breit hamiltonian are shown. The differences between the 
second-order pair correlation energies from calculations using the Dirac-Coulomb 
hamiltonian and those using the Dirac—Breit hamiltonian are shown in Figure 13.
Comparing the results of the relativistic calculation using the Dirac-Coulomb 
hamiltonian with the non-relativistic results, the effects of relativity on the 
correlation energy can be explained in terms of competing effects due to shielding and 
the relative phases of the large and small components of the relativistic wave 
functions (Lindroth 1987, Quiney, 1987). However, the Dirac—Coulomb hamiltonian 
accounts for only a small fraction of the total relativistic correction to the correlation 
energy, though it is, of course, this hamiltonian that has been used as a reference in 
all previous studies of relativistic correlation effects. The bulk of the relativistic 
correction to the correlation energy comes from single—particle insertions (one 
Coulomb and one Breit photon diagrams) which are not in the Dirac—Hartree—Fock— 
Coulomb basis. These diagrammatic terms are summed through all orders in the 
Dirac—Hartree—Fock—Breit approximation, which has the additional advantage that 
evaluation of terms in the relativistic many—body perturbation series is simplified, 
particularly in higher orders.
The terms in the partial wave expansion for for the relativistic shift associated with 
s2 pairs vary approximately as 1/Z2, where I is the orbital angular momentum of the 
intermediate states. This should be compared with the 1/Z4 behaviour of the partial 
wave expansion for s2 pairs in the non-relativistic case. The effects of relativity on 
the valence spinors are almost entirely accounted for by the Dirac—Coulomb 
hamiltonian. For the core spinors and for the interaction between the core and the 
valence spinors, it is necessary to use the Dirac—Breit hamiltonian.
The total non-relativistic second—order many—body perturbation theory energy at 
the f—limit is —638680 //hartree. Within the no virtual pair approximation, the 
Dirac—Coulomb second-order correlation energy is —639424 //hartree, so that the 
relativistic correction is —744 //hartree. This difference arises from the use of 
relativistic single-particle states, but the same two-body interaction. The 
corresponding relativistic calculation using the Dirac—Breit operator gives a total 
second-order energy of —646206 //hartree, which represents a relativistic shift of 
-7526 //hartree, which is an order of magnitude larger than the Dirac-Coulomb 
many—body correction. Although roughly half of the Dirac—Breit many-body 
correction is associated with the Is2 pair, the remainder arises through subtle 
interactions between the core and the valence orbitals.
Quiney, Grant and Wilson (1990) conclude that the terms in the perturbation 
expansion corresponding to the self-consistent modification of the one—electron 
orbitals due to the Breit interaction result in the most significant relativistic 
many-body effect. Furthermore, this studies underlines that fact that the relativistic 
many-body perturbation theory using the algebraic approximation is a tractable

4. Linear dependence in the two-electron integral matrix
The computational demands of the various stages of a molecular electronic structure 
calculation are quite considerable both in terms of the processing time used and the 
storage requirements. The number of two-electron integrals increases as the fourth 
power of the number of basis functions which in turn influences all subsequent phases 
of the computation. The dependence of each stage on the number of basis functions, 
n, is summarized in Figure 14.
Consider, by way of example, the computational demands that would arise in a 
calculation for the deep red complex formed when rhodium chloride and stannous 
chloride solutions are mixed; the complex is shown in Figure 15. It contains 20 atoms 
and 532 electrons. Each of the atoms can be accurately described by a basis set 
containing say 18 functions of s symmetry plus functions of higher angular symmetry 
which, for simplicity, we ignore in the present discussion. The number of 
two-electron integrals arising in a non—relativistic calculation or in the [LL|LL] 
block of a relativistic calculation is
M = m(m+l)/2, where m = n(n-J-l)/2.
Putting n = 18 gives the number of two-electron integrals arising in the atomic case: 
M = 14,706. Putting n = 20 x 18 = 360 gives the number of integrals arising in the 
molecular case:— M = 2,111,232,690. When the number of basis functions increases by 
a factor of 20 the number of two-electron integral increases by a factor in excess of 
143,562. In a relativistic calculation, the problem is compounded by the fact that 
integral blocks of the type [LL|SS], [LSILS], [LS | SL] and [SS|SS] have to be 
considered in addition to the [LL|LL] block (Wilson 1988).
The traditional approach to the construction of basis sets for molecular electronic 
structure calculations has been (i) to optimize the exponents, (k, for atomic 
self-consistent field calculations; that is, using the object function
Escf = Escf((i, £2, ••• ? Cn)
find those exponents which minimize the energy; (ii) add polarization functions to 
describe the deformation of the atom in the molecule; (Hi) add correlation functions. 
The procedure is somewhat empirical and it is not surprising that much of the art of 
molecular electronic structure calculations lies in the selection of appropriate basis 
functions.
The first step towards a more rational approach to basis set construction was taken 
by Ruedenberg and his coworkers (Ruedenberg, Raffenetti and Bardo 1973), who, 
building on earlier work by Reeves (1963), introduced the even-tempered basis set. In 
these basis sets the orbital exponents are taken to form a geometric series
(1k = (ai)(/?i)k, ai>0, /?i>l, k=l,2,...,n
The parameters ai and (h are optimized for each atom and each 1—shell. In later work 
it was shown that there is little loss in accuracy if a and 0 are taken to be 
independent of 1. As Raffenetti pointed out in 1973
The introduction of even-tempered orbitals has opened the possibility of determining 
analytic SCF functions for heavy atoms with relatively modest computing effort
In 1978, Silver and Wilson employed even-tempered basis sets in electron correlation 
studies. Such calculations demand larger basis sets than self-consistent field studies. 
These large basis sets have a flexibility which enables them to used for different 
235

atoms and differing molecular environments. This leads to the concept of a universal 
basis set. Many—body perturbation theory calculations using universal basis sets have 
yield some of the most accurate correlation energies for small molecules (Wilson and 
Silver, 1980,1982).
Most molecular electronic structure calculations reported in the 1970’s employed a 
single basis set selected in some ad hoc fashion. With the advent of even-tempered 
and universal basis sets the resulting improvement in the accuracy of electronic 
structure calculations gave impetus to the study of the convergence of calculated 
energy with increasing size of basis set. Ruedenberg and his coworkers introduce the 
idea of a systematic sequence of even-tempered basis sets for use in atomic 
self—consistent—field studies. They generated even-tempered exponents by means of 
the empirical prescription
In In /?i = bi In ni + bf
In aa = ai ln(/?i-l) + af
which ensure that
Cmin = &0 } 0) Cmax = OL011 1 
0 1 1
since
a—>0, 
0 —>1, 
^-4od
The parameters ai, af, bi and bf are determined from atomic self-consistent-field 
calculations. The use of systematic sequences of even-tempered basis sets of 
Gaussian-type functions was found to afford atomic self-consistent field energies 
which were often more accurate than those given by finite difference calculations.
In correlation energy calculations, not only is an accurate representation of the 
occupied orbitals required but also of the virtual spectrum. The use of universal 
systematic sequences of even-tempered basis sets can be shown to lead to
ai(ni) = {/?i(ni) - l)/(/?i(m—1) - l)}ai ai(ni-l)
Mi(ni) = {ni/(ni-l)}bl Zn /?i(ni—1)
The set of exponential-type, exp(-(k r), or Gaussian—type, exp(-(k r2), basis 
functions generated according to the prescriptions given above can be shown to be 
asymptotically complete in the limit n —> ® since the generalized Muntz—Szasz 
theorem given by Klahn (1985) holds; that is
lim y <k(n)/(l + {<k(n)}2) = oo 
n—>od
It is easily demonstrated that for fixed a and 0 this limit is finite. In Figure 16, the 
logarithms of the orbital exponents obtained with fixed a and 0 are compared with 
those generated by means of the recursions given above. Each of the rows in this 
Figure corresponds to a basis set in the sequence and is labelled by n, the number of 
functions it contains. It should be noted that for the exponents generated by the 
above recursions that the range of the exponents increases with n, the lower limit 
decreasing to zero and the upper limit becoming infinite. Furthermore, the 
distribution of the exponents between these two limits becomes increasingly dense as 
n is increased.

Pjk(r) = (Pj(r) ¥>k(r)
In the case of an even-tempered basis set of exponential—type functions centred on 
the same point, these charge distributions assume the form
exp((j r) exp((k r) = exp(-{(j + (k} r)
In Figure 17, the logarithm of the exponent arising in each of the charge 
distributions, In {(j + £k}> is plotted for the same universal systematic sequence of 
even-tempered basis sets that was employed in the generation of Figure 16. Each row 
in Figure 17 corresponds to a particular basis set in the sequence and is labelled by 
the number of functions, N, it contains. Figure 17 suggests a great deal of linear 
dependence in the two-electron integral matrix. It should noted that whilst the 
exponents for the basis functions range from a/3 to a/?11, the exponents for the charge 
distributions range from 2a/3 to 2a^n. However, there are n(n+l)/2 charge 
distribution exponents compared with only n orbital exponents, which implies that 
n(n-l)/2 of the former are redundant.
If the charge distribution exponents are defined as follows
Cjk(n) = <j(n) + (k(n)
then the set of charge distributions can be shown to be asymptotically complete in 
the limit n —> oo since the generalized Muntz—Szasz theorem again holds
lim y (jk(n)/(l + {(jk(n)}2) =«> 
n—4qd
n of the charge distribution exponents can be deleted and asymptotic completeness is 
maintained. One choice is to retain those distributions for which j=k giving
lim y <jj(n)/(l + {<jj(n)}2) = 
n—>oo "
lim y 2(j(n)/(l + 4{(j(n)}2) =00 
n—>od
Other possible choices are considered elsewhere (Wilson 1990).
The two—electron integrals may be arranged in a symmetric, positive definite matrix 
of dimension (n(n+l))/2
Vij,ki i>j k>l (ij)>(kl)
The computational linear dependence amongst the charge distributions involved in 
the two—electron integral matrix can be exploited by a Cholesky decomposition in 
which the matrix Vy ,ki is written in the form
Vjj ?kl ~ bjj,mn Lmn,kl
239

where L is a lower triangular matrix and is its transpose. If linear dependence is 
present in V then the summation index mn will run for considerably less than its full 
range 1 to (n(n+l))/2. An approximation to V may be written
v
V ' ij J kl - Lij,mn linnjkl
mn
where v is the effective numerical rank of the two-electron integral matrix.
In Figure 18, the effective numerical rank of the two-electron integral matrix is 
shown for a universal systematic sequence of one—centre even-tempered basis sets of 
Gaussian-type functions of s symmetry. The upper curve shows the full rank of the 
two-electron integral matrix, that is
m = (n(n+l))/2
as a function of the size of the basis set on a logarithmic scale. The lower curves show 
the effective numerical rank, z/, when a tolerance of 10^, t= 4,5,6,7,8,9,10 is 
demanded.
The total number of two-electron integrals arising in a calculation employing a basis 
set of n functions is
M = (m(m+l))/2
The number of elements of L which have to be stored for a two-electron integral 
matrix of effective numerical rank v is
N = M — (m — z/) (m - v +l)/2
and the percentage storage requirements are thus
P - [N/M] x 100%.
For a tolerance of 10 ~8, P is shown as a function of the number of basis functions, n, 
in Table 1. It can be seen that as the basis set is systematically extended the 
percentage of the integral matrix that is actually required decreases monotonically. 
For a basis set of twenty functions the integral storage requirements are reduced to 
less than 25% of the length of the original integral list. The larger the basis set the 
more accurate is the calculation and the greater then percentage reduction in the 
computer storage demands.
Linear dependence in the two—electron integral matrix can be exploited in both 
non—relativistic and relativistic electronic structure calculations. It can reduce the 
number of integrals that have to be evaluated and stored in the integral evaluation 
phase of the calculation. It can reduce the number of integrals that have to be 
processed in subsequent self-consistent field and many—body perturbation theory 
calculations.
The reductions both in computer time in generating and processing the two-electron 
integral list are even more significant in relativistic calculations than they are in 
non-relativistic counterparts. Firstly, the number integrals arising in the relativistic 
case is significantly greater than the non—relativistic case and thus a larger number of 
integral evaluations can actually be avoided. Secondly, in relativistic electronic 
structure calculations, the integrals involving the small component basis functions are 
not required to such a high accuracy as those involving the large component basis 
function for a given accuracy in the final calculation energy or expectation value.
The most demanding phase of a low order many—body perturbation theory 
calculation is the four—index transformation of the two-electron integrals

5. Parallel processing in many—body perturbation theory
The performance of high quality electronic structure calculations, particularly for 
molecules, has always depended on the effective exploitation of state-of-the-art 
•computing machines. The importance of vector processing in many—body 
perturbation theory calculation was recognized at an early stage (Wilson and 
Saunders 1980, Guest and Wilson 1981). Each of the summations which arise in the 
sum—over—states perturbations expression for the energy coefficients can be written 
as a matrix multiplication which can be very efficiently performed on machines such
242

as the CRAY X—MP and Y-MP using the machine coded routine MXMA which 
accumulates results in a vector register rather than constantly reading then writing 
intermediate results to memory which is the case when FORTRAN code is employed. 
For example, in non—relativistic calculations of the fourth—order triple excitation 
energy components, which are particularly demanding since they scale as the seventh 
power of the number of basis functions, the computational kernel takes the form
CALL MXMA(D2,1 ,NVIRT,DI,1 ,NVIRT,T1,1 ,NVIRT, NVIRT,NVIRT,NOCC) 
CALL MXMA (E2,1, NVIRT, D1,1, NVIRT,T2,1, NVIRT, NVIRT, NVIRT,NO CC) 
CALL MXMA(D2,1,NVIRT,El,1,NVIRT,T3,1,NVIRT, NVIRT,NVIRT, NOCC 
CALL MXMA(E2,1,NVIRT,El, 1,NVIRT,T4,1,NVIRT, NVIRT,NVIRT,NOCC)
where DI, D2, El and E2 are direct and exchange two-electron integrals, including 
denominator factors in the case of DI and El, and Tl, T2, T3 and T4 are 
intermediates.
In addition to a vector processing capability, modern supercomputers increasingly 
employ parallel processing. The CRAY X—MP has a maximum of four processors 
whilst the CRAY Y—MP can have up to eight vector processors working in parallel. 
The linked diagram theorem of many—body perturbation theory ensures that the 
many—electron problem is effectively decoupled into a series of smaller problems each 
of which can be treated on a separate processor. Many—body perturbation theory 
calculations are therefore well suited to a parallel processing environment. The 
effective exploitation of the parallel processing capabilities of modern supercomputers 
is clearly of central importance for the effective implementation of a relativistic 
many-body perturbation theory of molecular electronic structure.
Now the benefits of parallel processing on the CRAY X—MP and Y—MP systems have 
until recently largely been seen in terms of what might be termed the ”1/Ncpu rule”, 
where Ncpu denotes the number of processors in the system (Taylor and Bauschlicher 
1987, Taylor and Bauschlicher and Schwenke 1989). In this model, the use of more 
than 1/Ncpu th of a scarce resource (for example, memory) requires that one uses 
more one processor, otherwise it is considered that other jobs will be unlikely to 
saturate the remaining processors because of shortage of the resource. Taken to an 
extreme, if a particular computer program uses all of the available memory, then it 
243

should try to use all of the available processors. An argument in favour of parallel 
processing even when memory requirements are small has recently been presented 
(Baker et al 1990a). It has been estimated that it is desirable to have about two 
executing processes per processor to ensure that no idle time accumulates, largely 
because of wait times for input/output. This is very difficult to ensure given the type 
of workload (many large memory heavily input/output bound jobs) often 
encountered. A single processor-bound small memory four—way parallel processing 
job, with a dynamically balanced load and running at low scheduling priority is 
capable of consuming all potentially idle cycles on all the processors on CRAY X-MP 
and CRAY Y—MP system, with little disturbance to the flow of other work, and a 
greatly improved overall throughput. A similar argument has recently been presented 
for the use of CRAY "micro-tasking” facilities (Bieterman 1989).
On shared memory architecture parallel computers, static load balancing of the work 
assigned to each process is usually far from optimal. This is not only because it is 
often impossible to divide the computation in such a way that the load is exactly 
balanced but also because each processor is not normally dedicated to a single user; 
instead its computing power is shared out amongst a number of users. The effective 
computing power delivered to a given user (or a parallel process of that user) by a 
given processor is largely unpredictable, because it depends upon what other users are 
doing at any given time. Thus instead of requiring that all processors carry out an 
identical workload, it is better to require that each processor be given a workload 
commensurate with its effective power; the latter is far from constant with time, so 
that it is necessary to feed work to the processors at a rate which is similarly time 
dependent. This may be accomplished by the technique of "dynamic load balancing", 
using a "global index" under control of a "lock".
To illustrate these ideas consider the following simple example. Suppose the 
sequential version of the code has the form:
DO 11 = 1,T
... Execute task I
1 CONTINUE
Using CRAY X—MP and CRAY Y—MP multi-tasking software the dynamically 
balanced parallel version using N processes would be of the form shown in Figure 20.
In this code, NCPUMAX should be initialized to a value greater than or equal to N. 
ITASK is a 3 by NCPUMAX array, each column of which is used by the CRAY 
system to identify a given process and is initialized in DO 9. LOCKI is a "lock" used 
to control unique access to the global index, I, the latter being initialized to 1. The 
call to LOCKASGN is required to declare that LOCKI will be used as a lock. A call 
to TSKSTART initiates a parallel process ("forking"), the corresponding call to 
TSKWAIT creates a "barrier" causing the parent process to wait until the indicated 
parallel process is complete. TSKSTART/TSKWAIT thus correspond to the system 
process creation/termination mechanism. During the parallel phase of the job N 
copies of subroutine PROCESS are in execution. On the CRAY system PROCESS is 
made re-entrant, circumventing the need to actually make the copies. PROCESS 
then has the form shown in Figure 21.
In the code displayed in Figure 21, LOCKON is called to acquire unique access to the 
global index I which is being protected by LOCKI; if another parallel copy of 
PROCESS calls LOCKON whilst such unique access is granted, the second copy will 
be halted until the first copy releases access with a call to LOCKOFF. If I is greater 
than T then all tasks have been completed, and after releasing LOCKI, PROCESS 
returns to the parent process, the latter checking for this by its call to TSKWAIT. 
Otherwise a local copy of the global index is taken in ITEMP, and the global index 
updated, after which LOCKI is released. The task indicated by ITEMP (note that

the global index itself is not used in this phase since it may be updated by another 
parallel copy of PROCESS) is then carried out, after which the routine branches to 
the first executable statement to see if work remains. Obviously, if task execution is 
controlled by a nest of loops (in the present work there is a four—fold nest of loops 
over the tasks), then all loop indices associated with the nest should be treated as a 
shared locked data structure (Saunders 1990) and accessed under control of a lock. 
The overheads associated with the above implementation are T Or, where OT is the 
time to acquire/release LOCKI. This is of the order of a few microseconds on the 
CRAY X—MP system. Of course, if the individual tasks are small, then contention for 
access to the lock will be correspondingly large, leading to a reduction in the average 
width of parallelism; however all the suggested methods have problems in this small 
task size limit. When the task size is large (as in the present work), so that the 
overheads can be largely ignored, the decisive advantage of the procedure described 
above over alternative strategies is that each process generates only as much work as 
its corresponding processor is able to deal with (it is dynamically balanced), and is for 
this reason the chosen strategy in the present work. When the processors are 
dedicated, all will perform an identical amount of work, as in the statically balanced 
case. In fact, given a reasonably large number of tasks, dynamic balance produces an 
approximately even loading over dedicated processors even if the tasks are not of 
equal size. The major disadvantage of dynamic balance is that it requires the use of 
locks, hardware support for which is unavailable (and software emulations expensive 
probably requiring that all processing of a lock be carried out by one processor which 
communicates its results to the other processors by message passing) on all current 
independent memory machines. Its use is thereby restricted to shared memory 
parallel architectures, which all provide hardware supported locks. We here observe 
that current shared memory systems such as are available from CRAY, IBM, 
Convex, Alliant, Sequent, Encore and FPS are capable of running each processor in 
multi-user mode (and thus require dynamic balance and the associated locks for 
optimal performance). However, the operating systems of the independent memory 
machines (exemplified by those available from Intel, Meiko or Suprenum) are 
presently capable of running a given processor in only single-user mode; it seems to 
us that the ease of use of such machines in a (as yet unavailable) multi-user per 
processor environment would be greatly facilitated by the provision of hardware 
locks, and program portability between shared and distributed memory systems 
thereby greatly enhanced.
The programming strategy described above has been employed in the evaluation of 
the most computationally demanding of the fourth order terms in the non-relativistic 
many—body perturbation expansion, namely, those involving triply excited 
intermediate states. In a dedicated environment, execution rates in excess of 820 
MFLOPS have been observed on the four processor CRAY X—MP/416 computer, 
whilst on the CRAY Y-MP/832, which has eight processors, execution rates of 2,230 
MFLOPS have been obtained. Executions rates of this order allow the efficient use of 
large basis sets which in turn is reflected in the improved accuracy of calculation. The 
dynamic load balancing technique will clearly enable the efficient implementation of 
relativistic many—body perturbation theory.
6. Conclusions
The relativistic many-body perturbation theory using the algebraic approximation 
affords a tractable scheme yielding a systematic approach to the calculation of 
relativistic correlation effects in atoms and molecules.
In this paper, we have considered, in detail, some of the computational problems 
which arise in the relativistic many—body perturbation theory when the algebraic 
approximation is invoked.
In section 4, we have shown how the numerical linear dependence in the two—electron 
246

integral matrix can be exploited in molecular electronic structure calculations. 
Although useful in both non-relativistic and relativistic studies, the techniques 
described in section 4 are particularly useful in the relativistic case because of the 
greater number of two-electron integrals which arise.
In section 5, we have shown how the parallel processing capabilities of modern 
supercomputers can be effectively harnessed in many-body perturbation theory 
calculations. We have shown that each diagrammatic term in the many—body 
perturbation expansion can be decomposed into a set of partial contributions which 
can be computed by an algorithm structured around the matrix multiply operation, 
so that conventional vector processors can be driven nearly optimally. We have also 
shown that the evaluation of the partial contributions may proceed entirely 
independently, so that the theory is well suited for implementation on a parallel 
processing system with either a distributed or shared memory. ’’Static" and 
’’dynamic" procedures for balancing the load amongst the parallel processors have 
been considered, and we have concluded that static balance is probably best for 
independent memory architectures in their present state of development. However, in 
the case of typical shared memory systems, which normally operate in multi-user 
mode, dynamic balance is to be preferred, since it allows one to partition the work 
amongst the processors according to their ability to deal with it. In a dedicated 
environment close to linear speed-up with number of processors was observed, there 
being little degradation due to memory bank conflicts or other overheads of the 
parallel implementation, and rate of computations of greater then 2,230 Mflops were 
observed on a CRAY Y-MP/832 machine.
It is clear that the techniques described in this paper can be exploited in relativistic 
electronic structure calculations based on the many-body perturbation expansion. 
They may be used in atomic calculations which go beyond the application to the 
argon atom ground state described in section 3 and take account of finite nuclear size 
effects, the Lamb shift, and higher order terms in the relativistic many-body 
perturbation theory. They will be essential in applications to molecular systems if 
adequate precision is to be obtained. It has recently been demonstrated (Wells and 
Wilson 1989, Thompson and Wilson 1990) that sub //hartree accuracy can be attained 
in non—relativistic molecular structure calculations.

Introduction
Practising solid state physicists are accustomed to using two dramatically 
different approaches to describing the electron 'glue' that holds the atomic 
nuclei together. The first pictures the solid as made up of atoms and talks of 
outer, valence, electrons hopping from site to site on an infinite lattice. This 
mode of thought leads to tight-binding models defined in language of local 
atomic like orbitals (LCAO) and the terms of discussions are very close to the 
parlance of quantum chemistry [McWeeny 1989]. The other approach begins 
with a model in which the positive charges of the nuclei are smeared out into a 
uniform, positively charged background for the negatively charged, 
interacting many electron system and proceeds to correct this, 'jellium', model 
by reintroducing the point charges of the nuclei [Ashcroft and Mermin 1976]. 
Usually, this second step is accomplished using the Density Functional Theory 
of Kohn and Sham [Kohn, W. and Vashista, P. 1983] and the notion of an 
atomic like object never enters the discussion. In a book dedicated to the 
common problems of atomic, molecular and solid state physics it may seem

255

perverse to follow the second line of thought. Nevertheless, it should be 
excused on the practical grounds that much of the most interesting modem 
applications of Relativistic Quantum Mechanics in condensed matter physics 
uses this second language and hence a useful introduction to the solid state 
oriented contributions will have to do likewise. Moreover, it is hoped that 
even the readers more at home within the conceptual framework of quantum 
chemistry may find the change in the habit of thought and the mode of 
presentation an interesting diversion.
To motivate an interest in effects of relativity on the electronic structure of 
solids, consider the non-interacting jellium model. Recall that the single 
particle states are plain waves, ~e* ', and, according to the Pauli exclusion 
principle, in the ground state, they are filled up to the Fermi surface as shown
in Fig. 1. The velocity of each electron is V- = and hence there can be 
only two electrons in the system which are stationary. They are the spin up 
and spin down electrons in the k = 0 state. The rest must be moving. In fact,
at the Fermi surface, they move with the velocity vF = —v3^zn, where n is the 
density of electrons. Thus, for a sufficiently dense system of degenerate 
Fermions the most interesting particles, namely those on the Fermi surface, 
move with the relativisitic velocities ~ c. Evidently, a good dimensionless 
measure of how close we are to the relativistic limit is
^=„f/c = A(3l2„),/3
To hint at what may happen as /J goes to 1 we note that according to Eq. 1, for 
j3~l, the particles are within their Compton wave length, X = A., of each 
other. This is a dramatic circumstance because, as was stressed by Landau 
[Beresteskii et al. 1971], a relativistic particle cannot be localized on a length 
scale less than X. and hence on such length scale the Dirac wave-function 
cannot be interpreted as a probability amplitude [Beresteskii et al. 1971].
Another example relativistic effects is the famous Chandrasekart limit of 
stellar stability [Cottingham & Greenwood 1987]. To see the point recall that 
in non relativistic quantum mechanics the energy per particle of a homogenous 
liquid in a uniform, neutralizing, positively charged background is given by

dominate and it provides the ultimate, Pauli exclusion
principle, resistance to the gravitational collapse of stars called white dwarfs. 
In the relativistic case the volume dependence of this term changes on account 
of the relativistic dispersion relation

(3)
This softening against collapse leads to the famous result that stars with M > 
1.44 Mo are unstable [Cottingham & Greenwood 1987].
Although the average density in a typical metal is such that rs~5, and this 
corresponds to a Fermi velocity of vF =108czn/sec only, near the atomic 
nuclei the local density can be considerably higher than that. In fact, at the 
nucleus, in /n(Z=50), according to standard band theory calculations, n(o) = 
6.2 1029 cm 3. This implies that, locally, ]3/w~l [Ramana and Rajogopal 1983]. 
Thus, it is not surprising that relativistic effects abound in atomic, molecular 
and solid state physics of elements with Z>50.
Many of these are small 1-10% quantitative effects like the shrinking of the 
inner core states and the subsequent relaxation of the outer orbitals in atoms, 
or the shift of the s-p bands relative to the d- and/-bands in transition and 
rear earth metals respectively [Koeling and McDonald 1983]. Others are 
qualitatively new features such as the coupling of the spin and orbital degrees 
of freedoms. Even when very small, as in the case for spin-orbit coupling in 
Fe, Co and Ni, these can give rise to surprising new phenomena such as 
magneto crystalline anisotropy, magneto optical effects and various 
manifestations of the Fano effect.
The first of these will be treated, in this volume by Staunton et al. [1991]. The 
second and third will be the subjects of the articles by Ebert et al. [1991a] and 
Ebert et al [1991b] respectively. The solid state analogues of the Fano effect 
will be discussed by Ginatempo and Gyorffy [1990]. Thus, the present article 
can be red as a pedagogical introduction to these four contributions. In turn 
these articles provide ample motivation for studying the 'electron glue', which 
binds the atomic nuclei of condensed matter together, within the framework of 
Relativistic Quantum Mechanics.

The complete, fully relativistic theory of an interacting many electron system 
such as the one in a solid, is Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). While this 
theory is very well understood in the limit of a vacuum with a few electrons 
and positrons [Beresteskii et al. 1971] for the dense system of electrons at hand 
it is far from being a closed book. Fortunately, for solid state problems of 
current interest we may bypass such interesting questions as pair creation and 
radiative corrections [Vshivtsev et al. 1989] and proceed along the well known 
lines of arguments familiar from the non-relativistic treatment of the problem. 
In particular, we adopt the methods of the Density Functional Theory and 
confine our interest to the well trodden path of the Local Density 
Approximation (LDA) [Kohn & Vashishta 1983].
For clarity, we shall present our brief review of this approach to the problem 
in three instalments. In Section 2 we summarise the basic ideas of LDA within 
the Relativistic Density Functional Theory. In Section III we describe the 
multiple-scattering method for solving the basic, Kohn-Sham-Dirac, equation 
of this theory. In a final, fourth, section we list a number of general issues of 
current interest.
2. 
Density functional theory
Density Functional Theory is the formal foundation of all modem 'band 
theory' calculations [Kohn & Vashishta 1983]. In short it replaces the full 
complexity of the Fock-space formulation of the many electron problem by a 
self-consistent field one-electron-problem. Surprisingly, it does so without 
introducing any approximations [Kohn & Hohenberg 1964]. Of course, as in 
any other approach to the problem, to render the procedures of theory 
tractible approximations have to be made. Within the framework of the 
Density Functional Theory the necessary simplifications take the form of 
mathematical recipies for calculating the potential function in the effective one 
electron problem from the knowledge of the charge densities no(r) for 
electrons with spin projections <7. In this, as well as in the campaignon papers, 
on applications, we shall be working in the well tried Local Density 
Approximation (LDA). For general orientation we shall now outline the 
theory and give a brief description of the LDA.
2.1. 
The non-relativistic theory
For simplicity we shall deal with the paramagnetic case at zero temperature 
(T=0) only. Then the theory consists of the following two parts.
The first is a theorem that the ground state energy is a unique functional 
E[«(r)]of the charge density n(r) and that the minimum of this, Eo, at n0(r), is 
the ground state energy of the system. Furthermore, n0(r) is the ground state 
charge density.
259

The second part is the construction and minimization of the functional 
E[n(r)]. This leads to the Kohn-Sham’s equations which are the Euler- 
Lagrange equation of the above variational problem. They are given by 
[Kohn & Sham 1983]
(-V2 + X V(r - ^;[n(r )])y<n(r) = £„¥<,(?) 
(2
where the local potential wells are described by the effective potential function
v(r - Rj;[«(?)]) = ^^-+e2fdr'”^},l + vxc(r - 
[n(r)]) 
(2.2) 
and the exchange correlation potential is the functional derivative of the 
exchange correlation energy E^intr)]. Namely,
vxc(r-^;[n(r)])
f <5EJCC[n(f)]>|
( 8n(r) J
(2.3)
Eqns. II. 1, 2 and 3 has to be solved self-consistently: one assumes a charge 
density n(f), calculates vxc(r - 7?.;[n(r)]) and then solves Eqn. II.l for the 
wave functions ^(r), from these one is to calculate the charge density by 
evaluating the sum over the occupied states up to £n ~ £f as follows:
£n~£F
n(r)= X1 ^Wl2 
n
(2.4)
where £F is the Fermi energy, finally the calculated n(r) is compared with 
the initial charge density and if they do not agree within a prescribed limit the 
calculation is repeated with an improved initial n(r). This procedure is 
continued until convergence.
Note the remarkable achievement of the Kohn-Hohenberg theorem: it has 
replaced the complex many-body problem in Fock-space by a self consistent 
field one electron problem without making an approximation. Of course, the 
above algorithm is not complete until an explicit form is specified for the 
exchange correlation functional. In this approach to the problem of 
interacting electrons it is at this point where principle approximations are 
made. In this talk I will always have in mind the local density of 
approximation
260

= J dr£^A(n(r ))n(r)
(2.5)
where the energy density E^(n) is the same function of n(r) as in the 
homogeneous electron liquid with a uniform positively charged background. 
This quantity is now well known from quantum Monte Carlo calculations 
[Caperley 1980].
Thus the Density Functional Theory approach does hark back to the jellium 
model of a solid and can be seen as a successful attempt to restore realism to 
the theory by reintroducing the point ions and the attendant inhomogenieties. 
From the point of view of our present concerns it is a striking feature of this 
approach that the density appears to play an explicitly central role. Clearly, 
where P(r) = -^^37t2n(r) ~ 1 relativisitic effects will be important. The 
necessary modifications of the theory will be discussed in the next section.
2.2. The relativistic density functional theory
The first fully-fledged relativistic density functional theories were formulated 
by Rajagopal (1978) and MacDonald and Vosko (1979). The subject has been 
reviewed by Ramana and Rajagopal (1983), Rajagopal (1985) and, more 
recently, with a quantum chemistry bias by Parr and Yand (1989). Done with 
care, this theory is capable of encompassing the complete quantum 
electrodynamics of the dense electron system in solids (Ramana and Rajagopol 
1983) but in fact only a small part of the whole formal edifice has been put to 
use so far. This introduction, as well as the following applications, will only 
concern this part. In fact we will always have the relativistic version of the 
Local Density Approximation (LDA) in mind.
In short the bases of the formalism is the theorem that the ground state energy 
is a unique functional of the four current ^(^) and spin-density m(r), and 
that the minimum of this functional, E[J (r),m(r)], is the ground state 
energy. As in the non-relativistic case the Euler- Lagrange equations of this 
variational problem is a self-consistent one electron equation. The difference 
is that this Kohn-Sham equation is now of the form of the Dirac equation. 
Thus the relativistic analogue of Eqn. II. 1 is
(4a-V + mc2(]3-l) + v (?;[/ ])
I =

where «, P, 1 are the 4x4 Dirac matrices in the standard representation 
(Landau et al. 1971), all quantities with double underline, like in J, are 4x4 
matrices, is a 4-component Dirac wave function, V (r) and

(2.9)
Evidently, the LDA consists of using 
f°r the relativistic, spin
polarized jellium. Unfortunately, and surprizingly, this is not as well known 
[Cortona et al. 1983, Eschrig et al. 1985] as the non-relativistic exchange amd
correlation energy, , for jellium [Ceperley 1980] and hence, frequently, 
E^ is used even in relativistic calculations.
262

The most striking new features of the above relativistic LDA potential is the 
contribution arising from the exchange of (transverse) photons between 
electrons. These are the consequences of the grand state energy diagrams with 
j A vertecies and photon (~) lines shown in Fig. 2 and they are often 
referred to as Breit interactions even though in Breit's original paper [Breit 
1925, Landau 1935] only a very approximate description of the full effect was 
considered. Although very small (~1 K°) the Briet interaction has important 
practical consequences due to its long range. For example its contribution to 
the total energy in the Hartree approximation:

(2.10)
gives rise to shape anisotropy effects which are the root causes of domain 
structure and dominate the magnetism of thin films [Jansen 1988].
3. 
The multiple scattering method (KKR) for solving the Kohn- 
Sham-Dirac equations
Most well-established band theory methods (LMTO, LAPW, KKR etc.) have a 
relativistic version which can solve the self-consistant one particle problem 
specified by Eqns. 2.6,7,8,9. Here we shall recall, briefly, only the relativistic 
Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker method which is based on the multiple scattering 
approach to the problem [Korringa 1947, Lloyd and Smith 1972, Gyorffy and 
Stott, 1973],
The strategy of multiple scattering theory for solving a Dirac or Schrodinger 
equation for an ordered array of potential wells, such as one encounters in a 
crystalline solid, is to solve the one scatterer problem first, by calculating the 
corresponding scattering amplitude, and then use this result to find the energy 
eigen values and eigen functions for the infinite lattice.
For a spherically symmetric finite range scatterer, the partial wave scattering 
amplitude is given by
4(£) = ^(^(£) -1) 
where K is the relativistic rotational quantum number, e.g. 
k = -2,-1,1,2
(3.1)
(3.2)
263

which are equivalent to = P3/2, S1/2, P1/2, ds/2 and 8k(e) is the phase shift of 
the outgoing spherical wave in the K-th channel. It is to be calculated by 
matching the solutions of the Dirac equation inside the potential well to an 
incoming spherical wave, labelled by the spin angular quantum number k, of 
unit amplitude and an outgoing spherical wave with the same k and coefficient 
fK(e).
As an illustration of the general description above we show the d3/2 and ds/2 
phase shifts corresponding to potential wells in an f.c.c. Pt metal in Fig.3. 
Such sharp resonances are characteristic of crystals with narrow bands such as 
those of transition or rear-earth metals. Note that the two d-resounces are 
split by the spin-orbit coupling. The extent of this splitting, 1.5 eV, 
determines the spin-orbit spliting of the d-bands which arise from them.
If the target is spin polarized the various spin-angular channels will be coupled 
and the scattering amplitude becomes a matrix fKp,K'n'(£) [Strange et al. 
1984]. This is due to the fact that the spin-orbit coupling term, d-L, is no 
longer a constant of the motion because it does not commute with the spin- 
external field coupling, a-B, contribution to the Hamiltonian. Under this 
circumstance it is useful to define the S matrix
SQQ' ~ 
~ 
(3.3)
where Q stands for both K and the magnetic quantum number p, and 
diagonalize Sq,q' with the help of the unitary rotation matrix UQ;Q'(e) by 
writing
S -SU e2SQ"^U~x
^QQ'" ^UQQ"e uQ"Q' 
(3 4)
The main point of this form is that the eigen values of the S-matrix are 
complex numbers of unit amplitudes and hence they can be written as 
Namely, the unitarity of Sq^' allows us to define phase shifts even when it is 
not diagnonal.
Strange et al. (1984) studied the Pt potential whose phase shifts are shown in 
Fig.3 in a magnetic field Beff. They found that in the £=2 channel all 10 phase 
shifts, defined as in Eqn. III.4, show a resonance whose position in energy, 
£^, moved with increasing Beff. Their results are shown in Fig.4. Evidently, 
these curves give an account of the Zeeman effect on the scattering states at 
positive energies.

The above discussion dealt with the case of non-spherical symmetric scatterers 
where the asphericity was confined to spin-space. Many interesting effects are 
associated with potentials which lack spherical symmetry in both spin and real 
space. For instance, to describe the coupling between the quadrupole moment 
of atoms in solids and the spin polarization of the electrons would require the 
consideration of such scattering centres. Unfortunately, as yet, this sector of 
the theory has not been developed.
Once the individual scattering centres have been fully described the next step 
in a multiple scattering theory is to construct the conditions for the infinite 
array of scattering centres to have an energy eigen value. Following Korringa 
(1947) such conditions may be derived by demanding that the incident wave to 
each site should be equal to the sum of outgoing waves from all the other sites. 
For the case of one site per unit cell this leads to the well-known KKR 
condition:
lh^4>>~cW^>ll = 0
where |oe Q .| stands for the instruction lo take the determinant of the matrix 
Oq q> and G (q,e) is the lattice Fourier transform of the relativistic KKR 
structure constants [Weiberger, 1990]. This latter quantity describes how 
free spherical waves propogate from site to site and is independent of the 
potential wells. Namely, it contains only geometrical information (the 
crystal structure) on the arrangement of the scatterers.
For a fixed wave vector q the KKR determinant in Eqn. III.5 vanishes at a 
number of energies £q;y. These are the Bloch wave energy eigen values. 
Finding these zeros is the principle computational task in applications of the 
KKR method.
To proceed to self-consistency one must also calculate the charge density n(r) 
and the magnetization density m(r). These quantities are readily obtained 
from the density-matrix
n(r, r') = -—Im J defie) G(r, r'; e)

where the imaginary part of the Greens function G(r,r';e), which is a 4x4

where the sum is over the Brillouin Zone.
Thus, given vL®A and W^A in terms of n(r,r') with the help of Eqn. 
111.5,6,7 and 8 a self-consistent solution to the Kohn-Sham-Dirac equations 
given in Eqn. II.6 can be affected. Examples of results of such calculation 
will be given in the following chapters where application of the above theory 
are discussed. Nevertheless, for the sake of explicitness we show, in Fig. 5., a 
comparison between a relativistic and non-relativistic LDA calculation.
In conclusion we would like to stress that frequently relativistic effects cannot 
be calculated in low order perturbation theory using Jy as an expansion 
parameter. For instance, let us consider the polarization of the photo-emitted 
electrons from the (111) face of an FCC Pt metal. Since Pt is not magnetic no 
such polarization would exist in a non relativistic calculation. Thus this 
polarization is completely a relativistic effect. We have calculated it for 
various values of the velocity of light. We show our results in Fig.6 as a
function of which, experimentally, in our units, is 50. Evidently, the
polarization is not a linear function of for all three energies. From the 
shape of these curves we deduce that first order perturbation theory can be 
expected to work only up to Jy = 5.10‘6 which is factor of 10 smaller than the 
experimental value.
4. Interesting relativistic effects in solids
In conclusion we should like to mention explicitly a few cases of relativistic 
effects in solids. The most studied examples are:

i) 
magneto crystalline anisotropy
ii) 
magneto optic (Faraday and Kerr) effects
iii) 
Fano effects
iv) 
magnetic scattering of X-rays
The first three of these will be treated at length in the following contributions. 
Due to the new very powerful X-beams, available from synchrotron sources, 
the fourth topic is of particular current interest and as such it has been well 
reviewed by Blume [1985].
There are two more, less well known, topics which we thought merit a note. 
They differ from those above in that they do not have analogues in chemistry. 
Moreover, they deal with phenomena whose significance has not yet been fully 
recognized. The first of these is
4.1. The relativistic correction to the London moment
The existence of gyromagnetic phenomena in solids, like the Barnett and the 
Einstein-deHaas effects, is stressed by Landau et al. [1984], A particularly 
interesting example is the London moment of a rotating superconductor 
[London I960]..
Consider a cylindrical superconductor rotating about is axis with angular 
velocity d>. Under this circumstance the statistical mechanics of the electrons 
have to be studied in the coordinate system rotating with the cylinder. In this 
frame of reference an electron experiences, in addition to the coulomb 
interaction with the ions and the other electrons, fictitious forces due to the 
rotation. These are the familiar centrifugal and Coriolis forces:
F - -md)x(a)xf) - 2w(toxv) 
(4.1)
where v is the velocity of the electron. As was argued by Rystephanic [1976] 
in a rotating superconductor both of these forces will be cancelled by a 
Lorentz force due to induced electric and magnetic forces:
F =-e(E +-vxB )
L 
x tnd q ind'
where
(4.2)
E =—d)xmxr and

and -e is the charge of the electrons. The induced B-field, BM, is commonly 
referred to as the London moment. Evidently, it corresponds to an induced 
vector potential:
A. =^(aixf) 
ind e
(4.4)
Solving the Ginzburg-Landau equations [Abrikosov, 1988] for this vector 
potential, leads to a surface current which is the physical origin of the London 
moment.
The principle general interest in the above phenomena is its consequence that 
the quantized flux within a rotating superconducting ring includes a
contribution due to Namely, the flux quantization constraint becomes:
IGA + X )de = n^ 
1 
2c
(4.5)
Consequently, by measuring the angular velocity difference Aw(= wn+i - wn) 
between the ground states that has n+1 and n quanta respectively treading a 
rotating ring, one can measure the fundamental constant
— = 2SA(O 
m
(4.6)
where S is the area enclosed by the ring [Cabrera et al. 1982].
The relevance of this effect to relativistic considerations arises from the fact 
that there is a measurable relativistic correction to the above formula [Cabrera 
et al. 1982]:
Aa(i + 522»+....)SA(O
m me
(4.7)
where <T>m is the relativistic kinetic energy of the electrons. Thus an 
accurate (10 ppm) measurement of S and A(0 determines <T >m. Evidently 
this is a remarkable circumstance since <T>^ is not probed by any other 
experiments. The results of the first calculations of < Tby Cabrera et 
al. [1982], are shown in Table 1. Clearly, further more accurate calculations 
and experiments could make this technique a unique probe of the electronic 
structure near the atomic nuclei.

4.2. The universality classes of metallic magnets
In general, a second order phase transition is characterized by a set of critical 
point exponents. For instance the mangetization M(T) of a ferromagnet goes 
to zero at the critical temperature Tc as M(T) ~ (T-TC)P. Similarly the 
susceptibility X(T) ~ (T-Tc)-Y, coherence length <(T) = (T-Tc)-v and CH(T) ~ 
(T-Tc)* a respectively. Moreover, these exponents (P,y,v,a.... ) form one of a
relatively few, apparently, universal sets. These are then said to define the 
universality class of a phase transition. Or, in other words, the set of critical 
exponents which characterise it, depends only on the number of components 
the order parameter has (n), the spatial dimensionality of the system (d) and 
the range of the interaction [Wilson, K. 1975].
Experimentally, the critical exponents characterising the Currie-Point of Fe, 
Co and Ni are those associated with the Heisenberg Spin Hamiltonian
However, this cannot be the whole story since the spin carrying electrons are 
described by Relativistic Quantum Mechanics whose relevant symmetry 
properties differ greatly from the simple, spin-only, description afforded by H 
in Eq IV.2. In particular, it is already well known (theoretically) that the 
dipolar spin-spin interaction and the cubic and quartic spin space anisotropies 
induced by the spin-orbit coupling, change the universality class [Toulouse and 
Pfeuty, 1975]. However, the true universality class of the ferromagnetic 
metals is determined by Relativistic Quantum Mechanics and it remains to be 
fully investigated.

INTRODUCTION
The importance of relativistic effects on the electronic structure of solids has been 
realized for a long time. One of the first convincing demonstration of the importance of 
spin-orbit coupling came from de Haas—van Alphen measurements on W (Macintosh and 
Andersen 1980). In these experiments it was found that the electron and hole surfaces do not 
touch in the TH-direction of the Brillouin—zone, as it was expected on the basis of 
non—relativistic band structure calculations. In the case of ferromagnetic Ni it was found 
experimentally that the de Haas-van Alphen signal vanishes for certain orientations of the 
external magnetic field relative to the crystal axes. This has been ascribed by Ruvalds and 
Falicov (1968) to a hybridisation of different spin states due to spin—orbit coupling.
The symmetry-breaking property of spin-orbit coupling (Falicov and Ruvalds 1968, 
Cracknell 1970), which is responsible for these and related phenomena, distinguishes 
spin-orbit coupling sharply from the so-called scalar—relativistic corrections, i.e. 
mass—velocity and Darwin term. The term ”symmetry—breaking” can indeed be taken 
literally, as it is nicely reflected by hyperfine experiments. For example, the Au—NMR 
spectra of Au dissolved in Fe clearly show the presence of an electric field gradient although 
the Au—atoms occupy substitutionally lattice sites of (in principle) perfect cubic symmetry

(Kawakami et al. 1985). The observed field gradient is caused by an axial charge distortion 
which in turn comes from the uncomplete quenching of the orbital angular momentum due to 
spin-orbit coupling. The last example clearly shows that one can expect especially for 
magnetic materials a lot of interesting effects which are caused by the interplay of 
spin—polarization and spin-orbit coupling. In the following, this is demonstrated by a 
detailed discussion of the magnetic moments and hyperfine fields of 5d—atoms dissolved 
substitutionally in ferromagnetic Fe. Obviously, a theoretical description of the phenomena 
mentioned above requires a simultaneous treatment of spin-orbit coupling and 
spin—polarization. This is conventionally done by the use of perturbation theory. In contrast 
to this approach we have used the recently developed spin—polarized relativistic version of 
the Korringa—Kohn—Rostoker method of band structure calculations in connection with the 
Green's function technique. A short outline of this approach is given in the next section.
THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK
Recently Feder et al. (1983) and Strange et al. (1984) developed a spin-polarized fully 
relativistic version of the KKR-method of bandstructure calculations. This scheme allows to 
deal with the electronic structure of magnetic materials taking into account all relativistic 
effects in a rigorous way. Within the framework of the KKR-method or multiple scattering 
theory, respectively, the corresponding Green's function of the system may be written as:
G+(V, ?’,E) = S ZA (?,E) r™, (E) ZJ, (?' ,E)
A A /
,E)jJ(?>,E) .
(1)
Here ^^/(E) is the so-called site—diagonal scattering path operator and Z and J are the 
regular and irregular solutions to the single-site Dirac equation for a spin-dependent 
potential. In contrast to the non-spin-polarized case Z and J have no pure spin—angular 
character (Strange et al. 1984). For this reason the index A, standing for the set of quantum 
numbers (/c,/z) specifies only their asymptotic behaviour. For further details see Strange et al. 
(1989). From the knowledge of the Green's function, more or less all properties of the system 
can be calculated. The spin magnetic moment for example is given by the expression
Mn 
Ep
^spin = — Im Tr £ 
FG+(r,-?,E)dE

where 0 is one of the standard Dirac matrices (Rose 1961), S is the z-component of the 4 x 4
—>
matrix vector E = ^ * with ~a the conventional Pauli spin matrix vector.
276

Within a non-relativistic description of the electronic structure p jn would be the only 
contribution to the total magnetic moment. Spin-orbit coupling, however, causes the orbital 
angular moment to be only incompletely quenched, giving rise to a corresponding orbital 
magnetic moment. This contribution can be approximately calculated from (Singh et al. 
1976):
Morb = AIm Tr £ S A 2+(r’7’E) dE 
(3)
where 1 is the z-component of the 4x4 matrix vector T = I ® T with T the 
conventional angular momentum operator.
Finally the correct relativistic expression for the hyperfine field is given by Breit’s 
formula (Breit 1930) which in our notation is
Bhf = i^ ImTr^ Fe a • (Mnx7)/r3G+(7,7,E)dE 
(4)
'n 
—co 
=

where "a is the vector of the Dirac matrices and 7^n is the nuclear moment.
In contrast to a non-relativistic description eq. (4) gives contributions to the hyperfine 
field which stem from non—s-electrons. As in the case of the orbital magnetic moment these 
contributions are again a consequence of the unquenching of orbital angular momentum due 
to spin—orbit coupling. On the basis of a Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation, Tterlikkis et al. 
(1968) have suggested a subdivision of these non—s-terms into a spin and orbital part. A 
more rigorous separation is possible by making use of the Gordon decomposition of the 
electronic current. For simplicity these non—s-contributions to the hyperfine field will be 
referred to as orbital contributions in the following.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
5d-atoms dissolved as impurities in ferromagnetic Fe, Co or Ni are interesting model 
cases to study the interplay of spin—polarization and spin-orbit coupling because of their 
high atomic number and the appreciable impurity magnetic moments induced by the host. 
We have calculated the electronic structure of the 5d—atoms in Fe in a charge self consistent 
way within the framework of local spin density theory using the scalar—relativistic 
approximation. The spin magnetic moments resulting from fully relativistic calculations 
using the above approach are shown in Fig. 1. These data show the typical S-like dependence 
on the atomic number as it is also found for 3d— and 4d— impurity atoms in Fe (see, for

example, Akai 1989). Compared to the 3d— and 4d—row atoms, the transition from negative 
to positive moments is however shifted to a higher atomic number. These findings are in 
qualitative agreement with experimental data from neutron scattering experiments (Collins 
and Low 1965). From these measurements it has been concluded that the Os moment should 
couple ferromagnetically to the host, while our calculation resulted in an antiferromagnetic 
coupling. This theoretical result could recently be confirmed by X-ray absorption 
experiments using circularly polarized radiation (Schutz et al. 1989).

The orbital contribution to the total magnetic moments as obtained from eq. (3) is also 
given in Fig. 2. Although in most cases it is relatively small compared to the spin 
contribution it is obviously non-negligible. For the pure elements Fe, Ni and Co it has been 
found that the spin and orbital moments possess the same sign (Ebert et al. 1988). However 
this is obviously not a general rule as it can clearly be seen from Fig. 1.
These properties of the orbital magnetic moments can be understood in a qualitative 
manner by considering spin-orbit coupling as a weak perturbation. Following the ideas of 
Gehring and Williams (1974) and Demangeat (1974), who performed tight binding model 
calculations for some heavy impurity atoms in pure ferromagnets, one finds for the 
expectation value 1 , the component of T along the magnetization, the approximate 
expression:
E
<1Z> = -1 e Im f F dE [(4g(+) (E) + g(+) (E)) g(+) (E) 
(5)
-(4gH(E) + gH(E))gH(E)].
Here g^—) (E) and g^B (E) are the tight binding matrix elements of the non—relativistic 
impurity Green’s function for e — and t9 —symmetry and for (+) and (—) spin direction and 
£ is the spin orbit coupling parameter. If we assume, as in the Anderson model, that the e — 
o 
and tgg-Green's functions are degenerate and that the local densities of states are 
Lorentzians, then the energy integration can be carried out analytically yielding
<lz>«-e(n(+)(EF)-n( )(Ef)) 
(6)
where n^^(E) and n^ \e) are the local d—densities of states of the impurity for spin—up and 
spin—down direction. In Fig. 2 we show the orbital moments of the impurities (left scale) as 
compared to the "magnetic” local density of states m^(Ep) = n^+)(Ep) - n^^Ep). One 
clearly finds a strong correlation, even if some details as e.g. the positive orbital moments of 
the early 5d—impurities, are not reflected by the density of states.
Because of the short range of the hyperfine interactions the hyperfine properties are 
mainly determined by the electrons near the nucleus. This is just where relativistic effects on 
the electronic structure are most important and for that reason one must expect a strong 
impact on the hyperfine properties. This is convincingly demonstrated in table I by showing 
the hyperfine fields of Ag and Pt in the alloy AggPtg^, which enter a calculation of the 
nuclear spin lattice relaxation rate (Ebert et al. 1985). As one can see, there is a strong 
relativistic enhancement of the hyperfine fields which decreases for increasing 1—quantum 
number but strongly increases with the atomic number.

In the past several authors tried to take this influence on the hyperfine fields into account 
by performing scalar-relativistic bandstructure calculations in connection with the use of the 
conventional expression for the Fermi-contact interaction. This is however not consistent 
because it strongly overestimates the relativistic enhancement of the s—hyperfine field. A 
correct expression for the hyperfine fields within the framework of a scalar—relativistic 
description has been derived by Bliigel et al. (1987), which results in a relativistic 
enhancement in complete accordance with fully relativistic calculations. Because this 
approach gives only access to the hyperfine fields due to s-electrons, we have adapted here 
the fully relativistic approach outlined above. The calculated total hyperfine fields of the 
5d—atoms in Fe are shown in Fig. 3. The agreement with the corresponding experimental 
data is rather satisfying although some deviations occur especially at the end of the row.
From the data in table I it is clear that a non—relativistic calculation would result in 
hyperfine fields much too low compared with experiment. As it is normally assumed, the core
part of the hyperfine field turned out to scale rather well with the impurity moment, 
reflecting the S—shaped variation of MSpjn with atomic number (Fig. 1). This holds for the
s-electron contribution as well as the much smaller one due to the non-s-core electrons
which has been taken into account for the first time.
As for the core part of the hyperfine field, the conduction band part is dominated by its 
s-contribution, which essentially determines the variation of the total field with atomic 
number (Fig. 3). Nevertheless the contributions coming from p— and d— electrons are 
appreciable. Throughout the 5d—row the p—fields are nearly constant and positive (~ 50 kG).
280

5d—impurities in Fe
The d-contribution on the other hand is strongly changing with atomic number (see Fig. 4), 
and most important in the region where the switch-over from anti- to ferromagnetic 
coupling of ZAgpin to the host magnetization occurs, in this way causing the pronounced 
minimum of the total field for Ir. As stated above, the source of the orbital contribution to 
the hyperfine field is as for the magnetic moment the uncomplete quenching of the orbital 
angular momentum. For this reason both quantities should be closely connected to one 
another. In fact the approximate expression (Abragam and Pryce 1951)
Borb - 2^B < ^3 > ^orb 
r
is often used in a discussion of experimental data. Our results for the orbital contribution to 
the hyperfine field and magnetic moment, shown in Fig. 4, essentially confirm the expected 
relation. However it is found that eq. (7) does not strictly hold. This is primarily due to the 
different weight of the p- and d-contributions to the hyperfine field and the magnetic 
moment, respectively.
In summary, it has been shown that relativistic effects have a strong impact on the 
properties of magnetic materials, causing phenomena that cannot be understood in a 
non—relativistic description. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that especially for 
hyperfine interactions a consistent relativistic description is indispensible.

ABSTRACT
In the relativistic spin-polarized density-functional theory the one-electron wave 
functions are solutions of a Dirac equation containing a symmetry-breaking term. As a 
consequence, the wave functions cannot be separated in an angular and a radial part. No 
attempt to solve exactly this equation has been done till now. In general, one looks for 
approximate solutions which can be determined by solving a system of two coupled radial 
Dirac equations. The solution of this system is not easy, and only a few non-self-consistent 
solid-state calculations based on it have been performed. In this paper we will discuss a 
method which permits to find very accurate approximate solutions of the coupled equations 
by solving two uncoupled Dirac equations. The new method is easy to apply, numerically 
more stable and less computing time consuming than the original one. Furthermore, the tests 
we have performed seem to indicate that the loss of accuracy introduced by the new 
approximation is negligible.
INTRODUCTION: THE RELATIVISTIC SPIN-POLARIZED THEORY
Density-functional theory (DFT), both in the relativistic and in the nonrelativistic 
version, becomes useful for applications when approximations to the unknown exchange­
correlation energy functional Exc are available. Our knowledge of these approximations is less 
advanced in the relativistic than in the nonrelativistic theory. For example, no nonlocal 
approximation of Exc has been elaborated till now; the local expressions of the correlation 
energy (Jancovici,1962; Ramana and Rajagopal, 1981) are limited to the nonmagnetic case 
and are not so accurate as the nonrelativistic ones derived from Monte-Carlo calculations 
(Vosko et al, 1980; Perdew and Zunger, 1981). Furthermore, applications to magnetic 
systems are particularly difficult. The one-electron equation, in the exact formal theory 
(Rajagopal,1978; MacDonald and Vosko,1979), contains the functional derivative of Exc with 
respect to the four-current density, and it is unpractical to use. So, in general, one simplifies 
it by neglecting the diamagnetic effects (MacDonald and Vosko,1979). In such a way, the 
following equation is obtained:
[c a- p + p c2 + veff I4 + Beff P oz) (p^r) = e. (p»(r)
where a, 0 and oz are Dirac matrices, I4 is the 4x4 identity matrix, and i is the set of quantum 
numbers which classify the orbitals. Eq.l is the relativistic generalization of the nonrelativistic 
spin-polarized one-electron equation. The effective potential and the effective magnetic field

contain now the functional derivative of Exc with respect to the charge and to the spin 
densities while the polarization direction has been assumed to coincide with the z-axis.
The solution of Eq.l presents two kinds of difficulties. First, one has to choice an 
approximate expression for Exc : no expression for the correlation energy is available, while 
for the exchange contribution there are two different approximations (MacDonald, 1983; Xu 
et al, 1984) corresponding to different interpretations of "local approximation" in the 
relativistic spin-polarized case. These expressions coincide at the first order in 1/c2. So, their 
discrepancies are probably not significant, at least for properties which are evaluated as 
differences of total energies. For other properties, as, for example, the transverse contribution 
to the exchange energy, the terms of order greater than 1/c2 can be important (Cortona and 
Sommers, 1987), and the discrepancies between the two approximations could be significant.
Second, the magnetic term Bcff pcz breaks the symmetry of the system. This gives rise 
to technical difficulties because: i) the wave functions cannot be separated in a radial and an 
angular component (even if the external fields are spherically symmetric); ii) apart from m, 
the z component of the total angular momentum, there are no other good quantum numbers to 
classify the orbitals.
The usual procedure for by-passing the latter difficulties consists in using the semi- 
relativistic theory of Koelling and Harmon (1977), where the spin-orbit contribution is, at a 
first time, neglected, and then it is introduced according to the perturbation theory once the 
self-consistent solutions have been found. In the last years, however, attempts have been 
made to go beyond this approximation, and to treat spin-orbit and spin-polarization on the 
same footing. The initial step was done by Doniach and Sommers (1981) (DS) and then their 
idea was further elaborated by several authors.
In this paper we will review the DS theory and will discuss some new developments 
(Cortona, 1989) which considerably simplify the calculations involved in the original DS 
method. The whole discussion will be limited to the case of spherically symmetric external 
fields.
THE DONIACH-SOMMERS APPROXIMATION
In order to find approximate solutions of Eq. 1, DS suggested to use wave functions 
which are the sum of two Dirac orbitals:
<p(0 = 'P . + T ,, = |
T 
nkm nkm T
W^<P)
2)
In this equation P(r) and Q(r) are the large and the small component respectively and 
are the two-dimensional Dirac spinors. The two orbitals which enter in Eq. 2 are characterized 
by the same values of n and m and by quantum numbers k and k' such that Xkm^^ and 
eigenfunctions of the orbital angular momentum L with the same eigenvalue /.
We note that, for a given value of k, there is one and just one value of k' which satisfies 
such a condition. We also note that the 5 states are an exception to this rule. In this approach 
their wave function is given by an ordinary Dirac orbital.
In such an approximation the orbitals can be classified in terms of the quantum numbers 
nlm, plus an additional quantum number a which distinguishes the two states corresponding 
to the same values of nlm. Introducing Eq. 2 in Eq. 1, one obtains the following system of 
two coupled Dirac equations:
286

^ + 4p-I^^ + 2c jQ-±B(r)C(m,-H:)Q = 0
^■-^ + ^-^-P-^B(r)C(m,kk)P-^P(r)C(m,kk’)P' = 0

3)

where we have used P to indicate P^, P' for Pn^'OT and so on. We have also introduced 
the coefficients C(m,kkr) defined by:
C(m,kk') = 
1 °z 1 d.Q 
4)
where ozp is the 2x2 Pauli matrix. System 3 should be solved self-consistently using the 
appropriate boundary conditions.
DISCUSSION OF THE DONIACH-SOMMERS APPROXIMATION
In order to understand what the DS approximation exactly means, let us derive Eq. 2 
step by step starting from the exact solutions of Eq. 1. Let and y^wbe the solutions of 
Eq. 1 without the symmetry-breaking term Bcf[paz. The wave functions ^nkm are then Dirac 
orbitals and can be used to develop in series the wave functions
where the coefficients Cn® satisfy the following infinite system of linear equations:
( ’ ^nk ^nk = 
^n’k' f r ^eff(r) (v nkm । z । Vn'k’rn) 
6)
n'k'
Using the coefficients defined by Eq. 4 and the fact that C(w,tt')=0 except if xkm an^ 
Xk'm correspond to the same value of / (ozp does not change the orbital angular momentum), 
one can transform Eq. 6 as follows:
<£,- ■ > c‘:i - x [c"‘c<m-" > Pir bw p"‘<r) p-'>w ■ 
n'
- 
C(m, -k-k ) Jdr B(r) Qn/r) Q^fr) +
+ C(‘’ C(m,kk') f dr B(r) P (r) P (r) - 
'• /v 
I 
fl t\>
- 
C(‘?k„ C(m, -k-k") j dr B(r) Q^r) Qn>r(r) 
7)
where k, kr and k” are related to each other through the two equations: k+k'=-1 and 
287

k+k"=l. These two conditions mean that the terms involving k and k' come from states 
having the same value of I relative to the large component, while the term involving k” 
comes from two orbitals having that value different by ±2.
The last term in the right member of Eq. 7 is of order 1/c2 with respect to the first and to 
the third one. By neglecting it, Eq. 7 splits in a set of subsystems, one for each pair of values 
k and k' for which C(m,kk')^Q. This is the first (and crucial) hypothesis introduced by 
DS. A discussion of it was given by Feder et al (1983), who were able to show that this 
assumption is equivalent to neglect terms dependent on the gradient of the effective magnetic 
field. From another standpoint, Eq. 7 makes explicit the fact that this approximation is not 
completely coherent, because some contributions which are taken into account (the second 
term in Eq. 7) are of the same order as those which are neglected.
Nevertheless, using this assumption, I becomes a good quantum number, and Eq. 5 can be 
written as follows:
(PW = X + E 
8>
n 
n
Factorizing the angular parts of the wave functions and performing the two sums, one obtains 
two Dirac orbitals with the principal quantum numbers determined by the number of nodes of 
the resulting radial parts. Indicating these orbitals with and with one can 
write:
<p(i) = 
9)
T 
nkm nkm 
'
We note that and are not solutions of the nonmagnetic equation. We note also 
that, in principle, n could be different from n. If one supposes n=n, one gets to the DS 
wave function (Eq. 2). This is the second assumption of DS, assumption that should work 
very well, at least for effective magnetic fields which are not too large.
SIMPLIFICATION OF THE DONIACH-SOMMERS APPROXIMATION
The coupled DS equations (Eq. 3) have been solved self-consistently by Cortona et al 
(1985) for atomic systems, while several authors have performed non-self-consistent solid- 
state calculations (Schadler et al, 1986 and 1987; Ebert, 1988; Ebert et al, 1988). The 
methods to solve them are not easy. In the atomic case one has to determine, at each iteration, 
three parameters for each orbital, instead of only the one-electron energy. This requires 
considerably more computing time, and the whole iterative process is less stable. 
Furthermore, for deep core states, one of the two terms of the wave function (Eq. 2) is of 
greater order of magnitude than the other and system 3 becomes difficult to solve by 
techniques which treat the two coupled Dirac equations on the same footing. In this case the 
two equations tend to decouple and the wave functions tend to the one-term solutions of the 
following Dirac equation:
dP k fc-V(r) 
1
d7 + YP4~^ + 2c jQ-FB(r)C(w,-M)Q = 0
^-^Q + ^-^-P-^B(r)C(m,kk)P = ° 
10)
The results of Cortona et al (1985), and the DS calculations reported in this paper, have been 
obtained by assuming that Eq. 3 can be replaced by Eq. 10 for all the electronic states with 
n<3 (for the rare-earth ions).
It is possible to obtain a method easier to implement by introducing a new approximation 
on the wave function. Let us start by looking for an approximate solution of the coupled 
equations of the form:
288

, 
2 ?/2
(pW = (p , = Aa y , + 1 - Aa 
w ,.
T Tanbn a r nktn k u J Y nk tn
H)
where an^ are normalized solutions of Eq. 10 with eigenvalues e and e' 
respectively. The energy ea, corresponding to (pfln//n, is related to the parameter Aa as 
follows:
Efl = E + C(m,W:')
J dr B(r) P(r) P'(r)
Za = £' + C(m,&£')
A r
-------a— J dr B(r) P(r) P'(r) 
[i-Aa]
12)
Indicating Aa/ (1 - Aa2)1/2 with xa and J*  B(r)P(r)P'(r)dr with I, we get the following 
equation for xa:
1 £ - £*
Xa ■ ~a = C(m,kk’) I
13)
This equation has a positive and a negative solution which fix the two wave functions and the 
two eigenvalues corresponding to a given choice of quantum numbers nlm. Using the wave 
functions so determined one can derive the charge and the spin densities and the new potential 
and magnetic field to use in Eq. 10, and then to iterate the overall process to self-consistency. 
This gives rise to a method that, in the following, will be referred to as Method 1 (Ml).
In Ml, the coupling terms affect only indirectly the two basis functions which enter in 
Eq. 11. An approximate way to take into account more effectively the coupling is the 
following: We still look for approximate solutions of Eq. 3 of the form given in Eq. 11, but 
now we choose the orbitals and \fn^m to be normalized solutions of the two uncoupled 
Dirac equations:
HP k |E-V(r) ~ i
+ F^ + 2c jQ-“B(r)C(AH,-W)Q = 0

where xfl has an arbitrary value at the beginning of the iterations and is then determined self- 
consistently as the effective potential and the effective magnetic field. At each iteration the 
one-electron energy za and the new value of xa are still given by Eqs. 12 and 13 but after 
substituting e and e’ as follows:
289

e -> £ - C(m,kn t- f B(0 p(0 pW 
J
£'->£'- C(m,kk') xa | B(r) P'(r) P’(r) dr 
16)
We shall refer to the method so modified as Method 2 (M2). Note that one is assuming, for 
the coupling term, P * P'. This should be quite a good approximation, and, in any case, 
certainly a better one than to assume P=P’=0 as we have done in Ml.
We have tested the methods by performing calculations of the electronic properties of all 
the trivalent rare-earth ions. The results obtained by both the methods for Ce3+ are reported 
in Tables I to V as well as the corresponding DS results. The analogous tables for the other 
rare-earth ions show completely similar features. The only difference is that all the effects are 
magnified owing to the strongest magnetic interactions [see Cortona (1989) for the results 
relative to Gd3+].

The main remark about Tables I-V is that, while Ml gives rise to some discrepancies 
with respect to DS, the results obtained by M2, in the limit of precision of our Tables, 
coincide with the DS ones. This is true for all the properties we have studied, with the only 
exception of the Fourier transforms of the core-states' spin density, for which some minor 
discrepancies can still be noted. In particular, we remark that M2 eliminates the shift of the 
Ml energy eigenvalues and that it corrects the anomalies in the trend of the mean values of the

powers of r calculated by Ml (in the case of Ce3+ these anomalies are just sketched in the 
values of <r6>, but they are more evident for the other ions). We emphasize the good 
description of the core-states' polarization obtained by M2. This is a property which is very 
sensitive to the relaxation effects due to the coupling terms, as it is indirectly shown by the 
bad agreement between the Ml and DS results reported in Table V. The good values of the 
Fourier transforms of the core spin densities calculated by M2, are a strong indication in 
favour of the method.
The ensemble of our results indicates that, to a very high degree of accuracy, the 
solutions of the DS equations can be identified with the wave functions calculated by M2. 
This is confirmed by the fact that starting a DS calculation using the M2 self-consistent 
potential and magnetic field, one finds that either the usual tests of self-consistency are 
satisfied, or that very few iterations are required.
Finally, we point out that the method can be applied without difficulties to deep core 
states. In Tables I to V, in order to make a consistent comparison with the DS results, we 
have reported values obtained by using M2 for states with n>3 and Eq. 10 in the other cases. 
However, we have also performed calculations using M2 for states with n>2 and for all the 
electrons without restrictions. We have not found appreciable differences with respect to the 
results we have reported, with the only exception of the Fourier transforms of the core-states’ 
spin density. The results of the three calculations for the latter quantities are compared in 
Table VI.
CONCLUSIONS
We have discussed two methods of performing fully relativistic spin-polarized 
calculations. They are both approximate versions of the DS method, which have the main 
advantage of requiring the solution of uncoupled Dirac equations. As a consequence, they 
are simpler, numerical more stable, and less computing time consuming than the original 
method. They both give satisfactory results. In particular, one of them seems to have a loss 
of accuracy with respect to the DS method, which is completely negligible.

Introduction
One of the first things one learns in a school course in magnetism is that a magnet has a 
north and a south pole. This defines a direction in the magnet, the axis of magnetisation. 
If one cools a single crystal sample of a magnetic material from above the magnetic 
transition temperature it will choose a crystal axis along which the magnetisation vector 
will point. Obviously, the direction chosen is the one with the lowest free energy. The 
magnetisation direction usually coincides with one of the principal crystal directions. 
In iron this is the (0,0,1) direction, whereas in nickel it is the (1,1,1) direction. The free 
energy of the crystal thus contains a term which couples the magnetisation direction to 
the crystal lattice. This is known as the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy [1].
The anisotropy energy can be determined by measuring the field needed to rotate the 
magnetisation vector away from the easy axis. It is traditionally expressed in terms of 
the direction cosines of the magnetisation vector and some anisotropy constants [2,3]. 
For example, if 9 is the angle between the magnetisation vector and the easy axis, then 
the anisotropy energy in an HCP crystal is given in terms of two anisotropy constants 
Ki and K2 as
Ean — jKi sin2 9 + K2sin^9

Many experiments have been performed to measure the anisotropy constants as a func­
tion of temperature for many metals (see [3] for example).
When one comes to consider what determines the anisotropy constants on a microscopic 
level one necessarily becomes involved in relativistic quantum theory. The angular 
momentum of an electron in a solid is divided into a spin and an orbital contribution. 
This is rather like dividing the angular momentum of the earth up into a part due to its 
orbital motion around the sun and a part due to its rotation about its own axis. Spin 
and orbital angular momentum are conserved separately in classical quantum theory. 
In relativistic quantum theory only total angular momentum is conserved, an electron 
can flip its spin by exchanging angular momentum with its orbital motion. The amount 
of angular momentum exchanged depends on the relative orientation of the spin and 
orbital angular momentum vectors. One finds that magnetocrystalline anisotropy is due 
to this subtle interplay between spin-orbit coupling and spin-polarisation. This turns 
out to be a case where these esoteric relativistic and quantum effects are observable in 
every day life [4].
One of the aims of condensed matter physics is to be able to calculate the properties of 
a material from first principles and faith in quantum theory! ie with the only input be­
ing the atomic number of the constituents and (if appropriate) the stoichiometry, (This 
information simply identifies the material). Such an approach has given us tremendous 
insight into such diverse properties as lattice constants, phonon spectra, crystal struc­
tures, superconducting transition temperatures and the occurrence of magnetism. It has 
also enabled us to give a detailed interpretation of such experiments as de Haas-Van 
Alphen measurements, positron annihilation studies and various spectroscopies[5,6].
In this chapter we develop a theory to describe magnetocrystalline anisotropy energies 
at zero temperature from first principles. This work is based on the relativistic density 
functional theory described elsewhere in this volume. The single site scattering theory 
is also described elsewhere in this volume (and in [7]). Here we present the multiple 
scattering theory [8]. In the first section we discuss the scattering theory. In the second 
section we restrict this to two site scattering and consider the relativistic generalisation 
of the RKKY interaction leading to an effective two body interaction Hamiltonian [9,10]. 
At the end of this section we show the results of some preliminary simulations of this 
Hamiltonian [11]. In the third section we discuss applying the theory to bulk crystals and 
illustrate this by showing explicit calculations of Fermi surfaces and magnetocrystalline 
anisotropy energies [12,13]. Finally we briefly mention some work in progress on a finite 
temperature generalisation of this work [14].
Relativistic Spin-Polarised Multiple Scattering Theory
In this section we outline the derivation of the relativistic spin-polarised Green function 
for a system of scatterers. The formulism presented here starts from the discussion of 
the relativistic free electron Green function derived by Rose [15]. This section is very 
similar to the non-relativistic derivation of reference [16] and the relativistic work of [8]. 
Equivalent derivations have been presented by Schadler et al [17] and Feder et al [18].
It is necessary to start with a series of definitions. Let us start with the quantum num­
bers. For completeness we include a definition of them all. The well known relativistic 
quantum numbers are j and /z which are the quantum number associated with the total 
angular momentum and its ^-component respectively. The quantum number k is the 
eigenvalue of the operator (a.L + 1). Here a is the Pauli matrices vector and L is the 
orbital angular momentum operator. The eigenvectors are the spin angular functions 
296

described below. If I is the usual orbital angular momentum quantum number we have
k = 1 j = 1-1/2 
(2.1a)
k=-Z-1 j = Z + l/2 
(2.16)
It can be seen from here that k takes on all integer values except zero. The sign of k 
gives the parity of the wavefunction, we define
Sk = k/\*\
 
(2.2)
We also introduce I which is the value of I associated with —k. So
I = k, — 1 
k>0 
(2.3a)
k, < 0
(2.36)
For a given value of j the two possible values of k are j + | and —j- — |. Hence
1-1 = SK 
(2.4)
and
j = I ~ 2$K 
(2-5)
The spin angular functions are defined as

As shown by Faulkner and Stocks [16] the scattering Green function for a particle moving 
in the field of a single potential located at a point labelled by n can be written in the 
following form.
Gn(r,r';E) = G°(r,r';
G\r,rn;E)tnn{r\rm-E)G\r,,\rl’E)dr,,drm (2.8)
where the £nn(r, r'; E) is a general scattering t-matrix. This is very difficult to calculate 
in itself, The on the energy shell elements of the t-matrix are what we require, these 
are defined below and are fairly straightforward to evaluate. The G° is the free electron 
Green function given by Rose [15]

In these equations E is the eigenvalue of the Dirac equation, and p = (E2 — l)1/2. hi 
and ji are the usual spherical Hankel and Bessel functions respectively. Note that we 
are taking an outer product of the spin-angular functions so Gj- is a 2 x 2 matrix and 
hence the full Green function (as well as the t-matrix) in (2.8) are 4x4 matrices. We 
can rewrite this as
G0(r,r';£)=z7r£[^(r)].[^(r)]+

(2.13)
and using

where r < r'. This is the final expression for the single site scattering Green function. 
The on the energy shell t-matrix is the same as that described by Gyorffy et al elsewhere 
298

in this volume, and also by Strange et al [7]. Next consider the derivation of the multiple 
scattering Green function. This can be written in terms of the single site Green function 
as
G(r, r';£) = Gn(r,r';E) + j J Gn(r,r"-,E)Tnn(r" ,r"';E)Gn(r'" ,r'■, E)dr"dr'"
(2.18) 
Where Tnn is the T-matrix for the system without the scatterer at the nth site. The 
most easy way to proceed is to substitute (2.15) for the single site Green function into 
this equation. Now jJ^(E,Rn) is singular at the origin, but is regular at all other 
points. Thus it is possible to expand it in terms of J£(r) where r is in the vicinity of 
some other site m, ie
^(rn)-£^g-^(rm) 
(2.19)
In fact this is a straightforward generalisation of the non-relativistic case, because each 
element of the 4-vector here obeys an equation identical to the non-relativistic case. 
The gs here are known as structure constants, they are simply a rotation of the usual 
non-relativistic structure constants which are written in terms of the (Z,m,s) quantum 
numbers.

Here the C-coefficients are Gaunt numbers. Note that gnm is independent of the atomic 
species under consideration and depends only upon the geometric arrangement of scat­
tered. Substitution of (2.16) and (2.17) into (2.18) eventually leads to an expression 
for the multiple scattering Green function.

If we vary E there will be certain places where the determinant - </(q, 1?)|| passes 
through zero. At these energies 
and hence G(r,r';l?) diverge. At these 
299

energies there will be an amplified scattered wave even with no incident electron. These 
energies form the eigenvalue spectrum or electronic band structure of the system. It is 
expression (2.22) that is usually evaluated. It has a particularly useful property that 
the second term is completely real at real energies. Thus it is not necessary to evaluate 
it if only the imaginary part of the Green function is required as is the case for many 
applications.
Once we have found the Green function we can use it to calculate observables such as
the density of states:-
n(E) = -^Im I TrG{r,v,E)d3r
(2.24)
the magnetic moment

m(r) = - -Im / Trf3aG(r, r; E)dE

and the charge density

(2.26)
In a later section we shall show some applications of these formulae, however in the next 
section we restrict our multiple scattering to two sites and examine the new physics 
introduced into this problem by the simultaneous occurrence of spin-orbit coupling and 
spin-polarisation.
The relativistic R.K.K.Y. interaction - magnetic impurities in a paramag­
netic host
As a first application of our multiple scattering theory we shall study the interaction 
between magnetic impurities in a metallic host. This work is described fully in refer­
ences [9] and [10] in which the cases of (i) two and three magnetic impurities and (ii) 
two magnetic and a single non-magnetic impurity have been investigated. The salient 
results will be summarised in this section. The electrons which mediate these inter­
actions are modelled by an infinite non-interacting electron gas of appropriate density 
with a uniform, positively charged background (jellium). For the conventional coupling 
between the two identical magnetic impurities with moments pointing along the unit 
vectors si and S2 respectively at an asymptotically large separation R12, the well known 
Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yoshida [20,21,22] formula is found.
E™KY = Vs\ ■ s2((2kFR12coS2kFR12 - sin2kFR12)/R
*
2) 
(2.27)
where k? is the Fermi momentum and V is a parameter which describes the interaction 
between an impurity and the electrons. The precise nature of V depends on how the 
impurities are modelled.
This result is based on non-relativistic quantum mechanics. Using the Dirac equation to 
describe the conduction electrons, the relativistic generalisation of equation (2.27) can 
300

be derived. In addition to the usual spatially isotropic ’spin-spin’ term, owing to spin­
orbit coupling effects, it has also pseudo-dipolar and squared Dzyaloshinskii -Moriya 
type terms. Evidently the anisotropy is uniaxial in form. On extending the work to 
the case of two non-equivalent magnetic impurities, additional unidirectional terms are 
found. Three impurity interactions show further magnetic anisotropic effects.
In non-relativistic quantum mechanics the exchange interaction is isotropic in spin space, 
but in Dirac theory the spin and orbital degrees of freedom are coupled. As stated 
already this coupling is the main source of magneto-crystalline anisotropies in metals. 
The relativistic RKKY interaction is therefore of general interest because it reveals a 
simple example of magnetic anisotropy. It is also of particular interest because it may 
contribute significantly to the still mysterious anisotropies which characterise the low 
temperature behaviour of the spin-glass state [23].
We use spin-dependent potentials to describe the imparities:
v-(r) = Vi(r)l 4- wt(r)a • Si 
(2.28)
where 
and az are the complete set of Pauli spin matrices. All orders of v^i =

described earlier and in [7]. E is the kinetic energy of the incident electron,and l,m and 
s are the polar, azimuthal and spin magnetic quantum numbers respectively, m and s 
refer to a common z -axis at both sites and the matrix t(c) is non-diagonal in m and s. 
The orbital parts of the potentials are taken to be spherically symmetric and hence the 
are diagonal in 1. In a non-relativistic theory for a local moment along i, we have
- l)/(2i/E) 
(2.30)
whereas in a fully relativistic theory 
is non-diagonal and its diagonal ele­
ments depend on both m and a. Both of these effects trace back to spin-orbit coupling 
and are the root causes of magnetic anisotropy.

real space KKR structure constants. They are given by equation (2.21). In (2.21) the 
Yj^^R) are the complex spherical harmonics for the angles which specify the direction 
R. Equation (4) is the straightforward relativistic generalisation of Lloyd’s formula [24]. 
From equations (2.31), (2.32) and (2.33)
W12 = -(1/tt) J 
(2.34)
where |- • -| means taking the determinant with respect to the indices Z,m and s only, 
the operation with respect to the site indices having been fully worked out. A similar 
analysis provides a more complicated expression for £11123, the interaction between three 
sites.
Although the exact formulae of the above form are easy to evaluate numerically, the 
physical effects can be extracted by studying their asymptotic forms for large separations 
between the impurities. In that limit gZ] 1/Rij equation (7) can be expanded in 
powers of gZ]. For two impurities and to lowest order in g'3 we find
ftl12 = (l/7r)/m / dE £ (4nAi(£;)ffA1,A2(R12)£;)42’A3(E)5A3,A(R21,E))
a,a1,a2,a3
(2.35) 
where A denotes all three indices Z,m and 5. In a similar fashion the expression for 
three impurities is
£H123 = (l/7r)Im / dE

(2.36) 
The form of (2.35) and (2.36) show that these interactions can be interpreted quite 
neatly in scattering theory terms. In the non-relativistic limit, after making appropriate 
approximations, £1112 can be shown to have the usual RKKY form i.e.
£1112 oc {si • 52}(2AjfRi2 cos2A?pRi2 — sin2&F#i2)/7?i2 
(2.37)
In the non-relativistic derivation it is found that £1112 depends only on |Ri21 because 
^A1^) is diagonal and independent of m. As a consequence of such m-dependence in 
the relativistic theory a number of new terms containing the ’direction’ of R12, denoted 
by the unit vector R12, arise. Equation (2.35) may be rewritten after some algebraic 
manipulation as
9/1 hi. a x

302

where the coefficient bni ,n2,n3(^i • ^2) depends only on the relative orientation of Si and 
S2, R12, the scattering properties of the two impurities and various numerical factors. 
For 2 identical magnetic impurities n3 = 0 only. This is the general form of the rela­
tivistic RKKY interaction, a polynomial function of anisotropic pseudo-dipolar terms 
(^12 • «si)(jRi2 • £2) and squared Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) type terms,Ri? • (<$i x $2)-
Although equation (2.38) for two identical impurities contains terms like R12 • (si x $2) 
it differs from the usual DM terms in that here only even powers of R12 • ($i x $2) 
enter. This is the inevitable consequence of the symmetry in this problem and is also 
a very satisfactory feature of our formula. A uniaxial anisotropy is described. Once 
this interchange symmetry is broken, unidirectional effects are added. This occurs in 
(2.38) for two non-equivalent magnetic impurities n3 0. The three impurity problem, 
also studied by Levy and Fert [23,25], similarly reveals unidirectional contributions to 
£17123• These include terms linear in • (si x £2) (as shown in [9]). In [10] we found 
such magnetic anisotropic effects to be comparable, in magnitude, to those predicted 
by (2.38).
In [9] we explored the relativistic RKKY interaction of (2.38) for two Fe and Co atoms 
respectively. In particular we looked at the interaction energies 6QJ2 ^or the two mo­
ments parallel to each other and to R12 and perpendicular, 
to Ri2- As expected
the anisotropy energy — ^12^ (on the scale of 10~6 a.u.) is smaller than the 
interaction energy by a factor of 103. Moreover it was in the range of experimen­
tal observation. Interestingly, the anisotropic contributions to the interaction energy 
oscillate and are long ranged like the non-relativistic RKKY interaction itself.
An anisotropic frustration in spin glasses [26] is therefore apparent. These uniaxial 
contributions are unable to explain the purely directional character of the magnetic 
anisotropy of such systems as demonstrated by several types of experiment. These 
include measurements of shifted hysteresis cycles, NMR and torque measurements [25]. 
This observation then motivated the studies described in [2] on two non-equivalent 
impurities and three impurities in which unidirectional effects were found.
In this section we have outlined a general formulism for the study of the interaction 
between impurities in a metallic host modelled by relativistic jellium. The general rel­
ativistic multi-site, multi-component RKKY interaction has a particularly transparent 
functional form for the two site limit. Specific calculations relevant to two and three 
impurities have been carried out and described in [1] and [2j. Both uniaxial and unidi­
rectional magnetic anisotropic effects appear naturally.
Very recently there has been some preliminary computer simulation work on a simplified 
version of the Hamiltonian defined by (2.38) [11]. This work has been a simple classical 
simulation of a Hamiltonian containing the Heisenberg term, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya 
term and the pseudo-dipolar term all to order one.

simulations are shown in figure (1). Clearly, the AT-term confines the spins to a plane 
whereas the Z-term tends to align neighbouring spins at right angles to one another. 
Obviously, even in such a simplified case a wealth of magnetic structures can be found. 
Further exploration would require three dimensional work and the full Hamiltonian. At 
that stage one might consider calculating spin wave spectra, so that if this interaction 
does determine the magnetic structure of materials this can be verified using neutron 
scattering.
Experimental Consequences of Magnetocrystalline Anisotropy in Metals
In the previous sections we have written down a considerable amount of scattering 
theory. In this section we consider the experimental consequences of implementing this 
theory. The principle new physics introduced by the simultaneous inclusion in the theory 
of spin-polarisation and spin-orbit coupling is caused by the reduction in symmetry 
that this brings about. The spin-orbit interaction couples the crystal lattice to the 
magnetisation direction. Hence in a cubic lattice, for example, some directions which 
were equivalent in a non-relativistic theory become inequivalent. This is illustrated in 
figures (2) and (3) where we plot the energy bands for nickel along the T — X(0,0,1) and 
T — X(l,0,0) directions in the Brillouin zone when the moment is along (0,0,1). Small 
differences and the lifting of some degeneracies at points of high symmetry can be seen 
between these two diagrams, which would be identical in a non-relativistic calculation. 
We now go on to look at how these differences can be measured experimentally. Firstly 
we consider how relativistic effects may be observed in the de Haas van Alphen effect. 
Secondly we consider the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy itself. Of course these 
are not the only possibilities. For example in the magnetic X-ray dichroism theory 
described elsewhere in this volume the dichroism spectra will have a dependence on the 
direction of the magnetic moment relative to the crystal axes. This is a direct probe of 
the anisotropy, but will be a small effect which has not yet been observed.
The de Haas van Alphen effect
The de Haas van Alphen effect is a very sensitive probe of the Fermi surface of metals. 
There are several good reviews of this subject [27]. The Fermi surface is also something 
that is very easy to calculate from band theory. In figures (4), (5) and (6) we show cross 
sections through the Fermi surface of cobalt in three planes of high symmetry in the 
hexagonal Brillouin zone. These have been calculated in three increasingly more precise 
approximations. Also all these figures have been calculated within the same computer 
program, so they are directly comparable.
In Figure (4) we see the non-relativistic Fermi surface. This has been calculated by 
putting c —> oo in the program and it is in excellent agreement with previous non- 
relativistic calculations [28].
In figure (5) we have the Fermi surface calculated when the magnetic moment points 
along the c-axis of the crystal. Comparison with figure (4) shows that where the majority 
and minority spin bands cross in the non-relativistic case they avoid each other in the 
relativistic case. This leads to a rather unusual picture of the electrons behaviour. As 
they drift round the Fermi surface they go through regions where their spin is almost 
entirely in one direction, then they come to a region where the spin is undefined and

of the H.C.P Brillouin zone, with the magnetic moment in the direction of the applied 
field, calculated relativistically.
309

the band mass is very close to zero. Later on they come to a region where the spin is 
almost entirely the opposite direction.
Finally in figure (6) we have the Fermi surface for the case when the magnetic moment is 
in the direction of the applied field, ie it is in a different direction when the experiment is 
looking at different planes in the Brillouin zone. This is what happens in the experiment. 
There is no reason why the Fermi surface plots should join up at the symmetry lines 
in the Brillouin zone in this case. In figure (6) we see an example of this. The two 
planes joined together are at right angles to one another, the bands do not join up and 
this effect can lead to a 2 or 3 % change in the predicted Fermi surface areas. One 
can imagine cases where the effect could be very large, in the case of nearly flat bands 
crossing very close to the Fermi energy
Some of the orbits predicted by the relativistic theory, but not by the non-relativistic 
theory have been confirmed in recent experiments [29].
This section shows that the usual interpretation of de Haas van Alphen experiments 
on magnetic materials in terms of separate spin up and spin down Fermi surfaces is 
fallacious [28]. Magnetic breakdown of the gaps between the Fermi surface in the figures 
can occur and then the experiment will measure a single spin Fermi surface. In this case 
this work is a warning to experimentalists that the method of measurement is changing 
the results and they are not measuring the ground state.
Magnetocrystalline Anisotropy Energy
The multiple scattering theory described previously has been applied to metals [8,12,13]. 
Before we go on to consider this work in more detail let us consider previous work on 
first principles calculations of magnetocrystalline anisotropy energies. Two previous at­
tempts have been made to calculate these energies from first principles to our knowledge. 
Firstly Eckardt et al [30] calculated the anisotropy energy for F.C.C nickel and B.C.C 
iron. They found anisotropy energies of the correct order of magnitude, but the wrong 
sign for iron. Daalderop et al [31] also calculated these quantities but found the wrong 
sign for both iron and nickel. They also looked at H.C.P cobalt where the anisotropy 
energy is an order of magnitude larger. In this case their results were the correct sign, 
but their magnitude was incorrect by a factor of 2. They also looked at the anisotropy 
energy as a function of the number of valence electrons and found the anisotropy energy 
was very sensitive to this. Jansen [32] has considered ^he calculation of magnetocrys­
talline anisotropy energies from relativistic density functional theory. He has concluded 
that a spherical approximation for the potential means the neglect of significant contri­
butions to the anisotropy energy. Furthermore he has stated that the Breit interaction 
may also play a role in determining the value of this energy. Of course, this is included, 
in principle, in the relativistic exchange-correlation functional. However the effect of 
this would only be included in the theory if we went to self-consistency within density 
functional theory with a suitably chosen approximation for the exchange-correlation 
functional.
We now go on to consider calculations of magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy using 
the multiple scattering theory above. In particular we look at ferromagnetic nickel on 
an F.C.C lattice [12]. The nickel atoms were defined by a potential and effective field 
310

from a self-consistent non-relativistic electronic structure calculation [6]. As nickel is a 
fairly light element this is not believed to be an important approximation.
Figures (2) and (3) are enlarged views of the energy bands for nickel in the F - X(0,0,1) 
and T-X(l, 0,0) directions in the Brillouin zone with the moment pointing along (0,0,1). 
These are very similar to previous results [6]. Comparison with these previous non- 
relativistic results shows that relativity introduces some small changes in band widths 
and lifts degeneracies at points of high symmetry. There is also some gross movement 
of the bands due to the mass-velocity and Darwin terms in the Hamiltonian. It can be 
seen that the major effect of rotating the magnetic moment is to prevent/allow band 
crossings and to alter some band separations. This can be understood on the basis of 
the ct.B term in the Hamiltonian. When the moment rotates the scalar product varies 
as a cosine function.
Now, if we have different band structures for each direction of the moment we can 
integrate these over the Brillouin zone and we will then have different densities of states 
for each moment direction. This was done and a number of new mathematical techniques 
had to be used to ensure the numerical parts of the calculation were done to sufficient 
accuracy. For a discussion of these, reference should be made to the original papers [8]. 
The force theorem [33] states that the difference in total energy between two states with 
similar charge density is given by the difference in the single electron contributions to 
the energy. This was used to calculate the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy, ie
rEf
E001 = / EnQ01(E,nQQ1(r))dE 
(2.40a)
Jo
and
rEf
E111 - / Enni(E,nQ01(r))dE 
(2.406)
Jo
or equivalently for any other direction of the moment in the unit cell. The differ­
ence between these two energies is the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy. This has 
been calculated for nickel and Table (1) shows a full set of results. Apart from the 
spin-contribution to the magnetic moment all quantities shown in the table would be 
identically equal to zero in a non-relativistic theory. The values tabulated are those 
calculated when the Brillouin zone integral was performed with 36 directions per ^th 
of the zone. The errors indicated are estimated on the basis of the calculation using 10 
and 21 directions in the integration.
Nickel has a very small magneto-crystalline anisotropy energy. In fact any material on 
a cubic lattice has a much smaller anisotropy than for a non-cubic lattice [2]. Therefore 
many of the numerical problems associated with cubic lattices will not be present for 
non-cubic lattices. Unfortunately no magnetic element with one atom per unit cell 
exists on a non-cubic lattice. Two atoms per unit cell require four times as much cpu 
time and hence have not yet been examined. Therefore Strange et al [13] calculated 
the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy for the fictitious compound simple tetragonal 
iron.
The difference in total energy for the moment pointing along (0,0,1) and (1,0,0) was 
calculated for a number of values of the axial ratio c/a. The potential was obtained from

reference [6]. The axial ratio was varied in such a way as to keep the nearest neighbour 
distance constant. This was done to avoid renormalising the potential to different sphere 
radii for each c/a value which would lead to too large an uncertainty. Again for the 
numerical details of the calculation the original references should be referred to [8,13]. 
As expected the magnetic moment increased and the single particle energies decreased as 
the crystal layers got further apart. Figure (7) shows the magnetocrystalline anisotropy 
energy as a function of axial ratio. There are three things to note about this curve. 
Firstly the energy scale is one to two orders of magnitude greater than the size of the 
magnetocrystalline anisotropy in nickel. This is as it should be. Secondly, the curve 
is smoothly varying which indicates that the numerical procedures used were reliable. 
Thirdly the curve passes through zero at c/a = 1.29. This indicates that if we varied 
c/a through this value the moment direction would flip through ninety degrees. In fact 
too many approximations have gone into this work to make this number reliable. The 
most important of these is probably the way c/a was varied without obtaining a new 
self-consistent potential for each new value and hence the difference in total energies 
being given by the difference in single electron energies is likely to be not strictly valid. 
Nonetheless this work does imply the theory would be able to predict a flip in the easy 
axis of magnetisation as a function of some other parameter. Strange et al are able 
to go on to examine the density of states at Ef as a function of c/a and show a well 
defined peak in this quantity, figure (8). This is a d-band narrowing and rising above 
Ef as c/a increases and being replaced by increasing s-character below Ef, analogous 
to a valence transition in a rare earth metal.
Now we go on to examine the origin of the anisotropy within the formalism of relativistic 
spin-polarised scattering theory. If we consider equations (2.21) to (2.24) the only place 
where a direction with respect to the crystal lattice enters is in the spherical harmonics 
in the expression for </(q, E) Taking Z-1 outside the square brackets of (2.23) what 
remains can be expanded as a binomial series. This leads to an infinite series of terms, 
each of which can be written (tg)n (ignoring quantum numbers), this term includes 
all n-site scattering processes. These can then be substituted back into (2.22). In the 
non-relativistic case the dependence of the t-matrices and the radial part of Z on the m- 
quantum numbers vanishes and they can be taken outside the sum over the m-quantum 
numbers. Then all that remains is a sum over Clebsch-Gordon coefficients and spherical 
harmonics. From simple trigonometrical relations it can be shown that the directional 
dependence cancels to all orders. In the relativistic case the t-matrix and Zs cannot 
be taken outside the m-summation. i.e. The symmetry which gave cancellation in 
the non-relativistic case has been broken and hence magnetocrystalline anisotropy is 
observed.
The value of the single-electron energy difference between distinct moment directions 
is due to different elements of the T-matrix being dominant as the t-matrix is rotated 
and hence the symmetry is broken in different ways for each moment direction. Funda­
mentally this occurs relativistically and not non-relativistically because the relativistic 
theory conserves total angular momentum only, spin and orbital angular momentum 
are not conserved separately. In the non-relativistic case they are conserved separately.
In conclusion then, magnetocrystalline anisotropy energies can be calculated to the 
right order of magnitude. It is not clear why the values obtained are not in numerical 
agreement with experiment. For the smallest anisotropies the uncertainties in numerical 
314

procedures are nearly as large as the quantities we are trying to calculate. It may be 
that the potentials used just are not sufficiently precise to give the correct anisotropy 
energy, or that the force theorem is not a good enough approximation. However it 
may be that this theory is insufficient as it stands and we need to relax some of the 
approximations that have gone into it, for example the spherical approximation for the 
potential, or a more explicit inclusion of the Breit interaction. Finally as the atomic 
and molecular physicists have discussed elsewhere in this volume, if we try to calculate 
energies much smaller than these within density functional theory it will soon become 
necessary to examine the validity of the point nucleus approximation! Further work 
needs to be done to sort these problems out.
Paramagnetic spin susceptibility, Finite temperature anisotropy
In this section we report on work in progress in setting up a theory for the spin suscepti­
bility of metals using relativistic spin polarised multiple scattering theory. The dynam­
ical regime of this theory will be appropriate for studies of gaps in spin wave spectra 
and the coupling of spin wave excitations to crystallographic directions. To date, we 
have succeeded in carrying out explicit calculations for the static uniform paramagnetic 
spin susceptibility for cubic and h.c.p. systems [14]. When applied to systems which 
are ferromagnetic at low temperatures , the formulism will indicate the direction in the 
crystal lattice along which the magnetic moments initially align. Calculations for h.c.p. 
cobalt also show that thermally driven Stoner excitations affect this preferred direction. 
The work at this stage can be viewed as complementary to magnetic anisotropy energy 
calculations.
In short our approach is the relativistic generalisation of that of Vosko and Perdew [34], 
Macdonald and Vosko [35] and related work. In particular Stenzel and Winter [36] and 
Winter et al. [37] have set up a scheme for calculating the dynamic spin susceptibility 
of metals using a multiple scattering framework and our work, described fully in [14], 
is essentially the relativistic generalisation of the static limit of their theory. We start 
with an accurate relativistic treatment of the electronic structure of the paramagnetic 
system described by a single particle Green function. This paramagnetic system is then 
subjected to a small external magnetic field and the induced magnetisation determined. 
With the use of Euler rotation matrices, we can vary the orientation of the magnetic 
field with respect to the crystal axes. An expression for the paramagnetic susceptibility 
is obtained and has the form
T) = Xo(^; T)/(l - IXoW>-, T) 
(2.41)
where 3 and represent the orientation of the magnetic field and xoJXo describe 
the unenhanced and enhanced susceptibilities respectively. The denominator of this 
expression can be used to set up a relativistic Stoner condition. Full detailed expressions 
for these quantities are given in [14]. Once again, if the non-relativistic versions of these 
quantities are used the 3 and (f) dependence, i.e. the anisotropy, vanishes along with the 
spin-orbit coupling.
So far f.c.c. and h.c.p Co have been looked at with this theory. At low temperatures 
cobalt is an h.c.p. ferromagnet. As its temperature is increased it changes structure to 
an f.c.c. phase and at still higher temperatures becomes paramagnetic. Consequently 
paramagnetic h.c.p. cobalt does not exist but calculations of its spin susceptibility do 
315

provide insights into the nature of magnetic anisotropy in the presence of Stoner like 
excitations. In [14] they found ’Stoner’ transition temperatures of 4345K and 2295K 
were found for h.c.p. and f.c.c. Co respectively. Owing to the neglect of spin wave 
fluctuations these are too high. The paramagnetic susceptibility of the cubic system in 
this linear response theory shows no dependence upon the orientation of the induced 
magnetisation but that of h.c.p. cobalt indicates that the magnetisation would initially 
grow in the a-b plane. On examining xtOfa T) as a function of 6 and </>, we found that 
the anisotropy varies wih temperature and ,at 4345K, it diverges when 0 and </> describe 
a magnetic response in the a-b plane.
Relativistic spin-polarised scattering theory provides a new formulism for the static 
spin susceptibility which incorporates an anisotropic effect. Calculations show that this 
effect is temperature dependent. The formulism gives a generalised Stoner condition 
and forms the basis for future studies of dynamical effects.

INTRODUCTION
Since 1969 ( 1) it was well known that photoelectrons 
emitted from non-magnetic targets after excitation by 
circularly polarized radiation might be polarized.Such a 
theoretical prediction has its origin in the fact that, 
because of spin-orbit interaction, the spin-components of the 
electron wavefunction at a given binding energy Ei are 
different and the interaction with a photon in a definite 
helicity state selects just one spin components,making 
therefore the electron at energy Ei+?269 polarized. Experiments 
on atoms, molecules and solids confirmed such predictions.
In 1984 it appeared the first photoemission experiment 
(2) where photoelectron extracted normally from the (1,1,1) 
face of Platinum, by normally incident circularly polarized 
radiation, were contemporarily analyzed in energy (kinetic 
energy), momentum (emission angle), and spin (polarization). 
Because these three physical quantities are represented by 
non-commuting quantum operators, the above sentence will be 
reviewed in some detail in the following section. The quoted 
work, actually, opened a very interesting field of research in 
solid state physics, showing that spin-polarized photoemission 
was able to gain information not only about the initial states 
energy dispersion but also about the spin symmetry of the 
electron wavefunction in non-magnetic metals. It was made 
feasible by the realization of a 'Mott' detector: the LEED 
detector, i.e. a tungsten surface onto which the photoelectron 
beam is shot to diffract and separate 'spin up' and 'spin 
down' electrons. A number of experimental papers appeared so 
far on this topics and Tamura, Piepke and Feder (3) have made 
accurate calculations and analysis about the extent of 
agreement between theory and experiment.

Theorists came along, in effects. In 1985, the theory and 
the quantitative explanations of the above experiment was 
provided (4,5). Later, in 1987, Feder’s group was able to 
predict (6) that even by using linearly polarized light it was 
possible to extract polarized electrons, depending on the 
symmetry of particular surfaces (as the FCC (1,1,1) face) and 
experiments confirmed their prediction (7) .
Another effect, still in Pt (1,1,1), was discovered in 
1986 (8) in the case of off-normal emission. Opposite to the 
case of normal emission, in which case reversing the helicity 
of the light will produce a change of sign of the 
photoelectron spin polarization but not the total 
photocurrent, in the case of off-normal emission a sizeable 
asymmetry of the total photocurrent has been found, after 
reversing the helicity. Such phenomenon has its origin in the 
breakdown of the spatial and time reversal invariance 
introduced by the surface in addition to the above 
photoelectron spin-polarization effect, as it was argued by 
those authors. Garbe and Kirschner (9) made a more systematic 
study of this Photoemission Intensity Asymmetry (PIA). We have 
given in ref. 10 a quantitative explanation of such an effect 
by means of explicit calculations and symmetry analysis.
In this talk we will discuss about the fundamental points 
of a fully relativistic theory of photoemission, necessary to 
sort out the role of the electron spin and its interactions, 
and we will illustrate some theoretical predictions which are 
possible only because of the use of a fully relativistic 
hamiltonian.
THEORETICAL PREDICTIONS
The basic idea that made possible to elaborate a first 
principle theory of photoemission spectra from metals was due 
to Mahan (11). It consists in regarding the final state of the 
photoemission process as a time-reversed LEED (Low Energy 
Electron Diffraction) state. This is the basis of the so- 
called One-Step model, in which the photoemission cross 
section is evaluated as the rate of probability of a quantum 
transition for an electron in a Bloch state to such a final 
state, and which matches to the Three-Step model, in which the 
photoemission process is regarded as (i) a bulk optical 
excitation, followed by (ii) propagation up to the surface and 
(iii) diffraction. We do not discuss here about which of these 
models is the best, but we want just to point out that the 
One-Step model certainly defines the final state of the 
photoemission process in the most correct way. On this basis 
Pendry (12) was able to formulate, within the Multiple 
Scattering theoretical framework, a computer suitable non- 
relativistic theory for the One-Step model, largely using the 
already well established LEED theory and computer codes (see 
for example ref. 13). Such a non-relativistic theory af Angle 
Resolved Photo-Emission (ARPE) and its following improvements 
(14), together with its extension to the random alloy case 
(15), timely appeared while ARPE measurements, exploiting 
synchrotron radiation facilities, were coming along, and it 
had a remarkable success in linking the electronic structure 
320

of metals and alloys to the experimental spectra (see for 
example ref. 16).
Notwithstanding its merits, such a theory cannot deal 
with metals and alloys of high atomic numbers, because of the 
absence in the hamiltonian of the relativistic interactions 
due to the electron spin. After Pendry’s theory next challenge 
to the theorists has been the relativistic generalization of 
the One-Step model. That involved the proper time reversal 
operation and the analysis of the photoelectron spin 
polarization. A very similar problem has been encountered in 
the literature when the relativistic electron diffraction 
problem has been studied (see for example refs. 17,18,19).
The existing fully relativistic theories of the One-Step 
model photoemission are due to Ackermann and Feder (20) and 
Ginatempo, Durham and Gyorffy (21) . We have shown in a 
separate paper (9) how both theories and related codes 
produces very similar results. Both theories are the fully 
relativistic generalization of Pendry’s LEED theory and differ 
only in few aspects: the first one can deal with both magnetic 
and non-magnetic metals, while the second one can deal with 
all non-magnetic metals, random alloys and intermetallic 
ordered compounds. Another big difference is about the form of 
the electric dipole matrix element: Ackermann and Feder use 
the velocity form of the matrix element, while we use a 
generalization of the acceleration form whose limit with c —»°° 
analytically recover the non-relativistic counterpart (21).
Problem—set ..up
In the logic of time reversing the actual physical 
process, we start by defining the final state of the 
photoelectron at the Mott detector, placed far away (at Z) 
from the metal surface, as the following relativistic plane 
wave :
(r|f,Z) = ^q^U^(f + to)exp(-ik=-r)5(z-Z) 
s
(1)
where A stands for ’up’ and ’down' and refers to the spin 
direction accepted by the Mott Detector whose internal axis of
spin quantization is directed along nj and is the usual 
four-spinor amplitude of the plane wave with s=±l denoting the 
spin state of the photoelectron respect with the surface
normal. The are defined in terms of the Pauli spinors XX

The final state at the detector in eq. (1) is then joined 
smoothly at the surface to the proper Bloch state in the bulk 
of energy Ei + fiO) Finally the amplitude of such states are 
calculated by the probability amplitude to have been induced 
by polarized light incident along the surface normal with 
helicity V. In terms of quantities as eqs. (2) one can write 
down a density matrix whose diagonal elements, for a given

An experiment that measures P for a given incidence and

PV is identically zero in absence of spin-orbit 
interaction as the following exercise will demonstrate.

Consider a single spherical muffin-tin well. In such a 
case the photocurrent can be written as:

where the A’s are the coefficients of the relativistic

where the coefficients 0's at the r.h.s. are some tricky

the direction of the photon, the direction of the 
photoelectron and the direction of the Mott detector axis. If

because the double sum on the j's and the/I ’ s reduces to zero. 
We conclude then that the phenomenon of the spin polarization 
of electrons extracted from non-magnetic atoms is a direct 
consequence of the spin-orbit interaction.
Symmetry
The difference within the square brackets in eq. (9), 
however, can be zero for a number of other reasons, namely 
because of the polarization of the light. In fact, even if 
spin-orbit interaction is not neglected, in case of linearly 
polarized radiation (V=0), the above calculation yields zero 
again. This fact is simply due to the symmetry of the system 
under investigation, i.e. the spherical symmetry of the 
muffin-tin well. This means that for more complicates targets, 
as surfaces, different and sometimes curious results are to be 
expected, either because the formulae for the photocurrents 
become more complicated, involving Multiple Scattering, or 
because surface symmetry affects deeply the selection rules. 
For a deep analysis of the role of the target symmetry see for 
example ref. (22) .
Tamura, Piepke and Feder (6) have shown that linearly 
polarized light extracts indeed polarized electrons from the 
(1,1,1) surface of platinum. Their arguments are based on the 
symmetry properties of such a surface. The triangular symmetry 
of the FCC (1,1,1) face (the C3V group)consists of a threefold 
rotation axis (the surface normal) and three mirror operation 
with respect to the three planes FLUX orthogonal to the 
surface (see Fig. 1) Such planes make ann angle of 120 degrees 
each other and their intersection is the surface normal. It 
follows that the right and left side, with respect to the 
surface normal in a mirror plane are not equivalent, because 
the mirror operation with respect to a plane orthogonal to a 
FLUX plan is not a triangular symmetry operation. In other

words the contributions to ij from both sides of a plane 
orthogonal to a mirror plane cannot be the same and therefore 
components of the spin-polarization vector parallel to the 
surface are to be expected even if linearly polarized light is 
used. For future reference we recall here that the symmetry of 
the FCC (1,1,1) surface is due to the fact that the underlying 
layers are shifted and rotated respect with the first.
Photoemission Intensity Asymmetry
The breakdown of translational invariance and time 
reversal symmetry introduced by surfaces has dramatic effects 
on photoemission spectra. For example, group theory arguments 
(23) demonstrate that a bulk optical interband transition at a 
given k-point along a symmetry direction must be entirely 
spin-polarized. The experiments never found such a results, 
but only partial spin polarization have been detected. The 
reason can be found in the fact that only few top atomic 
layers contribute to the spectra, because of the limited 
photoelectron escape depth. That means that, even if the 
energy position of a photocurrent peak identifies the precise 
band and k-point at which the transition occurs, the actual 
shape of a spectrum strongly depends upon the scattering 
history of the photoelectrons in a slab structure, before and 
after being excited. The reduction of translational and time 
reversal symmetry therefore acts broadening the photocurrent 
peaks and mixing the spin states. As a consequence, if 
photoelectrons, excited by circularly polarized radiation 
incident normally to the surface, are collected along an off- 
normal direction (the case of normal incidence and normal 
emission is, as we will see in the following, a highly 
degenerate one), one should expect for generally different 
spectra using photons of positive and negative helicity, 
because of the lack of cancellations produced by the surface. 
In other words, the surface acts as a spin filter, depressing 
or enhancing a given polarized photoelectron peak, so that 
affecting in different ways the shape of the spectra taken 
with positive and negative helicity.
Indeed, such an effect has been discovered by Oepen 
Hunlich and Kirschner (8) in 1986. These authors claimed also 
that the same kind of informations about the symmetry of 
electron bands one gets from the spin-polarized experiments, 
is obtainable from the asymmetry measurements which are in 
principle easier and faster than the former, because they do 
not need to analyze the photoelectron beam by the LEED 
detector. In some sense, one exploits the surface under 
investigation itself as a LEED detector. Such an effect is, 
indeed, a consequence of the fact that circularly polarized 
radiation excites spin-polarized electrons, however, owing to 
the fact that to have a sizeable PIA one has to work at off- 
normal emission directions and that in such a case is more 
difficult to identify the k-points corresponding to the 
initial state, this experiment should be regarded as 
complementary to the spin-polarized one, even if, as we will 
see, it brings a great deal of information about the surface 
properties .
326

Arbitrary rotation of the surface with respect to its 
normal must affect the spectra taken at a fixed polar angle 
and their asymmetry. In ref. (8) a qualitative explanation of 
such an effect is given in term of the Three-Step model. Garbe 
and Kirschner (9) presented a systematic study of the PIA for 
Pt (1,1,1) highlighting its behavior vs the azimuth angle. 
Ginatempo and Gyorffy (10) calculated the photocurrents 
(within the One-Step model) and their asymmetry, confirming 
and analyzing the experimental results, and remarked the role 
played by the surface and its symmetry.
Following ref. (9), one can define the PIA spectrum as

axial vectors: the

scalar product of 2 
spin-polarization and
that is the 
photoelectron 
whose introduction allows us to describe the asymmetry effect 
independently of the polarization, and immediately evidentiate 
how such an effect is a relativistic one. In case of normal 
incidence and emission along a direction ne = (0e,(p) where 
is measured from the surface normal and , the azimuth angle, 
is measured from a FLUX mirror plane of the (1,1,1) face, 
A^O is expected. Now, because A and P are axial vectors, 
under a mirror operation their components parallel to the 
mirror plane must change sign, while the normal component must 
not. That does not change their scalar products, but also the 
photon spin is an axial vector which for positive (negative) 
helicity is oriented parallel (antiparallel) to the surface 
normal (the direction of light propagation) and only has 
components in the mirror plane. Therefore it is inverted by 
mirror operation and that changes the sign of the polarization 
too. It follows then that the asymmetry is an antisymmetric 
function of the azimuth angle, i.e.:
A(0e,+<p) = -A(0e,-<p)

free from geometrical errors, systematically fulfill such

predictions. The undoubtable fact that the PIA depends upon 
the surface symmetry suggests its use as a very valuable probe 
in surface reconstruction analysis. Another convincing reason 
is the following.
Fig.2 shows the antisymmetric behavior of the symmetry of 
a feature ("band 4”) in a photoemission spectrum (Pt (1,1,1) 
normal incidence, h(0 = 18 eV, = 62 ) at about -1.5 eV below the 
Fermi level as measured (9) and calculated (10). The somewhat 
surprising oscillating behavior of half period 30 degrees, of 
both theory and experiment (less accurate in the experiment 
for negative azimuths) , has a very interesting physical 
interpretation. Suppose the system has the full hexagonal 
symmetry (which would be true if the first layer was 
isolated) . In such a case eq. (13) would predict a periodic 
behavior of period 60 degrees (the mirror planes in such a 
case are making such an angle each other) . Now, the FCC 
(1,1,1) surface has only the triangular C3V symmetry owing to 
the displacements and rotations of the inner layers with 
respect to the first. But the outer layers are the ones which 
contribute more to the photocurrent, so that one could hazard 
this conclusion: the 'quasi hexagonal' symmetry shown by Fig.2 
arises from a combination of weak interaction between the 
layers and escape depth. Because of the fact that the layers 
interact and that the full symmetry is only triangular, 
different peaks in the photocurrent spectrum have different 
asymmetries as a function of the azimuth angle but the 
tendency of such functions to oscillate around = 30 is a 
clear surface geometry effect. The use of this function in 
surface analysis is therefore promising.
Lifetimes
To make feasible such One-Step model calculations one has 
to introduce two parameters the low and the high energy 
inverse lifetimes, Voi and Vpi. The LEED calculations are 
carried on building a slab structure of atomic layers of 
bidimensional periodicity and calculating the waves amplitude 
of back and forth scattered waves in this structure, limited 
by the surface and the bulk. That can be numerically achieved 
introducing a negative imaginary potential to be added to the 
actual energy Ei + ftry of the LEED state. Photoemission 
calculations consist of two LEED calculations to be carried on 
for the photoelectron wavefunction and for the hole 
wavefunction, so that the introduction of 2 different 
parameters is required. Such parameters might be regarded just 
as a numerical trick to allow the calculations to converge, 
but they have interesting physical meanings. A careful 
analysis of them can be found in ref. (22) .
The high energy inverse lifetime Vpi is actually related 
to the photoelectron escape depth, and, in effect, it limits 
the number of layers entering the calculation. It is, in 
principle a function of the photoelectron kinetic energy. For 
a homogeneous gas one could take for it a constant value of 4 
eV, and such choice has proved to be a successful one for most 
applications (22). Looking for more sophisticated treatments, 
one could write in atomic units:

T(e) = (2Vpi(£)) 1 and A = T^2[f-iVpi(£))
(15)
and a parametric form of A might give better results. Another 
possible choice could be
Vpi(£) = a(e-£F^ 
(16)
and suggested by McRae and Caldwell(24)used by Tamura, Piepke 
and Feder (3) .
The hole lifetime Vgi is a much complicated matter. It is 
actually the imaginary part of the self-energy to be 
introduced to deal with many-body effects in the photoemission 
process. The existing models let it varies linearly or 
quadratically with the distance from the Fermi level and 
actually they represent an important future development for 
the photoemission theory.
Neglecting the energy dependence of Voi means in some 
sense to limit the calculations to the one-particle spectra. 
But imposing a non-zero value for it has in practice the 
effect of damping the low energy states, i.e. the effect of 
decreasing the multiple scattering of the initial states 
within a single layer and among the layers of the slab. Such a 
decrease is related to the quasi-symmetry effect illustrated 
in the preceding subsection to explain the oscillations of the 
PIA vs the azimuth angle of Fig. 2. Decreasing the 
interactions between the layers 'changes slowly' the symmetry 
from triangular to hexagonal. Fig. 3 shows such an effect. 
Increasing the low energy inverse lifetime absolute value has 
the effect to reduce the asymmetry for the angle = 30, and 
to let the spectra for = 20 and = 40 to become 
antisymmetric. We interpret this fact as an increase of 
hexagonal symmetry.
CONCLUSIONS
We like to conclude such a discussion just remarking how 
the spin-polarization and the asymmetry of photoelectron beams 
are phenomena based on the fact that the speed of the light is 
a universal constant. As a consequence of that, relativistic 
interactions affect the motion of electrons in a metal and 
produce, among the others, the physical effects described 
above. Due to their relativistic nature it is not possible to 
describe them out of a fully relativistic theoretical 
framework.

Introduction
In recent years the development of high intensity synchrotron radiation sources has en­
abled us to use X-ray spectroscopies as a probe of the electronic structure of materials on 
an extremely detailed level. In particular, the high fluxes available have made possible 
spectroscopies based on magnetic scattering rather than charge scattering [1,2,3]. The 
magnetic scattering is smaller than charge scattering by a factor of luv/mc2. Nonethe­
less such investigations have been carried out. Sawatzky and co-workers [4,5,6] have 
examined the absorption spectra of rare earth materials and interpreted them in 
terms of localised f-electrons excited from a Hunds rule ground state. Siddons and 
coworkers [7] have studied the Faraday rotation and ellipticity of linearly polarised radi­
ation in transmission through a magnetic material. The Magneto-Optic Kerr Effect has 
been observed in many materials (see [8] for example). Schutz and co-workers [9,10,11] 
have used circularly polarised X-rays and have found a difference in absorption rate 
between left and right circularly polarised incident radiation. This effect is known as 
X-ray dichroism. It is a theoretical description of this that the present chapter focuses 
upon.
Theoretical Framework
Virtually all the first principles theoretical research into the electronic structure of solids 
today is based upon the density functional theory. The relativistic version of this is dis­
cussed elsewhere in this volume. By first principles we mean that the only necessary

input into a calculation on a specific material is the atomic number and stoichiometry, 
which just identifies the material, (The crystal structure can be calculated, but usually 
we are not directly interested in calculating this, so we save time and use the known 
structure). The most important probe of electronic structures away from the Fermi 
energy is the large number of photon spectroscopies available. These spectroscopies 
excite an electron from one energy level to another, leaving a hole in the initial state, 
(This is the least that happens, often more complicated processes occur). Spectroscopies 
measure the spectrum of the excited states. Now we have reached a difficulty already. 
The density functional theory is only a theory of the ground-state, whereas the spec­
troscopies, by definition, create an excited state. It is certainly true that the density 
functional energy bands do not represent the quasi-particle excitation energies. How­
ever it has been argued by Durham [1] and Von-Barth [12] that the density-functional 
eigenvalues are probably quite close to the true quasi-particle energies. Certainly, ex­
perience has shown us that agreement between one-electron theory and experiment is 
surprisingly good, particularly for metals.
All the magneto-optical effects mentioned in the introduction have their origin in the 
subtle interplay between spin-orbit coupling and spin-polarisation. Hence we have to 
use relativistic density functional theory to describe them. This is implemented using 
relativistic band theory, in the present case this involves a multiple scattering theory 
approach. The important aspect of the simultaneous occurence of these two effects is the 
coupling of the spin to the crystal lattice and the consequent lowering of the symmetry 
in the material. We now go on to examine, in detail, how this symmetry breaking leads 
to magnetic X-ray dichroism.
Theoretical Method
The formal one-electron theory for studying spectroscopies, including X-ray absorption, 
using multiple scattering theory was developed by Durham [1]. It is certainly true 
that many electron effects also contribute to the theory, however we ignore them here, 
and indeed in most cases they turn out to be negligible. Ultimately though, this is a 
fundamental limitation of the theory presented here. This treatment assumes we know 
the one-electron scattering Green function. If this is known the method is applicable 
equally to elements, dilute alloys and ordered and disordered compounds.
In this paper we are concerned with X-ray absorption. The absorption coefficient is 
given by (by definition)
(i)

where 
is the probability that a photon of frequency a;, wavevector q and po­
larisation state A excites an electron in state i up into the conduction band. Note that 
throughout this chapter we use /z to represent two different things. Where it has an 
argument it is the absorption coefficient. Where it has no argument it is the quan­
tum number associated with the z-component of total angular momentum operator.

In this equation Ei is the energy of the core state which is a Dirac spinor. Ep is the 
Fermi energy. The 0-function ensures that the excited electron can only occupy ener­
getically acceptable empty conduction band states. The are interaction operators.

Within a fully relatvistic and spin-polarised formalism this is given by
^qA(r) = — ea • A(r) 
(3)
where A(r) is the vector potential associated with the incident radiation and a are the 
usual Dirac matrices. It is in the interaction operator that we distinguish between left 
(LCP) and right (RCP) circularly polarised radiation. Of course the incident radiation 
may be described by a plane wave
E = Eoe^'-^ex
where is a vector describing the polarisation state of the wave. The convention 
is that the electric field associated with an incident LCP photon is — (l,i,0) and 
if the incident photon is RCP we have = (1, — z,0), provided q points along the 
z-axis (0,0,1)- Throughout this chapter we assume the incident wavevector and the 
magnetisation direction are parallel along the z-axis. The vector potential can easily 
be obtained from these via Maxwells equations. G(r,r/;£) is the Green function which 
describes the electronic structure of the material, and in particular the final states 
available for the excited electron. For the present purposes we include magnetic and 
relativistic effects on an equal footing. The scattering theory method for calculating the 
Green function under such circumstances has been derived by Strange et al [13,14,15]. 
They show that the scattering Green function is given by
G(r,r'-,E) = £ ZA(r,E)T^,(E)Z+(r',E) - £ ZA(r,E)j+(r',E)

quantum numbers k and /z.

by the integral of the inverse of the KKR matrix over the first brillouin zone.
rZm = 1 jBzd3k[t-\E) - G(k,(5)
In this equation t is the single site t-matrix and G(k,j&) are the usual KKR structure 
constants rotated, if necessary, into the correct representation. A full discussion of the 
properties of r is given in references [16] and [17]. Details of the calculation of these 
quantities in the relativistic case are given by Strange et al [14]. Here we have implicitly 
assumed we are dealing with a single atom per unit cell. If this is not the case equation 
(4) can easily be generalised by allowing the superscript n to represent atomic species as 
well as unit cell. If we want to consider random alloys the ts can be obtained from the 
KKR-CPA equations [17], or for a single impurity we can find the effective site diagonal 
scattering path operator from (see reference [18])

Retaining only the first term here is known as the electric dipole approximation. Higher 
terms represent magnetic dipole, electric quadrupole contributions etc. The matrix ele­
ments of equation (8) are not entirely straightforward to calculate because the functions 
and Z^r^E) are 4-vectors which do not have a unique spin-angular character 
[13,14]. This arises because the spin-polarisation and spin-orbit coupling couple states 
of different /-quantum number. Only /i remains a good quantum number. Henceforth we 
restrict ourselves to the representation. In this representation the wavefunctions 
have the form
ZKll(r,E) = ^Z^K^E)

resents the spin angular character and the second represents the asymptotic behaviour

Now ax is the polarisation vector of the photon field and for RCP we have a_ =
a(l,—i,0) and for LCP = a(l,z,0). Taking the scalar product of these with the
Pauli matrices gives
(14)
We can substitute these matrices into (13) and perform the angular integrals straight­
forwardly. This leads us to:-

and

Substitution of this into equation (12) gives the selection rules for the dipole approxima­
tion, I — I1 = ±1 and /i — n' = ±1, depending on the polarisation state. Now we have got 
to the source of the difference in absorption rate for LCP and RCP incident radiation. 
It is easier to answer the question, Why is there no difference in the absorption rate 
for incident LCP and RCP radiation in the non-relativistic case? In the non-relativistic 
case we would get these same selection rules. However the radial part of the matrix 
element is independent of /i in this case. Therefore, the amplitude for /i — p1 = 1 would 
be the same as for fi — /? = —1, and hence the absorption rates for LCP and RCP 
X-rays are equal. In the relativistic case this is no longer true.
Note that (at least at real energies) both the radial and angular integrals are real, 
and hence the matrix element of equation (12) is completely imaginary. It is a simple 
generalisation to go above the dipole approximation, and include the iq.r term from 
equation (9). This simply leads to an extra factor of r in the radial integrals. As these 
are done numerically in the computer code, this requires very little extra labour. The 
angular integrals in this case can still be evaluated analytically and they lead to some 
interesting dipole forbidden transitions.
In equation (12) we can make the simplification that we neglect the relatively small 
contribution from the coupling of partial waves with different Z-values. Then the sum­
mations in (12) can be restricted to kJ = k^, —k; — 1 and k' = k, —k — 1. The first 
application of this theory was for X-rays tuned to the K-edge of iron [20,21,22]. This 
was prompted by the experiments of Schutz and co-workers [9,11]. However it turns 
out that this was convenient from the theoretical point of view as well. This is because 
a core s-level has a unique spin-angular character, and hence the summation over core 
quantum numbers simply reduces to kJ = k;. This is not the case for excitations from 
states with a higher /-quantum number. For example let us consider initial p2/2 and 
p3/2 states. Because of the spin-dependent potential the electrons in these shells contain 
some admixed p3/2 or Pi/2 character, although they can still be labelled uniquely by 
the /i- quantum number. A further complication arises because these states, which were 
degenerate in the paramagnetic case, are now slightly split by the effective magnetic 
field from the unpaired electrons in the outer levels. A full treatment of these effects 
requires a very accurate determination of core wavefunctions. Ebert [23] has developed 
an algorithm that provides such a determination, although he has shown that in some 
cases these effects can be ignored [18]. The larger the magnetic moment and the higher 
the principle quantum number, the more important these effects become.
Applications of the Theory
The first application of this theory was to iron [20,21]. The Green function was deter­
mined as described above using a potential obtained from a self-consistent spin-polarised 
non-relativistic electronic structure calculation [24]. Figure (1) shows the K-shell X-ray 
absorption coefficient of iron. This curve has undergone a lorentzian broadening of 
0.8eV to take into account the finite lifetime of the Is state. Further broadening of 
leV was included to take account of experimental broadening from various origins, such

this chapter. For iron and for all calculations the shape of the theoretical spectrum is 
to some extent dependent on the degree of broadening assumed. Figure (2) shows the 
relative difference in absorption coefficient for right and left circularly polarised incident 
radiation. The relative difference is defined by

Clearly all the main features of the experiment are well reproduced by the theory. This 
experiment has now been repeated by Cooper et al [25]. They have shown that the first 
experiment was subject to an error of a factor of 1.5. This changes quantitatively the 
agreement between the theory and experiment, however some of the discrepancy can be 
made up by decreasing the broadening factor, and anyway, the theoretical conclusions 
are not changed by this. The theory also gives good qualitative agreement with the 
corrected experiment. Figure (3) [21] shows the contribution to the absorption rate from 
the first correction to the electric dipole approximation. It is three orders of magnitude 
smaller than the leading order contribution. Nonetheless it is quite structured and 
certainly does contain information about the electronic structure of iron, which implies 
it may be worthwhile to examine it experimentally. This can be done by studying the 
variation of the accurately determined average intensity with changes in the crystal 
orientation, hence separating the magnetic and electric dipole contributions. To our 
knowledge this has not yet been attempted.
One further interesting feature of the relativistic theory is that the absorption depends 
on the orientation of the equilibrium magnetisation with respect to the crystal axes. 
If such an orientation dependence could be observed it would be a direct probe for 
studying magnetocrystalline anisotropy. However in the experiments of Schutz et al 
poly crystalline samples were used. For a completely valid comparison between experi­
ment and theory averages of the theoretical results over all crystal orientations should

be made. This has not been done in the figures because of the huge numerical and 
computational effort that would require.
Following this success for iron other materials have been investigated, both theoretically 
and experimentally. Schutz et al [10,25] have performed measurements of the magnetic 
X-ray dichroism for the magnetic transition metals and rare earths. The spectra for 
different elements are all rather different, showing that this is a sensitive probe of the 
magnetisation.
Calculations have been performed for the K-edge absorption in nickel and cobalt. For 
cobalt the correspondence between experiment and theory is as good as in the case 
of iron, (see figure (4)). For nickel the agreement is rather poor. Nickel is a case 
that is notorious for not being easily describable by the local approximation to density 
functional theory. This is discussed in detail by von Barth [12].
The Zi, L2 and Z3 edges of the rare earths terbium and gadolinium been investigated 
and they exhibit a fairly large dichroism. This has not yet been investigated theoretically 
for two reasons. Firstly the matrices one has to diagonalise become larger for rare earths 
and a large computational effort would be required. Secondly, the local approximation 
to density functional becomes suspect when we come to highly correlated shells like the 
4f-levels in rare earths. Therefore reliable potentials for calculating the Green function 
are not available.
Ebert and co-workers [18,26,27,28] have developed the theory further in several direc­
tions. Implementing his algorithm for calculating core states accurately [23] has enabled 
them to examine dichroism from core levels other than those of s-character. The first 
application of this has been to the absorption of platinum atoms dissolved in ferromag­
netic iron. This required the platinum atom t-matrix, which is trivial to calculate once 
we have a suitable potential. The potential was obtained from a self-consistent local 
spin density functional calculation on an embedded substitutional platinum atom in an 
iron matrix. A fully relativistic version of this method is not available, but for most 
cases the non-relativistic theory will be sufficient to generate a potential. The details 
of the method used to perform this calculation are described elsewhere [29]. From this 
they were able to find the scattering path operator of the impurity from equation (6). 
The absorption rate is then calculated by using equation (2) and summing over all pos­
sible core states which are defined by all possible values of The authors calculated 
the absorption coefficient and dichroism for the Z2 and Z3 edges and their results, to­
gether with the experiments are shown in figure (5). The theory reproduces all the 
main features of the experiment. This is particularly so because the degree of circular 
polarisation in the beam is difficult to determine accurately and has an error of about 
10%. A somewhat surprising feature of the curves is the difference in the magnitude of 
the dichroism in this case compared to the elements. Here it reaches 20% of the total 
whereas in elements it is only of order 0.1%.
These authors have then gone on to study dichroism in the £2 and £3 edges of a range 
of 5d impurities dissolved in iron. In all cases they have obtained excellent agreement 
with the experiments. In most cases they find the dichroism large compared to the 3d 
elements. Initially this seems rather surprising. Magnetic X-ray dichroism has its origin 
in the subtle interplay between spin-orbit coupling and spin-polarisation. Therefore one 
would naively expect it to scale with the local magnetic moment and the strength of 
the spin-orbit coupling. The heavy 5d elements have a rather small magnetic moment 
when dissolved in iron from which one would expect the dichroism to be reduced relative 
to iron. On the other hand these elements are substantially heavier than iron and so 
343

one expects spin-orbit coupling to be a considerably larger influence. Therefore one 
might expect these effects to cancel to first order. However this is not the case and the 
origin of the difference lies in the initial states. For the K-edge in iron the dichroism is 
essentially determined by the spin-orbit coupling in the 4p final states, which are the 
only states into which the initial Is state can be excited, owing to the selection rules. 
In this case the spin splitting of the initial Is state is negligible. For the L2 and Z3 
edges in the impurities in iron the dichroism is determined by the spin-orbit splitting 
of the initial 2p states as well as the splitting of the conduction band states. Therefore, 
contrasting these two effects is not very meaningful. A more meaningful comparison 
would be between the K-edge of iron and the K or Zi edge of the impurity. According 
to reference [18] this comparison has been made experimentally as well as theoretically 
and it has been found that the smaller spin-polarisation and larger spin-orbit coupling 
do compensate one another.
Figure (5) shows the L2 and L$ dichroism for osmium, iridium, platinum and gold. 
One striking feature of these curves is the difference in sign of the L2 and £3 dichro­
ism for Ir, Au and Pt. Schutz et al [9,18,27] have developed a simple model which 
explains this which is rather similar to the Fano effect [30]. Spin-orbit coupling gives 
rise to an effective spin-polarisation of an excited core electron which is described by a 
polarisation parameter Pe. This parameter relates the dichroism curves to the relative 
spin-polarisation An//ni in the component and 1-projected final state bands via
Mre'(w) = Pe.&ni/nt 
(17)
where ni is the /-projected density of states, and the angular momentum I is fixed by the 
selection rules. This relationship makes it clear that the dichroism depends on the local 
magnetic properties of the 5d transition metals. This model artificially splits up the 
absorption process into two steps, Firstly the excitation and polarisation of the electron 
and secondly, the settling into a final state. The value of Pe is usually taken from 
free atom calculations [9,31]. This shows that the L2 transitions should consist nearly 
exclusively of 2pt /2 5d3/2 transitions while the Z3 spectra are primarily 2p3/2 —> 5d5/2 
transitions. This involves an apparently rather arbitrary splitting of the final state into 
the /c-sub-bands. The corresponding Pe values have a ratio of about —2:1 and therefore 
explain the opposite sign of for the L2 and Z3 spectra. According to this model 
(equation (16))the dichroism curves divided by Pe give the difference between spin up 
and spin down polarisations in the /^-projected density of states, where I is determined 
by the selection rules.
Ebert and Zeller [18] have performed a detailed analysis of their rigorous calculations 
to see if this simplified model has any validity. The example they chose to consider was 
platinum dissolved in iron. They found that the model does contain the essential aspects 
of the magnetic X-ray dichroism spectra for this system because the electron polarisation 
parameter deduced from atomic calculations remains more or less unchanged in the solid 
state environment. The transitions for the L2 and Z3 spectra were dominated by the 
processes discussed above. They also found that the spin-polarisation derived from 
experiment cannot be interpreted as the one of K-projected sub-bands. For the system 
in question it bore more resemblance to the total d-band. Since the spin-polarisation 
calculated scalar relativistically agrees with that calculated fully relativistically they 
concluded that it was probably justified in most cases to use the scalar relativistic 
calculations to interpret the experimental spectra.
Further interesting physics can be deduced from this work. Proceeding across the pe­
riodic table, increasing the atomic number of the 5d impurity, the coupling between

the host and the impurity changes from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic. This has 
been deduced from neutron scattering measurements. This can also be deduced from 
the dichroism results. Because the Pe parameters for all the 5d impurities are more or 
less equal, and from the connection with the density of states from equation (16), the 
change in sign of the dichroism between osmium and iridium also indicates this change 
of coupling. However this occurs at a different place in the row of the periodic table 
than indicated by neutron scattering. Neutron scattering data has been interpreted [32] 
as indicating ferromagnetic coupling of osmium to iron. However, because the X-ray 
absorption is a much more local probe than neutron scattering it is believed to provide 
more reliable information on the coupling.
One note of caution needs to be sounded concerning the interpretation of magnetic X- 
ray dichroism spectra. The information it gives about the properties of impurities will 
only be unambiguous if there is no clustering of impurity atoms. If the impurity atoms 
do cluster, there will be alot of inequivalent sites with different moments. In that case 
the dichroism must be viewed only as a measure of the average spin-polarisation.
One very interesting application of Magnetic X-ray dichroism has been in the investiga­
tion of magnetic multilayers. In particular, this has been applied to Co/Pt Multilayers 
and to Co50Pt5o [28], (see figure (6)). In these layer structures the platinum contri­
bution to the magnetism is not known. In Co/Pd multilayer structures the saturation 
magnetisation is different to that for pure cobalt, suggesting a moment is induced in 
the Pd. Platinum is isoelectronic with palladium so one would expect the same effect 
to be observed. However, in Co/Pt the enhancement of the saturation magnetisation 
is not clearly observed [33]. Schutz and co-workers have measured the L$ dichroism in 
Co/Pt multilayers and compared it with the ordered compound CosoPtso [28]. Their 
results show unambiguously that the platinum atoms in the layer compounds have a 
significant spin-polarisation. Their results also indicated that the average moment on 
Pt in the layer structure is a factor of about 3 smaller than in the ordered compound. 
This is in reasonable agreement with the corresponding spin moments found from stan­
dard electronic structure calculations. These were 0.37/1# for CosoPtso and 0.08/1# as 
an average value for the multilayer structure 2Co/7Pt multilayer structure [34]. These 
results demonstrate that the experimental investigations of magnetic X-ray dichroism 
are a useful step towards an understanding of the magnetism of these layer structures. It 
is particularly useful as a probe of the penetration of the polarisation into the normally 
non-magnetic platinum.
One final point to make here is a potential use of dichroism. The largest value of the 
relative absorption rates found so far is about 20%. It is likely that materials that have 
not yet been investigated will have larger values. Some Heusler alloys[8], for example, 
may be good candidates. If this is so we can pass an unpolarised beam through the 
material and one polarisation will be effectively extinguished before the other. By a 
suitable choice of material thickness it should be possible to have a beam exiting from 
the material that is purely circularly polarised. Hence we have a method of producing 
X-rays that are purely circularly polarised, something that is rather difficult to do using 
other techniques.
