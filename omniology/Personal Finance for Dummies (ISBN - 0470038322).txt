Praise for Eric Tyson
“Eric Tyson is doing something important — namely, helping people at all
income levels to take control of their financial futures. This book is a natural
outgrowth of Tyson’s vision that he has nurtured for years. Like Henry Ford,
he wants to make something that was previously accessible only to the
wealthy accessible to middle-income Americans.”
— James C. Collins, coauthor of the national bestseller Built
to Last; former Lecturer in Business, Stanford Graduate
School of Business
“Personal Finance For Dummies is the perfect book for people who feel guilty
about inadequately managing their money but are intimidated by all of the
publications out there. It’s a painless way to learn how to take control.”
— National Public Radio’s Sound Money
“Eric Tyson . . . seems the perfect writer for a For Dummies book. He doesn’t
tell you what to do or consider doing without explaining the why’s and how’s
— and the booby traps to avoid — in plain English. . . . It will lead you through
the thickets of your own finances as painlessly as I can imagine.”
— Chicago Tribune
“This book provides easy-to-understand personal financial information and
advice for those without great wealth or knowledge in this area. Practitioners
like Eric Tyson, who care about the well-being of middle-income people, are
rare in today’s society.”
— Joel Hyatt, founder of Hyatt Legal Services, one of the
nation’s largest general-practice personal legal service
firms
“Worth getting. Scores of all-purpose money-management books reach book-
stores every year, but only once every couple of years does a standout 
personal finance primer come along. Personal Finance For Dummies, by finan-
cial counselor and columnist Eric Tyson, provides detailed, action-oriented
advice on everyday financial questions. . . . Tyson’s style is readable and 
unintimidating.”
— Kristin Davis, Kiplinger’s Personal Finance magazine
“This is a great book. It’s understandable. Other financial books are too techni-
cal and this one really is different.”
— Business Radio Network

About the Author
Eric Tyson first became interested in money more than three decades ago.
After his father was laid off during the 1973 recession and received some
retirement money from Philco-Ford, Eric worked with his dad to make invest-
ing decisions with the money. A couple years later, Eric won his high school’s
science fair with a project on what influences the stock market. Dr. Martin
Zweig, who provided some guidance, awarded Eric a one-year subscription to
the Zweig Forecast, a famous investment newsletter. Of course, Eric’s mom
and dad share some credit with Martin for Eric’s victory.
After toiling away for a number of years as a management consultant to
Fortune 500 financial-service firms, Eric finally figured out how to pursue his
dream. He took his inside knowledge of the banking, investment, and insur-
ance industries and committed himself to making personal financial manage-
ment accessible to all.
Today, Eric is an internationally acclaimed and bestselling personal finance
book author, syndicated columnist, and speaker. He has worked with and
taught people from all financial situations, so he knows the financial concerns
and questions of real folks just like you. Despite being handicapped by an
MBA from the Stanford Graduate School of Business and a B.S. in Economics
and Biology from Yale University, Eric remains a master of “keeping it simple.”
An accomplished personal finance writer, his “Investor’s Guide” syndicated
column, distributed by King Features, is read by millions nationally, and he
was an award-winning columnist for the San Francisco Examiner. He is the
author of five national bestselling financial books in the For Dummies series
on personal finance, investing, mutual funds, home buying (coauthor), and
taxes (coauthor). The prior edition of this book was awarded the Benjamin
Franklin Award for best book of the year in the Business category.
His latest book, Mind Over Money: Your Path to Wealth and Happiness
(CDS/Perseus), examines the problematic financial habits people engage in
and provides proven strategies for overcoming them.
Eric’s work has been featured and quoted in hundreds of local and national
publications, including Newsweek, The Wall Street Journal, Los Angeles Times,
Chicago Tribune, Forbes, Kiplinger’s Personal Finance magazine, Parenting,
Money, Family Money, and Bottom Line/Personal; on NBC’s Today Show, ABC,
CNBC, PBS Nightly Business Report, CNN, and FOX-TV; and on CBS national
radio, NPR’s Sound Money, Bloomberg Business Radio, and Business Radio
Network.


Dedication
This book is hereby and irrevocably dedicated to my family and friends, as
well as to my counseling clients and customers, who ultimately have taught
me everything that I know about how to explain financial terms and strate-
gies so that all of us may benefit.
Author’s Acknowledgments
Being an entrepreneur involves endless challenges, and without the support
and input of my good friends and mentors Peter Mazonson, Jim Collins, and
my best friend and wife, Judy, I couldn’t have accomplished what I have.
I hold many people accountable for my perverse and maniacal interest in fig-
uring out the financial services industry and money matters, but most of the
blame falls on my loving parents, Charles and Paulina, who taught me most of
what I know that’s been of use in the real world.
I’d also like to thank Michael Bloom, Chris Dominguez, Maggie McCall, David
Ish, Paul Kozak, Chris Treadway, Sally St. Lawrence, K.T. Rabin, Will Hearst III,
Ray Brown, Susan Wolf, Rich Caramella, Lisa Baker, Renn Vera, Maureen
Taylor, Jerry Jacob, Robert Crum, Duc Nguyen, Maria Carmicino, and all the
good folks at King Features for believing in and supporting my writing and
teaching.
Many thanks to all the people who provided insightful comments on this edi-
tion and previous editions of this book, especially financial planner Sheryl
Garrett, Bill Urban, Barton Francis, Mike van den Akker, Gretchen Morgenson,
Craig Litman, Gerri Detweiler, Mark White, Alan Bush, Nancy Coolidge, and
Chris Jensen.
And thanks to all the wonderful people at my publisher on the front line and
behind the scenes, especially Kathy Cox and Alissa Schwipps.

Introduction
I
f your personal financial knowledge is limited, you’re probably not at fault.
Personal Finance 101 isn’t offered in our schools — not in high school and
not even in the best colleges and graduate programs. It should be. (Of course,
if it were, I wouldn’t be able to write fun and useful books such as this — or
maybe they’d use this book in the course!)
People keep making the same common financial mistakes over and over —
procrastinating and lack of planning, wasteful spending, falling prey to financial
salespeople and pitches, failing to do sufficient research before making impor-
tant financial decisions, and so on. This book can keep you from falling into
the same traps and get you going on the best paths.
As unfair as it may seem, numerous pitfalls await you when you seek help for
your financial problems. The world is filled with biased and bad financial
advice. As a practicing financial counselor and now as a writer, I constantly
see and hear about the consequences of poor advice. Of course, every profes-
sion has bad apples, but too many of the people calling themselves “financial
planners” have conflicts of interest and an inadequate competence level.
All too often, financial advice ignores the big picture and focuses narrowly on
investing. Because money is not an end in itself but a part of your whole life,
this book helps connect your financial goals and challenges to the rest of
your life. You need a broad understanding of personal finance to include all
areas of your financial life: spending, taxes, saving and investing, insurance,
and planning for major goals like education, buying a home, and retirement.
Even if you understand the financial basics, thinking about your finances in a
holistic way can be difficult. Sometimes you’re too close to the situation to be
objective. Like the organization of your desk or home (or disorganization, as
the case may be), your finances may reflect the history of your life more than
they reflect a comprehensive plan for your future.
You’re likely a busy person who doesn’t have enough hours in the day to
get things done. Thus, you want to know how to diagnose your financial situ-
ation efficiently (and painlessly) and determine what you should do next.
Unfortunately, after figuring out which financial strategies make sense for you,
choosing specific financial products in the marketplace can be a nightmare.
You have literally thousands of investment, insurance, and loan options to
choose from. Talk about information overload!

To complicate matters even more, you probably hear about most products
through advertising that can be misleading, if not downright false. Of course,
some ethical and outstanding firms advertise, but so do those that are more
interested in converting your hard-earned income and savings into their prof-
its. And they may not be here tomorrow when you need them.
You want to know the best places to go for your circumstances, so this book
contains specific, tried-and-proven recommendations. I also suggest where to
turn next if you need more information and help.
About This Book
You selected wisely in picking up a copy of Personal Finance For Dummies,
5th Edition! More than 1.5 million copies of prior editions of this book are in
print, and as you can see from the quotes in the front of this edition, readers
and reviewers alike were pleased with those editions. This book was also pre-
viously awarded the prestigious Benjamin Franklin Award for best book of the
year in Business.
However, I never rest on my laurels. So the book you hold in your hands
reflects more hard work and brings you the freshest material for addressing
your personal financial quandaries.
Here are some of the major updates you may notice as you peruse the pages
of this book:
 Coverage of new and revised tax laws and how to best take advantage
of them
 The latest information on what’s going on with Social Security and
Medicare and what it means for how you should prepare for and live
in retirement
 Updated investment recommendations — especially in the areas of mutual
funds/other managed investments and real estate — throughout Part III
 Enhanced coverage of smart spending, which includes finding the best
ways to shop online, minimizing bank fees and lousy service, coping
with higher energy costs, eating healthy without spending a fortune,
and spending wisely on technology
 Complete analysis of the new bankruptcy laws and the best ways to
reduce and eliminate the financial plague of consumer debt
 Additional coverage of smart ways to use credit, understanding your
credit scores, and how to improve them
 Expanded coverage of education savings options and education tax
breaks and how they impact financial aid
2
Personal Finance For Dummies, 5th Edition 

 Revised recommendations for where to get the best insurance deals and
expanded coverage on preparing for natural disasters
 Updated details on how to avoid identity theft and other scams
 Expanded and updated coverage of financial resources (especially
online resources)
 The latest advice on how to simplify your financial life and pass on what
you know to others you love
Aside from being packed with updated information, another great feature of
this book is that you can read it from cover to cover if you want, or you can
read each chapter and part without having to read what comes before, which
is useful if you have better things to do with your free time. (Handy cross-
references direct you to somewhere else in the book for more details on a
particular subject.) This book also makes for great reading anywhere you
may be sitting for a length of time (just not in an airplane lavatory, as I don’t
want you to annoy your fellow passengers with overstaying).
Conventions Used in This Book
To help you navigate the waters of this book, I’ve set up a few conventions:
 I use italics for emphasis and to highlight new words or terms that I define.
 I use boldface text to indicate the action part of numbered steps and to
highlight key words or phrases in bulleted lists.
 I put all Web addresses in monofont for easy identification.
What You Don’t Need to Read
I’ve written this book so you can find information easily and easily under-
stand what you find. And although I’d like to believe that you want to pore
over every last word between the two yellow and black covers, I actually
make it easy for you to identify “skippable” material. This information is the
stuff that, although interesting, isn’t essential for you to know:
 Text in sidebars: The sidebars are the shaded boxes that appear here
and there. They include helpful information and observations but aren’t
necessary reading.
 Anything with a Technical Stuff icon attached: This information is
interesting but not critical to your understanding of the topic at hand.

Introduction

Foolish Assumptions
In writing this book, I made some assumptions about you, dear reader:
 You want expert advice about important financial topics — such as 
getting out of high-interest consumer debt, planning for major goals,
or investing — and you want answers quickly.
 Or perhaps you want a crash course in personal finance and are looking
for a book you can read cover-to-cover to help solidify major financial
concepts and get you thinking about your finances in a more compre-
hensive way.
 Or maybe you’re just tired of picking up scattered piles of bills, receipts,
and junk mail every time the kids chase the cat around the den, so you
plan to use this book as a paperweight.
Seriously though, this book is basic enough to help a novice get his or her
arms around thorny financial issues. But advanced readers will be challenged,
as well, to think about their finances in a new way and identify areas for
improvement. Check out the table of contents for a chapter-by-chapter run-
down of what this book offers. You can also look up a specific topic in the
index. Or you can turn a few pages and start at the beginning: Chapter 1.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is organized into six parts, with each covering a major area of your
personal finances. The chapters within each part cover specific topics in detail.
Here’s a summary of what you can find in each part.
Part I: Assessing Your Fitness 
and Setting Goals
This part explains how to diagnose your current financial health and explores
common reasons for any missing links in your personal finance knowledge.
We all have dreams and goals, so in this part, I also encourage you to think
about your financial (and personal) aspirations and figure out how much you
should be saving if you want to retire someday or accomplish other impor-
tant goals.
4
Personal Finance For Dummies, 5th Edition 

Part II: Saving More, Spending Less
Most people don’t have gobs of extra cash. Therefore, this part shows you
how to figure out where all your dollars are going and tells you how to reduce
your spending. Chapter 5 is devoted to helping you get out from under the
burden of high-interest consumer debt (such as credit card debt). I also pro-
vide specifics for reducing your tax burden.
Part III: Building Wealth 
with Wise Investing
Earning and saving money is hard work, so you should be careful when it comes
to investing what you’ve worked so hard to save (or waited so long to inherit!).
In this part, I assist you with picking investments wisely and help you under-
stand investment risks, returns, and a whole lot more. I explain all the major,
and best, investment options. I recommend specific strategies and investments
to use both inside and outside of tax-sheltered retirement accounts. I also
discuss buying, selling, and investing in real estate, as well as other wealth-
building investments.
Part IV: Insurance: Protecting 
What You’ve Got
Insurance is an important part of your financial life. Unfortunately, for most
people, insurance is a thoroughly overwhelming and dreadfully boring topic.
But perhaps I can pique your interest in this esoteric topic by telling you that
you’re probably paying more than you should for insurance and that you
probably don’t have the right coverage for your situation. This part tells you
all you ever wanted to know (okay, fine — all you never wanted to know but
probably should know anyway) about how to buy the right insurance at the
best price.
Part V: Where to Go for More Help
As you build your financial knowledge, more questions and issues may arise.
In this part, I discuss where to go and what to avoid when you seek financial
information and advice. I also discuss hiring a financial planner as well as
investigating resources in print, on the air, and online.
5
Introduction

Part VI: The Part of Tens
The chapters in this part can help you manage major life changes and protect
yourself from the increasingly common problem of identity theft.
Glossary
The world of money is filled with jargon, so you’ll be happy to know that this
book includes a comprehensive glossary of financial terms that are often
tossed around but seldom explained.
Icons Used in This Book
The icons in this book help you find particular kinds of information that may
be of use to you:
This nerdy looking guy appears beside discussions that aren’t critical if you
just want to understand basic concepts and get answers to your financial
questions. You can safely ignore these sections, but reading them can help
deepen and enhance your personal financial knowledge. This stuff can also
come in handy if you’re ever on a game show, or if you find yourself stuck on
an elevator with a financial geek.
This target flags strategy recommendations for making the most of your
money (for example, paying off your credit card debt with your lottery 
winnings).
This icon highlights the best financial products in the areas of investments,
insurance, and so on. These products can help you implement my strategy
recommendations.
This icon points out information that you’ll definitely want to remember.
This icon marks things to avoid and points out common mistakes people
make when managing their finances.
6
Personal Finance For Dummies, 5th Edition 

This icon alerts you to scams and scoundrels who prey on the unsuspecting.
This icon tells you when you should consider doing some additional research.
Don’t worry — I explain what to look for and what to look out for.
Where to Go from Here
This book is organized so you can go wherever you want to find complete
information. Want advice on reducing your debt, for example? Head to
Chapter 5. If you’re interested in investing strategies, go to Part III for that.
You can use the table of contents to find broad categories of information or
the index to look up more specific things.
If you’re not sure where you want to go, you may want to start with Part I.
It gives you all the basic info you need to assess your financial situation and
points to places where you can find more detailed information for improving it.

Introduction

Personal Finance For Dummies, 5th Edition 

Part I
Assessing Your
Fitness and
Setting Goals

In this part . . .
I
discuss the concepts that underlie sensible personal
financial management. You find out why you didn’t
know all these concepts before now (and whom to blame).
Here, you undergo a (gentle) financial physical exam to
diagnose your current economic health, and I show you
how to identify where your hard-earned dollars are going.
I also cover understanding and improving your credit
report and scores and how to plan for and accomplish
your financial goals.

Chapter 1
Improving Your Financial Literacy
In This Chapter
 Looking at what your parents and others taught you about money
 Studying money management in schools
 Hitting the books (and other sources): Questioning reliability
 Overcoming real and imagined financial hurdles
U
nfortunately, most Americans don’t know how to manage their personal
finances because they were never taught how to do so. Their parents may
have avoided discussing money in front of the kids, and nearly all our high
schools and colleges lack even one course that teaches this vital, lifelong-
needed skill.
Some people are fortunate enough to learn the financial keys to success
at home, from knowledgeable friends, and from good books like this one.
Others either never learn the keys to success, or they learn them the hard
way — by making lots of costly mistakes. People who lack knowledge make
more mistakes, and the more financial errors you commit, the more money
passes through your hands and out of your life. In addition to the enormous
financial costs, you experience the emotional toll of not feeling in control of
your finances. Increased stress and anxiety go hand in hand with not master-
ing your money.
This chapter examines where people learn about finances and helps you
decide whether your current knowledge is helping you or holding you back.
You can find out how to improve your financial literacy and take responsibil-
ity for your finances, putting you in charge and reducing your anxiety about
money. After all, you have more important things to worry about, like what’s
for dinner.

Talking Money at Home
I was fortunate in that my parents instilled in me the importance of personal
financial management. Mom and Dad taught me a lot of things that have been
invaluable throughout my life, and among those things were sound principles
for earning, spending, and saving money. My parents had to know how to do
these things, because they were raising a family of three children on (usually)
one modest income. They knew the importance of making the most of what
you have and of passing that vital skill on to your kids.
In many families, however, money is a taboo subject — parents don’t level
with their kids about the limitations, realities, and details of their budgets.
Some parents I talk with believe that dealing with money is an adult issue and
that kids should be insulated from it so that they can enjoy being kids. In many
families, kids may hear about money only when disagreements and financial
crises bubble to the surface. Thus begins the harmful cycle of children having
negative associations with money and financial management.
In other cases, parents with the best of intentions pass on their bad money-
management habits. You may have learned from a parent, for example, to buy
things to cheer yourself up. Or you may have witnessed a family member mani-
acally chasing get-rich-quick business and investment ideas. Now I’m not saying
that you shouldn’t listen to your parents. But in the area of personal finance,
as in any other area, poor family advice and modeling can be problematic.
Think about where your parents learned about money management, and
then consider whether they had the time, energy, or inclination to research
choices before making their decisions. For example, if they didn’t do enough
research or had faulty information, your parents may mistakenly think that
banks are the best places for investing money or that buying stocks is like
going to Las Vegas. (You can find the best places for investing your money in
Part III of this book.)
In still other cases, the parents have the right approach, but the kids go to
the other extreme out of rebellion. For example, if your parents spent money
carefully and thoughtfully and at times made you feel denied, you may tend
to do the opposite, buying yourself gifts the moment any extra money comes
your way.
Although you and I can’t change what the educational system and your parents
did or didn’t teach you about personal finances, you now have the ability to
find out what you need to know to manage your finances.
If you have children of your own, I’m sure you agree that kids really are amazing.
Don’t underestimate their potential or send them out into the world without
the skills they need to be productive and happy adults. Buy them some good
financial books when they head off to college or begin their first job.
12
Part I: Assessing Your Fitness and Setting Goals 

Picking Up on Personal Finance 
in the Classroom
In schools, the main problem with personal finance education is the lack of
classes, not that kids already know the information or that the skills are too
complex for children to understand.
Nancy Donovan teaches personal finance to her fifth-grade math class as a
way to illustrate how math can be used in the real world. “Students choose a
career, find jobs, and figure out what their taxes and take-home paychecks
will be. They also have to rent apartments and figure out a monthly budget,”
says Donovan. “Students like it, and parents have commented to me how sur-
prised they are with how much financial knowledge their kids can handle.”
Donovan also has her students invest $10,000 (play money) and then track
the investments’ performance.
13
Chapter 1: Improving Your Financial Literacy
Financial illiteracy: A costly situation
The lack of proficiency in personal financial
management causes not only tremendous anx-
iety but also serious problems. Consider the fol-
lowing sobering statistics:
 Studies show that less than 20 percent of
baby boomers are saving adequately for
retirement and that one-quarter of the
adults between the ages of 35 and 54 have
not even begun to save for retirement.
 One out of every two marriages in America
ends in divorce. Studies show that financial
disagreement is one of the leading causes
of marital discord. In a survey conducted by
Worth magazine and the market research
firm of Roper/Starch, couples admitted to
fighting about money more than anything
else (more than three times more often than
they fight about their sex lives). And a stag-
gering 57 percent of those surveyed agreed
with the statement “In every marriage,
money eventually becomes the most impor-
tant concern.”
 Less than 10 percent of American adults
understand a 401(k) well enough to explain
it to someone else. Fewer than one in four
can explain what a municipal bond is.
 Only 8 percent of investors knew that there’s
not any agency or organization that “insures
you against losing money as the result of
fraud in your investment portfolio,” accord-
ing to a survey conducted by the Securities
Investor Protection Corporation and the
Investor Protection Trust.
 Nearly 80 percent of consumers do not
know how the grace period on a credit card
works. An even greater percentage doesn’t
understand that interest starts accumulat-
ing immediately for new purchases on
credit cards with outstanding debts.
 Fifty-three percent of people who took a
multiple choice investing quiz did not know
that total return was the best measure of a
mutual fund’s performance.

Urging schools to teach the basics of personal finance is just common sense.
We should be teaching our children how to manage a household budget, the
importance of saving money for future goals, and the consequences of over-
spending. Unfortunately, few schools offer classes like Donovan’s. In most
cases, the financial basics aren’t taught at all.
In the handful of schools that do offer a course remotely related to personal
finance, the class is typically in economics (and an elective at that). “Archaic
theory is being taught, and it doesn’t do anything for the students as far as
preparing them for the real world,” says one high school principal I know.
Having taken more than my fair share of economics courses in college, I
understand the principal’s concerns.
Some people argue that teaching children financial basics is the parents’ job.
However, this well-meant sentiment is what we’re relying on now, and for all
too many, it isn’t working. In some families, financial illiteracy is passed on
from generation to generation.
We must recognize that education takes place in the home, on the streets,
and in the schools. Therefore, schools must bear some responsibility for
teaching this skill. However, if you’re raising children, remember that no one
cares as much as you do or has as much ability to teach the important life
skill of personal money management.
Identifying Unreliable Sources 
of Information
Some people are smart enough to realize that they’re not financial geniuses.
So they set out to take control of their finances by reading or consulting a
financial advisor. Because the pitfalls are so numerous and the challenges so
mighty when choosing an advisor, I devote Chapter 18 to the financial plan-
ning business and tell you what you need to know to avoid being fooled.
Reading is good. Reading is fundamental. But reading to find out how to
manage your money can be dangerous if you’re a novice. Misinformation
can come from popular and seemingly reliable information sources, as I
explain in the following sections.
Recognizing fake financial gurus
Before you take financial advice from anyone, examine his or her background,
including professional work experience and education credentials. This is
true whether you’re getting advice from an advisor, writer, talk show host,
or television financial reporter.
14
Part I: Assessing Your Fitness and Setting Goals 

If you can’t easily find such information, that’s usually a red flag. People with
something to hide or a lack of something redeeming to say about themselves
usually don’t promote their background.
Of course, just because someone seems to have a relatively impressive sound-
ing background doesn’t mean that she has your best interests in mind or has
honestly presented her qualifications. Forbes magazine journalist William P.
Barrett presented a sobering review of financial author Suze Orman’s stated
credentials and qualifications:
“Besides books and other royalties, Orman’s earned income has come
mainly from selling insurance — which gets much more attention in her
book than do stocks or bonds. . . . The jacket of her video says she has
‘18 years of experience at major Wall Street institutions.’ In fact, she has 7.
The ‘nearly 1,000 new clients each year’ touted on her publisher’s Web
site are simply fans making inquiries by mail.”
When the Forbes piece came out, Orman’s publicist tried to discredit it and
made it sound as if the magazine had falsely criticized Orman. In response,
the San Francisco Chronicle, which is the nearest major newspaper to
Orman’s hometown, picked up on the Forbes piece and ran a story of their
own — written by Mark Veverka in his “Street Smarts” column — which sub-
stantiated the Forbes story.
Veverka went through the Forbes piece point by point and gave Orman’s com-
pany and the public relations firm numerous opportunities to provide infor-
mation contrary to the piece, but they did not. Here’s some of what Veverka
recounts from his contact with them:
“If you want your side told, you have to return reporters’ telephone calls.
But alas, no callback.
“. . . On Wednesday, December 6, Orman’s publicist said a written
response to the Forbes piece and the ‘Street Smarts’ column would be
sent by facsimile to the Chronicle that day. However, no fax was ever sent.
They blew me off. Twice.
“In what was becoming an extraordinary effort to be fair, I placed more tele-
phone calls over several days to Orman Financial and the publicist, asking
for either an interview with Orman or an official response. If Orman didn’t
fudge about her years on Wall Street or didn’t let her commodity-trading
adviser license lapse, surely we could straighten all of this out, right?
“Still, no answer. Nada. On December 17, I called yet again. Finally, liter-
ally on deadline, a woman who identified herself as Orman’s ‘consultant’
called me to talk ‘off the record’ about the column. What she ended up
doing was bashing the Forbes piece and my column but not for publica-
tion. More importantly, she offered no official retort to allegations made
by veteran Forbes writer William Barrett. I have to say, it was an incredi-
bly unprofessional attempt at spinning. And I’ve been spun by the worst
of them.”

Chapter 1: Improving Your Financial Literacy

Even then you can’t always accept stated credentials and qualifications at
face value, because some people lie. You can’t sniff out liars by the way they
look, their gender, or their age. You can, however, increase your chances of
being tipped off by being skeptical. You can see a number of hucksters in the
print publishing field for what they are by using common sense in reviewing
some of their outrageous claims.
One formerly best-selling personal finance book (Wealth Without Risk, by
Charles Givens) advises you to “Buy disability insurance only if you are in
poor health or accident prone.” Putting aside the minor detail that no insur-
ance company (that’s interested in making a profit) is going to issue you a
disability policy after you fall into poor health, how do you know when you’re
going to be accident-prone? Because health problems and auto accidents
cause many disabilities, you can’t see disabilities coming unless your horo-
scope happens to warn you!
Some sources of advice, such as Wade Cook’s investment seminars, lure you
in by promising outrageous returns. The stock market has generated average
annual returns of about 10 percent over the long term. However, Cook, a former
taxi driver, promoted his seminars as an “alive, hands-on, do the deals, two-
day intense course in making huge returns in the stock market. If you aren’t
getting 20% per month, or 300% annualized returns on your investments, you
need to be there.” (I guess I do, as does every investment manager and indi-
vidual investor I know!)
Cook’s get-rich-quick seminars, which cost more than $6,000, were so suc-
cessful at attracting people that his company went public in the late 1990s
and generated annual revenues of more than $100 million.
Cook’s “techniques” included trading in and out of stocks and options on
stocks after short holding periods of weeks, days, or even hours. His trading
strategies can best be described as techniques that are based upon technical
analysis — that is, charting a stock’s price movements and volume history,
and then making predictions based on those charts.
The perils of following an approach that advocates short-term trading with
the allure of high profits are numerous:
 You’re going to rack up enormous brokerage commissions.
 On occasions where your short-term trades produce a profit, you pay
high ordinary income tax rates rather than the far lower capital gains
rate for investments held more than 12 months.
 You’re not going to make big profits — quite the reverse. If you stick
with this approach, you’ll underperform the market averages.
 You’re going to make yourself a nervous wreck. This type of trading is
gambling, not investing. Get sucked up in it, and you’ll lose more than
money — you may also lose the love and respect of your family and
friends.
16
Part I: Assessing Your Fitness and Setting Goals 

If Cook’s followers were indeed earning the 300 percent annual returns his
seminars claim to help you achieve, any investor starting with just $10,000
would vault to the top of the list of the world’s wealthiest people (ahead of
Bill Gates and Warren Buffett) in just 11 years!
Understanding how undeserving 
investment gurus get popular
You may be wondering how Givens and Cook became so popular despite the
obvious flaws in their advice. Givens made the most of his talent for working
the media and his great self-promotion through seminars. One of the problems
with the mass media is that hucksters can get good publicity because many
members of the media are themselves financially illiterate, and they love a
good story. So charming hucksters get all sorts of free coverage, getting
quoted in the press and invited to appear on a number of national television
and radio programs.
Thousands of people went to seminars conducted by Givens, partly because of
the credibility Givens built through media appearances. As has now been well
documented by some of those same members of the media, many unsuspect-
ing investors were sold commission-laden products, including risky limited
partnerships, through his organization.
Consider the case of Helen Giszczak, a 69-year-old retired secretary. She
invested nearly two-thirds of her modest life savings in limited partnerships,
which she said were described to her by Givens’s associates as “probably the
most conservative investments we know of.” But some of her limited partner-
ships ended up in bankruptcy, while the others lost much of their value.
Helen Giszczak appeared on the Donahue show with John Allen, an invest-
ment broker turned securities lawyer who helped her sue Givens’s organiza-
tion to get her money back. After a lengthy dialogue with Giszczak and Allen,
Phil Donahue asked Helen how a smart person like her could get sucked in
like that. She replied, “He was on your show and Oprah’s. You gave him credi-
bility. You gave him free advertising.”
Wade Cook, on the other hand, promoted his seminars through infomercials
and other advertising, including radio ads on respected news stations. The high
stock market returns of the 1990s brought greed back into fashion. (My expe-
rience has been that you see more of this greed near market tops than you do
near market bottoms.)
The attorneys general of numerous states sued Cook’s company and sought
millions of dollars in consumer refunds. The suits alleged that the company
lied about its investment track record (not a big surprise — this company
claimed that you’d make 300 percent per year in stocks!).
17
Chapter 1: Improving Your Financial Literacy

Cook’s company settled the blizzard of state and Federal Trade Commission
(FTC) lawsuits against his firm by agreeing to accurately disclose its trading
record in future promotions and give refunds to customers who were misled
by past inflated return claims.
According to a news report by Bloomberg News, Cook’s firm disclosed that it
lost a whopping 89 percent of its own money trading during the last reporting
year. As Deb Bortner, director of the Washington State Securities Division
and president of the North American Securities Administrators Association
observed, “Either Wade is unable to follow his own system, which he claims
is simple to follow, or the system doesn’t work.”
Don’t assume that someone with something to sell, who is getting good press
and running lots of ads, will take care of you. That “guru” may just be good at
press relations and self-promotion. Certainly, talk shows and the media at
large can and do provide useful information on a variety of topics, but bad
eggs sometimes turn up. These bad eggs may not always smell bad upfront.
In fact, they may hoodwink people for years before finally being exposed.
Please review Part V for the details on resources you can trust and those
that could cause you to go bust!
Pandering to advertisers
Thousands of publications and media outlets — newspapers, magazines, Web
sites, radio, television, and so on — dole out personal financial advice and
perspectives. Although many of these “service providers” collect revenue
from subscribers, virtually all are dependent — in some cases, fully dependent
(especially on the Internet, radio, and television) — on advertising dollars.
Although advertising is a necessary part of capitalism, advertisers can taint
and, in some cases, dictate the content of what you read, listen to, and view.
Consider this case from a nonfinancial publication — Modern Bride magazine.
Harper’s magazine got ahold of an apologetic letter (which it humorously 
entitled “To Love, Honor And Obey Our Advertisers”) that Bride’s fashion
advertising director sent to the magazine’s advertisers. Here’s an excerpt of
that letter:
“Bride’s recommends that its readers (your customers) negotiate price,
borrow a slip or petticoat, and compare catalog shoe prices, and tells its
readers that the groom’s tuxedo may be free. It is difficult to understand
why Bride’s was compelled to publish this information. With 57 years of
publishing experience and support to the bridal industry, Bride’s could
and should have been more sensitive to the retailers that it purports to
serve. All of us in the bridal business must concentrate on projecting full-
service bridal retailing in a positive light.”
18
Part I: Assessing Your Fitness and Setting Goals 

I don’t find it difficult to understand why the writer of the criticized Bride’s
article suggested cost-saving strategies to its readers — she was trying to
give them useful information and advice! Now, revealing letters like this one
are hard to come by, so how can you, a consumer of financial information,
separate the good publications from the advertiser-biased publications?
After writing and working for a number of publications, and observing the
workings of even more, I’ve developed some ideas on the subject.
Be sure to consider how dependent a publication or media outlet is on adver-
tising. I find that “free” publications, radio, and television are the ones that
most often create conflicts of interest by pandering to advertisers. (All three
derive all their revenue from advertising.)
Much of what’s on the Internet is advertiser-driven, as well. Many of the invest-
ing sites on the Internet offer advice about individual stocks. Interestingly,
such sites derive much of their revenue from online brokerage firms seeking
to recruit customers who are foolish enough to believe that selecting their
own stocks is the best way to invest. (See Part III for more information about
your investment options.)
As you read various publications, watch TV, or listen to the radio, note how
consumer-oriented these media are. Do you get the feeling that they’re looking
out for your interests? For example, if lots of auto manufacturers advertise,
does the media outlet ever tell you how to save money when shopping for a
car or the importance of buying a car within your means? Or are they primar-
ily creating an advertiser-friendly broadcast or publication?
Jumping over Real and Imaginary
Hurdles to Financial Success
Perhaps you know that you should live within your means, buy and hold
sound investments for the long term, and secure proper insurance coverage;
however, you can’t bring yourself to do these things. We all know how diffi-
cult it is to break habits that you’ve practiced for many years. The temptation
to spend money lurks everywhere you turn. Ads show attractive and popular
people enjoying the fruits of their labors — a new car, an exotic vacation, and
a lavish home.
Maybe you felt deprived by your tightwad parents as a youngster, or maybe
you’re bored with life and you like the adventure of buying new things. If only
you could hit it big on one or two investments, you think, you could get rich
quick and do what you really want with your life. As for disasters and cata-
strophes, well, those things happen to other people, not to you. Besides,
you’ll probably have advance warning of pending problems, so you can pre-
pare accordingly, right?
19
Chapter 1: Improving Your Financial Literacy

Your emotions and temptations can get the better of you. Certainly, part of
successfully managing your finances involves coming to terms with your
shortcomings and the consequences of your behaviors. If you don’t, you may
end up enslaved to a dead-end job so you can keep feeding your spending
addiction. Or you may spend more time with your investments than you do
with your family and friends. Or unexpected events can leave you reeling
financially; disasters and catastrophes can happen to anyone at any time.
Discovering what (or who) 
is holding you back
A variety of personal and emotional hurdles can get in the way of making the
best financial moves. As I discuss earlier in this chapter, a lack of financial
knowledge (which stems from a lack of personal financial education) can
stand in the way of making good decisions.
But I’ve seen some people caught in the psychological trap of blaming some-
thing else for their financial problems. For example, some people believe that
all our adult problems can be traced back to childhood and how we were
raised. Behaviors ranging from substance abuse and credit card addiction
to sexual infidelity are supposedly caused by our roots.
I don’t want to disregard the negative impact particular backgrounds can
have on some people’s tendency to make the wrong choices during their
lives. Exploring your personal history can certainly yield clues to what makes
you tick. That said, we are adults making choices and engaging in behaviors
that affect ourselves as well as others. We shouldn’t blame our parents for
our own inability to plan for our financial futures, live within our means, and
make sound investments.
Some people also tend to blame their financial shortcomings on not earning
more income. Such people believe that if only they earned more, their finan-
cial (and personal) problems would melt away.
My experience working and speaking with people from diverse economic
backgrounds has taught me that achieving financial success — and more
importantly, personal happiness — has virtually nothing to do with how
much income a person makes but rather with what she makes of what she
does have. I know financially wealthy people who are emotionally poor even
though they have all the material goods they want. Likewise, I know people
who are quite happy, content, and emotionally wealthy even though they’re
struggling financially.
20
Part I: Assessing Your Fitness and Setting Goals 

Americans — even those who have not had an “easy” life — should be able to
come up with numerous things to be happy about and grateful for: a family
who loves them; friends who laugh at their stupid jokes; the freedom to catch
a movie or play or to read a good book; a great singing voice, sense of humor,
or a full head of hair.
Developing good financial habits
After you understand the basic concepts and know where to buy the best
financial products when you need them, you’ll soon see that managing 
personal finances well is not much more difficult than other things you do
regularly, like tying your shoelaces and getting to work each day.
Regardless of your income, you can make your dollars stretch further if you
practice good financial habits and avoid mistakes. In fact, the lower your
income, the more important it is that you make the most of your income and
savings (because you don’t have the luxury of falling back on your next fat
paycheck to bail you out).
More and more industries are subject to global competition, so you need to
be on your financial toes now more than ever. Job security is waning; layoffs
and retraining for new jobs are increasing. Putting in 30 years for one com-
pany and retiring with the gold watch and lifetime pension are becoming as
rare as never having problems with your computer.
Speaking of company pensions, odds are increasing that you work for an
employer that has you save toward your own retirement instead of providing
a pension for you. Not only do you need to save the money, you must also
decide how to invest it. Chapter 11 can help you get a handle on investing in
retirement accounts.
Personal finance involves much more than managing and investing money.
It also includes making all the pieces of your financial life fit together; it
means lifting yourself out of financial illiteracy. Like planning a vacation, 
managing your personal finances means forming a plan for making the best
use of your limited time and dollars.
Intelligent personal financial strategies have little to do with your gender, 
ethnicity, or marital status. We all need to manage our finances wisely.
Some aspects of financial management become more or less important at 
different points in your life, but for the most part, the principles remain the
same for everyone.
21
Chapter 1: Improving Your Financial Literacy

Knowing the right answers isn’t enough. You have to practice good financial
habits just as you practice other good habits, such as brushing your teeth.
Don’t be overwhelmed. As you read this book, make a short list of your
financial marching orders and then start working away. Throughout this
book, I highlight ways you can overcome temptations and keep control of
your money rather than let your emotions and money rule you. (I discuss
common financial problems in Chapter 2.)
What you do with your money is a quite personal and confidential matter.
In this book, I try to provide guidance that can keep you in sound financial
health. You don’t have to take it all — pick what works best for you and
understand the pros and cons of your options. But from this day forward,
please don’t make the easily avoidable mistakes or overlook the sound strate-
gies that I discuss throughout this book.
If you’re young, congratulations for being so forward-thinking as to realize the
immense value of investing in your personal financial education. You’ll reap
the rewards for decades to come. But even if you’re not so young, you surely
have many years to make the most of the money you currently have, the
money you’re going to earn, and even the money you may inherit!
Throughout your journey, I hope to challenge and even change the way you
think about money and about making important personal financial decisions —
and sometimes even about the meaning of life. No, I’m not a philosopher, but
I do know that money — for better but more often for worse — is connected
to many other parts of our lives.

H
ow financially healthy are you? You may already know some or even all
the bad news. Or perhaps things aren’t quite as bad as they seem.
When was the last time you sat down surrounded by all your personal and
financial documents and took stock of your overall financial situation, includ-
ing reviewing your spending, savings, future goals, and insurance? If you’re
like most people, you’ve either never done this exercise or you did so a long
time ago.
This chapter guides you through a financial physical to help you detect prob-
lems with your current financial health. But don’t dwell on your “problems.”
View them for what they are — opportunities for improving your financial sit-
uation. In fact, the more areas for improvement you can identify, the greater
the potential you may have to build real wealth and accomplish your finan-
cial and personal goals.
Avoiding Common Money Mistakes
Financial problems, like many medical problems, are best detected early
(clean living doesn’t hurt, either). Here are some common personal financial
problems I’ve seen in my work as a financial counselor:
 Not planning: Human beings were born to procrastinate. That’s why we
have deadlines (like April 15) — and deadline extensions (need another
six months to get that tax return done?). Unfortunately, you may have no

explicit deadlines with your overall finances. You can allow your credit
card debt to accumulate, or you can leave your savings sitting in lousy
investments for years. You can pay higher taxes, leave gaps in your
retirement and insurance coverage, and overpay for financial products.
Of course, planning your finances isn’t as much fun as planning a vaca-
tion, but doing the former can help you take more of the latter. See
Chapter 4 for info on setting financial goals.
 Overspending: Simple arithmetic helps you determine that savings is the
difference between what you earn and what you spend (assuming that
you’re not spending more than you’re earning!). To increase your savings,
you either have to work more (yuck!), increase your earning power
through education or job advancement, get to know a wealthy family who
wants to leave its fortune to you, or spend less. For most of us, especially
over the short-term, the thrifty approach is the key to building savings
and wealth. Check out Chapter 3 for a primer on figuring out where your
money goes; Chapter 6 gives advice for reducing your spending.
 Buying with consumer credit: Even with the benefit of today’s lower
interest rates, carrying a balance month-to-month on your credit card or
buying a car on credit means that even more of your future earnings are
going to be earmarked for debt repayment. Buying on credit encourages
you to spend more than you can really afford. Chapter 5 discusses debt
and credit problems.
 Delaying saving for retirement: Most people say that they want to
retire by their mid-60s or sooner. But in order to accomplish this goal,
most people need to save a reasonable chunk (around 10 percent) of
their incomes starting sooner rather than later. The longer you wait to
start saving for retirement, the harder reaching your goal will be. And
you’ll pay much more in taxes to boot if you don’t take advantage of the
tax benefits of investing through particular retirement accounts. For
information on planning for retirement, see Chapters 4 and 11.
 Falling prey to financial sales pitches: Great deals that can’t wait for a
little reflection or a second opinion are often disasters waiting to
happen. A sucker may be born every minute, but a slick salesperson is
pitching something every second! Steer clear of people who pressure
you to make decisions, promise you high investment returns, and lack
the proper training and experience to help you. For basic investment
concepts and what kinds of investments to avoid, turn to Chapter 8.
 Not doing your homework: To get the best deal, shop around, read
reviews, and get advice from objective third parties. You also need to
check references and track records so that you don’t hire incompetent,
self-serving, or fraudulent financial advisors. (For more on hiring finan-
cial planners, see Chapter 18.) But with all the different financial prod-
ucts available, making informed financial decisions has become an
overwhelming task. I do a lot of the homework for you with the recom-
mendations in this book. I also explain what additional research you
need to do and how to do it.
24
Part I: Assessing Your Fitness and Setting Goals 

 Making decisions based on emotion: You’re most vulnerable to making
the wrong moves financially after a major life change (a job loss or
divorce, for example) or when you feel pressure. Maybe your invest-
ments plunged in value. Or perhaps a recent divorce has you fearing that
you won’t be able to afford to retire when you planned, so you pour
thousands of dollars into some newfangled financial product. Take your
time and keep your emotions out of the picture. In Chapter 21, I discuss
how to approach major life changes with an eye on determining what
changes you may need to make to your financial picture.
 Not separating the wheat from the chaff: In any field in which you’re
not an expert, you run the danger of following the advice of someone
who you think is an expert but really isn’t. This book shows you how to
separate the financial fluff from the financial facts. (Flip to Chapter 20 for
info on how to evaluate financial advice in the mass media.) You are the
person who is best able to manage your personal finances. Educate and
trust yourself!
 Exposing yourself to catastrophic risk: You’re vulnerable if you and your
family don’t have insurance to pay for financially devastating losses.
People without a savings reserve and support network can end up home-
less. Many people lack sufficient insurance coverage to replace their
income. Don’t wait for a tragedy to strike to find out whether you have
the right insurance coverage. Check out Part IV for more on insurance.
 Focusing too much on money: Placing too much emphasis on making
and saving money can warp your perspective on what’s important in life.
Money is not the first or even second priority in happy people’s lives.
Your health, relationships with family and friends, career satisfaction,
and fulfilling interests should be more important.
Most problems can be fixed over time with changes in your behavior. (That’s
what the rest of the book is all about.)
Determining Your Financial Net Worth
Your financial net worth is an important barometer of your monetary health.
Your net worth indicates your capacity to accomplish major financial goals,
such as buying a home, retiring, and withstanding unexpected expenses or
loss of income.
Your financial net worth has absolutely, positively no relationship to your
worth as a human being. This is not a test. You don’t have to compare your
number with your neighbor’s. Financial net worth is not the scorecard of life.
25
Chapter 2: Measuring Your Financial Health

Your net worth is your financial assets minus your financial liabilities:
Financial Assets – Financial Liabilities = Net Worth
The following sections tell you how to determine those numbers.
Adding up your financial assets
A financial asset is real money or an investment you can convert to hard dol-
lars that you can use to buy things now or in the future.
Financial assets generally include the money you have in bank accounts,
stocks, bonds, and mutual fund accounts (see Part III, which deals with
investments). Money that you have in retirement accounts (including those
with your employer) and the value of any businesses or real estate that you
own are also included.
I generally recommend that you exclude your personal residence when figur-
ing your financial assets. Include your home only if you expect to someday
sell it or otherwise live off the money you now have tied up in it (perhaps by
taking out a reverse mortgage, which I discuss in Chapter 14). If you plan on
someday tapping into the equity (the difference between the market value
and any debt owed on the property), add that portion of the equity that you
expect to use to your list of assets.
Assets can also include your future expected Social Security benefits and
pension payments (if your employer has such a plan). These assets are usu-
ally quoted in dollars per month rather than in a lump sum value. I explain in
a moment how to account for these monthly benefits when tallying your
financial assets.
Consumer items — such as your car, clothing, stereo, and wine collection —
do not count as financial assets. I know that adding these things to your
assets makes your assets look larger (and some financial software packages
and publications encourage you to list these items as assets), but you can’t
live off them unless you sell them.
Subtracting your financial liabilities
To arrive at your financial net worth, you must subtract your financial liabili-
ties from your assets. Liabilities include loans and debts outstanding, such as
credit card and auto loan debts. When figuring your liabilities, include money
you borrowed from family and friends — unless you’re not gonna pay it back!
Include mortgage debt on your home as a liability only if you include the
26
Part I: Assessing Your Fitness and Setting Goals 

value of your home in your asset list. Be sure to also include debt owed on
other real estate — no matter what (because you counted the value of invest-
ment real estate as an asset).
Crunching your numbers
Table 2-1 provides a place for you to figure your financial assets. Go ahead
and write in the spaces provided, unless you plan to lend this book to some-
one and you don’t want to put your money situation on display. Note: See
Table 4-1 in Chapter 4 to estimate your Social Security benefits.

* To convert benefits that will be paid to you monthly into a total dollar amount, and for purposes of
simplification, assume that you will spend 20 years in retirement. (Ah, think of two decades of lolly-
gagging around — vacationing, harassing the kids, spoiling the grandkids, starting another career,
or maybe just living off the fat of the land.) As a shortcut, multiply the benefits that you’ll collect
monthly in retirement by 240 (12 months per year times 20 years). Inflation may reduce the value of
your employer’s pension if it doesn’t contain a cost-of-living increase each year in the same way
that Social Security does. Don’t sweat this now — you can take care of it in the section on retire-
ment planning in Chapter 4.

Interpreting your net worth results
Your net worth is important and useful only to you and your unique situation
and goals. What seems like a lot of money to a person with a simple lifestyle
may seem like a pittance to a person with high expectations and a desire for
an opulent lifestyle.
In Chapter 4, you can crunch some more numbers to determine your financial
status more precisely for goals such as retirement planning. I also discuss
saving toward other important goals in that chapter. In the meantime, if your
net worth (excluding expected monthly retirement benefits such as those
28
Part I: Assessing Your Fitness and Setting Goals 

from Social Security and pensions) is negative or less than half your annual
income, take notice. You have lots of company — in fact, you’re with the
majority of Americans. If you’re in your 20s and you’re just starting to work, 
a low net worth is less concerning.
Getting rid of your debts — the highest-interest ones first — is the most
important thing. Then you need to build a safety reserve equal to three to six
months of living expenses. You should definitely find out more about getting
out of debt, reducing your spending, and developing tax-wise ways to save
and invest your future earnings.
Examining Your Credit Score and Reports
You may not know it (or care), but you probably have a personal credit
report and a credit score. Lenders examine your credit report and score
before granting you a loan or credit line.
Understanding what your credit 
data includes and means
A credit report contains information such as
 Personal identifying information: Includes name, address, Social
Security number, and so on
 Record of credit accounts: Details when each account was opened,
latest balance, payment history, and so on
 Bankruptcy filings: If you’ve filed bankruptcy in recent years
 Inquiries: Lists who has pulled your credit report because you’ve
applied for credit
Your credit score, which is not the same as your credit report, is a three-digit
score based on the report. Lenders use your credit score as a predictor of
your likelihood of defaulting on repaying your borrowings. As such, your
credit score has a major impact on whether a lender is willing to extend you a
particular loan and at what interest rate.
FICO is the leading credit score in the industry and was developed by Fair
Isaac and Company. FICO scores range from a low of 300 to a high of 850. As
with college entrance examinations such as the SAT, higher scores are better.
The higher your credit score, the lower your predicted likelihood of default-
ing on a loan (see Figure 2-1). The “rate of credit delinquency” refers to the
percentage of consumers who will become 90 days late or later in repaying a
29
Chapter 2: Measuring Your Financial Health

creditor within the next two years. As you can see in the chart, consumers
with low credit scores have dramatically higher rates of falling behind in their
loans. Thus, low credit scorers are considered much riskier borrowers, and
fewer lenders will be willing to offer you a given loan; those who do will
charge you relatively high rates.

The median FICO score is around 710. According to Liz Weston, author of
Your Credit Score: How to Fix, Improve, and Protect the 3-digit Number that
Shapes Your Financial Future (Prentice Hall), you will generally qualify for the
best lending rates if your credit score is 620 or higher. Credit scores below
620 are not considered good, and lenders consider these loans risky. With
some types of loans (such as home equity loans), to qualify for the best rates,
you may need a credit score of at least 760 or 780.
Obtaining your credit reports and score
Given the importance of your personal credit report, you may be pleased to
know that you’re entitled to receive a free copy of your credit report annually
from each of the three credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion).
If you visit www.annualcreditreport.com, you can view and print copies
of your credit report information from each of the three credit agencies
(alternatively, call 877-322-8228 and have your reports mailed to you). After
entering some personal data at the Web site, check the box indicating that
you want to obtain all three credit reports, as each report may have slightly
different information. You’ll then be directed to one of the three bureaus, and
after you finish verifying that you are who you claim to be at that site, you
can easily navigate back to annualcreditreport.com so you can continue
to the next agency’s site.

Part I: Assessing Your Fitness and Setting Goals 

When you receive your reports, the best first step is to examine them for pos-
sible mistakes (more in a moment regarding fixing problems in your reports).
I recently did that myself and found minor errors on two of the three reports.
It took me two minutes to correct one of the errors (by submitting a request
to that credit reporting agency’s Web site), and it took about half an hour to
get the other mistake fixed (a small doctor’s bill was erroneously listed as
unpaid and in collections).
You may be surprised to find that your credit reports do not include your
credit score. The reason for this is quite simple: The 2003 law mandating that
the three credit agencies provide a free credit report annually to each U.S. cit-
izen who requests a copy did not mandate that they provide the credit score.
Thus, if you wish to obtain your credit score, it’s going to cost you.
You can request your credit score from Fair Isaac, but you’ll get whacked $15
for every request (that can set you back $45 to see your FICO score for each
credit bureau). Save your money. If you’re going to purchase your credit
score, you can do so for less from the individual credit bureaus — Equifax,
for example, charges just $7.
If you do spring for your current credit score, be clear about what you’re
buying. You may not realize that you’re agreeing to some sort of an ongoing
credit monitoring service for say $50 to $100 per year.
Improving your credit reports and score
Instead of simply throwing money into buying your credit scores or paying
for some ongoing monitoring service that you may not pay attention to
anyway, take an interest in improving your credit standing and score.
Working to boost your credit rating is especially worthwhile if you know that
your credit report contains detrimental information.
Here are the most important actions that you can take to boost your attrac-
tiveness to lenders:
 Get all three of your credit reports, and be sure each is accurate.
Correct errors (as I explain in the next section) and be especially sure to
get accounts removed if they aren’t yours and they show late payments
or are in collection.
 If your report includes late or missed payments more than seven
years old, ask to have those removed. Ditto for a bankruptcy more than
ten years ago.
 Pay all your bills on time. To ensure on-time payments, sign up for
automatic bill payment, which most companies (like phone and utility
providers) enable you to use.
31
Chapter 2: Measuring Your Financial Health

 Be loyal if it doesn’t cost you. The older the age of loan accounts you
have open, the better for your credit rating. Closing old accounts and
opening a bunch of new ones generally lowers your credit score.
But don’t be loyal if it costs you! For example, if you can refinance your
mortgage and save some good money, by all means do so. The same logic
applies if you’re carrying credit card debt at a high interest rate and want
to transfer that balance to a lower rate card. If your current credit card
provider refuses to match a lower rate you find elsewhere, move your
balance and save yourself some money (see Chapter 5 for details).
 Limit your debt and debt accounts. The more loans, especially con-
sumer loans, that you hold and the higher the balances, the lower your
credit score will be.
 Work to pay down consumer revolving debt (such as on credit cards).
Please read Chapters 5 and 6 for suggestions.
Getting credit report errors corrected
If you obtain your credit report and find a boo-boo on it that you don’t recog-
nize as being your mistake or fault, do not assume that the information is cor-
rect. Credit reporting bureaus and the creditors who report credit
information to these bureaus often make mistakes.
You hope and expect that, if a credit bureau has negative and incorrect infor-
mation in your credit report and you bring the error to their attention, they
will graciously and expeditiously fix the mistake. If you believe that, you’re
the world’s greatest optimist; perhaps you also think you won’t have to wait
in line at the Department of Motor Vehicles, post office, or your local bank at
noon on payday.
Odds are, you’re going to have to fill out a form on a Web site, make some
phone calls, or write a letter or two to fix the problems on your credit report.
Here’s how to correct most errors that aren’t your fault:
 If the credit problem is someone else’s: A surprising number of per-
sonal credit report glitches are the result of someone else’s negative
information getting on your credit report. If the bad information on your
report is completely foreign-looking to you, tell the credit bureau and
explain that you need more information because you don’t recognize the
creditor.
 If the creditor made a mistake: Creditors make mistakes, too. You need
to write or call the creditor to get them to correct the erroneous infor-
mation that they sent to the credit bureau. Phoning first usually works
best. (The credit bureau should be able to tell you how to reach the
creditor if you don’t know how.) If necessary, follow up with a letter.
32
Part I: Assessing Your Fitness and Setting Goals 

Whether you speak with a credit bureau or an actual lender, make notes of
your conversations. If representatives say that they can fix the problem, get
their names and extensions, and follow up with them if they don’t deliver as
promised. If you’re ensnared in bureaucratic red tape, escalate the situation by
speaking with a department manager. By law, bureaus are required to respond
to a request to fix a credit error within 30 days — hold the bureau accountable!
Telling your side of the story
With a minor credit infraction, some lenders may simply ask for an explana-
tion. Years ago, I had a credit report blemish that was the result of being
away for several weeks and missing the payment due date for a couple small
bills. When my proposed mortgage lender saw my late payments, the lender
asked for a simple written explanation.
You and a creditor may not see eye to eye on a problem, and the creditor may
refuse to budge. If that’s the case, credit bureaus are required by law to allow
you to add a 100-word explanation to your credit file.
Sidestepping “credit repair” firms
Online and in newspapers and magazines, you may see ads for credit repair
companies that claim to fix your credit report problems. In the worst cases
I’ve seen, these firms charge outrageous amounts of money and don’t come
close to fulfilling their marketing hype.
If you have legitimate glitches on your credit report, credit repair firms can’t
make the glitches disappear. Hope springs eternal, however — some people
would like to believe that their credit problems can be fixed. 
Remember — if your problems are fixable, you can fix them yourself, and you
don’t need to pay a company big bucks to do it.
Knowing the Difference between 
Bad Debt and Good Debt
Why do you borrow money? Usually, you borrow money because you don’t
have enough to buy something you want or need — like a college education. If
you want to buy a four-year college education, you can easily spend $100,000,
$150,000, or more. Not too many people have that kind of spare cash. So bor-
rowing money to finance part of that cost enables you to buy the education.
How about a new car? A trip to your friendly local car dealer shows you that
a new set of wheels will set you back $20,000+. Although more people may
have the money to pay for that than, say, the college education, what if you
don’t? Should you finance the car the way you finance the education?
33
Chapter 2: Measuring Your Financial Health

The auto dealers and bankers who are eager to make you an auto loan say
that you deserve and can afford to drive a nice, new car, and they tell you to
borrow away (or lease, which I don’t love either — please see Chapter 6). I
just say, “No! No! No!” Why do I disagree with the auto dealers and lenders?
For starters, I’m not trying to sell you a car or loan from which I derive a
profit! More importantly, there’s a big difference between borrowing for some-
thing that represents a long-term investment and borrowing for short-term
consumption.
If you spend, say, $1,500 on a vacation, the money is gone. Poof! You may
have fond memories and even some Kodak moments, but you have no finan-
cial value to show for it. “But,” you say, “vacations replenish my soul and
make me more productive when I return. In fact, the vacation more than pays
for itself!”
Great. I’m not saying that you shouldn’t take a vacation. By all means, take
one, two, three, or as many as you can afford yearly. But that’s the point:
Take what you can afford. If you have to borrow money in the form of an out-
standing balance on your credit card for many months in order to take the
vacation, you can’t afford it.
Consuming your way to bad debt
I use the term bad debt to refer to debt incurred for consumption, because
such debt is harmful to your long-term financial health.
You’ll be able to take many more vacations during your lifetime if you save
the cash in advance. If you get into the habit of borrowing and paying all that
interest for vacations, cars, clothing, and other consumer items, you’ll spend
more of your future income paying back the debt and interest, leaving you
with less money for your other goals.
The relatively high interest rates that banks and other lenders charge for bad
(consumer) debt is one of the reasons you’re less able to save money when
using such debt. Not only does money borrowed through credit cards, auto
loans, and other types of consumer loans carry a relatively high interest rate,
but it also isn’t tax-deductible.
I’m not saying that you should never borrow money and that all debt is bad.
Good debt, such as that used to buy real estate and small businesses, is gen-
erally available at lower interest rates than bad debt and is usually tax-
deductible. If well managed, these investments may also increase in value.
Borrowing to pay for educational expenses can also make sense. Education is
generally a good long-term investment, because it can increase your earning
potential. And student loan interest is tax deductible subject to certain limita-
tions (see Chapter 7).
34
Part I: Assessing Your Fitness and Setting Goals 

Recognizing bad debt overload
Calculating how much debt you have relative to your annual income is a
useful way to size up your debt load. Ignore, for now, good debt — the loans
you may owe on real estate, a business, an education, and so on (I get to that
in the next section). I’m focusing on bad debt, the higher-interest debt used
to buy items that depreciate in value.
To calculate your bad debt danger ratio, divide your bad debt by your annual
income. For example, suppose that you earn $40,000 per year. Between your
credit cards and an auto loan, you have $20,000 of debt. In this case, your bad
debt represents 50 percent of your annual income.
bad debt
annual income
=
bad debt danger ratio
The financially healthy amount of bad debt is zero. Not everyone agrees with
me. One major U.S. credit card company says — in its “educational” materi-
als, which it gives to schools to teach students about supposedly sound
financial management — that carrying consumer debt amounting to 10 to 20
percent of your annual income is just fine.
When your bad debt danger ratio starts to push beyond 25 percent, it can
spell real trouble. Such high levels of high-interest consumer debt on credit
cards and auto loans grow like cancer. The growth of the debt can snowball
and get out of control unless something significant intervenes. If you have

Chapter 2: Measuring Your Financial Health
The lure of easy credit
Many years ago, I worked as a management
consultant and did a lot of work with companies
in the financial services’ industry, including some
of the major credit card companies. Their game
then, as it is now, was to push cards into the
hands of as many people as possible who have a
tendency and propensity to carry debt month to
month at high interest rates. Their direct market-
ing campaigns are quite effective. Ditto for the
auto manufacturers who successfully entice
many people who can’t really afford to spend
$20,000, $30,000, or more on a brand new car to
buy new autos financed with an auto loan or
lease. And just as alcohol and cigarette makers
target young people with their advertising, credit
card companies are recruiting and grooming the
next generation of overspenders on college
campuses. Unbelievably, our highest institutions
of learning receive large fees from credit card
companies for being allowed to promote their
cards on campuses!
As credit is widely available today, so too are
suggestions for how to spend it. We’re bom-
barded with ads 24/7 on radio, television, Web
sites, the sides of buses and trains and the tops
of taxicabs, people’s clothing, and cars. If you
wanted to go a day without advertising, you
couldn’t — you’re surrounded!

consumer debt beyond 25 percent of your annual income, see Chapter 5 to
find out how to get out of debt.
How much good debt is acceptable? The answer varies. The key question is:
Are you able to save sufficiently to accomplish your goals? In the “Analyzing
Your Savings” section, later in this chapter, I help you figure out how much
you’re actually saving, and in Chapter 4, I help you determine what you
should save to accomplish your goals. (See Chapter 14 to find out how much
mortgage debt is appropriate to take on when buying a home.)
Borrow money only for investments (good debt) — for purchasing things that
retain and hopefully increase in value over the long term, such as an educa-
tion, real estate, or your own business. Don’t borrow money for consumption
(bad debt) — for spending on things that decrease in value and eventually
become financially worthless, such as cars, clothing, vacations, and so on.
Assessing good debt: Can 
you get too much?
As with good food, of course, you can get too much of a good thing! When
you incur debt for investment purposes — to buy real estate, for small busi-
ness, even your education — you hope to see a positive return on your
invested dollars.
But some real estate investments don’t work out. Some small businesses
crash and burn and some educational degrees and programs don’t help in 
the way that some hope that they could.
There’s no magic formula for determining when you have too much “good
debt.” In extreme cases, I’ve seen entrepreneurs, for example, borrow up to
their eyeballs to get a business off the ground. Sometimes this works and
they end up financially rewarded, but in most cases, it doesn’t.
Here are two important questions to ponder and discuss with your loved
ones about the seemingly “good debt” you’re taking on:
 Are you and your loved ones able to sleep well at night and function well
during the day, free from great worry about how you’re going to meet
next month’s expenses?
 Are you and your loved ones financially able to save what you’d like to
work toward your goals (see Chapter 4)?
If you find your debt is too high, you may be able to use some of the debt-
reduction strategies in Chapter 5.

Playing the credit card float
Given what I have to say about the vagaries of consumer debt, you may think
that I’m always against using credit cards. Actually, I have credit cards, and I
use them — but I pay my balance in full each month. Besides the convenience
credit cards offer me — in not having to carry around extra cash and checks —
I receive another benefit: I have free use of the bank’s money extended to me
through my credit card charges. (Some cards offer other benefits, such as fre-
quent flyer miles. Also, purchases made on credit cards may be contested if the
seller of the product or service doesn’t stand behind what it sells.)
When you charge on a credit card that does not have an outstanding balance
carried over from the prior month, you typically have several weeks (known
as the grace period) from the date of the charge to the time when you must
pay your bill. This is called playing the float. Had you paid for this purchase
by cash or check, you would have had to shell out the money sooner.
If you have difficulty saving money, and plastic tends to burn holes through
your budget, forget the float game. You’re better off not using credit cards.
The same applies to those who pay their bills in full but spend more because
it’s so easy to do so with a piece of plastic. (For info on alternatives to using
credit cards, see Chapter 5.)
Analyzing Your Savings
How much money have you actually saved in the past year? By savings, I
mean the amount of new money you added to your nest egg, stash, or what-
ever you like to call it.
Most people don’t know or have only a vague idea of the rate at which
they’re saving money. The answer may sober, terrify, or pleasantly surprise
you. In order to calculate your savings over the past year, you need to calcu-
late your net worth as of today and as of one year ago.
The amount you actually saved over the past year is equal to the change in
your net worth over the past year — in other words, your net worth today
minus your net worth from one year ago. I know it may be a pain to find state-
ments showing what your investments were worth a year ago, but bear with
me; it’s a useful exercise.
If you own your home, ignore this in the calculations. (You can consider the
extra payments you make to pay off your mortgage principal faster as new
savings.) And don’t include personal property and consumer goods, such as
your car, computer, clothing, and so on, with your assets.
37
Chapter 2: Measuring Your Financial Health

When you have your net worth figures from both years, plug them into Step 1
of Table 2-4. If you’re anticipating the exercise and are already subtracting
your net worth of a year ago from what it is today in order to determine your
rate of savings, your instincts are correct, but the exercise isn’t quite that
simple. You need to do a few more calculations in Step 2 of Table 2-4. Why?
Well, counting the appreciation of the investments you’ve owned over the
past year as savings wouldn’t be fair. Suppose that you bought 100 shares of
a stock a year ago at $17 per share, and now the value is at $34 per share.
Your investment increased in value by $1,700 during the past year. Although
you’d be the envy of your friends at the next party if you casually mentioned
your investments, the $1,700 of increased value is not really savings. Instead,
it represents appreciation on your investments, so you must remove this
appreciation from the calculations. (Just so you know, I’m not unfairly penal-
izing you for your shrewd investments — you also get to add back the decline
in value of your less-successful investments.)

If all this calculating gives you a headache, you get stuck, or you just hate
crunching numbers, try the intuitive, seat-of-the-pants approach: Save a regu-
lar portion of your monthly income. You can save it in a separate savings or
retirement account.
How much do you save in a typical month? Get out the statements for
accounts you contribute to or save money in monthly. It doesn’t matter if
you’re saving money in a retirement account that you can’t access — 
money is money.
38
Part I: Assessing Your Fitness and Setting Goals 

Note: If you save, say, $200 per month for a few months, and then you spend
it all on auto repairs, you’re not really saving. If you contributed $3,000 to an
individual retirement account (IRA), for example, but you depleted money
that you had from long ago (in other words, it wasn’t saved during the past
year), you should not count the $3,000 IRA contribution as new savings.
You should be saving at least 5 to 10 percent of your annual income for
longer-term financial goals such as retirement (Chapter 4 helps you to fine-
tune your savings goals). If you’re not, be sure to read Chapter 6 to find out
how to reduce your spending and increase your savings.
Evaluating Your Investment Knowledge
Congratulations! If you stuck with me from the beginning of this chapter, you
completed the hardest part of your financial physical. The physical is a whole
lot easier from here on out!
Regardless of how much or how little money you have invested in banks,
mutual funds, or other types of accounts, you want to invest your money in
the wisest way possible. Knowing the rights and wrongs of investing is vital
to your long-term financial well-being. Few people have so much extra money
that they can afford major or frequent investing mistakes.
Answering “yes” or “no” to the following questions can help you determine
how much time you need to spend with my Investing Crash Course in Part III,
which focuses on investing. Note: The more “no” answers you reluctantly
scribble, the more you need to find out about investing, and the faster you
should turn to Part III.
_____ Do you understand the investments you currently hold?
_____ Is the money that you’d need to tap in the event of a short-term emer-
gency in an investment where the principal does not fluctuate in value?
_____ Do you know what marginal income-tax bracket (combined federal and
state) you’re in, and do you factor that in when choosing investments?
_____ For money outside of retirement accounts, do you understand how
these investments produce income and gains and whether these types
of investments make the most sense from the standpoint of your tax
situation?
_____ Do you have your money in different, diversified investments that
aren’t dependent on one or a few securities or one type of investment
(that is, bonds, stocks, real estate, and so on)?
39
Chapter 2: Measuring Your Financial Health

_____ Is the money that you’re going to need for a major expenditure in the
next few years invested in conservative investments rather than in
riskier investments such as stocks or pork bellies?
_____ Is the money that you have earmarked for longer-term purposes 
(more than five years) invested to produce returns that are well 
ahead of inflation?
_____ If you currently invest in or plan to invest in individual stocks, do you
understand how to evaluate a stock, including reviewing the company’s
balance sheet, income statement, competitive position, price-earnings
ratio versus its peer group, and so on?
_____ If you work with a financial advisor, do you understand what that
person is recommending that you do, are you comfortable with those
actions and that advisor, and is that person compensated in a way that
minimizes potential conflicts of interest in the strategies and invest-
ments he or she recommends?
Making and saving money is not a guarantee of financial success but rather a
prerequisite. If you don’t know how to choose sound investments that meet
your needs, you’ll likely end up throwing money away, which leads to the
same end result as never having earned and saved it in the first place. Worse
still, you won’t be able to derive any enjoyment from spending the lost
money on things that you perhaps need or want. Turn to Part III to discover
the best ways to invest; otherwise, you may wind up spinning your wheels
working and saving.
Assessing Your Insurance Savvy
In this section, you have to deal with the prickly subject of protecting your
assets and yourself with insurance. (The following questions help you get
started.) If you’re like most people, reviewing your insurance policies and
coverages is about as much fun as a root canal. Open wide!
_____ Do you understand the individual coverages, protection types, and
amounts of each insurance policy you have?
_____ Does your current insurance protection make sense given your current
financial situation (as opposed to your situation when you bought the
policies)?
40
Part I: Assessing Your Fitness and Setting Goals 

_____ If you wouldn’t be able to make it financially without your income, do
you have adequate long-term disability insurance coverage?
_____ If you have family members who are dependent on your continued
income, do you have adequate life insurance coverage to replace your
income should you die?
_____ Do you buy insurance through discount brokers, fee-for-service advi-
sors, and companies that sell directly to the public (bypassing agents)?
_____ Do you carry enough liability insurance on your home, car (including
umbrella/excess liability), and business to protect all your assets?
_____ Have you recently (in the last year or two) shopped around for the best
price on your insurance policies?
_____ Do you know whether your insurance companies have good track
records when it comes to paying claims and keeping customers 
satisfied?
That wasn’t so bad, was it? If you answered “no” more than once or twice,
don’t feel bad — nine out of ten people make significant mistakes when
buying insurance. Find your insurance salvation in Part IV. If you answered
“yes” to all the preceding questions, you can spare yourself from reading 
Part IV, but bear in mind that many people need as much help in this area 
as they do in other aspects of personal finance.

Determining Where 
Your Money Goes
In This Chapter
 Understanding why people overspend
 Assessing your spending
A
s a financial counselor, I’ve worked with people who bring in tiny
incomes, people who have incomes of hundreds of thousands of dollars
or more, and everyone in between. At every income level, people fall into one
of the following three categories:
 People who spend more than they earn (accumulating debt)
 People who spend all that they earn (saving nothing)
 People who save 2, 5, 10, or even 20 percent (or more!)
I’ve seen $40,000 earners who save 20 percent of their income ($8,000),
$80,000 earners who save just 5 percent ($4,000), and people earning well
into six figures annually who save nothing or accumulate debt.
Suppose that you currently earn $50,000 per year and spend all of it. You may
wonder, “How can I save money?” Good question!
Rather than knock yourself out at a second job or hustle for that next promo-
tion, you may want to try living below your income — in other words, spend-
ing less than you earn. (I know spending less than you earn is hard to
imagine, but you can do it.) Consider that for every discontented person
earning and spending $50,000 per year, someone else is out there making do
on $45,000.
A great many people live on less than you make. If you spend as they do, you
can save and invest the difference. In this chapter, I examine why people over-
spend and help you look at your own spending habits. When you know where
your money goes, you can find ways to spend less and save more (see Chapter
6) so that someday, you, too, can live richly and achieve your life’s goals.

Examining the Roots of Overspending
If you’re like most people, you must live within your means in order to
accomplish your financial goals. This requires spending less than you earn
and then investing your “savings” intelligently (unless you plan on winning
the lottery or gaining a large inheritance). To put yourself in a position that
allows you to start saving, take a close look at your spending habits.
Many folks earn just enough to make ends meet. And some can’t even do
that; they simply spend more than they make. The result of such spending
habits is, of course, an accumulation of debt: Witness the U.S. government
and its over seven trillion dollars’ worth of debt accumulation!
Most of the influences in society encourage you to spend; credit is so widely
and easily available. Think about it: More often than not, you’re referred to as
a consumer in the media and in the hallowed halls of our government. You’re
not referred to as a person, a citizen, or a human being.
Here are some of the adversaries you’re up against as you attempt to control
your spending.
Access to credit
As you probably already know, spending money is easy. Thanks to innova-
tions like ATMs and credit cards, your money is always available, 24/7. Every
little outlet in the mall pitches its own credit card, and so do the gas stations
across the street and the convenience stores down the road. It certainly
won’t surprise me when little kids down our street start taking credit cards 
at their lemonade stand. I can hear it now: “We take Visa, Mr. Tyson, but we
don’t take American Express.”
Sometimes it may seem as though lenders are trying to give away money by
making credit so easily available. But this free money is a dangerous illusion.
When it comes to consumer debt (credit cards, auto loans, and the like),
lenders aren’t giving away anything except the opportunity for you to get 
in over your head, rack up high interest charges, and delay your progress
toward your financial and personal goals.
Credit is most dangerous when you make consumption purchases you can’t
afford in the first place.
Misusing credit cards
The modern day bank credit card was invented by Bank of America near the
end of the baby boom. The credit industry has been booming along with the
boomers ever since.
44
Part I: Assessing Your Fitness and Setting Goals 

If you pay your bill in full every month, credit cards offer a convenient way to
buy things with an interest-free, short-term loan. But if you carry your debt
over from month to month at high interest rates, credit cards encourage you
to live beyond your means. Credit cards make it easy and tempting to spend
money that you don’t have.
You’ll never pay off your credit card debt if you keep charging on your card
and make only the minimum monthly payments. Interest continues to pile up
on your outstanding debt. Paying only the minimum monthly payment could
lead to your carrying high-interest debt on your card for decades (not just
months or years)!
If you have a knack for charging up a storm and spending more than you
should with those little pieces of plastic, only one solution exists: Get rid of
your credit cards. Put scissors to the plastic. Go cold turkey. You can func-
tion without them. (See Chapter 5 for details on how to live without credit
cards.)
Taking out car loans
Walking onto a car lot and going home with a new car that you could never
afford if you had to pay cash is easy. The dealer gets you thinking in terms 
of monthly payments that sound small when compared to what that four-
wheeler is really gonna cost you. Auto loans are easy for just about anyone 
to get (except maybe a recently paroled felon).
Suppose you’re tired of driving around in your old clunker. The car is battle-
scarred and boring, and you don’t like to be seen in it. Plus, the car is likely to
need more repairs in the months ahead. So off you go to your friendly local
car dealer.
You start looking around at all the shiny, new cars, and then — like the feeling
you experience when spotting a water fountain on a scorching hot day —
there it is: the replacement for your old clunker. This new car is sleek and
clean, and it has A/C, stereo, and power everything.
Before you can read the fine print on the sticker page on the side window, 
the salesperson moseys on up next to you. He gets you talking about how
nice the car is, the weather, or anything but the sticker price of that car.
“How,” you begin to think to yourself, “can this guy afford to spend time with
me without knowing if I can afford this thing?” After a test drive and more talk
about the car, the weather, and your love life (or lack thereof) comes your
moment of truth.
45
Chapter 3: Determining Where Your Money Goes

The salesperson, it seems, doesn’t care about how much money you have.
Whether you have lots of money or very little doesn’t matter. The car is only
$399 a month!
“That price isn’t bad,” you think. Heck, you were expecting to hear that the car
costs at least 25 grand. Before you know it, the dealer runs a credit report on
you and has you sign a few papers, and minutes later you’re driving home —
the proud owner of a new car.
The dealer wants you to think in terms of monthly payments because the
cost sounds so cheap: $399 for a car. But, of course, that’s $399 per month,
every month, for many, many months. You’re gonna be payin’ forever — after
all, you just bought a car that cost a huge chunk (perhaps 100 percent or
more) of your yearly take-home income!
But it gets worse. What does the total sticker price come to when interest
charges are added in? (Even if interest charges are low, you may still be
buying a car with a sticker price you can’t afford.) And what about insurance,
registration, and maintenance over the seven or so years that you’ll own the
car? Now you’re probably up to more than a year’s worth of your income.
Ouch! (See Chapter 6 for information on how to spend what you can afford 
on a car.)
Bending to outside influences and agendas
You go out with some friends to dinner, a ballgame, or a show. Try to remem-
ber the last time one of you said, “Let’s go someplace (or do something)
cheaper. I can’t afford to spend this much.” On the one hand, you don’t want
to be a stick in the mud. But on the other hand, some of your friends have
more money than you do — and the ones who don’t may be running up debt
fast.
Some people just have to see the latest hit movie, wear the latest designer
clothes, or get the newest handheld personal digital assistant. They don’t
want to feel left out or behind the times.
When was the last time you heard someone say that he decided to forego a
purchase because he was saving for retirement or a home purchase? It doesn’t
happen often, does it? Just dealing with the here-and-now and forgetting your
long-term needs and goals is tempting. This mindset leads people to toil away
for too many years in jobs they dislike.
Living for today has its virtues: Tomorrow may not come. But odds are good
that it will. Will you still feel the same way about today’s spending decisions
tomorrow? Or will you feel guilty that you again failed to stick to your goals?
46
Part I: Assessing Your Fitness and Setting Goals 

Your spending habits should be driven by your desires and plans, not those
of others. If you haven’t set any goals yet, you may not know how much you
should be saving. Chapter 4 helps you kick-start the planning and saving
process.
Spending to feel good
Life is full of stress, obligations, and demands. “I work hard,” you say, “and
darn it, I deserve to indulge!” Especially after your boss took the credit for
your last great idea or blamed you for his last major screwup. So you buy
something expensive or go to a fancy restaurant. Feel better? You won’t when
the bill arrives. And the more you spend, the less you save, and the longer
you’ll be stuck working for jerks like your boss!
Just as people can become addicted to alcohol, tobacco, television, and the
Internet, some people also become addicted to the high they get from spend-
ing. Researchers can identify a number of psychological causes for spending
addiction, with some relating to how your parents handled money and spend-
ing. (And you thought you’d identified all the problems you can blame on
Mom and Dad!)
If your spending and debt problems are chronic, or even if you’d simply like
to be a better consumer and saver, see Chapter 5 for more information.
Analyzing Your Spending
Brushing your teeth, eating a diverse diet including plenty of fruits and veg-
etables, and exercising regularly are good habits. Spending less than you earn
and saving enough to meet your future financial objectives are the financial
equivalents of these habits.
Despite relatively high incomes compared with the rest of the world, most
Americans have a hard time saving a good percentage of their incomes. Why?
Because we spend too much — often far more than necessary.
The first step to saving more of the income that you work so hard for is to
figure out where that income typically gets spent. The spending analysis in
the next section helps you determine where your income is going. You should
do the spending analysis if any of the following apply to you:
 You aren’t saving enough money to meet your financial goals. (If you’re
not sure whether this is the case, please see Chapter 4.)
 You feel as though your spending is out of control, or you don’t really
know where all your income goes.
47
Chapter 3: Determining Where Your Money Goes

 You’re anticipating a significant life change (for example, marriage, leav-
ing your job to start a business, having children, retiring, and so on).
If you’re already a good saver, you may not need to complete the spending
analysis. If you’re saving enough to accomplish your goals, I don’t see much
value in continually tracking your spending. You’ve already established the
good habit — saving. Tracking exactly where you spend your money month
after month is not the good habit. As long as you’re saving enough, I say, who
cares where the leftover money is being spent?! (You may still benefit from
perusing my smarter spending recommendations in Chapter 6.)
The immediate goal of a spending analysis is to figure out where you typically
spend your money. The long-range goal is to establish a good habit:
Maintaining a regular, automatic savings routine.
Notice the first four letters in the word analysis. (You may never have
noticed, but I feel the need to bring it to your attention.) Knowing where your
money is going each month is useful, and making changes in your spending
behavior and cutting out the fat so you can save more money and meet your
financial goals is terrific. However, you may make yourself and those around
you miserable if you’re anal-retentive about documenting precisely where
you spend every single dollar and cent.
Saving what you need to achieve your goals is what matters most.
Tracking spending the low-tech way
Doing a spending analysis is a little bit like being a detective. Your goal is to
reconstruct the crime of spending. You probably have some major clues at
your fingertips or piled somewhere on the desk or table where you pay bills.
Unless you keep meticulous records that detail every dollar you spend, you
won’t have perfect information. Don’t sweat it! A number of available sources
should allow you to reconstruct where you’ve been spending the bulk of your
money. To get started, get out your
 Recent pay stubs
 Tax returns
 Checkbook register or canceled checks (and monthly debit card 
transactions)
 Credit and charge card bills
Ideally, you want to assemble the documents needed to track one year’s (12
months’) spending. But if your spending patterns don’t fluctuate greatly from
month to month (or if your dog ate some of the old bills), you can reduce
your data gathering to one six-month period, or to every second or third
48
Part I: Assessing Your Fitness and Setting Goals 

month for the past year. If you take a major vacation or spend a large amount
on gifts during certain months of the year, make sure that you include these
months in your analysis.
Purchases made with cash are the hardest to track because they don’t leave
a paper trail. Over the course of a week or perhaps even a month, you could
keep a record of everything you buy with cash. Tracking cash can be an
enlightening exercise, but it can also be a hassle. If you’re lazy like I some-
times am or you lack the time and patience, try estimating. Think about a typ-
ical week or month — how often do you buy things with cash? For example, if
you eat lunch out four days a week, paying around $6 a shot, that’s about
$100 a month. You may also want to try adding up all the cash withdrawals
from your checking account statement and then working backwards to try to
remember where you spent the cash.
Separate your expenditures into as many useful and detailed categories as
possible. Table 3-1 gives you a suggested format; you can tailor it to fit your
needs. Remember, if you lump too much of your spending into broad, mean-
ingless categories like Other, you’ll end up right back where you started —
wondering where all the money went. (Note: When completing the tax sec-
tion in Table 3-1, report the total tax you paid for the year as tabulated on
your annual income tax return — and take the total Social Security and
Medicare taxes paid from your end-of-year pay stub — rather than the tax
withheld or paid during the year.)
Tracking your spending on the computer
Software programs can assist you with paying bills and tracking your spend-
ing. The main advantage of using software is that you can continually track
your spending as long as you keep entering the information. These software
packages can even help speed up the check-writing process (after you figure
out how to use them, which isn’t always an easy thing to do).
But you don’t need a computer and fancy software to pay your bills and
figure out where you’re spending money. Many people I know stop entering
data after a few months. If tracking your spending is what you’re after, you
need to enter information from the bills you pay by check and the expenses
you pay by credit card and cash. Like home exercise equipment and exotic
kitchen appliances, such software often ends up in the consumer graveyard.
Paper, pencil, and a calculator work just fine for tracking your spending.
If you want to try computerizing your bill payments and expense tracking, I
recommend the best software packages in Chapter 19.

Chapter 3: Determining Where Your Money Goes
Don’t waste time on financial administration
Tom is the model of financial organization. His
financial documents are neatly organized into
color-coded folders. Every month, he enters all
his spending information into his computer. He
even carries a notebook to detail his cash
spending so that every penny is accounted for.
Tom also balances his checkbook “to make sure
that everything is in order.” He can’t remember
the last time his bank made a mistake, but he
knows someone who once found a $50 error.
If you spend seven hours per month balancing
your checkbook and detailing all your spending
(as Tom does), you may be wasting nearly two
weeks’ worth of time per year — the equivalent
of two-thirds of your vacation time if you take
three weeks annually.
Suppose that, every other year, you’re “lucky”
enough to find a $100 error the bank made in its
favor. If you spend just three hours per month
tracking your spending and balancing your
checkbook to discover this glitch, you’ll be
spending 72 hours over two years to find a $100
mistake. Your hourly pay: a wafer-thin $1.39 per
hour. You can make more flipping burgers at a
burger joint. (Note: If you make significant-sized
deposits or withdrawals, make sure that you
capture them on your statement.)
To add insult to injury, you may not have the
desire and energy to do the more important stuff
after working a full week and doing all your finan-
cial and other chores. Your big personal financial
picture — establishing goals, choosing wise
investments, securing proper insurance cover-
age — may continue to be shoved to the back
burner. As a result, you may lose thousands of
dollars annually. Over the course of your adult
life, this amount could translate into tens or even
hundreds of thousands of lost dollars.
Tom, for example, didn’t know how much he
should be saving to meet his retirement goals. He
didn’t review his employer’s benefit materials, so
he didn’t understand his insurance and retire-
ment plan options. He knew that he paid a lot in
taxes, but he wasn’t sure how to reduce his taxes.
You want to make the most of your money.
Unless you truly enjoy dealing with money, you
need to prioritize the money activities you work
on. Time is limited and life is short. Working
harder on financial administration doesn’t earn
you bonus points. The more time you spend
dealing with your personal finances, the less
time you have available to gab with friends,
watch a good movie, read a good novel, and do
other things you really enjoy.
Don’t get me wrong — nothing is inherently
wrong with balancing your checkbook. In fact, if
you regularly bounce checks because you don’t
know how low your balance is, the exercise
may save you a lot in returned check fees.
However, if you keep enough money in your
checking account so that you don’t have to
worry about the balance reaching $0 or if you
have overdraft protection, balancing your
checkbook is probably a waste of time, even if
your hourly wages aren’t lofty. I haven’t bal-
anced mine in years (but please don’t tell my
bank — it might start making some “mistakes”
and siphoning money out).
If you’re busy, consider ways to reduce the
amount of time you spend on mundane financial
tasks like bill paying. Many companies, for
example, allow you to pay your monthly bills
electronically via your bank checking account
or your credit card. (Don’t use this option unless
you pay your credit card bill in full each month.)
The fewer bills you have to pay, the fewer sep-
arate checks and envelopes you must process
each month. That translates into more free time
and fewer paper cuts!

I
n my work as a financial counselor, I always asked new clients what their
short- and long-term personal and financial goals were. Most people
reported that reflecting on this question was incredibly valuable, because
they hadn’t considered it for a long time — if ever.
In this chapter, I help you dream about what you want to get out of life.
Although my expertise is in personal finance, I wouldn’t be doing my job if I
didn’t get you to consider your nonfinancial goals and how money fits into the
rest of your life goals. So before I jump into how to establish and save toward
common financial goals, I want to take a moment to discuss how you think
about making and saving money, as well as how to best fit your financial
goals into the rest of your life.
Creating Your Own Definition 
of “Wealth”
Pick up just about any major financial magazine or newspaper, or scan stories
on the Internet, and you’ll quickly see our culture’s obsession with financial
wealth. The more money financial executives, movie stars, or professional
athletes have, the more publicity and attention they seem to get. In fact,
many publications go as far as ranking those people who earn the most or
have amassed the greatest wealth!

I’m frankly perplexed at why many of the most affluent and highest-income
earners maintain workaholic schedules despite being married and having kids.
From what I observe, our society seems to define “wealth” as fat paychecks;
huge investment account balances; the ability to hire full-time employees to
raise children; being too busy with a career to maintain friendships or take an
interest in neighbors, community, or important social problems; and the free-
dom to be unfaithful and dump your spouse when you’re no longer pleased
with him or her.
Of course, you don’t need to buy into any of these concepts. The following
sections can help you gain some perspective.
Acknowledging what money can’t buy
Recall the handful of best moments in your life. Odds are, these times don’t
include the time you bought a car or found a designer sweater that you liked.
The old saying is true: The most enjoyable and precious things of value in
your life can’t be bought.
The following statement should go without saying, but I must say it, because
too many people act as if it isn’t so: Money can’t buy happiness. It’s tempting
to think that if you could only make 20 percent more or twice as much money,
you’d be happier because you’d have more money to travel, eat out, and buy
that new car you’ve been eyeing, right? Not so. A great deal of thoughtful
research suggests that little relationship exists between money and happiness.
“Wealth is like health: Although its absence can breed misery, having it is no
guarantee of happiness,” says psychology professor Dr. David G. Myers in his
book The Pursuit of Happiness: Discovering the Pathway to Fulfillment, Well-Being,
and Enduring Personal Joy (Harper).
Despite cheap air travel, VCRs, compact discs, microwaves, computers, voice
mail, and all the other stuff that’s supposed to make our lives easier and
more enjoyable, Americans aren’t any happier than they were four decades
ago. According to research conducted by the National Opinion Research
Center, the number of Americans who say they’re “very happy” has dropped
over the past two generations. These unexpected results occur even though
incomes, after being adjusted for inflation, have more than doubled during
that time.
As Dr. Myers observes in The Pursuit of Happiness, “. . . if anything, to judge
by soaring rates of depression, the quintupling of the violent crime rate since
1960, the doubling of the divorce rate, and the tripling of the teen suicide
rate, we’re richer and less happy.”
56
Part I: Assessing Your Fitness and Setting Goals 

Managing the balancing act
Believe it or not, some people save too much. In my counseling practice, I saw
plenty of people who fell into that category. If making and saving money is a
good thing, then the more the better, right?
Well, take the admittedly extreme case of Anne Scheiber, who, on a modest
income, started saving at a young age, allowing her money to compound in
wealth-building investments such as stocks over many years. As a result, she
was able to amass $20 million before she passed away at the age of 101.
57
Chapter 4: Establishing and Achieving Goals
What’s your relationship to money?
Over the years in my work as a financial coun-
selor, I’ve come to find that how a person
relates to and feels about money has a great
impact on how good he is at managing his
money and making important financial deci-
sions. For example, knowing that you have a net
worth of negative $13,200 because of credit
card debt is useful, but it’s probably not enough
information for you to do something construc-
tive about your problem. A logical next step
would be to examine your current spending and
take steps to reduce your debt load.
Although I cover practical solutions to common
financial quandaries later in this book, I also dis-
cuss the more touchy-feely side of money. For
example, some people who continually rack up
consumer debt have a spending addiction. Other
people who jump in and out of investments and
follow them like a hawk have psychological
obstacles that prevent them from holding onto
investments.
And then you have those somewhat philosoph-
ical and psychological issues relating to money
and the meaning of life. Saving more money and
increasing your net worth isn’t always the best
approach. In my work, I’ve come across numer-
ous people who attach too much significance to
personal wealth accumulation and neglect
important human relationships in their pursuit of
more money. Some retirees have a hard time
loosening the purse springs and actually spend-
ing some of the money they worked so hard to
save for their golden years.
Balancing your financial goals with other impor-
tant life goals is key to your happiness. What’s
the point, for example, of staying in a well-
paying, admired profession if you don’t care for
the work and you’re mainly doing it for the finan-
cial rewards? Life is too short and precious for
you to squander away your days.
So as you read through the various chapters
and sections of this book, please consider your
higher life goals and purposes. What are your
nonfinancial priorities (family, friends, causes),
and how can you best accomplish your goals
with the financial resources you do have? If you
really want to examine your priorities and your
relationship to money, I have a new book, Mind
over Money: Your Path to Wealth and Happiness
(CDS Books), which delves into how we feel
about money, why we have the financial habits
that we do, and how you can overcome those
obstacles holding you back.

Scheiber lived in a cramped studio apartment and never used her investments.
She didn’t even use the interest or dividends — she lived solely on her Social
Security benefits and the small pension from her employer. Scheiber was
extreme in her frugality and obsessed with her savings. As reported by James
Glassman in the Washington Post, “She had few friends . . . she was an unhappy
person, totally consumed by her securities accounts and her money.”
Most people, myself included, wouldn’t choose to live and save the way that
Scheiber did. She saved for the sake of saving: no goal, no plan, no reward for
herself. Saving should be a means to an end, not something that makes you
mean to the end.
Even those who are saving for an ultimate goal can become consumed
by their saving habits. I see some people pursuing higher-paying jobs and
pinching pennies in order to retire early. But sometimes they make too many
personal sacrifices today while chasing after some vision of their lives tomor-
row. Others get consumed by work and then don’t notice or understand why
their family and friends feel neglected.
Another problem with seeking to amass wealth is that tomorrow may not
come. Even if all goes according to plan, will you know how to be happy when
you’re not working if you spend your entire life making money? More impor-
tantly, who will be around to share your leisure time? One of the costs of an
intense career is time spent away from friends and family. You may realize
your goal of retiring early, but you may be putting off too much living today
in expectation of living tomorrow. As Charles D’Orleans said in 1465, “It’s very
well to be thrifty, but don’t amass a hoard of regrets.”
Of course, at the other extreme are spendthrifts who live only for today.
A friend of mine once said, “I’m not into delayed gratification. “Shop ’til you
drop” seems to be the motto of this personality type. “Why save when I might
not be here tomorrow?” reasons this type of person.
The danger of this approach is that tomorrow may come after all, and most
people don’t want to spend all their tomorrows working for a living. The ear-
lier neglect of saving, however, may make it necessary for you to work when
you’re older. And if for some reason you can’t work and you have little money
to live on, much less live enjoyably, the situation can be tragic. The only dif-
ference between a person without any savings or access to credit and some
homeless people is a few months of unemployment.
Making and saving money is like eating food. If you don’t eat enough, you
may suffer. If you eat too much, the overage may go to waste or make you
overweight. The right amount, perhaps with some extra to spare, affords you
a healthy, balanced, peaceful existence. Money should be treated with respect
and acknowledged for what it is — a means to an end and a precious resource
that shouldn’t be thoughtlessly squandered and wasted.
58
Part I: Assessing Your Fitness and Setting Goals 

As Dr. David Myers, whom I introduced earlier in this chapter, says:
“Satisfaction isn’t so much getting what you want as wanting what you have.
There are two ways to be rich: one is to have great wealth, the other is to
have few wants.” Find ways to make the most of the money that does pass
through your hands, and never lose sight of all that is far more important
than money.
Prioritizing Your Savings Goals
Most people I know have financial goals. The rest of this chapter discusses
the most common financial goals and how to work toward them. See whether
any of the following reflect your ambitions:
 Becoming part of the landed gentry: Renting and dealing with landlords
can be a financial and emotional drag, so most folks want to buy into the
American dream and own some real estate — the most basic of which is
your own home.
 Retiring: No, retiring does not imply sitting on a rocking chair watching
the world go by while hoping that some long lost friend, your son’s or
daughter’s family, or the neighborhood dog comes by to visit. Retiring
is a catch-all term for discontinuing full-time work or perhaps not even
working for pay at all.
 Educating the kids: No, all those diaper changes, late-night feedings,
and trips to the zoo aren’t enough to get Junior out of your house and
into the real world as a productive, self-sufficient adult. You may want to
help your children get a college education. Unfortunately, that can cost a
truckload of dough.
 Owning your own business: Many employees want to face the chal-
lenges and rewards that come with being the boss. The primary reason
that most people continue just to dream is that they lack the money to
leave their primary job. Although many businesses don’t require gobs of
start-up cash, almost all require that you withstand a substantial reduc-
tion in your income during the early years.
Because each of us is different, we can have goals (other than those in the
previous list) that are unique to our own situation. Accomplishing such
goals almost always requires saving money. As one of my favorite Chinese
proverbs says, “Do not wait until you are thirsty to dig a well.” In other
words, don’t wait to save money until you’re ready to accomplish a personal
or financial goal!
59
Chapter 4: Establishing and Achieving Goals

Knowing what’s most important to you
Unless you earn really big bucks or have a large family inheritance to fall
back on, your personal and financial desires will probably outstrip your
resources. Thus, you must prioritize your goals.
One of the biggest mistakes I see people make is rushing into financial deci-
sions without considering what’s really important to them. Because many of
us get caught up in the responsibilities of our daily lives, we often don’t have
time for reflection.
As a result of my experience counseling and teaching people about better
personal financial management, I can tell you that the folks who accomplish
their goals aren’t necessarily smarter or higher-income earners than those
who don’t. People who identify their goals and then work toward them, which
often requires changing some habits, are the ones who accomplish their
goals.
Valuing retirement accounts
Where possible, you should try to save and invest in accounts that offer
you a tax advantage. This is precisely what retirement accounts offer you.
These accounts — known by such enlightening acronyms and names as
401(k), 403(b), SEP-IRAs, Keoghs, and so on — offer tax breaks to people of
all economic means. Consider the following advantages to investing in retire-
ment accounts:
 Contributions are usually tax-deductible. By putting money in a retire-
ment account, not only do you plan wisely for your future, but you also
get an immediate financial reward: lower taxes — and lower taxes mean
more money available for saving and investing. Retirement account con-
tributions are generally not taxed at either the federal or state income
tax level until withdrawal (but they’re still subject to Social Security
and Medicare taxes when earned). If you’re paying, say, 35 percent
between federal and state taxes (refer to Chapter 7 to determine your
tax bracket), a $5,000 contribution to a retirement account lowers your
taxes by $1,750.
 Returns on your investment compound over time without taxation.
After you put money into a retirement account, any interest, dividends,
and appreciation add to your account without being taxed. Of course,
there’s no such thing as a free lunch — these accounts don’t allow for
60
Part I: Assessing Your Fitness and Setting Goals 

complete tax avoidance. Yet you can get a really great lunch at a discount:
You get to defer taxes on all the accumulating gains and profits until you
withdraw the money down the road. Thus, more money is working for
you over a longer period of time. (The newer Roth IRA that I discuss in
Chapter 11 offers no upfront tax breaks but does allow future tax-free
withdrawal of investment earnings.)
In the early 2000s, the tax rates on stock dividends and for long-term
capital gains (on investments held more than one year) were lowered.
This created some concern that investing through retirement accounts
may no longer be worthwhile because all investment earnings are taxed
at the relatively high ordinary income tax rates when money is with-
drawn from retirement accounts. By contrast, if you invest outside of
retirement accounts, you pay a lower rate of tax on stock dividends and
on the sale of an investment held for more than one year. I’ll cut to the
chase: The vast, vast majority of people are still much better off con-
tributing to retirement accounts (for more info, please see Chapter 7).
 In some company retirement accounts, companies match a portion of
your own contributions. Thus, in addition to tax breaks, you get free
extra money courtesy of your employer!
Dealing with competing goals
Unless you enjoy paying higher taxes, why would you save money outside of
retirement accounts, which shelter your money from taxation? The reason is
that some financial goals are not easily achieved by saving in retirement
accounts. Also, retirement accounts have caps on the amount you can con-
tribute annually.
If you’re accumulating money for a down payment on a home or to start or
buy a business, for example, you’ll probably need to save that money outside
of a retirement account. Why? Because if you withdraw funds from retirement
accounts before age 591⁄2 and you’re not retired, not only do you have to pay
income taxes on the withdrawals, but you also generally have to pay early
withdrawal penalties — 10 percent of the withdrawn amount in federal tax
and whatever your state charges. (See the sidebar, “Avoiding retirement
account early withdrawal penalties,” for exceptions to this rule.)
Because you’re constrained by your financial resources, you need to prioritize
your goals. Before funding your retirement accounts and racking up those tax
breaks, read on to consider your other goals.
61
Chapter 4: Establishing and Achieving Goals

Building Emergency Reserves
Because you don’t know what the future holds, preparing for the unexpected
is financially wise. Even if you’re the lucky sort who sometimes finds $5 bills
on street corners, you can’t control the sometimes chaotic world in which
we live.
Conventional wisdom says that you should have approximately six months of
living expenses put away for an emergency. This particular amount may or
may not be right for you, because it depends, of course, on how expensive
the emergency is. Why six months, anyway? And where should you put it?
Unfortunately, no hard and fast rules exist. How much of an emergency stash
you need depends on your situation.
62
Part I: Assessing Your Fitness and Setting Goals 
Avoiding retirement account early 
withdrawal penalties
You can find ways to avoid the early withdrawal
penalties that the tax gods normally apply.
Suppose that you read this book at a young age,
develop sound financial habits early, and save
enough to retire before age 591⁄2. In this case,
you can take money out of your retirement
account without triggering penalties (which are
normally 10 percent of the amount withdrawn
for federal income tax plus whatever your state
levies). The IRS allows you to withdraw money
before 591⁄2 if you do so in equal, annual install-
ments based on your life expectancy. The IRS
(this is slightly chilling) even has a little table
that allows you to look up your life expectancy.
You can now also make penalty-free withdrawals
from individual retirement accounts for either a
first-time home purchase (limit of $10,000) or
higher educational expenses for you, your
spouse, your children, or your grandchildren.
The other conditions under which you can make
penalty-free early withdrawals from retirement
accounts are not as enjoyable: If you have major
medical expenses (exceeding 7.5 percent of
your income) or a disability, you may be exempt
from the penalties under certain conditions.
If you get into a financial pinch while you’re still
employed, be aware that some company retire-
ment plans allow you to borrow against your
balance. This tactic is like loaning money to
yourself — the interest payments go back into
your account.
If you lose your job and withdraw retirement
account money simply because you need it to
live on, the penalties do apply. However, if
you’re not working and you’re earning so little
income that you need to raid your retirement
account, you surely fall into a low tax bracket.
The lower income taxes you pay (when com-
pared to the taxes you would have paid on that
money had you not sheltered it in a retirement
account in the first place) should make up for
most or all of the penalty.

I recommend saving the following emergency amounts under differing cir-
cumstances (in Chapter 12, I recommend good places to invest this money):
 Three months’ living expenses: Choose this option if you have other
accounts, such as a 401(k), or family members and close friends whom
you can tap for a short-term loan. This minimalist approach makes sense
when you’re trying to maximize investments elsewhere (for example, in
retirement accounts) or you have stable sources of income (employment
or otherwise).
 Six months’ living expenses: This amount is appropriate if you don’t
have other places to turn for a loan or you have some instability in your
employment situation or source of income.
 Up to one year’s living expenses: Set aside this much if your income
fluctuates wildly from year to year or if your profession involves a high
risk of job loss; finding another job could take you a long time, and you
don’t have other places to turn for a loan.
In the event that your only current source of emergency funds is a high-interest
credit card, you should first save at least three months’ worth of living expenses
in an accessible account before funding a retirement account or saving for
other goals.
Saving to Buy a Home or Business
When you’re starting out financially, deciding whether to save money to buy
a home or to put money into a retirement account presents a dilemma. In the
long run, owning your own home is a wise financial move. On the other hand,
saving sooner for retirement makes achieving your goals easier.
Presuming both goals are important to you, you should be saving towards
both buying a home and for retirement. If you’re eager to own a home, you
can throw all your savings toward achieving that goal and temporarily put
your retirement savings on hold. Save for both purposes simultaneously if
you’re not in a rush.
You may be able to eat your cake and have it, too, if you work for an employer
that allows borrowing against retirement account balances. You can save
money in the retirement account and then borrow against it for the down
payment of a home. Be careful, though. Retirement account loans typically
must be paid back within a set number of years (check with your employer),
or immediately if you quit or lose your job. As I mention earlier in this chap-
ter, you’re also allowed to make penalty-free withdrawals of up to $10,000
from individual retirement accounts toward a first-time home purchase.
63
Chapter 4: Establishing and Achieving Goals

When saving money for starting or buying a business, most people encounter
the same dilemma they face when deciding to save to buy a house: If you fund
your retirement accounts to the exclusion of earmarking money for your small-
business dreams, your entrepreneurial aspirations may never become a reality.
Generally, I advocate hedging your bets by saving money in your tax-sheltered
retirement accounts as well as toward your business venture. As I discuss in
Part III, an investment in your own small business can produce great rewards,
so you may feel comfortable focusing your savings on your own business.
Funding Kids’ Educational Expenses
Wanting to provide for your children’s future is perfectly natural. But doing
so before you’ve saved adequately toward your own goals can be a major
financial mistake. The college financial-aid system effectively penalizes you
for saving money outside of retirement accounts and penalizes you even
more if the money’s invested in the child’s name.
This concept may sound selfish, but you need to take care of your future first.
You should first take advantage of saving through your tax-sheltered retire-
ment accounts before you set aside money in custodial savings accounts for
your kids. This practice isn’t selfish: Do you really want to have to leech off
your kids when you’re old and frail because you didn’t save any money for
yourself? (See Chapter 13 for a complete explanation of how to save for edu-
cational expenses.)
Saving for Big Purchases
If you want to buy a car, a canoe, or a plane ticket to France, do not, I repeat, do
not buy such things with consumer credit (that is, carry debt month-to-month
to finance the purchase on a credit card or auto loan). As I explain in Chapter 5,
cars, boats, vacations, and the like are consumer items, not wealth-building
investments, such as real estate or small businesses. A car begins to depreciate
the moment you drive it off the sales lot. A plane ticket to France is worthless
the moment you arrive back home. (I know your memories will be priceless,
but they won’t pay the bills.)
Paying for high-interest consumer debt can cripple your ability not only to
save for long-term goals but also to make major purchases in the future.
Interest on consumer debt is exorbitantly expensive — up to 18 percent for
most credit cards. When contemplating the purchase of a consumer item on
credit, add up the total interest you end up paying on your debt and call it
the price of instant gratification.
64
Part I: Assessing Your Fitness and Setting Goals 

Don’t deny yourself gratification; just learn how to delay it. Get into the habit
of saving for your larger consumer purchases to avoid paying for them over
time with high-interest consumer credit. When saving up for a consumer 
purchase such as a car, a money market account or short-term bond fund
(see Chapter 12) is a good place to store your short-term savings.
Preparing for Retirement
Many people toil away at work, dreaming about a future in which they can
stop the daily commute and grind; get out from under that daily deluge of
faxes, voice mails, and e-mails; and do what they want, when they want.
People often assume that this magical day will arrive either on their
next true day off or when they retire or win the lottery — whichever
comes first.
I’ve never cared much for the term retire. This word seems to imply idleness
or the end of usefulness to society. But if retirement means not having to work
at a job (especially one you don’t enjoy) and having financial flexibility and
independence, then I’m all for it.
Being able to retire sooner rather than later is part of the American dream.
But this idea has some obvious problems. First, you set yourself up for disap-
pointment. If you want to retire by your mid-60s (when Social Security kicks
in), you need to save enough money to support yourself for 20 years, maybe
longer. Two decades is a long time to live off your savings. You’re going to
need a good-sized chunk of money — more than most people realize.
The earlier you hope to retire, the more money you need to set aside, and the
sooner you have to start saving — unless you plan to work part-time in retire-
ment to earn more income! See Chapter 5 for more details about how to save
for retirement.
Many of the people I speak to say that they do want to retire, and most
say “the sooner, the better.” Yet more than half of Americans between the
ages of 18 and 34, and a quarter of those ages 35 to 54, have not begun
to save for retirement. When I asked one of my middle-aged counseling
clients, who had saved little for retirement, when he would like to retire, he
deadpanned, “Sometime before I die.” If you’re in this group (and even if
you’re not), determine where you stand financially regarding retirement.
If you’re like most working people, you need to increase your savings rate
for retirement.
65
Chapter 4: Establishing and Achieving Goals

Figuring what you need for retirement
If you hope to someday reduce the time you spend working or cease working
altogether, you’ll need sufficient savings to support yourself. Many people —
particularly young people and those who don’t work well with numbers —
underestimate the amount of money needed to retire. To figure out how much
you should save per month to achieve your retirement goals, you need to
crunch a few numbers. (Don’t worry — this number-crunching should be
easier than doing your taxes.)
Luckily for you, you don’t have to start cold. Studies show how people typi-
cally spend money before and during retirement. Most people need about
70 to 80 percent of their pre-retirement income throughout retirement to
maintain their standard of living. For example, if your household earns
66
Part I: Assessing Your Fitness and Setting Goals 
Don’t neglect nonfinancial 
preparations for retirement
Investing your money is just one (and not even
the most important) aspect of preparing for your
retirement. In order to enjoy the lifestyle that your
retirement savings will provide you, you need to
invest energy into other areas of your life as well:
 Few things are more important than your
health. Without your health, enjoying the
good things in life can be hard. Unfortunately,
many people aren’t motivated to care about
their health until after they discover prob-
lems. By then, it may be too late.
Although exercising regularly, eating a 
balanced and nutritious diet, and avoiding
substance abuse can’t guarantee you a
healthful future, these good habits go a long
way toward preventing many of the most
common causes of death and debilitating
disease. Regular medical exams also are
important in detecting problems early.
 In addition to your physical health, be sure to
invest in your psychological health. People
live longer and have happier and healthier
lives when they have a circle of family and
friends around them for support.
Unfortunately, many people become more iso-
lated and lose regular contact with business
associates, friends, and family members as they
grow older.
Happy retirees tend to stay active, getting involved
in volunteer organizations and new social circles.
They may travel to see old friends or younger
relatives who may be too busy to visit them.
Treat retirement life like a bubbly, inviting hot tub
set at 102 degrees. You want to ease yourself in
nice and slow; jumping in hastily can take most of
the pleasantness out of the experience. Abruptly
leaving your job without a plan for spending all
that free time is an invitation to boredom and
depression. Everyone needs a sense of purpose
and a sense of routine. Establishing hobbies,
volunteer work, or a sideline business while
gradually cutting back your regular work sched-
ule can be a terrific way to ease into retirement.

$50,000 per year before retirement, you’re likely to need $35,000 to $40,000
(70 to 80 percent of $50,000) per year during retirement to live the way you’re
accustomed to living. The 70 to 80 percent is an average. Some people may
need more simply because they have more time on their hands to spend their
money. Others adjust their standard of living and live on less.
You, of course, are not average in any way — you’re unique! So how do you
figure out what you’re going to need? The following three profiles provide a
rough estimate of the percentage of your pre-retirement income you’re going
to need during retirement. Pick the one that most accurately describes your
situation. If you fall between two descriptions, pick a percentage that fits in
between the two.
To maintain your standard of living in retirement, you may need about
 65 percent of your pre-retirement income if you
• Save a large amount (15 percent or more) of your annual earnings
• Are a high-income earner
• Will own your home free of debt by the time you retire
• Do not anticipate leading a lifestyle in retirement that reflects your
current high income
If you’re an especially high-income earner who lives well beneath your
means, you may be able to do just fine with even less than 65 percent.
Pick an annual dollar amount or percentage of your current income that
will allow the kind of retirement lifestyle you desire.
 75 percent of your pre-retirement income if you
• Save a reasonable amount (5 to 14 percent) of your annual earnings
• Will still have some mortgage debt or a modest rent to pay by the
time you retire
• Anticipate having a standard of living in retirement that’s compara-
ble to what you have today
 85 percent of your pre-retirement income if you
• Save little or none of your annual earnings (less than 5 percent)
• Will have a relatively significant mortgage payment or sizeable rent
to pay in retirement
• Anticipate wanting or needing to maintain your current lifestyle
throughout retirement
Of course, you can use a more precise approach to figure out how much you
need per year in retirement. Be forewarned, though, that this more personalized
method is far more time-consuming, and because you’re making projections
into an uncertain future, it may not be any more accurate than the simple
67
Chapter 4: Establishing and Achieving Goals

method I just explained. If you’re data-oriented, you may feel comfortable
tackling this method: You need to figure out where you’re spending your
money today (worksheets are available in Chapter 3) and then work up some
projections for your expected spending needs in retirement (the information
in Chapter 19 may help you, as well).
Understanding retirement building blocks
Did you play with Lego blocks or Tinkertoys when you were a child? You start
by building a foundation on the ground, and then you build up. Before you
know it, you’re creating bridges, castles, and panda bears. Although preparing
financially for retirement isn’t exactly like playing with blocks, the concept
is the same: You need a basic foundation so that your necessary retirement
reserves can grow.
If you’ve been working steadily, you may already have a good foundation,
even if you haven’t been actively saving toward retirement. In the pages
ahead, I walk you through the probable components of your future retirement
income and show you how to figure how much you should be saving to reach
particular retirement goals.
Counting on Social Security
According to polls, nearly half of American adults under the age of 35, and
more than a third of those between the ages of 35 and 49, think that Social
Security benefits will not be available by the time they retire.
Contrary to widespread cynicism, Social Security should be available when
you retire, no matter how old you are today. In fact, Social Security is one of
the sacred cow political programs. Imagine what would happen to the group
of politicians who voted not to pay any more benefits!
If you think that you can never retire because you don’t have any money
saved, I’m happy to inform you that you’re probably wrong. You likely have
some Social Security. But Social Security is generally not enough to live on
comfortably.
Social Security is intended to provide you with a subsistence level of retire-
ment income for the basic necessities: food, shelter, and clothing. Social
Security is not intended to be your sole source of income. Some elderly are
quite dependent upon Social Security: For 22 percent of the elderly, Social
Security is their only income source; for two out of three Social Security
68
Part I: Assessing Your Fitness and Setting Goals 

recipients, their Social Security retirement check accounts for at least half
of their total retirement income. Few working people could maintain their
current lifestyles into retirement without supplementing Social Security with
personal savings and company retirement plans.
How much will I get from Social Security?
Table 4-1 shows the approximate size of your expected monthly allowance from
Social Security. The first column gives your average yearly employment earnings
(in today’s dollars) on which you pay Social Security taxes. The second column
contains the approximate monthly benefit amount (in today’s dollars) that you’ll
receive when eligible for full benefits.
Note: The benefit amounts in Table 4-1 are for an individual income earner.
If you’re married and one of you doesn’t work for pay, the nonworking spouse
collects 50 percent of what the working spouse collects. Working spouses
are eligible for either individual benefits or half of their spouse’s benefits —
whichever amount is greater.

Chapter 4: Establishing and Achieving Goals

How much work makes me eligible?
To be eligible to collect Social Security benefits, you need to have worked a
minimum number of calendar quarters. If you were born after 1928, you need
40 quarters of work credits to qualify for Social Security retirement benefits.
If for some reason you work only the first half of a year or only during
summer months, don’t despair. You don’t need to work part of every quarter
to get a quarter’s credit. You get credits based on the income you earn during
the year. As of this writing, you get the full four quarters credited to your
account if you earn $3,880 or more in a year. (Before 1978, folks got one 
quarter’s credit for each actual calendar quarter in which they earned $50.)
To get 40 quarters of coverage, you basically need to work (at least portions
of) ten years.
70
Part I: Assessing Your Fitness and Setting Goals 
More Social Security details
When the Social Security system was created
in the 1930s, its designers underestimated how
long people would live in retirement. Thanks to
scientific advances and improved medical care,
life expectancies have risen substantially since
that time. As a result, many of today’s retirees
get back far more than they paid into the
system.
The age at which you can start collecting full
benefits has increased, and it may increase
again. In the “good old days” (prior to changes
made in Social Security regulations in 1983), you
could collect full Social Security payments at
age 65, assuming you were eligible. This rule no
longer holds true. If you were born before 1938,
you’re still eligible to collect full Social Security
benefits at age 65. If you were born in 1960 or
after, you have to wait until age 67 for full bene-
fits. If you were born between 1938 and 1959, full
benefits are payable to you at age 66 (plus or
minus some number of months, depending on
the year you were born).
These regulations may seem unfair, but they’re
necessary for updating the system to fit with the
realities of our increased longevity, large fed-
eral budget deficits, and aging baby boomers.
Without changes, the Social Security system
may collapse, because it’ll be fed by a relatively
small number of workers while supporting large
numbers of retirees.
In addition to paying for retirement-income
checks for retirees, your Social Security taxes
also help fund disability insurance for you, sur-
vivor income insurance for your financial
dependents, and Medicare (the health insur-
ance program for retirees).
The amount of Social Security benefits you
receive in retirement depends on your average
earnings during your working years. Don’t worry
about the fact that you probably earned a lot
less many years ago. The Social Security bene-
fits calculations increase your older earnings to
account for the lower cost of living and wages
in prior years.

To get credits, your income must be reported and you must pay taxes on it
(including Social Security tax). In other words, you and those you employ
encounter problems when you neglect to declare income or you pay people
under the table: You may be cheating yourself, or others, out of valuable 
benefits.
To get a more precise handle on your Social Security benefits, call the Social
Security Administration at 800-772-1213 and ask for Form 7004, which allows
you to receive a record of your reported earnings and an estimate of your
Social Security benefits. (You can also visit the Social Security Administration
Web site at www.ssa.gov.) Or you can just wait by your mailbox — the govern-
ment now annually mails a personal Social Security Statement that includes
estimates of the benefits you and your family members may qualify for.
(Check your earnings record, because occasional errors do arise and — 
surprise — they usually aren’t in your favor.)
Planning your personal savings/investment strategy
Money you’re saving toward retirement can include money under the mattress
as well as money in a retirement account such as an individual retirement
account (IRA), 401(k), or similar plan (see Chapter 11). You may have also
earmarked investments in nonretirement accounts for your retirement.
Equity (the difference between the market value less any mortgage balances
owed) in rental real estate can be counted toward your retirement, as well.
Deciding whether to include the equity in your primary residence (your home)
is trickier. If you don’t want to count on using this money in retirement, don’t
include it when you tally your stash. You may want to count a portion of your
home equity in your total assets for retirement. Many people sell their homes
when they retire and move to a cheaper region of the country, move closer to
family, or downsize to a more manageable household. And increasing numbers
of older retirees are tapping their homes’ equity through reverse mortgages
(see Chapter 14 for information on mortgages).
Making the most of pensions
Pension plans are a benefit offered by some employers — mostly larger 
organizations and government agencies. Even if your current employer 
doesn’t offer a pension, you may have earned pension benefits through a 
previous job.
The plans I’m referring to are known as defined-benefit plans. With these
plans, you qualify for a monthly benefit amount to be paid to you in retire-
ment based on your years of service for a specific employer.
71
Chapter 4: Establishing and Achieving Goals

Although each company’s plan differs, all plans calculate and pay benefits
based on a formula. A typical formula might credit you with 1.5 percent of
your salary for each year of service (full-time employment). For example, if
you work ten years, you earn a monthly retirement benefit worth 15 percent
of your monthly salary.
Pension benefits can be quite valuable. In the better plans, employers put
away the equivalent of 5 to 10 percent of your salary to pay your future pen-
sion. This money is in addition to your salary —you never see it in your 
paycheck, and it isn’t taxed. The employer puts this money away in an
account for your retirement.
To qualify for pension benefits, you don’t have to stay with an employer long
enough to receive the 25-year gold watch. Under current government regula-
tions, employees must be fully vested (entitled to receive full benefits based
on years of service upon reaching retirement age) after five years of full-time
service.
Defined-benefit pension plans are becoming rarer for two major reasons:
 They’re costly for employers to maintain. Many employees don’t under-
stand how these plans work and why they’re so valuable, so companies
don’t get mileage out of their pension expenditures — employees don’t
see the money, so they don’t appreciate the company’s generosity.
 Most of the new jobs being generated in the U.S. economy are with small
companies that typically don’t offer these types of plans.
More employers offer plans like 401(k)s, in which employees elect to save
money out of their own paychecks. Known as defined-contribution plans, these
plans allow you to save toward your retirement at your own expense rather
than at your employer’s expense. (To encourage participation in defined-
contribution plans, some employers “match” a portion of their employees’
contributions.) More of the burden and responsibility of investing for retire-
ment falls on your shoulders with 401(k) and similar plans, so it’s important
to understand how these plans work. Most people are ill-equipped to know
how much to save and how to invest the money. The retirement planning
worksheet in the next section should help get you started with figuring out
the amount you need to save. (Part III shows you how to invest.)

Making up for lost time
If the amount you need to save per month to reach your retirement goals
seems daunting, all is not lost. Remember: Winners never quit, and quitters
never win. Here are my top recommendations for making up for lost time:
74
Part I: Assessing Your Fitness and Setting Goals 

 Question your spending. You have two ways to boost your savings:
Earn more money or cut your spending (or do both). Most people
don’t spend their money nearly as thoughtfully as they earn it. Refer to
Chapter 6 for suggestions and strategies for reducing your spending.
 Be more realistic about your retirement age. If you extend the age at
which you plan to retire, you get a double benefit: You’re earning and
saving money for more years, and you’re spending your nest egg over
fewer years. Of course, if your job is making you crazy, this option may
not be too appealing. Try to find work that makes you happy, and con-
sider working, at least part-time, during the early years typically consid-
ered the retirement years.
 Use your home equity. The prospect of tapping the cash in your home
can be troubling. After getting together the down payment, you probably
worked for many years to pay off that sucker. You’re delighted not to
have to mail a mortgage payment to the bank anymore. But what’s the
use of owning a house free of mortgage debt when you lack sufficient
retirement reserves? All the money that’s tied up in the house can be
used to help increase your standard of living in retirement.
You have a number of ways to tap your home’s equity. You can sell your
home and either move to a lower-cost property or rent an apartment. Tax
laws allow you to realize up to $250,000 in tax-free profit from the sale of
your house ($500,000 if you’re married). Another option is a reverse mort-
gage, in which you get a monthly income check as you build a loan balance
against the value of your home. The loan is paid when your home is finally
sold. (See Chapter 14 for more information about reverse mortgages.)
 Get your investments growing. The faster the rate at which your money
grows and compounds, the less you need to save each year to reach your
goals. Earning just a few extra percentage points per year on your invest-
ments can dramatically slash the amount you need to save. The younger
you are, the more powerful the effect of compounding interest. For exam-
ple, if you’re in your mid-30s and your investments appreciate 6 percent
per year (rather than 4 percent) faster than the rate of inflation, the
amount you need to save each month to reach your retirement goals
drops by about 40 percent! (See Part III, on investing.)
 Turn a hobby into supplemental retirement income. Even if you’ve
earned a living in the same career over many decades, you have skills
that are portable and can be put to profitable use. Pick something you
enjoy and are good at, develop a business plan, and get smart about
how to market your services and wares (check out the latest edition of
Small Business For Dummies from Wiley Publishing, which I co-wrote with
veteran entrepreneur Jim Schell). Remember, as people get busier, more
specialized services are created to support their hectic lives. A demand
for quality, homemade goods of all varieties also exists. Be creative! You
never know — you may wind up profiled in a business publication!
75
Chapter 4: Establishing and Achieving Goals

 Invest to gain tax-free and other free money. By investing in a tax-wise
fashion, you can boost the effective rate of return on your investments
without taking on additional risk.
In addition to the tax benefits you gain from funding most types of retire-
ment accounts in this chapter (see the earlier section, “Valuing retirement
accounts”), some employers offer free matching money. Also, the govern-
ment now offers tax credits (see Chapter 7) for low and moderate income
earners who utilize retirement accounts.
As for money outside of tax-sheltered retirement accounts, if you’re in a
relatively high tax bracket, you may earn more by investing in tax-free
investments and other vehicles that minimize highly taxed distributions.
 Think about inheritances. Although you should never count on an inher-
itance to support your retirement, you may inherit money someday.
If you want to see what impact an inheritance has on your retirement
calculations, add a conservative estimate of the amount you expect to
inherit to your current total savings in Table 4-2.

In this part . . .

detail numerous ways to make your dollars go toward
building up your savings rather than toward wasteful
spending. Are you buried in debt with little to show for it?
Well, it’s never too late to start digging out. Here you find
out how to reduce your debt burden. I also devote an
entire chapter to discussing taxes and how to legally mini-
mize them, because too much of your money may be
going to Uncle Sam.

ccumulating bad debt (consumer debt) by buying things like new living
room furniture or a new car that you really can’t afford is like living on a
diet of sugar and caffeine: a quick fix with little nutritional value. Borrowing
on your credit card to afford an extravagantly expensive vacation is detri-
mental to your long-term financial health.
When debt is used for investing in your future, I call it good debt (see Chapter 2).
Borrowing money to pay for an education, buy real estate, or invest in a small
business is like eating fruits and vegetables for their vitamins. That’s not to
say that you can’t get yourself into trouble when accumulating good debt.
Just as you can gorge yourself on too much “good food,” you can absolutely
develop financial indigestion from too much good debt.
In this chapter, I mainly help you battle the increasing problem of consumer
debt. Getting rid of your bad debts may be even more difficult than giving up
the junk foods you love. But in the long run, you’ll be glad you did; you’ll be
financially healthier and emotionally happier. And after you get rid of your
high-cost consumer debts, make sure you practice the best way to avoid
future credit problems: Don’t borrow with bad debt.
Before you decide which debt reduction strategies make sense for you, you
must first consider your overall financial situation (see Chapter 2) and assess
your alternatives. (I discuss strategies for reducing your current spending —
which help you free up more cash to pay down your debts — in the next
chapter.)

Using Savings to Reduce 
Your Consumer Debt
Many people build a mental brick wall between their savings and investment
accounts and their consumer debt accounts. By failing to view their finances
holistically, they simply fall into the habit of looking at these accounts indi-
vidually. The thought of putting a door in that big brick wall doesn’t occur
to them.
Understanding how you gain
If you have the savings to pay off consumer debt, like high-interest credit
card and auto loans, do so. (Make sure you pay off the loans with the highest
interest rates first.) Sure, you diminish your savings, but you also reduce
your debts. Although your savings and investments may be earning decent
returns, odds are good that the interest you’re paying on your consumer
debts is higher.
Paying off consumer loans on a credit card at, say, 12 percent is like finding
an investment with a guaranteed return of 12 percent — tax-free. You would
actually need to find an investment that yielded even more — around 
18 percent — to net 12 percent after paying taxes in order to justify not
paying off your 12 percent loans. The higher your tax bracket (see Chapter 7),
the higher the return you need on your investments to justify keeping high-
interest consumer debt.
Even if you think that you’re an investment genius and you can earn more
on your investments, swallow your ego and pay down your consumer debts
anyway. In order to chase that higher potential return from investments, you
need to take substantial risk. You may earn more investing in that hot stock
tip or that bargain real estate located on a toxic waste site, but more than
likely, you won’t.
If you use your savings to pay down consumer debts, be careful to leave
yourself enough of an emergency cushion. (In Chapter 4, I tell you how to
determine how large of an emergency reserve you should have.) You want to
be in a position to withstand an unexpected large expense or temporary loss
of income. On the other hand, if you use savings to pay down credit card
debt, you can run your credit card balances back up in a financial pinch
(unless your card gets canceled), or you can turn to a family member or
wealthy friend for a low-interest loan.

Part II: Saving More, Spending Less 

Discovering money to pay 
down consumer debts
Have you ever reached into the pocket of an old winter parka and found a
rolled-up $20 bill you forgot you had? Stumbling across some forgotten funds
is always a pleasant experience. But before you root through all your closets
in search of stray cash to help you pay down that nagging credit card debt,
check out some of these financial jacket pockets you may have overlooked:
 Borrow against your cash value life insurance policy. If you were
approached by a life insurance agent, he or she probably sold you a
cash value policy because it pays high commissions to insurance agents.
Or perhaps your parents bought one of these policies for you when you
were a child. Borrow against the cash value to pay down your debts.
(Note: You may want to consider discontinuing your cash value policy
altogether and simply withdraw the cash balance — see Chapter 16 for
details.)
 Sell investments held outside of retirement accounts. Maybe you have
some shares of stock or a Treasury bond gathering dust in your safety
deposit box. Consider cashing in these investments to pay down your
consumer loans. Just be sure to consider the tax consequences of selling
these investments. If possible, sell only those investments that won’t
generate a big tax bill.
 Borrow against the equity in your home. If you’re a homeowner, you
may be able to tap into your home’s equity, which is the difference
between the property’s market value and outstanding loan balance.
You can generally borrow against real estate at a lower interest rate and
get a tax deduction to boot. You must take care to ensure that you don’t
overborrow on your home and risk losing it to foreclosure.
 Borrow against your employer’s retirement account. Check with your
employer’s benefits department to see whether you can borrow against
your retirement account balance. The interest rate is usually reasonable.
Be careful, though — if you leave your job (or if you’re asked to leave),
you may have to repay the loan within only 60 days. Also recognize that
you’ll miss out on investment returns on the money borrowed.
 Borrow from friends and family. They know you, love you, realize your
shortcomings, and probably won’t be as cold-hearted as some bankers.
Money borrowed from family members can have strings attached, of
course. Treating the obligation seriously is important. To avoid misunder-
standings, write up a simple agreement listing the terms and conditions
of the loan. Unless your family members are like the worst bankers I
know, you’ll probably get a fair interest rate, and your family will have
the satisfaction of helping you out — just don’t forget to pay them back.
81
Chapter 5: Dealing with Debt

Decreasing Debt When You Lack Savings
If you lack savings to throw at your consumer debts, not surprisingly, you have
some work to do. If you’re currently spending all your income (and more!),
you need to figure out how you can decrease your spending (see Chapter 6
for lots of great ideas) and/or increase your income. In the meantime, you
need to slow the growth of your debt.
Reducing your credit card’s interest rate
Different credit cards charge different interest rates. So why pay 14, 16, or
18 percent (or more) when you can pay less? The credit card business has
become quite competitive. Gone are the days where all banks charge 18 per-
cent or more for VISA and MasterCard.
Until you get your debt paid off, slow the growth of your debt by reducing the
interest rate you’re paying. Here are sound ways to do that:
 Apply for a lower-rate credit card. If you’re earning a decent income,
you’re not too burdened with debt, and you have a clean credit record,
qualifying for lower-rate cards is relatively painless. Some persistence
(and cleanup work) may be required if you have income and debt prob-
lems or nicks in your credit report. After you’re approved for a new,
lower-interest-rate card, you can simply transfer your outstanding 
balance from your higher-rate card.
Among the banks with consistently low-interest-rate credit cards, I like
5Star Bank (800-776-2265), which offers a no-annual-fee card with a 7.9
percent interest rate. CardWeb.com’s Web site has a credit card locator
tool that you may find useful (www.cardweb.com/cardlocator/).
In addition, the site presents monthly surveys of low-interest-rate and
no-annual-fee cards (among others, including secured cards).
 Call the bank(s) that issued your current high-interest-rate credit
card(s) and say that you want to cancel your card(s) because you
found a competitor that offers no annual fee and a lower interest rate.
Your bank may choose to match the terms of the “competitor” rather
than lose you as a customer.
 While you’re paying down your credit card balance(s), stop making
new charges on cards that have outstanding balances. Many people
don’t realize that interest starts to accumulate immediately when they
carry a balance. You have no grace period — the 20-odd days you normally
have to pay your balance in full without incurring interest charges — if
you carry a credit card balance month to month.
82
Part II: Saving More, Spending Less 

Understanding all credit card 
terms and conditions
Avoid getting lured into applying for a credit card that hypes an extremely
low interest rate. One such card advertises a 1.9 percent rate, but you have
to dig into the fine print for the rest of the story.
First, any card that offers such a low interest rate will honor that rate only for
a short period of time — in this case, six months. After six months, the inter-
est rate skyrockets to nearly 15 percent.
But wait, there’s more: Make just one late payment or exceed your credit
limit, and the company raises your interest rate to 19.8 percent (or even 24,
29 percent, or more) and slaps you with a $29 fee for each such infraction
(some banks charge $39). If you want a cash advance on your card, you get
socked with a fee equal to 3 percent of the amount advanced. (During the
economic slowdown in the early 2000s, some banks were even advertising
0 percent interest rates — although that rate generally applied only to bal-
ances transferred from another card, and such cards were subject to all of
the other vagaries discussed in this section.)
Now, I’m not saying that everyone should avoid this type of card. Such a card
may make sense for you if you want to transfer an outstanding balance and
then pay off that balance within a matter of months, cancel the card, and avoid
getting socked with the high fees on the card.
If you hunt around for a low-interest-rate credit card, be sure to check out all
the terms and conditions. Start by reviewing the uniform rates and terms dis-
closure, which details the myriad fees and conditions. Also, be sure that you
understand how the future interest rate is determined on cards that charge
variable interest rates.
Cutting up your credit cards
If you have a pattern of living beyond your means by buying on credit, get rid
of the culprit — the credit card, that is. To kick the habit, a smoker needs
to toss all the cigarettes, and an alcoholic needs to get rid of all the booze.
Cut up all of your credit cards and call the issuers of the cards to cancel your
accounts. And when you buy consumer items such as cars and furniture, do
not apply for E-Z credit.
83
Chapter 5: Dealing with Debt

The world worked fine back in the years B.C. (Before Credit). Think about it:
Just a couple generations ago, credit cards didn’t even exist. People paid with
cash and checks — imagine that! You can function without buying anything
on a credit card. In certain cases, you may need a card as collateral — such
as when renting a car. When you bring back the rental car, however, you can
pay with cash or check. Leave the card at home in the back of your sock
drawer or freezer, and pull (or thaw) it out only for the occasional car rental.
If you can trust yourself, keep a separate credit card only for new purchases
that you know you can absolutely pay in full each month. No one needs three,
five, or ten credit cards! You can live with one (and actually none), given the
wide acceptance of most cards. Count ’em up, including retail store and gas
cards, and get rid of ’em. Retailers such as department stores and gas stations
just love to give you their cards. Not only do these cards charge outrageously
high interest rates, but they also are not widely accepted like VISA and
MasterCard. Virtually all retailers accept VISA and MasterCard. More credit
lines mean more temptation to spend what you can’t afford.
If you decide to keep one widely accepted credit card instead of getting rid of
them all, be careful. You may be tempted to let debt accumulate and roll over
for a month or two, starting up the whole horrible process of running up your
consumer debt again. Rather than keeping one credit card, consider getting a
debit card.
Discovering debit cards: 
The best of both worlds
Credit cards are the main reason today’s consumers are buying more than
they can afford. So logic says that one way you can keep your spending in
check is to stop using your credit cards. But in a society that’s used to the
widely accepted VISA and MasterCard plastic for purchases, changing habits
is hard. And you may be legitimately concerned that carrying your checkbook
or cash can be a hassle or can be costly if you’re mugged.
Debit cards truly offer the best of both worlds. The beauty of the debit card is
that it offers you the convenience of making purchases with a piece of plastic
without the temptation or ability to run up credit card debt. Debit cards keep
you from spending money you don’t have and help you live within your means.
A debit card looks just like a credit card with either the VISA or MasterCard
logo. The big difference between debit cards and credit cards is that, as with
checks, debit card purchase amounts are deducted electronically from your
checking account within days. (Bank ATM cards are also debit cards; however,
if they lack a VISA or MasterCard logo, bank ATM cards are accepted by far
fewer merchants.)
84
Part II: Saving More, Spending Less 

If you switch to a debit card and you keep your checking account balance low
and don’t ordinarily balance your checkbook, you may need to start balanc-
ing it. Otherwise, you may face unnecessary bounced check charges.
Here are some other differences between debit and credit cards:
 If you pay your credit card bill in full and on time each month, your
credit card gives you free use of the money you owe until it’s time to pay
the bill; debit cards take the money out of your checking account almost
immediately. (Note that some credit cards charge a fee even if you pay
your balance in full each month. You didn’t think the banks would let
you use the float forever, did you?)
 Credit cards make it easier for you to dispute charges for problematic
merchandise through the issuing bank. Most banks allow you to
dispute charges for up to 60 days after purchase and will credit the dis-
puted amount to your account pending resolution. Most debit cards
offer a much shorter window, typically less than one week, for making
disputes.
Because moving your checking account can be a hassle, see whether your
current bank offers VISA or MasterCard debit cards. If your bank doesn’t offer
one, shop among the major banks in your area, which are likely to offer the
cards. Because such cards come with checking accounts, make sure that
you do some comparison shopping between the different account features
and fees.
85
Chapter 5: Dealing with Debt
What if your debit card is lost or stolen?
Personal credit cards and debit cards have sim-
ilar so-called “zero liability” should someone
illegally use your card. If your debit card is lost
or stolen and someone makes fraudulent
charges on your debit card, you simply sign
statements with your bank that they aren’t your
charges. You will be reimbursed typically in a
matter of days.
However, cards designated and listed as business
(commercial) cards may not have the same zero
liability as consumer cards. Generally speaking,
banks view businesses as riskier and more
prone to internal fraud. Suppose, for example,
that your business issued debit cards to its
employees and one of them gave it to a friend to
use and then said the card was lost and those
purchases were fraudulent.
Therefore, I recommend getting a separate con-
sumer debit card for your small business (simply
keep your name, not the business’s on the
account) or use a bank that offers the same pro-
tections on their business debit cards as on their
consumer debit cards. Otherwise, you could get
socked with a hefty bill that you didn’t deserve.

A number of investment firms offer VISA or MasterCard debit cards with their
asset management accounts. Not only can these investment firm “checking
accounts” help you break the credit card overspending habit, but they may
also get you thinking about saving and investing your money. One drawback
of these accounts is that most of them require fairly hefty minimum initial
investment amounts — typically $5,000 to $10,000. Among brokerages with
competitive investment offerings and prices are TD Waterhouse (800-934-4448;
www.tdameritrade.com), Vanguard (800-992-8327; www.vanguard.com),
and Muriel Siebert (800-872-0711; www.siebertnet.com).
Turning to Credit Counseling Agencies
Prior to the passage of the 2005 bankruptcy laws discussed later in this 
chapter, each year hundreds of thousands of debt-burdened consumers
sought “counseling” from credit counseling service offices. Now, more than
a million people annually are expected to get the required counseling.
Unfortunately, many people find that the service doesn’t always work the
way it’s pitched.
Beware biased advice at credit 
counseling agencies
Leona Davis, whose family racked up significant debt due largely to unex-
pected medical expenses and a reduction in her income, found herself in
trouble with too much debt. So she turned to one of the large, nationally 
promoted credit counseling services, which she heard about through its
advertising and marketing materials.
The credit counseling agency Davis went to markets itself as a “nonprofit
community service.” Davis, like many others I know, found that the “service”
was not objective. After her experience, Davis feels that a more appropriate
name for the organization she worked with would be the Credit Card Collection
Agency.
Unbeknownst to Davis and most of the other people who use supposed credit
counseling agencies is the fact that the vast majority of their funding comes
from the fees that creditors pay them. Most credit counseling agencies collect
fees on a commission basis — just as collection agencies do! Their strategy is
to place those who come in for help on their “debt management program.”
Under this program, counselees like Davis agree to pay a certain amount per
month to the agency, which in turn parcels out the money to the various
creditors.
86
Part II: Saving More, Spending Less 

Because of Davis’s tremendous outstanding consumer debt (it exceeded her
annual income), her repayment plan was doomed to failure. Davis managed to
make 10 months’ worth of payments, largely because she raided a retirement
account for $28,000. Had Davis filed bankruptcy (which she ultimately needed
to do), she would’ve been able to keep her retirement money. But Davis’s
counselor never discussed the bankruptcy option. “I received no counseling,”
says Davis. “Real counselors take the time to understand your situation and
offer options. I was offered one solution: a forced payment plan.”
Others who have consulted various credit counseling agencies, including one
of my research assistants who, undercover, visited an office to seek advice,
confirm that some agencies use a cookie-cutter approach to dealing with
debt. Such agencies typically recommend that debtors go on a repayment
plan that has the consumer pay, say, 3 percent of each outstanding loan bal-
ance to the agency, which in turn pays the money to creditors.
Unable to keep up with the enormous monthly payments, Davis finally turned
to an attorney and filed for bankruptcy — but not before she had unnecessar-
ily lost thousands of dollars because of the biased recommendations.
Although credit counseling agencies’ promotional materials and counselors
aren’t shy about highlighting the drawbacks to bankruptcy, counselors are
reluctant to discuss the negative impact of signing up for a debt payment plan.
Davis’ counselor never told her that restructuring her credit card payments
would tarnish her credit reports and scores. The counselor my researcher
met with also neglected to mention this important fact. When asked, the
counselor was evasive about the debt “management” program’s impact on
his credit report.
If you’re considering bankruptcy, first be sure to read the rest of this chapter.
Second, interview any counseling agency you may be considering working
with. Remember that you’re the customer and you should do your homework
first and be in control. Don’t allow anyone or any agency to make you feel
that they’re in power simply because of your financial troubles.
Ask questions and avoid debt 
management programs
Probably the most important question to ask a counseling agency is whether
they offer debt management programs (DMP) where they put you on a repay-
ment plan with your creditors and get paid a monthly fee for handling the
payments. You do not want to work with an agency offering DMPs because of
conflicts of interest. An agency can’t offer objective advice about all your
options for dealing with debt, including bankruptcy, if they have a financial
incentive to put you on a DMP.
87
Chapter 5: Dealing with Debt

Two good agencies that don’t offer DMPs are the Institute for Financial
Literacy (866-662-4932; www.financiallit.org) and Hummingbird Credit
Counseling (800-645-4959; www.hummingbirdcreditcounseling.org).
Here are some additional questions that the Federal Trade Commission sug-
gests that you ask prospective counseling agencies you may hire:
 What are your fees? Are there setup and/or monthly fees? Get a spe-
cific price quote in writing.
 What if I can’t afford to pay your fees or make contributions? If an
organization won’t help you because you can’t afford to pay, look else-
where for help.
 Will I have a formal written agreement or contract with you? Don’t
sign anything without reading it first. Make sure all verbal promises are
in writing.
 Are you licensed to offer your services in my state?
 What are the qualifications of your counselors? Are they accredited
or certified by an outside organization? If so, by whom? If not, how
are they trained? Try to use an organization whose counselors are
trained by a non-affiliated party.
 What assurance do I have that information about me (including my
address, phone number, and financial information) will be kept confi-
dential and secure?
 How are your employees compensated? Are they paid more if I sign
up for certain services, if I pay a fee, or if I make a contribution to
your organization?
Filing Bankruptcy
For consumers in over their heads, the realization that their monthly income
is increasingly exceeded by their bill payments is usually a traumatic one.
In many cases, years can pass before people consider drastic measures like
filing bankruptcy. Both financial and emotional issues come into play in one
of the most difficult and painful, yet potentially beneficial, decisions.
When Helen, a mother of two and a sales representative, contacted a bank-
ruptcy attorney, her total credit card debt equaled her annual gross income.
As a result of her crushing debt load, she couldn’t meet her minimum monthly
credit card payments. Rent and food gobbled up most of her earnings. What
little was left over went to the squeakiest wheel.
88
Part II: Saving More, Spending Less 

Creditors were breathing down Helen’s back. “I started getting calls from col-
lection departments at home and work — it was embarrassing,” relates Helen.
Helen’s case is typical in that credit card debt was the prime cause of her
bankruptcy.
As the debt load grew (partly exacerbated by the high interest rates on the
cards), more and more purchases got charged — from the kids’ clothing to
repairs for the car. Finally, after running out of cash, she had to take a large
cash advance on her credit cards to pay for rent and food.
Despite trying to work out lower monthly payments to keep everyone happy,
most of the banks to which Helen owed money were inflexible. “When I
asked one bank’s VISA department if it preferred that I declare bankruptcy
because it was unwilling to lower my monthly payment, the representative
said ‘yes’,” Helen says. After running out of options, Helen filed personal 
bankruptcy.
Understanding bankruptcy benefits
Every year, more than 1.5 million American households (that’s about 1 in
every 80 households) file personal bankruptcy.
With bankruptcy, certain types of debts can be completely eliminated or dis-
charged. Debts that typically can be discharged include credit card, medical,
auto, utilities, and rent.
Debts that may not be canceled generally include child support, alimony, stu-
dent loans, taxes, and court-ordered damages (for example, drunk driving
settlements). Helen was an ideal candidate for bankruptcy because her debts
(credit cards) were dischargeable.
Helen also met another important criterion — her level of high-interest con-
sumer debt relative to her annual income was high (100 percent). When this
ratio (discussed in Chapter 2) exceeds more than 25 percent, filing bankruptcy
may be your best option.
Eliminating your debt also allows you to start working toward your financial
goals. Depending on the amount of debt you have outstanding relative to
your income, you may need a decade or more to pay it all off. In Helen’s case,
at the age of 48, she had no money saved for retirement, and she was increas-
ingly unable to spend money on her children.
89
Chapter 5: Dealing with Debt

Filing bankruptcy offers not only financial benefits but emotional benefits,
as well. “I was horrified at filing, but it is good to be rid of the debts and 
collection calls — I should have filed six months earlier. I was constantly 
worried. When I saw homeless families come to the soup kitchen where I
sometimes volunteer, I thought that someday that could be me and my kids,”
says Helen.
Coming to terms with bankruptcy 
drawbacks
Filing bankruptcy, needless to say, has a number of drawbacks. First, bank-
ruptcy appears on your credit report for up to ten years, so you’ll have diffi-
culty obtaining credit, especially in the years immediately following your
filing. However, if you already have problems on your credit report (because
of late payments or a failure to pay previous debts), the damage has already
been done. And without savings, you’re probably not going to be making
major purchases (such as a home) in the next several years anyway.
If you do file bankruptcy, getting credit in the future is still possible. You may
be able to obtain a secured credit card, which requires you to deposit money
in a bank account equal to the credit limit on your credit card. Of course,
you’ll be better off without the temptation of any credit cards and better
served with a debit card. Also, know that if you can hold down a stable job,

What you can keep if you file bankruptcy
In every state, you can retain certain property
and assets when you file for bankruptcy. You
may be surprised to discover that in some
states, you can keep your home regardless of
its value! Most states, though, allow you to pro-
tect a certain amount of home equity.
Additionally, you’re allowed to retain some other
types and amounts of personal property and
assets. For example, most states allow you to
retain household furnishings, clothing, pen-
sions, and money in retirement accounts. So
don’t empty your retirement accounts or sell off
personal possessions to pay debts unless
you’re absolutely sure that you won’t be filing
bankruptcy.

most creditors will be willing to give you loans within a few years of your
filing bankruptcy. Almost all lenders ignore bankruptcy after five to seven
years.
Another drawback of bankruptcy is that it costs money, and those expenses
have jumped higher due to the new requirements from the 2005 bankruptcy law
(more on that in a moment). I know this seems terribly unfair. You’re already
in financial trouble — that’s why you’re filing bankruptcy! Court filing and
legal fees can easily exceed $1,000, especially in higher cost of living areas.
And finally, most people find that filing bankruptcy causes emotional stress.
Admitting that your personal income can’t keep pace with your debt obliga-
tions is a painful thing to do. Although filing bankruptcy clears the decks of
debt and gives you a fresh financial start, feeling a profound sense of failure
(and sometimes shame) is common. Despite the increasing incidence of bank-
ruptcy, bankruptcy filers are reluctant to talk about it with others, including
family and friends.
Another part of the emotional side of filing bankruptcy is that you must open
your personal financial affairs to court scrutiny and court control during the
several months it takes to administer a bankruptcy. A court-appointed bank-
ruptcy trustee oversees your case and tries to recover as much of your 
property as possible to satisfy the creditors — those to whom you owe money.
Some people also feel that they’re shirking responsibility by filing for bank-
ruptcy. One client I worked with should have filed, but she couldn’t bring 
herself to do it. She said, “I spent that money, and it’s my responsibility to
pay it back.”
Most banks make gobs and gobs of money from their credit card businesses.
As a former consultant who worked in the industry, I can tell you that credit
cards are one of the most profitable lines of business for banks. If you don’t
believe me, consider that at a banking conference, CEO John Reed referred to
the credit card business for banks as a “high-return, low-risk” business. Now
you know why your mailbox is always filled with solicitations for more cards.
So if you file for bankruptcy, don’t feel bad about not paying back the bank.
The nice merchants from whom you bought the merchandise have already
been paid. Charge-offs — the banker’s term for taking the loss on debt that
you discharge through bankruptcy — are the banker’s cost, which is another
reason why the interest rate is so high on credit cards and why you shouldn’t
borrow on credit cards.
91
Chapter 5: Dealing with Debt

Deciphering the new bankruptcy laws
In 2005, a new bankruptcy law went into effect — the Bankruptcy Abuse and
Prevention Act of 2005. As you may be able to tell from the bill’s name, major
creditors, such as credit card companies, lobbied heavily for new laws.
Although they didn’t get everything they wanted, they got a lot, which not
surprisingly doesn’t benefit those folks in dire financial condition considering
bankruptcy. Don’t despair, though — help and information can overcome the
worst provisions of this new law. Here are the major new elements of the per-
sonal bankruptcy laws:
 Required counseling: Before filing for bankruptcy, individuals are now
mandated to complete credit counseling, the purpose of which is to
explore your options for dealing with debt, including (but not limited to)
bankruptcy and developing a debt repayment plan.
Historically, many supposed “counseling” agencies have provided highly
biased advice. Be sure to read the “Turning to Credit Counseling Agencies”
section on what conflicts of interest agencies have and for advice on
how to pick a top-notch agency.
To actually have debts discharged through bankruptcy, the new law
requires a second type of counseling called “Debtor Education.” All credit
counseling and debtor education must be completed by an approved
organization on the U.S. Trustee’s Web site (www.usdoj.gov/ust).
Click on the link “Credit Counseling & Debtor Education.”
 Means testing: Some high-income earners now may be precluded from
filing the form of bankruptcy that actually discharges debts (called
Chapter 7) and instead forced to use the form of bankruptcy that
involves a repayment plan (called Chapter 13).
Recognizing that folks living in higher cost of living areas tend to have
higher incomes, the new law does allow for differences in income by
making adjustments based upon your state of residence and family size.
The expense side of the equation is considered as well, and allowances
are determined by county and metropolitan area. I won’t bore you with
the details and required calculations here. Studies estimate that only
about 5 percent of potential filers are expected to be affected by this new
provision. For more information, click on the “Means Testing Information”
link on the U.S. Trustee’s Web site (www.usdoj.gov/ust).
 Increased requirements placed on filers and attorneys: The means
testing alone has created a good deal of additional work for bankruptcy
filers, work generally done by attorneys. Filers including lawyers must
also now attest to the accuracy of submitted information, which will
have attorneys doing more verification work. Thus, it’s no surprise
that since the new bankruptcy laws were passed, legal fees increased
significantly — jumps of 30 to 40 percent were common.
92
Part II: Saving More, Spending Less 

 New rules for people who recently moved: Individual states have
their own provisions for how much personal property and home equity
(difference between market value of your home and debt owed on that
home) you could keep. In some cases, soon before filing bankruptcy,
people actually moved to a state that allowed them to keep more. Under
the new law, you must live in the state for at least two years before filing
bankruptcy in that state and using that state’s personal property exemp-
tions. To use a given state’s homestead exemption, which dictates how
much home equity you may protect, you must have lived in that state
for at least 40 months.
Choosing between Chapter 7 and 13
You can file one of two forms of personal bankruptcy, Chapter 7 or Chapter 13.
Chapter 7 allows you to discharge or cancel certain debts. This form of bank-
ruptcy makes the most sense when you have significant debts that you’re
legally allowed to cancel. (See “Understanding bankruptcy benefits,” earlier
in this chapter, for details on which debts can be canceled, or discharged.)
Chapter 13 comes up with a repayment schedule that requires you to pay
your debts over several years. Chapter 13 stays on your credit record (just
like Chapter 7), but it doesn’t eliminate debt, so its value is limited — usually
to dealing with debts like taxes that can’t be discharged through bankruptcy.
Chapter 13 can keep creditors at bay until a repayment schedule is worked
out in the courts.
Seeking bankruptcy advice
If you want to find out more about the pros, cons, and details of filing for
bankruptcy, pick up a copy of The New Bankruptcy: Will It Work For You by
attorney Stephen R. Elias (Nolo Press). If you’re comfortable with your deci-
sion to file and you think you can complete the paperwork, you may be able
to do it yourself. How to File for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy, by attorneys Elias,
Albin Renauer, and Robin Leonard (Nolo Press), comes with all the necessary
filing forms.
Hiring a paralegal typing service to prepare the forms, which can be a cost-
effective way to get help with the process if you don’t need heavy-duty legal
advice, is an intermediate approach. To find a paralegal typing service in
your area, check your local yellow pages under “Paralegals.”

Chapter 5: Dealing with Debt

Stopping the Spend-and-Consumer 
Debt Cycle
Regardless of how you deal with paying off your debt, you’re in real danger
of falling back into old habits. Backsliding happens not only to people who
file bankruptcy but also to those who use savings or home equity to elimi-
nate their debt. This section speaks to that risk and tells you what to do
about it.
Resisting the credit temptation
Getting out of debt can be challenging, but I have confidence that you can do
it with this book by your side. In addition to the ideas I discuss earlier in this
chapter (such as eliminating all your credit cards and getting a debit card),
the following list provides some additional tactics you can use to limit the
influence credit cards hold over your life. (If you’re concerned about the
impact that any of these tactics may have on your credit rating, please see
Chapter 2):
 Reduce your credit limit. If you’re not going to take the advice I give
you earlier in this chapter and get rid of all of your credit cards or
secure a debit card, be sure to keep a lid on your credit card’s credit
limit (the maximum balance allowed on your card). You don’t have to
accept the increase just because your bank keeps raising your credit
limit to reward you for being such a profitable customer. Call your credit
card service’s toll-free phone number and lower your credit limit to a
level you’re comfortable with.
 Replace your credit card with a charge card. A charge card (such
as the American Express Card) requires you to pay your balance in
full each billing period. You have no credit line or interest charges.
Of course, spending more than you can afford to pay when the bill
comes due is possible. But you’ll be much less likely to overspend if
you know you have to pay in full monthly.
 Never buy anything on credit that depreciates in value. Meals out,
cars, clothing, and shoes all depreciate in value. Never buy these things
on credit. Borrow money only for sound investments — education, real
estate, or your own business, for example.
94
Part II: Saving More, Spending Less 

 Think in terms of total cost. Everything sounds cheaper in terms of
monthly payments — that’s how salespeople entice you into buying
things you can’t afford. Take a calculator along, if necessary, to tally up
the sticker price, interest charges, and upkeep. The total cost will scare
you. It should.
 Stop the junk mail avalanche. Look at your daily mail — I bet half of it
is solicitations and mail-order catalogs. You can save some trees and
time sorting junk mail by removing yourself from most mailing lists.
To remove your name from mailing lists, write to the Direct Marketing
Association, Mail Preference Service, P.O. Box 643, Carmel, NY 10512
(you can register through their Web site at www.dmaconsumers.org/
consumerassistance.html, but you have to pay a $5 fee to do so;
simply print out the form and mail it in to avoid the online fee).
To remove your name from the major credit reporting agency lists that
are used by credit card solicitation companies, call 888-567-8688. Also,
tell any credit card companies you keep cards with that you want your
account marked to indicate that you don’t want any of your personal
information shared with telemarketing firms.
 Limit what you can spend. Go shopping with a small amount of cash
and no plastic or checks. That way, you can spend only what little cash
you have with you!
Identifying and treating a compulsion
No matter how hard they try to break the habit, some people become addicted
to spending and accumulating debt. It becomes a chronic problem that starts
to interfere with other aspects of their lives and can lead to problems at work
and with family and friends.
Debtors Anonymous (DA) is a nonprofit organization that provides support
(primarily through group meetings) to people trying to break their debt accu-
mulation and spending habits. DA is modeled after the 12-step Alcoholics
Anonymous (AA) program.
Like AA, Debtors Anonymous works with people from all walks of life and
socioeconomic backgrounds. You can find people who are financially on the
edge, $100,000-plus income earners, and everybody in between at DA meet-
ings. Even former millionaires join the program.
95
Chapter 5: Dealing with Debt

DA has a simple questionnaire that helps determine whether you’re a prob-
lem debtor. If you answer “yes” to at least 8 of the following 15 questions, you
may be developing or already have a compulsive spending and debt accumu-
lation habit:
 Are your debts making your home life unhappy?
 Does the pressure of your debts distract you from your daily work?
 Are your debts affecting your reputation?
 Do your debts cause you to think less of yourself?
 Have you ever given false information in order to obtain credit?
 Have you ever made unrealistic promises to your creditors?
 Does the pressure of your debts make you careless when it comes to the
welfare of your family?
 Do you ever fear that your employer, family, or friends will learn the
extent of your total indebtedness?
 When faced with a difficult financial situation, does the prospect of 
borrowing give you an inordinate feeling of relief?
 Does the pressure of your debts cause you to have difficulty sleeping?
 Has the pressure of your debts ever caused you to consider getting drunk?
 Have you ever borrowed money without giving adequate consideration
to the rate of interest you’re required to pay?
 Do you usually expect a negative response when you’re subject to a
credit investigation?
 Have you ever developed a strict regimen for paying off your debts, only
to break it under pressure?
 Do you justify your debts by telling yourself that you are superior to the
“other” people, and when you get your “break,” you’ll be out of debt?
To find a Debtors Anonymous (DA) support group in your area, check your
local phone directory (in the “Business” section) or visit the DA Web site at
www.debtorsanonymous.org. You can write to DA’s national headquarters
for meeting locations in your area and a literature order form at the following
address: Debtors Anonymous General Service Office, P.O. Box 920888, Needham,
MA 02492-0009. You can also contact the DA’s national headquarters by phone
at 781-453-2743.

Chapter 6
Reducing Your Spending
In This Chapter
 The keys to successful spending
 Proven techniques for reducing your spending
T
elling people how and where to spend their money is a risky undertaking,
because most people like to spend money and hate to be told what to do.
You’ll be glad to hear that I don’t tell you exactly where you must cut your
spending in order to save more and accomplish your personal and financial
goals. Instead, I detail numerous strategies that have worked for other people.
The final decision for what to cut rests solely on you. Only you can decide
what’s important to you and what’s dispensable (should you cut out your
weekly poker games, or cut back on your shoe collection?).
I assume throughout these recommendations that you value your time.
Therefore, I don’t tell you to scrimp and save by doing things like cutting
open a tube of toothpaste so that you can use every last bit of it. And I don’t
tell you to have your spouse do your ironing to reduce your dry-cleaning
bills — no point in having extra money in the bank if your significant other
walks out on you!
The fact that you’re busy all the time may be part of the reason you spend
money as you do. Therefore, the recommendations in this chapter focus on
methods that produce significant savings but don’t involve a lot of time.
In other words, these strategies provide bang for the buck.
Finding the Keys to Successful Spending
For most people, spending money is a whole lot easier and more fun than
earning it. Far be it from me to tell you to stop having fun and turn into a penny-
pinching, stay-at-home miser. Of course you can spend money. But there’s a
world of difference between spending money carelessly and spending money
wisely.

If you spend too much and spend unwisely, you put pressure on your income
and your future need to continue working. Savings dwindle, debts may accu-
mulate, and you can’t achieve your financial goals.
If you dive into details too quickly, you may miss the big picture. So before I
jump into the specific areas where you can trim your budget, I give you my
four overall keys to successful spending. These four principles run through
my recommendations in this chapter.
Living within your means
Spending too much is a relative problem. Two people can each spend $40,000
per year yet still have drastically different financial circumstances. How?
Suppose that one of them earns $50,000 annually, while the other makes
$35,000. The $50,000 income earner saves $10,000 each year. The $35,000
wage earner, on the other hand, accumulates $5,000 of new debt (or spends
that amount from prior savings). Spend within your means.
Don’t let the spending habits of others dictate yours. Certain people — and
you know who they are — bring out the big spender in you. Do something
else with them besides shopping and spending. If you can’t find any other
activity to share with them, try shopping with limited cash and no credit
cards. That way, you can’t overspend on impulse.
How much you can safely spend while working toward your financial goals
depends on what your goals are and where you are financially. Chapter 4
assists you with figuring how much you should be saving and what you can
afford to spend to accomplish your financial goals.
Looking for the best values
You can find high quality and low cost in the same product. Conversely, paying
a high price is no guarantee that you’re getting high quality. Cars are a good
example. Whether you’re buying a subcompact, a sports car, or a luxury four-
door sedan, some cars are more fuel-efficient and cheaper to maintain than
rivals that carry the same sticker price.
When you evaluate the cost of a product or service, think in terms of total,
long-term costs. Suppose that you’re comparing the purchase of two used
cars: the Solid Sedan, which costs $11,995, and the Clunker Convertible,
which weighs in at $9,995. On the surface, the convertible appears to be
cheaper. However, the price that you pay for a car is but a small portion of
what that car ultimately costs you. If the convertible is costly to operate,
maintain, and insure over the years, it could end up costing you much more
than the sedan would have. Sometimes paying more upfront for a higher-
quality product or service ends up saving you money in the long run.
98
Part II: Saving More, Spending Less 

People who sell particular products and services may initially appear to have
your best interests at heart when they steer you toward something that isn’t
costly. However, you may be in for a rude awakening when you discover the
ongoing service, maintenance, and other fees you face in the years ahead.
Salespeople are generally trained to pitch you a lower-cost product if you
indicate that’s what you’re after.
Don’t waste money on brand names
You don’t want to compromise on quality, especially in the areas where qual-
ity is important to you. But you also don’t want to be duped into believing
that brand-name products are better or worth a substantially higher price.
Be suspicious of companies that spend gobs on image-oriented advertising.
Why? Because heavy advertising costs many dollars, and as a consumer of
those companies’ products and services, you pay for all that advertising.
All successful companies advertise their products. Advertising is cost-effective
and good business if it brings in enough new business. But you need to consider
the products and services and the claims that companies make.
Does a cola beverage really taste better if “it’s the real thing” or “the choice
of a new generation”? Consider all the silly labels and fluffy marketing of
beers. Blind taste testing demonstrates little if any difference between the
more expensive brand name products and the cheaper, less heavily adver-
tised ones.
Now, if you can’t live without your Coca-Cola or Pepsi and you think that
these products are head and shoulders above the rest, drink them to your
heart’s content. But question the importance of the name and image of the
products you buy. Companies spend a lot of money creating and cultivating
an image, which has zero impact on how their products taste or perform.
Branding is used in many fields to sell overpriced, mediocre products and
services to consumers. Take the lowly can of paint. Tests show some 
differences among different brands of paint. However, when you can buy
high-quality paints for about $20 a gallon, do you really think that a $100 can
of paint blessed with the name of Ralph Lauren or Martha Stewart is that
much better?
D/L Laboratories, a testing firm, compared these $100-per-gallon snooty
paints to $20-per-gallon high-quality alternatives and found little difference —
or at least no difference that was worth paying for. In fact, one of the
“gourmet” paints splattered more, had a less uniform sheen, didn’t cover the
surface as well, was more prone to run when applied, and emitted a high level
of volatile organic compounds! Some other snooty brands didn’t fare much
better. As people in the trade can tell you (thanks to computer-based match-
ing), if you find a particular color of paint you like in a highbrow line, match it
in a high-quality but far less costly line.

Chapter 6: Reducing Your Spending

Consumer Reports is a reputable publication that evaluates products and 
services based on quality and performance, not brand image. Consult it
on major consumer purchases.
Getting your money back
Take a look around your home for items you never use. Odds are you have
some (maybe even many). Returning such items to where you bought them
can be cathartic; it also reduces your home’s clutter and puts more money in
your pocket.
Also, think about the last several times you bought a product or service and
didn’t get what was promised. What did you do about it? Most people do
nothing and let the derelict company off the hook. Why? Here are some
common explanations for this type of behavior:
 Low standards: We’ve come to expect shoddy service and merchandise
because of the common lousy experiences we’ve had.
 Conflict avoidance: Most people shun confrontation. It makes us tense
and anxious, and it churns our stomachs.
 Hassle aversion: Most companies don’t make it easy for complainers to
get their money back or obtain satisfaction. To get restitution from some
companies, you need the tenacity and determination of a pit bull.
You can increase your odds of getting what you expect for your money by
doing business with companies that
 Have fair return policies: Don’t purchase any product or service until you
understand the company’s return policy. Be especially wary of buying from
companies that charge hefty “restocking” fees for returned merchandise
or simply don’t allow returns at all. Reputable companies offer full refunds
and don’t make you take store credit (although taking credit is fine if you’re
sure that you’ll use it soon and that the company will still be around).
 Can provide good references: Suppose that you’re going to install a
fence on your property, and as a result, you’re going to be speaking with
fencing contractors for the first time. You can sift out many inferior firms
by asking each contractor that you interview for at least three references
from people in your local area who have had a fence installed in the past
year or two.
 Are committed to the type of product or service they provide: Suppose
that your chosen fencing contractor does a great job, and now that you’re
in the market for new gutters on your home, the contractor says that he
does gutters, too. Although the path of least resistance would be to simply
100
Part II: Saving More, Spending Less 

hire the same contractor for your gutters, you should inquire about how
many gutters the contractor has installed and also interview some other
firms that specialize in such work. Because your fencing contractor may
have done only a handful of gutter jobs, he may not know as much about
such work.
Following these guidelines can greatly diminish your chances of having
unhappy outcomes with products or services you buy. And here’s another
important tip: Whenever possible, pay with a credit card if your credit’s in
good standing. Doing so enables you to dispute a charge within 60 days and
gives you leverage for getting your money back.
If you find that you’re unable to make progress when trying to get compensa-
tion for a lousy product or service, here’s what I recommend you do:
 Document. Taking notes whenever you talk to someone at a company
can help you validate your case down the road, should problems
develop. Obviously, the bigger the purchase and the more you have
at stake, the more carefully you should document what you’ve been
promised. In many cases, though, you probably won’t start carefully
noting each conversation until a conflict develops. Keep copies of com-
panies’ marketing literature, because such documents often make
promises or claims that companies fail to live up to in practice.
 Escalate. Some frontline employees either aren’t capable of resolving
disputes or lack the authority to do so. No matter what the cause, speak
with a department supervisor and continue escalating from there. If you’re
still not making progress, lodge a complaint to whatever state regulatory
agency (if any) oversees such companies. Also, be sure to tell your friends
and colleagues not to do business with the company (and let the company
know that you’re doing this until your complaint is resolved to your satis-
faction). Also consider contacting a consumer help group — these groups
are typically sponsored by broadcast or print media in metropolitan areas.
They can be helpful in resolving disputes or shining adverse publicity on
disreputable companies or products.
 Litigate. If all else fails, consider taking the matter to small claims court
if the company continues to be unresponsive. (Depending on the amount
of money at stake, this tactic may be worth your time.) The maximum
dollar limit that you may recover varies by state, but you’re usually lim-
ited to a few thousand dollars. For larger amounts than those allowed in
small claims court in your state, you can, of course, hire an attorney and
pursue the traditional legal channels — although you may end up throw-
ing away more of your time and money. Mediation and arbitration are
generally a better option than following through on a lawsuit.

Chapter 6: Reducing Your Spending

Eliminating the fat from your spending
If you want to reduce your overall spending by, say, 10 percent, you can just
cut all of your current expenditures by 10 percent. Or you can reach your 10-
percent goal by cutting some categories a lot and others not at all. You need
to set priorities and make choices about where you want and don’t want to
spend your money.

Recognizing the Better Business 
Bureau’s conflicts of interest
The Better Business Bureau (BBB) states that
its mission is “to promote and foster the highest
ethical relationship between businesses and
the public.” The reality of the typical consumer’s
experience of dealing with the BBB doesn’t live
up to the BBB’s marketing. BBBs are nonprofits
and are not agencies of any governmental body.
“They don’t go after local established 
businesses — they are funded by these same
businesses. The BBB certainly has a good public
relations image, better than what is warranted.
They don’t do all that much for consumers,”
says veteran consumer advocate Ralph Nader.
“It’s a business trade organization, and each local
BBB is basically independent like a franchise,”
says John Bear, an author of consumer advocacy
books, including Send This Jerk the Bedbug
Letter: How Companies, Politicians, and the
Mass Media Deal With Complaints & How to Be
a More Effective Complainer (Ten Speed Press).
“By and large, when somebody has a problem
with a company and they fill out a complaint
form with the BBB, if the company is a member
of the BBB, there’s ample evidence that con-
sumers often end up not being satisfied. The
BBB protects their members.”
Particularly problematic among the BBB’s pro-
business practices are the company reports the
BBB keeps on file. The BBB often considers a
legitimate complaint satisfactorily resolved even
when you’re quite unhappy and the company is
clearly not working to satisfy the problems for
which it’s responsible.
Bear also cites examples of some truly troubling
BBB episodes. In one case, he says that a diploma
mill (a company that sells degrees but provides
little if any education) in Louisiana was a member
of the local BBB. “When complaints started
coming in,” says Bear, “the BBB’s response was
always that the company met their standards
and that the complaints were resolved. The real-
ity was that the complaints weren’t satisfactorily
resolved and it took about two years until com-
plaints reached into the hundreds for the BBB
to finally cancel the diploma mill’s membership
and give out a bland statement about com-
plaints. Two months later, the FBI raided the
company. Millions of consumers’ dollars were
lost because the BBB didn’t do its job.”
The president of a South Florida BBB (the fifth
largest in the country, according to Bear) was
ultimately imprisoned for taking bribes from
companies in exchange for maintaining favor-
able reports on file.
The truth about some BBBs is unfortunate,
because as state consumer protection agencies
are being cut back and dissatisfied consumers
are being shunted to the BBB, more people are
in for unsatisfactory experiences with an orga-
nization that does not go to bat for them.

What you spend your money on is sometimes a matter of habit rather than a
matter of what you really want or value. For example, some people shop at
whatever stores are close to them.
Eliminating fat doesn’t necessarily mean cutting back on your purchases:
You can save money by buying in bulk. Some stores specialize in selling
larger packages or quantities of a product at a lower price because they save
money on the packaging and handling. If you’re single, shop with a friend and
split the bulk purchases.
Turning your back on consumer credit
As I discuss in Chapters 3 and 5, buying items that depreciate — such as
cars, clothing, and vacations — on credit is hazardous to your long-term
financial health. Buy only what you can afford today. If you’ll be forced to
carry a debt for months or years on end, you can’t really afford what you’re
buying on credit today.
Without a doubt, renting-to-own is the most expensive way to buy. Here’s how
it works: You see a huge ad blaring “$12.95 for a DVD player!” Well, the ad has
a big hitch: That’s $12.95 per week, for many weeks. When all is said and done
(and paid), buying a $100 DVD player through a rent-to-own store costs a typ-
ical buyer more than $375!
Welcome to the world of rent-to-own stores, which offer cash-poor consumers
the ability to lease consumer items and, at the end of the lease, an option
to buy.
If you think that paying an 18-percent interest rate on a credit card is expen-
sive, consider this: The effective interest rate charged on many rent-to-own
purchases exceeds 100 percent; in some cases, it may be 200 percent or
more! Renting-to-own makes buying on a credit card look like a great deal.
I’m not sharing this information to encourage you to buy on credit cards but
to point out what a rip-off renting-to-own is. Such stores prey on cashless
consumers who either can’t get credit cards or don’t understand how expen-
sive renting-to-own really is. Forget the instant gratification, and save a set
amount each week until you can afford what you want.
Consumer credit is expensive, and it reinforces a bad financial habit: spend-
ing more than you can afford.

Chapter 6: Reducing Your Spending

Budgeting to Boost Your Savings
When most people hear the word budgeting, they usually think unpleasant
thoughts — and like dieting, rightfully so. But budgeting can help you move
from knowing how much you spend on various things to successfully reduc-
ing your spending.
The first step in the process of budgeting, or planning your future spending,
is to analyze where your current spending is going (refer to Chapter 3).
After you do that, calculate how much more you’d like to save each month.
Then comes the hard part: deciding where to make cuts in your spending.
Suppose that you’re currently not saving any of your monthly income and
you want to save 10 percent for retirement. If you can save and invest
through a tax-sheltered retirement account — for example, a 401(k) or
403(b), or SEP-IRA or Keogh — you don’t actually need to cut your spending
by 10 percent to reach a savings goal of 10 percent (of your gross income).
When you contribute money to a tax-deductible retirement account, you
reduce your federal and state taxes. If you’re a moderate-income-earner
paying, say, 30 percent in federal and state taxes on your marginal income,
you actually need to reduce your spending by only 7 percent to save 10 per-
cent. The “other” 3 percent of the savings comes from the lowering of your
taxes. (The higher your tax bracket, the less you need to cut your spending
to reach a particular savings goal.)
So to boost your savings rate to 10 percent, go through your current spend-
ing category by category until you come up with enough proposed cuts to
reduce your spending by 7 percent. Make your cuts in the areas that will be
the least painful and where you’re getting the least value from your current
level of spending. (If you don’t have access to a tax-deductible retirement
account, budgeting still involves the same process of assessment and making
cuts in various spending categories.)
Another method of budgeting involves starting completely from scratch
rather than examining your current expenses and making cuts from that
starting point. Ask yourself how much you’d like to spend on different cate-
gories. The advantage of this approach is that it doesn’t allow your current
spending levels to constrain your thinking. You’ll likely be amazed at the dis-
crepancies between what you think you should be spending and what you
actually are spending in certain categories.

Reducing Your Spending: 
Eric’s Strategies
As you read through the following strategies for reducing your spending,
please keep in mind that some of these strategies will make sense for you and
some of them won’t. Start your spending reduction plan with the strategies
that come easily. Work your way through them. Keep a list of the options that
are more challenging for you — ones that may require more of a sacrifice but
be workable if necessary to achieve your spending and savings goals.
No matter which of the ideas in this chapter you choose, rest assured that
keeping your budget lean and mean pays enormous dividends. After you
implement a spending reduction strategy, you’ll reap the benefits for years
to come. Take a look at Figure 6-1: For every $1,000 that you shave from your
annual spending (that’s just $83 per month), check out how much more money
you’ll have down the road. (This chart assumes that you invest your new-
found savings in a tax-favored retirement account, you average 10 percent
per year returns on your investments, and you’re in a moderate combined
federal and state tax bracket of 35 percent — see Chapter 7 for information
on tax brackets.)

Chapter 6: Reducing Your Spending

Managing food costs
Not eating is one way to reduce food expenditures; however, this method
tends to make you weak and dizzy, so it’s probably not a viable long-term
strategy. The following culinary strategies can keep you on your feet — 
perhaps improve your health — and help you save money.
Eating out frugally
Eating meals out and getting takeout can be time-savers, but they rack up big
bills if done too often and too lavishly. Eating out is a luxury — think of it as
hiring someone to shop, cook, and clean up for you. Of course, some people
either hate to cook or don’t have the time, space, or energy to do much in the
kitchen. If this sounds like you, choose restaurants carefully and order from
the menu selectively.
Here are a couple tips for eating out:
 Avoid beverages, especially alcohol. Most restaurants make big profits
on beverages. Drink water instead. (Water is healthy, and it reduces the
likelihood that you’ll want a nap after a big meal.)
 Order vegetarian. Vegetarian dishes generally cost less than meat-based
entrees (and they’re generally better for you).
I don’t want to be a killjoy. I’m not saying that you should live on bread and
water. You can have dessert — heck, have some wine, too, for special occa-
sions! Just try not to eat dessert with every meal. Try eating appetizers and
dessert at home, where they’re a lot less expensive.
Eating healthy at home without spending a fortune
Obesity and unhealthy eating habits continue to be a big problem. The Surgeon
General’s Report on Nutrition and Health (produced under former U.S. Surgeon
General C. Everett Koop, M.D.) states that our reliance on a meat- and dairy-
based diet — with its unhealthy fat and cholesterol — is the cause of the
majority of premature deaths in the United States. In fact, five out of the top
ten causes of death — heart disease, certain types of cancer, stroke, diabetes,
and arteriosclerosis — are caused largely by Americans’ poor diets.
As evidenced by the preponderance of diet and weight loss books on health
book bestseller lists — and the growth of the natural and organic grocery
stores like Whole Foods and Trader Joe’s — Americans are trying to eat
healthier. Concerned about all the pesticides, antibiotics, and hormones that
end up in our food supply, organic food purchases are growing at 20 percent
annually.
106
Part II: Saving More, Spending Less 

Problem is, financially speaking, better quality food, especially organic foods,
can cost more, sometimes much more — but not always. A number of studies
I’ve seen demonstrate that highly processed foods, which are less nutritious
and worse for your health, can be as costly or even more expensive than fresh,
so-called whole foods. The key to not overspending on fresher, healthier, and
organic foods is to be flexible when you’re at the grocery store. Buy more of
what is currently less expensive, stock up on sale items that aren’t perish-
able, and buy more at stores like Trader Joe’s that have competitive pricing.
To find the Trader Joe’s nearest you, visit their Web site at www.traderjoes.
com or call 800-SHOPTJS (800-746-7857).
Joining a wholesale superstore
Superstores such as Costco and Sam’s Club enable you to buy groceries in
bulk at wholesale prices. And contrary to popular perception, you don’t have
to buy 1,000 rolls of toilet paper at once — just 24.
I performed price comparisons between wholesale superstores and retail gro-
cery stores and found that wholesalers charge about 30 percent less for the
exact same stuff — all without the hassle of clipping coupons or hunting for
which store has the best price on paper towels this month! (At these discount
prices, you only need to buy about $100 per year to recoup Costco and Sam’s
Club’s membership fees, which start at $30 per year.)
107
Chapter 6: Reducing Your Spending
Organic food worth spending for
According to a February 2006 study by Consumer
Reports, spending the money to buy organic
makes the most sense when buying the follow-
ing foods:
 Produce — apples, bell peppers, celery,
cherries, imported grapes, nectarines,
peaches, pears, potatoes, red raspberries,
spinach, and strawberries: “The U.S.
Department of Agriculture’s lab testing
reveals that even after washing, some fruits
and vegetables consistently carry much
higher levels of pesticide residue than
others.”
 Meat, poultry, eggs, and dairy: “You greatly
reduce the risk of exposure to the agent
believed to cause mad cow disease and
minimize exposure to other potential toxins
in nonorganic feed. You also avoid the results
of production methods that use daily supple-
mental hormones and antibiotics, which
have been linked to increased antibacterial
resistance in humans.”
 Baby food: “Children’s developing bodies
are especially vulnerable to toxins, and they
may be at risk of higher exposure. Baby
food is often made up of condensed fruits or
vegetables, potentially concentrating pesti-
cide residues.”

In addition to saving you lots of money, buying in bulk requires fewer shop-
ping trips. You’ll have more supplies around your humble abode — so you’ll
have less need to eat out (which is costly) or make trips (wasted time and
gasoline) to the local grocer, who may be really nice but charges the most.
Perishables run the risk of living up to their name, so don’t buy what you
can’t use. Repackage bulk packs into smaller quantities and store them in the
freezer if possible. If you’re single, shop with a friend or two and split the
order. Also, be careful when you shop at the warehouse clubs — you may be
tempted to buy things you don’t really need. These stores carry all sorts of
items, including the newest TVs, computers, furniture, clothing, complete
sets of baseball cards, and giant canisters of biscotti — so wallet and waist-
line beware! Try not to make impulse purchases, and be especially careful
when you have kids in tow.
To find a superstore near you, check your local phone directory. You can
also find a Costco store near you by visiting the Costco Web site at www.
costco.com or calling 800-774-2678. Sam’s Club is on the Internet at
www.samsclub.com.
Saving on shelter
Housing and all the costs associated with it (utilities, furniture, appliances,
and if you’re a homeowner, maintenance and repairs) can gobble a large
chunk of your monthly income. I’m not suggesting that you live in an igloo
or teepee (though they’re probably less costly), but people often overlook
opportunities to save money in this category.
Reducing rental costs
Rent can take up a sizable chunk of your monthly take-home pay. Many people
consider rent to be a fixed and inflexible part of their expenses, but it’s not.
Here’s what you can do to cut down your rental costs:
 Move to a lower-cost rental. Of course, a lower-cost rental may not be
as nice — it may be smaller, lack a private parking spot, or be located in
a less popular area. Remember that the less you spend renting, the more
you can save toward buying your own place. Just be sure to factor in all
the costs of a new location, including the possible higher commuting
costs.
 Share a rental. Living alone has some benefits, but financially speaking,
it’s a luxury. If you rent a larger place with roommates, your rental costs
will go way down, and you’ll get more home for your rental dollars.
You have to be in a sharing mood, though. Roommates can be a hassle
at times, but they can also be a plus — you get to meet all sorts of new
people, and you have someone else to blame when the kitchen’s a mess.
108
Part II: Saving More, Spending Less 

 Negotiate your rental increases. Every year, like clockwork, your landlord
bumps up your rent by a certain percentage. If your local rental market
is soft or your living quarters are deteriorating, stand up for yourself!
You have more leverage and power than you probably realize. A smart
landlord doesn’t want to lose good tenants who pay rent on time. Filling
vacancies takes time and money. State your case: You’ve been a respon-
sible tenant, and your research shows comparable rentals going for less.
Crying “poor” may help, too. At the very least, if you can’t stave off the
rent increase, maybe you can wrangle some improvements to the place.
 Buy rather than rent. Purchasing your own place can be costly, yes, but
in the long run, owning should be cheaper than renting, and you’ll have
something to show for it in the end. If you purchase real estate with a 30-
year fixed-rate mortgage, your mortgage payment (which is your biggest
ownership expense) remains constant. Only your property taxes, main-
tenance, and insurance costs are exposed to the vagaries of inflation.
As a renter, your entire monthly housing cost can rise with increases
in the cost of living (unless you’re the beneficiary of a rent-controlled
apartment). See Chapter 14 to find out how to buy real estate, even if
you’re short on cash.
Reducing homeowner expenses
As every homeowner knows, houses suck up money. You should be espe-
cially careful to watch your money in this area of your budget.
 Know what you can afford. Don’t make the mistake of overspending when
buying a home. Whether you’re on the verge of buying your first home
or trading up to a more costly property, crunch some realistic numbers
before you jump. When too little money is left over for your other needs
and wants — such as taking trips, eating out, enjoying hobbies, or saving
for retirement — your new dream house may become a financial prison.
Calculate how much you can afford to spend monthly on a home by fig-
uring your other needs first. (Doing the exercises in Chapter 3, on where
you’re spending your money, and Chapter 4, on saving for retirement,
can help you calculate the amount you can afford.)
Although real estate can be a good long-term investment, you can end
up pouring a large portion of your discretionary dollars into your home.
In addition to decorating and remodeling, some people feel the need to
trade up to a bigger home every few years. Of course, after they’re in
their new home, the remodeling and renovation cycle simply begins
again, which costs even more money. Appreciate what you have, and
remember that homes are for living in, not museums for display. If you
have children, why waste a lot of money on expensive furnishings that
take up valuable space and require you to constantly nag your kids to
tread carefully? And don’t covet — the world will always have people
with bigger houses and more toys than you.
109
Chapter 6: Reducing Your Spending

 Rent out a room. Because selling your home to buy a less expensive place
can be a big hassle, consider taking in a tenant (or charge those adult
“children” still living at home!) to reduce your housing expenses. Check out
the renter thoroughly: Get references, run a credit report, and talk about
ground rules and expectations before sharing your space. Don’t forget to
check with your insurance company to see whether your homeowner’s
policy needs adjustments to cover potential liability from renting.
 Refinance your mortgage. This step may seem like common sense,
but surprisingly, many people don’t keep up-to-date on mortgage rates.
If interest rates are lower than they were when you obtained your 
current mortgage, you may be able to save money by refinancing
(see Chapter 14 for more information).
 Appeal your property-tax assessment. If you bought your property
when housing prices were higher in your area than they are now, you
may be able to save money by appealing your assessment. Also, if you
live in an area where your assessment is based on how the local asses-
sor valued the property (rather than what you paid for your home),
your home may be overassessed.
Check with your local assessor’s office for the appeals procedure you
need to follow. You generally have to prove that your property is worth
less today than it was when you bought it or that the assessor incorrectly
valued your property. In the first case, an appraiser’s recent evaluation
of your property will do — you may already have one if you refinanced
your mortgage recently. In the latter case, review how the assessor valued
your property compared with similar ones nearby — mistakes happen.
 Reduce utility costs. Sometimes you have to spend money to save
money. Old refrigerators, for example, can waste a lot of electricity.
Insulate to save on heating and air-conditioning bills. Install water flow
regulators in shower heads and toilet bowls. When planting your yard,
don’t select water-guzzling plants, and keep your lawn area reasonable.
Even if you don’t live in an area susceptible to droughts, why waste
water (which isn’t free) unnecessarily? Recycle — recycling means less
garbage, which translates into lower trash bills (because you won’t be
charged for using larger garbage containers) and benefits the environ-
ment by reducing landfill.
Cutting transportation costs
America is a car-driven society. In most other countries, cars are a luxury.
More than 90 percent of the people in the rest of the world can’t afford a
new car. If more people in the United States thought of cars as a luxury,
110
Part II: Saving More, Spending Less 

Americans might have far fewer financial problems (and accidents). Not only
do cars pollute the air and clog the highways, but they also cost you a bundle.
Purchasing a quality car and using it wisely can save you money. Using other
transportation alternatives can also help you save.
Contrary to advertising slogans, cars aren’t built to last; manufacturers don’t
want you to stick with the same car year after year. New models are constantly
introduced with new features and styling changes. Getting a new set of wheels
every few years is an expensive luxury.
Don’t try to keep up with the Joneses as they show off their new cars every
year — for all you know, they’re running themselves into financial ruin just
trying to impress you. Let your neighbors admire you for your thriftiness and
wisdom instead.
Research before you buy a car
When you buy a car, you don’t just pay the initial sticker price: You also have
to pay for gas, insurance, registration fees, maintenance, and repairs. You may
also have to pay sales and/or personal property taxes. Don’t compare simple
sticker prices; think about the total, long-term costs of car ownership.
Speaking of total costs, remember that you’re also trusting your life to the
car. With about 40,000 Americans killed in auto accidents annually (about
half of which are caused by drunk drivers), safety should be an important
consideration as well. Air bags, for example, may save your life. The National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration Web site (www.nhtsa.gov) has lots of
crash test data, as well as information on other car safety issues.
Consumer Reports publishes a number of useful buying guides for new and
used cars. You find Consumer Reports on the Internet at www.consumer
reports.org. For you data jocks, IntelliChoice (www.intellichoice.com)
provides information about all categories of ownership costs, warranties, and
dealer costs for new cars, which are rated based on total ownership costs.
Edmunds (www.edmunds.com) provides more general information about dif-
ferent makes and models of both new and used cars. Please be aware that
these latter two sites have advertising and may receive referral fees if you
buy a car through a dealer their Web site refers you to.
Don’t lease, don’t borrow: Buy your car with cash
The main reason people end up spending more than they can afford on a car
is that they finance the purchase. As I discuss in Part I, you should avoid 
borrowing money for consumption purchases, especially for items that
depreciate in value (like cars). A car is most definitely not an investment.
111
Chapter 6: Reducing Your Spending

When buying a car, leasing is generally more expensive than borrowing money.
Leasing is like a long-term car rental. We all know how well rental cars get
treated — leased cars are treated just as well, which is one of the reasons
leasing is so costly.
Unfortunately, the practice of leasing cars or buying them on credit is
increasingly becoming the norm in our society. This approach is certainly
attributable to a lot of the misinformation that’s spread by car dealers and, in
some cases, the media. Consider the magazine article entitled “Rewards of
Car Leasing.” The article claims that leasing is a great deal when compared to
buying. Ads for auto dealers advertising auto leasing were placed next to the
article. The magazine, by the way, is free to subscribers — which means that
100 percent of its revenue comes from advertisers such as auto dealers. Also
be aware that because of the influence of advertising (and ignorance), leasing
is widely endorsed on Web sites that purport to provide information on cars.
“But I can’t buy a new car with cash,” you may be thinking. Some people feel
that it’s unreasonable of me to expect them to use cash to buy a new car, but
I’m trying to look out for your best long-term financial interests. Please con-
sider the following:
 If you lack sufficient cash to buy a new car, I say, “Don’t buy a new car!”
Most of the world’s population can’t even afford a car, let alone a new one!
Buy a car that you can afford — which for most people is a used one.
 Don’t fall for the rationale that says buying a used car means lots of main-
tenance, repair expenses, and problems. Do your homework and buy a
good quality used car (see the preceding section, “Research before you
buy a car.” That way, you can have the best of both worlds. A good used
car costs less to buy and, thanks to lower insurance costs (and possibly
property taxes), less to operate.
 A fancy car is not needed to impress people for business purposes. Some
people I know say that they absolutely must drive a nice, brand-spanking-
new car to set the right impression for business purposes. I’m not going
to tell you how to manage your career, but I will ask you to consider that
if clients and others see you driving an expensive new car, they may
think that you spend money wastefully or you’re getting rich off of them!
Replace high-cost cars
Maybe you realize by now that your car is too expensive to operate because
of insurance, gas, and maintenance costs. Or maybe you bought too much
car — people who lease or borrow money for a car frequently buy a far more
expensive car than they can realistically afford.
112
Part II: Saving More, Spending Less 

Dump your expensive car and get something more financially manageable.
The sooner you switch, the more money you’ll save. Getting rid of a car on a
lease is a challenge, but it can be done. I had one client who, when he lost his
job and needed to slash expenses, convinced the dealer (by writing a letter to
the owner) to take the leased car back.
Keep cars to a minimum
I’ve seen households that have one car per person — four people, four cars!
Some people have a “weekend” car that they use only on days off! For most
households, maintaining two or more cars is an expensive extravagance.
Try to find ways to make do with fewer cars.
You can move beyond the confines of owning a car by either carpooling or
riding buses or trains to work. Some employers give incentives for taking
public transit to work, and some cities and counties offer assistance for set-
ting up vanpools or carpools along popular routes. By leaving the driving to
someone else, you can catch up on reading or just relax on the way to and
from work. You also help reduce pollution.
When you’re considering the cost of living in different areas, don’t forget to
factor in commuting costs. One advantage of living close to work, or at least
close to public transit systems, is that you may be able to make do with fewer
cars (or no car at all) in your household.
Buy commuter passes
In many areas, you can purchase train, bus, or subway passes to help reduce
the cost of commuting. Many toll bridges also have booklets of tickets that
you can buy at a discount. Some booths don’t advertise that they offer these
plans (maybe as a strategy to help keep revenues up). Some areas even allow
before-tax dollars to be withheld from your paycheck to buy commuter passes.
Use regular unleaded gas
A number of studies have shown that “super-duper-ultrapremium” gasoline
is not worth the extra expense. But make sure that you buy gasoline that has
an octane rating recommended for your vehicle. Paying more for the higher
octane “premium” gasoline just wastes money. Your car won’t run better; you
just pay more for gas. Fill up your tank when you’re on a shopping trip to the
warehouse wholesalers (discussed earlier in this chapter). These superstores
are usually located in lower-cost areas, so the gas is often cheaper there, too.
Also, don’t use credit cards to buy your gas if you have to pay a higher price
to do so.
113
Chapter 6: Reducing Your Spending

Service your car regularly
Sure, servicing your car (for example, changing the oil every 5,000 miles)
costs money, but it saves you dough in the long run by extending the operat-
ing life of your car. Servicing your car also reduces the chance that your car
will crap out in the middle of nowhere, which requires a humongous towing
charge to a service station. Stalling on the freeway during peak rush hour and
having thousands of angry commuters stuck behind you is even worse.
Lowering your energy costs
Escalating energy prices remind all of us how much we depend upon and use
oil, electricity, and natural gas in our daily lives. There are a number of terrific
Web sites packed with suggestions and tips for how to lower your energy costs.
Before I present those to you, however, here are the basics:
 Drive fuel-efficient cars. If you’re safety minded, you know how danger-
ous driving can be and aren’t willing to risk your life driving a pint-size
vehicle just to get 50 miles per gallon. That said, you can drive safe cars
(see the section, “Research before you buy a car”) that are fuel-efficient.
 Be thrifty at home. Get all family members on the same page, without
driving them crazy, to turn off lights they don’t need. Turn down the
heat at night, which saves money and helps you sleep better, and turn
it down when no one is home. Hint: If people are walking around your
home during the winter with shorts on instead of wearing sweaters, it’s
time to turn the heat down!
 Service and maintain what you have. Anything that uses energy — from
your cars to your furnace — should be regularly serviced. For instance,
make sure you clean your filters.
 Investigate energy efficiency before you buy. This advice applies not
only to appliances but also to an entire home. Some builders are build-
ing energy efficiency into their new homes.
The following are my favorite energy information and tip Web sites:
 Alliance to Save Energy (www.powerisinyourhands.org)
This site includes home and business energy saving tips; utility, local,
and state incentive programs; and information about federal energy
tax credits.
 The Database of State Incentives for Renewable Energy (www.
dsireusa.org)
 U.S. Department of Energy’s Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy
Web site (www.eere.energy.gov/consumer)

Part II: Saving More, Spending Less 

Controlling clothing costs
Given the amount of money that some people spend on clothing and related
accessories, I’ve come to believe that people in nudist colonies must be great
savers! But you probably live among the clothed mainstream of society, so
here’s a short list of economical ideas:
 Avoid clothing that requires dry cleaning. When you buy clothing, try
to stick with cottons and machine-washable synthetics rather than wools
or silks that require dry cleaning. Check labels before you buy clothing.
 Don’t chase the latest fashions. Fashion designers and retailers are 
constantly working to tempt you to buy more. Don’t do it. Ignore publi-
cations that pronounce this season’s look. In most cases, you simply
don’t need to buy racks of new clothes or an entire new wardrobe every
year. If your clothes aren’t lasting at least ten years, you’re probably
tossing them before their time or buying clothing that isn’t very durable.
True fashion, as defined by what people wear, changes quite slowly.
In fact, the classics never go out of style. If you want the effect of a new
wardrobe every year, store last year’s purchases away next year and
then bring them out the year after. Or rotate your clothing inventory
every third year. Set your own fashion standards. Buy basic, and buy
classic — if you let fashion gurus be your guide, you’ll end up with the
biggest wardrobe in the poorhouse!
 Minimize accessories. Shoes, jewelry, handbags, and the like can gobble
large amounts of money. Again, how many of these accessory items do
you really need? The answer is probably very few, because each one
should last many years.
Go to your closet or jewelry box and tally up the loot. What else could you
have done with all that cash? Do you see things you regret buying or forgot
you even had? Don’t make the same mistake again. Have a garage sale if you
have a lot of stuff that you don’t want. Return recent unused purchases to
stores.
Repaying your debt
In Chapter 5, I discuss strategies for reducing the cost of carrying consumer
debt. The best way to reduce the costs of such debt is to avoid it in the first
place when you’re making consumption purchases. You can avoid consumer
debt by eliminating your access to credit or by limiting your purchase of con-
sumer items to what you can pay off each month. Remember, borrow only for
long-term investments (see Chapter 2 for more information).
115
Chapter 6: Reducing Your Spending

Don’t keep a credit card that charges you an annual fee, especially if you pay
your balance in full each month. Many no-fee credit cards exist — and some
even offer you a benefit for using them:
 Discover Card (800-347-2683) rebates up to 1 percent of purchases in cash.
 GM Card (800-846-2273) gives credits worth 5 percent of your charges that
can be used toward the purchase of most GM-manufactured vehicles.
 AFBA (800-776-2265) offers a basic no-fee card.
 USAA Federal Savings (800-922-9092) offers a basic no-fee card.
You should consider the cards in the preceding list only if you pay your bal-
ance in full each month, because no-fee cards typically levy high interest
rates for balances carried month-to-month. The small rewards that you earn
really won’t do you much good if they’re negated by interest charges.
If you have a credit card that charges an annual fee, try calling the company
and saying that you want to cancel the card because you can get a competi-
tor’s card without an annual fee. Many banks will agree to waive the fee on
the spot. Some require you to call back yearly to cancel the fee — a hassle
that can be avoided by getting a true no-fee card.
Some cards that charge an annual fee and offer credits toward the purchase
of a specific item, such as a car or airline ticket, may be worth your while if
you pay your bill in full each month and charge $10,000 or more annually.
Note: Be careful — you may be tempted to charge more on a card that rewards
you for more purchases. Spending more in order to rack up bonuses defeats
the purpose of the credits.
Indulging responsibly 
in fun and recreation
Having fun and taking time out for R and R can be money well spent. But when
it comes to fun and recreation, financial extravagance can wreck an otherwise
good budget.
Entertainment
If you adjust your expectations, entertainment doesn’t have to cost a great
deal of money. Many movies, theaters, museums, and restaurants offer dis-
count prices on certain days and times.
116
Part II: Saving More, Spending Less 

Cultivate some interests and hobbies that are free or low-cost. Visiting with
friends, hiking, reading, and playing sports can be good for your finances as
well as your health.
Vacations
For many people, vacations are a luxury. For others, regular vacations are
essential parts of their routine. Regardless of how you recharge your batter-
ies, remember that vacations are not investments, so you shouldn’t borrow
through credit cards to finance your travels. After all, how relaxed will you
feel when you have to pay all those bills?
Try taking shorter vacations that are closer to home. Have you been to a
state or national park recently? Take a vacation at home, visiting the sites in
your local area. Great places that you’ve always wanted to see but haven’t
visited for one reason or another are probably located within 200 miles of
you. Or you may want to just block out some time and do what my cats do:
Take lots of naps and relax around your home.
If you do travel a long way to a popular destination, travel during the off-season
for the best deals on airfares and hotels. Keep an eye out for discounts and
“bought-but-unable-to-use” tickets advertised in your local paper. The Consumer
Reports Travel newsletter and numerous Web sites such as www.priceline.
com, www.expedia.com, and www.travelocity.com can help you find
low-cost travel options as well. Senior citizens generally qualify for special
fares at most airlines — ask the airline what programs it offers.
Also, be sure to shop around, even when working with a travel agent. Travel
agents work on commission, so they may not work hard to find you the best
deals. Tour packages, when they meet your interests and needs, can also
save you money. If you have flexible travel plans, courier services can cut
your travel costs significantly (but make sure that the company is reputable).
Using thrift with gifts
Think about how you approach buying gifts throughout the year — especially
during the holidays. I know people who spend so much on their credit cards
during the December holidays that it takes them until late spring or summer
to pay their debts off!
Although I don’t want to deny your loved ones gifts from the heart — or deny
you the pleasure of giving them — spend wisely. Homemade gifts are less
costly to the giver and may be dearer to recipients. Many children actually
love durable, classic, basic toys. If the TV commercials dictate your kids’
desires, it may be time to toss the TV or set better rules for what the kids are
allowed to watch. Use TiVo or similar services to record desired shows so
you can zap through the ubiquitous commercials.
117
Chapter 6: Reducing Your Spending

Some people forget their thrifty shopping habits when gift buying, perhaps
because they don’t like to feel cheap when buying a gift. As with other pur-
chases you make, paying careful attention to where and what you buy can
save you significant dollars. Don’t make the mistake of equating the value of a
gift with its dollar cost.
And here’s a good suggestion for getting rid of those old, unwanted gifts: One
of the most entertaining holiday parties I’ve ever attended involved a white
elephant gift exchange: Everyone brought a wrapped, unwanted gift from the
past and exchanged it with someone else. After the gifts were opened, trading
was allowed. (Just be sure not to bring a gift that was given to you by any of
the exchange participants!) Can’t be bothered with this? Consider donating
unwanted items for a tax write-off if you itemize on Schedule A — see Chapter 7.
Lowering your phone bills
Thanks to increased competition and technology, telephoning costs are
falling. If you haven’t looked for lower rates recently, you’re probably paying
more than you need to for quality phone service. Unfortunately, shopping
among the many service providers is difficult. Plans come with different
restrictions, minimums, and bells and whistles. Here are my recommenda-
tions for saving on your phone bills:
 Look at your phone company’s other calling plans. You may have to
switch companies to reduce your bill, but I find that many people can
save significantly with their current phone company simply by getting
onto a better calling plan. So before you spend hours shopping around,
contact your current local and long distance providers and ask them
which of their calling plans offer the lowest cost for you based on the
patterns of your calls.
 Get help when shopping for other providers. Two useful sources are
Consumer Reports (800-234-1645; www.consumerreports.org) and
Telecommunications Research & Action Center, or TRAC (www.trac.org).
The cell phone business is booming. And although being able to make calls
from wherever you are can be enormously convenient, you can spend a lot of
money for service given the myriad of extra charges. On the other hand, if
you’re able to take advantage of the free minutes many plans offer (on week-
ends, for example), a good cell phone service can save you money. Here’s
how to get your money’s worth:
118
Part II: Saving More, Spending Less 

 Question the need for a cell phone. Okay, I realize that this is a risky
point to raise for those cell phone addicts among us. If you enjoy having
a cell phone to use during downtime when commuting or for emergency
purposes, I won’t try to talk you out of your cell phone. However, many
people really don’t need a cell phone (or one for which they’re paying
for lots of minutes). And some folks find that always being available
raises their stress level.
 Shop around. Make sure you sign up with the best calling plan and car-
rier given your typical usage. Consumer Reports and TRAC (see previous
list) can also help you research wireless phone services. Reputable car-
riers let you test out their service. They also offer full refunds if you’re
not satisfied after a week or two of service.
A thoughtful letter is usually cheaper, more appreciated, and longer lasting
than a phone call. Just block out an hour, grab a pen and paper, and redis-
cover the lost art form of letter writing. Formulating your thoughts on paper
can be clarifying and therapeutic. Computer users may find that they can
also save money by sending e-mail.
Technology: Spending wisely
Today, we’ve got e-mail, cell phones, voice mail, BlackBerries, satellite TV,
the Internet, and too many other ways to stay in touch and entertained 24/7.
Visit a store that sells electronics, and you’ll find no end to new gadgets.
Although I enjoy choices and convenience as much as the next person, I also
see the detrimental impact these technologies have on our families’ lives.
As it is, most families struggle to find quality time together given their work
obligations, long school days, and various other activities. At home, all these
technology choices and options compete for attention and often pull families
apart. The cost for all these services and gadgets adds up, leading to a con-
tinued enslavement to our careers.
Err on the side of keeping your life simple. Doing so costs less, reduces
stress, and allows more time for the things that really do matter in life.
Especially when it comes to new technology and gadgets, don’t be among the
first to get something. HDTV is a good example why — in the early years, these
new sets were extremely costly and more prone to problems. Now, prices are
coming down and sets are more reliable.
119
Chapter 6: Reducing Your Spending

The worst way to shop for electronics and technology-based products is to
wander around stores selling lots of these goods and having a salesperson
pitch you things. These folks are trained in what buttons to push to get
you to whip out your VISA card and be on your way with things you don’t
know how you ever could’ve lived without. Educate yourself and determine
what you really need instead of going to a store and being seduced by a 
salesperson.
Read articles — Consumer Reports is a very objective publication. CNET (www.
cnet.com) is a useful source, and along with Froogle (froogle.google.com),
it provides comparison shopping help after you decide to get serious about
trying to buy something specific.
Curtailing personal care costs
You have to take care of yourself, but as with anything else, you can find
ways to do it that are expensive, and you can find ways that save you money.
Try this money-saving advice:
 Hair care: Going bald is one way to save money in this category. I’m work-
ing on this one myself. In the meantime, if you have hair to be trimmed, a
number of no-frills, low-cost, hair-cutting joints can do the job. Supercuts
is one of the larger hair care chains. You may insist that your stylist is
the only one who can manage your hair the way you like it. At the prices
charged by some of the trendy hair places, you have to really adore what
they do to justify the cost. Consider going periodically to a no-frills stylist
for maintenance after getting a fabulous cut at a more expensive place.
If you’re daring, you can try getting your hair cut at a local training school.
For parents of young children, buying a simple-to-use home haircutting
electric shaver (such as Wahl’s) can be a great time and money saver —
no more agonizing trips with little ones to have their hair cut by a
“stranger.” The kit pays for itself after just two haircuts!
 Other personal-care services: As long as I’m on the subject of outward
beauty, I have to say that, in my personal opinion, the billions spent
annually on cosmetics are largely a waste of money (not to mention all
the wasted time spent applying and removing it). Women look fine with-
out makeup. (In most cases, they look better.) And having regular facials,
pedicures, and manicures can add up quickly.
 Health club expenses: Money spent on exercise is almost always money
well spent. But you don’t have to belong to a trendy club to receive the
benefits of exercise. If you belong to a gym or club for the social scene
(whether for dating or business purposes), you have to judge whether
it’s worth the cost.
120
Part II: Saving More, Spending Less 

Local schools, colleges, and universities often have tennis courts, run-
ning tracks, swimming pools, basketball courts, and exercise rooms, and
they may provide instruction as well. Community centers offer fitness
programs and classes, too. Metropolitan areas that have lots of health
clubs undoubtedly have the widest range of options and prices. Note:
When figuring the cost of membership, be sure to factor in the cost of
travel to and from the clubs, as well as any parking costs (and the realis-
tic likelihood of going there regularly to work out).
Don’t forget that healthy exercise can be done indoors or out, free of
charge. Isn’t hiking in the park at sunset more fun than pedaling away on
a stationary bike, anyway? You may want to buy some basic gym equip-
ment for use at home. Be careful, though: Lots of rowing machines and
free weights languish in a closet after their first week at home.
Paring down professional expenses
Accountants, lawyers, and financial advisors can be worth their expense if
they’re good. But be wary of professionals who create or perpetuate work
and have conflicts of interest with their recommendations.
Make sure that you get organized before meeting with a professional for tax,
legal, or financial advice. Do some background research to evaluate their
strengths and biases. Set goals and estimate fees in advance so you know
what you’re getting yourself into.
Computer and printed resources (see Chapters 19 and 20) can be useful, 
low-cost alternatives and supplements to hiring professionals.
Looking for value in publication 
subscriptions
Everyone has a favorite and not-so-favorite publication. Some people don’t
realize how much they spend on publications, partly because they never tally
up the cost.
Take The New York Times, for example. (Actually, consider not taking it.)
At $9.70 per week in the New York metro area and $11.90 per week elsewhere,
you pay a whopping $504 or $619 per year! Most areas have decent newspa-
pers that cost a fraction of these amounts. You can also keep up with news
and events through weekly news magazines such as Newsweek — which
costs just $40 per year for new subscribers.
121
Chapter 6: Reducing Your Spending

If you were to take the money that you’re spending on The New York Times
and invest it in a retirement account that earns a mere 10 percent per year, in
25 years you’d have about $74,000 (New York metro subscribers) or about
$93,000 (everyone else in the country)! And this example assumes that the
subscription prices won’t increase every year, which they always do. After
seeing these figures, you’d really have to feel that you’re getting good value
from The New York Times to keep subscribing!
Free publications are often driven by advertisers, so I don’t encourage you to
load up on them. But take a close look at the total amount you spend on pub-
lications and how much each one costs. Keep the ones that you’re getting
sufficient value from and cancel the rest. You can always read them at your
local library.
Managing medical expenses
Health care is a big topic nowadays. The cost of health care is going up fast.
Your health insurance — if you have health insurance, that is — probably
covers most of your health-care needs. (Chapter 16 explains how to shop for
health insurance.) But many plans require you to pay for certain expenses
out of your own pocket.
Medical care and supplies are like any other services and products — prices
and quality vary. And medicine in the United States, like any other profession,
is a business. A conflict of interest exists whenever the person recommending
treatment benefits financially from providing that treatment. Many studies
have documented some of the unnecessary surgeries and medical procedures
that have resulted from this conflict of interest.
Remember to shop around when seeking health insurance. Don’t take any
one physician’s advice as gospel. Always get a second opinion for any major
surgery. Most health insurance plans, out of economic self-interest, require a
second opinion, anyway.
Therapy can be useful and even lifesaving. Have a frank talk with your thera-
pist about how much total time and money you can expect to spend and
what kind of results you can expect to receive. As with any professional ser-
vice, a competent therapist gives you a straight answer if he or she is looking
out for your psychological and financial well-being.
122
Part II: Saving More, Spending Less 

Alternative medicine (holistic, for example) is gaining attention because of
its focus on preventive care and the treatment of the whole body or person.
Although alternative medicine can be dangerous if you’re in critical condi-
tion, alternative treatment for many forms of chronic pain or disease may be
worth investigating. Alternative medicine may lead to better and lower-cost
health care.
If you have to take certain drugs on an ongoing basis and pay for them out-of-
pocket, ordering through a mail-order company can bring down your costs
and help make refilling your prescriptions more convenient. Your health plan
should be able to provide more information about this option.
Examine your employer’s benefit plans. Take advantage of being able to put
away a portion of your income before taxes to pay for out-of-pocket health-
care expenses. Make sure that you pay close attention to the “use it or lose
it” provisions of each plan.
Eliminating costly addictions
Human beings are creatures of habit. We all have habits we wish we didn’t
have, and breaking those habits can be very difficult. Costly habits are the
worst. The following tidbits may nudge you in the right direction toward
breaking your own financially-draining habits.
 Kick the smoking habit. Despite the decline in smoking over the past few
decades, about one in four Americans still smokes. The smokeless tobacco
habit, which also causes long-term health problems, is on the increase.
Americans spend more than $50 billion annually on tobacco products —
that’s a staggering $1,000 per year per tobacco user. The increased medical
costs and the costs of lost work time are even greater, as they’re estimated
at more than $50 billion every year. (Of course, if you continue to smoke,
you may eliminate the need to save for retirement.)
Check with local hospitals for smoking-cessation programs. The American
Lung Association (check your local phone directory) also offers Freedom
from Smoking clinics around the country. The National Cancer Institute
(800-422-6237, or 800-4CANCER) and the Office on Smoking and Health at
the Centers for Disease Control (1600 Clifton Road, Atlanta, GA 30333;
770-488-5703) offer free information guides that contain effective methods
for stopping smoking.
123
Chapter 6: Reducing Your Spending

 Stop abusing alcohol and other drugs. Nearly one million Americans
seek treatment annually for alcoholism or drug abuse. These addictive
behaviors, like spending, transcend all educational and socioeconomic
lines in our society. Even so, studies have demonstrated that only one in
seven alcohol or drug abusers seek help. Three of the ten leading causes
of death — cirrhosis of the liver, accidents, and suicides — are associated
with excessive alcohol consumption.
The National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information (800-729-
6686) can refer you to local treatment programs such as Alcoholics
Anonymous. It also provides pamphlets and other literature about
the various types of substance abuse. The National Substance Abuse
Information and Treatment Hotline (800-662-4357, or 800-662-HELP) can
refer you to local drug treatment programs. It provides literature as well.
 Don’t gamble. The house always comes out ahead in the long run. Why
do you think so many governments run lotteries? Because governments
make money on people who gamble, that’s why.
Casinos, horse and dog racetracks, and other gambling establishments are
sure long-term losers for you. So, too, is the short-term trading of stocks,
which isn’t investing but gambling. Getting hooked on the dream of win-
ning is easy. And sure, occasionally you win a little bit (just enough to keep
you coming back). Every now and then, a few folks win a lot. But your hard-
earned capital mostly winds up in the pockets of the casino owners.
If you gamble just for the entertainment, take only what you can afford to
lose. Gamblers Anonymous (213-386-8789; www.gamblersanonymous.
org) helps those for whom gambling has become an addiction.
Keeping an eye on insurance premiums
Insurance is a vast minefield. In Part IV, I explain the different types of cover-
age, suggest what to buy and avoid, and detail how to save on policies.
The following list explains the most common ways people waste money
on insurance:
 Keeping low deductibles. The deductible is the amount of a loss that must
come out of your pocket. For example, if you have an auto insurance
policy with a $100 collision deductible and you get into an accident, you
pay for the first $100 of damage and your insurance company picks up
the rest. Low deductibles, however, translate into much higher premi-
ums for you. In the long run, you save money with a higher deductible,
even when factoring in the potential for greater out-of-pocket costs to
124
Part II: Saving More, Spending Less 

you when you do have a claim. Insurance should protect you from eco-
nomic disaster. Don’t get carried away with a really high deductible,
which can cause financial hardship if you have a claim and lack savings.
If you have a lot of claims, you won’t come out ahead with lower
deductibles, because your insurance premiums will escalate. Plus, low
deductibles mean more claim forms to file for small losses (creating
more hassle). Filing an insurance claim is usually not an enjoyable or
quick experience.
 Covering small potential losses or unnecessary needs. You shouldn’t
buy insurance for anything that won’t be a financial catastrophe if you
have to pay for it out of your own pocket. Although the postal service
isn’t perfect, insuring inexpensive gifts sent in the mail isn’t worth the
price. Buying dental or home warranty plans, which also cover relatively
small potential expenditures, doesn’t make financial sense for the same
reason. And if no one’s dependent on your income, you don’t need life
insurance either. (Who’ll be around to collect when you’re gone?)
 Failing to shop around. Rates vary tremendously from insurer to insurer.
In Part IV, I recommend the best companies to call for quotes and other
cost-saving strategies.
Trimming your taxes
Taxes are probably one of your largest — if not the largest — expenditures.
(So why is it last here? Read on to find out.)
Retirement savings plans are one of the best and simplest ways to reduce your
tax burden. (I explain more about retirement savings plans in Chapter 11.)
Unfortunately, most people can’t take full advantage of these plans because
they spend everything they make. So not only do they have less savings, but
they also pay higher income taxes — a double whammy.
I’ve attended many presentations where a fast-talking investment guy in an
expensive suit lectures about the importance of saving for retirement and
explains how to invest your savings. Yet details and tips about finding the
money to save (the hard part for most people) are left to the imagination.
In order to take advantage of the tax savings that come through retirement
savings plans, you must first spend less than you earn. Only then can you
afford to contribute to these plans. That’s why the majority of this chapter is
about strategies to reduce your spending.
125
Chapter 6: Reducing Your Spending

Reduced sales tax is another benefit of spending less and saving more.
When you buy most consumer products, you pay sales tax. Therefore, when
you spend less money and save more in retirement accounts, you reduce
your income and sales taxes. (See Chapter 7 for detailed tax-reduction 
strategies.)

You pay a lot of money in taxes — probably more than you realize. Believe
it or not, few people know just how much they pay in taxes each year.
Most people remember only whether they received a refund or owed money
on their return. But when you file your tax return, all you’re doing is settling
up with tax authorities over the amount of taxes you paid during the year
versus the total tax that you owe based on your income and deductions.
Understanding the Taxes You Pay
Some people feel lucky when they get a refund, but all a refund really indicates
is that you overpaid in taxes during the year. You should have had this money
in your own account all along. If you’re consistently getting big refunds, you
need to pay less tax throughout the year. (Fill out a simple tax form, the W-4,
to determine how much you should be paying in taxes throughout the year.
You can obtain a W-4 through your employer’s payroll department. If you’re
self-employed, you can obtain Form 1040-ES by calling the IRS at 800-TAX-FORM
[800-829-3676] or visiting its Web site at www.irs.gov. Also, the IRS Web site
has a helpful “withholding calculator” at www.irs.gov/individuals/
article/0,,id=96196,00.html.)

Instead of focusing on whether you’re going to get a refund when you com-
plete your annual tax return, you should concentrate on the total taxes you
pay, which I discuss in the following section.
Focusing on the total taxes you pay
To find out the total taxes you pay, you need to get out your federal and state
tax returns. On each of those returns is a line that shows the total tax: This is
line 71 on the most recent federal 1040 returns. If you add up the totals from
your federal and state tax returns, you’ll probably see one of your largest
expenses.
The goal of this chapter is to help you legally and permanently reduce the
total taxes you pay. Understanding the tax system is the key to reducing
your tax burden — if you don’t, you’ll surely pay more taxes than necessary.
Your tax ignorance can lead to mistakes, which can be costly if the IRS and
state government catch your underpayment errors. With the proliferation of
computerized information and data tracking, discovering mistakes has never
been easier.
The tax system, like other public policy, is built around incentives to encourage
desirable behavior and activity. Home ownership, for example, is considered
desirable because it encourages people to take more responsibility for main-
taining buildings and neighborhoods. Clean, orderly neighborhoods are often
the result of home ownership. Therefore, the government offers all sorts of
tax perks, which I discuss later in this chapter, to encourage people to buy
homes.
Not all people follow the path the government encourages — after all, it’s a
free country. However, the fewer desirable activities you engage in, the more
you pay in taxes. If you understand the options, you can choose the ones that
meet your needs as you approach different stages of your financial life.
Recognizing the importance 
of your marginal tax rate
When it comes to taxes, not all income is treated equally. This fact is far from
self-evident. If you work for an employer and earn a constant salary during
the course of a year, a steady and equal amount of federal and state taxes is
deducted from each paycheck. Thus, it appears as though all that earned
income is being taxed equally.
128
Part II: Saving More, Spending Less 

In reality, however, you pay less tax on your first dollars of earnings and more
tax on your last dollars of earnings. For example, if you’re single and your tax-
able income (see the next section) totals $45,000 during 2006, you pay federal
tax at the rate of 10 percent on the first $7,550 of taxable income, 15 percent
on income between $7,550 and $30,650, and 25 percent on income from
$30,650 up to $45,000.

Your marginal tax rate is the rate of tax you pay on your last, or so-called 
highest, dollars of income. In the example of a single person with taxable
income of $45,000, that person’s federal marginal tax rate is 25 percent.
In other words, she effectively pays 25 percent federal tax on her last dollars
of income — those dollars in excess of $30,650.
Marginal tax rates are a powerful concept. Your marginal tax rate allows you
to quickly calculate the additional taxes you’d have to pay on additional
income. Conversely, you can delight in quantifying the amount of taxes you
save by reducing your taxable income, either by decreasing your income or
by increasing your deductions.
As you’re probably already painfully aware, you pay not only federal income
taxes but also state income taxes — that is, unless you live in one of the
handful of states (Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Texas, Washington,
or Wyoming) that have no state income tax. Note: Some states, such as New
Hampshire, don’t tax employment but do tax other income, such as income
from investments.
129
Chapter 7: Taming Taxes

Your total marginal rate includes your federal and state tax rates (not to men-
tion local income tax rates in the municipalities that have it).
You can look up your state tax rate in your current state income tax prepara-
tion booklet.
Defining taxable income
Taxable income is the amount of income on which you actually pay income
taxes. (In the sections that follow, I explain strategies for reducing your tax-
able income.) The following reasons explain why you don’t pay taxes on your
total income:
 Not all income is taxable. For example, you pay federal tax on the inter-
est you earn on a bank savings account but not on the interest you earn
from municipal bonds. As discussed later in this chapter, some income,
such as from stock dividends and long-term capital gains, is taxed at
lower rates. (For info on how the tax system creates incentives, see
“Focusing on the total taxes you pay,” earlier in this chapter.)
 You get to subtract deductions from your income. Some deductions are
available just for being a living, breathing human being. In 2006, single
people get an automatic $5,150 standard deduction, and married couples
filing jointly get $10,300. (People over age 65 and those who are blind get
a slightly higher deduction.) Other expenses, such as mortgage interest
and property taxes, are deductible in the event that these so-called item-
ized deductions exceed the standard deductions. When you contribute
to qualified retirement plans, you also effectively get a deduction.
Being mindful of the second tax system:
Alternative minimum tax
You may find this hard to believe, but a second tax system actually exists
(as if the first tax system weren’t already complicated enough). This second
system may raise your taxes even higher than they would normally be.
I’ll explain while you reach for some aspirin.
Over the years, as the government grew hungry for more revenue, taxpayers
who slashed their taxes by claiming lots of deductions or exclusions from
taxable income came under greater scrutiny. So the government created a
second tax system — the alternative minimum tax (AMT) — to ensure that
those with high deductions or exclusions pay at least a certain percentage
of taxes on their incomes.
130
Part II: Saving More, Spending Less 

If you have a lot of deductions or exclusions from state income taxes, real
estate taxes, certain types of mortgage interest, and passive investments
(for example, rental real estate), you may fall prey to AMT. You may also get
tripped up by AMT if you exercise certain types of stock options.
AMT restricts you from claiming certain deductions and requires you to add
back in income that is normally tax-free (like certain municipal-bond inter-
est). So you have to figure your tax under the AMT system and under the
other system and then pay whichever amount is higher. I hope that aspirin is
starting to kick in.
Trimming Employment Income Taxes
You’re supposed to pay taxes on income you earn from work. Countless illegal
ways are available to reduce your employment income — for example, not
reporting it — but if you use them, you can very well end up paying a heap
of penalties and extra interest charges on top of the taxes you owe. And you
may even get tossed in jail. Because I don’t want you to serve jail time or lose
even more money by paying unnecessary penalties and interest, this section
focuses on the legal ways to reduce your taxes.
Contributing to retirement plans
A retirement plan is one of the few painless and completely legal ways to
reduce your taxable employment income. Besides reducing your taxes, 
retirement plans help you build up a nest egg so that you don’t have to
work for the rest of your life.
You can deduct money from your taxable income by tucking it away in
employer-based retirement plans, such as 401(k) or 403(b) accounts, or self-
employed retirement plans, such as SEP-IRAs or Keoghs. If your combined
federal and state marginal tax rate is, say, 33 percent and you contribute
$1,000 to one of these plans, you reduce your federal and state taxes by $330.
Do you like the sound of that? How about this: Contribute another $1,000, and
your taxes drop another $330 (as long as you’re still in the same marginal tax
rate). And when your money is inside a retirement account, it can compound
and grow without taxation.
Many people miss this great opportunity for reducing their taxes because
they spend all (or too much) of their current employment income and, there-
fore, have nothing (or little) left to put into a retirement account. If you’re
in this predicament, you need to reduce your spending before you can con-
tribute money to a retirement plan. (Chapter 6 explains how to decrease
your spending.)
131
Chapter 7: Taming Taxes

If your employer doesn’t offer the option of saving money through a retire-
ment plan, see whether you can drum up support for it. Lobby the benefits
and human resources departments. If they resist, you may want to add this to
your list of reasons for considering another employer. Many employers offer
this valuable benefit, but some don’t. Some company decision-makers either
don’t understand the value of these accounts or feel that they’re too costly to
set up and administer.
If your employer doesn’t offer a retirement savings plan, individual retirement
account (IRA) contributions may or may not be tax-deductible, depending on
your circumstances. You should first exhaust contributions to the previously
mentioned tax-deductible accounts. Chapter 11 can help you determine
whether you should contribute to an IRA, what type you should contribute
to, and whether your IRA contributions are tax-deductible.
Married couples filing jointly with adjusted gross incomes (AGIs) of less than
$50,000 and single taxpayers with an AGI of less than $25,000 can earn a new
tax credit for retirement account contributions. (For info on how the AGI is
calculated, see “Deducting miscellaneous expenses.”) Unlike a deduction, a
tax credit directly reduces your tax bill by the amount of the credit. This credit,
which is detailed in Table 7-2, is a percentage of the first $2,000 contributed
(or $4,000 on a joint return). The credit is not available to those under the
age of 18, full-time students, or people who are claimed as dependents on
someone else’s tax return.

Shifting some income
Income shifting, which has nothing to do with money laundering, is a more
esoteric tax-reduction technique that’s an option only to those who can con-
trol when they receive their income.

Part II: Saving More, Spending Less 

For example, suppose that your employer tells you in late December that
you’re eligible for a bonus. You’re offered the option to receive your bonus in
either December or January. If you’re pretty certain that you’ll be in a higher
tax bracket next year, you should choose to receive your bonus in December.
Or suppose that you run your own business and you think that you’ll be in a
lower tax bracket next year. Perhaps you plan to take time off to be with a
newborn or take an extended trip. You can send out some invoices later in
the year so that your customers won’t pay you until January, which falls in
the next tax year.
Increasing Your Deductions
Deductions are amounts you subtract from your income after totaling your
taxable income and before calculating the tax you owe. To make things
more complicated, the IRS gives you two methods for determining your total
deductions. The good news is that you get to pick the method that leads to
greater deductions — and hence, lower taxes.
Choosing standard or itemized deductions
The first method for figuring deductions requires no thinking or calculating.
If you have a relatively uncomplicated financial life, taking the so-called stan-
dard deduction is generally the better option. (Earning a high income; renting
your house or apartment; and having unusually large expenses from medical
bills, moving, charitable contributions, or loss due to theft or catastrophe are
not symptoms of a simple tax life.)
As I mention earlier in this chapter, single folks qualify for a $5,150 standard
deduction, and married couples filing jointly get a $10,300 standard deduc-
tion in 2006. If you’re 65 or older, or blind, you get a slightly higher standard
deduction.
Itemizing your deductions on your tax return is the other method for deter-
mining your allowable deductions. This method is definitely more of a hassle,
but if you can tally up more than the standard amounts noted in the preced-
ing section, itemizing will save you money. Use Schedule A of IRS Form 1040
for summing up your itemized deductions.
133
Chapter 7: Taming Taxes

Even if you take the standard deduction, take the time to peruse all the line
items on Schedule A to familiarize yourself with the many legal itemized
deductions. Figure out what’s possible to deduct so you can make more-
informed financial decisions year-round.
Organize your deductions
Locating Form 1098 and all the other scraps of paper you need when com-
pleting your tax return can be a hassle. Setting up a filing system can be a
big timesaver:
 Folder or shoe box: If you have a simple financial life (that is, you haven’t
saved receipts throughout the year), you can confine your filing to
January and February. During those months, you receive tax summary
statements on wages paid by your employer (Form W-2), investment
income (Form 1099), and home mortgage interest (Form 1098) in the
mail. Label the shoe box or folder with something easy to remember
(“2007 Taxes” is a brilliant choice) and dump these papers and your tax
booklet into it. When you’re ready to crunch numbers, you’ll have every-
thing you need to complete the form.
 Accordion type file: Organizing the bills you pay into individual folders
during the entire year is a more thorough approach. This method is
essential if you own your own business and need to tabulate your expen-
ditures for office supplies each year. No one is going to send you a form
totaling your office expenditures for the year — you’re on your own.
 Software: Software programs can help organize your tax information
during the year and save you time and accounting fees come tax-
preparation time. See Chapter 19 for more information about tax
and financial software.
The following sections explain commonly overlooked deductions and deduction
strategies. Some are listed on Schedule A, and others appear on Form 1040.
Shift or bunch deductions
When you total your itemized deductions on Schedule A and the total is
lower than the standard deduction, you should take the standard deduction.
This total is worth checking each year, because you may have more deduc-
tions in some years, and itemizing may make sense.
Because you can control when you pay particular expenses that are eligible
for itemizing, you can shift or bunch more of them into the select years where
you have enough deductions to take advantage of itemizing. Suppose, for
example, that you’re using the standard deduction this year because you
134
Part II: Saving More, Spending Less 

don’t have many itemized deductions. Late in the year, though, you become
certain that you’re going to buy a home next year. With mortgage interest
and property taxes to write off, you also know that you can itemize next year.
If you typically make more charitable contributions in December because of
the barrage of solicitations you receive when you’re in the giving mood, you
may want to write the checks in January rather than in December.
When you’re sure that you’re not going to have enough deductions in the cur-
rent year to itemize, try to shift as many expenses as you can into the next
tax year.
Purchasing real estate
When you buy a home, you can claim two big ongoing expenses of home 
ownership — your property taxes and the interest on your mortgage —
as deductions on Schedule A. You’re allowed to claim mortgage interest
deductions for a primary residence (where you actually live) and on a
second home for mortgage debt totaling $1,000,000 (and a home equity
loan of up to $100,000). There’s no limit on property tax deductions.
In order to buy real estate, you need to first collect a down payment, which
requires maintaining a lid on your spending. See Part I for help with prioritiz-
ing and achieving important financial goals. Check out Chapter 14 for more
on investing in real estate.
Trading consumer debt for mortgage debt
When you own real estate, you haven’t borrowed the maximum, and you’ve
run up high-interest consumer debt, you may be able to trade one debt for
another. You may be able to save on interest charges by refinancing your
mortgage or taking out a home equity loan and pulling out extra cash to pay
off your credit card, auto loan, or other costly credit lines. You can usually
borrow at a lower interest rate for a mortgage and get a tax deduction as a
bonus, which lowers the effective borrowing cost further. Consumer debt,
such as that on auto loans and credit cards, is not tax-deductible.
This strategy involves some danger. Borrowing against the equity in your
home can be an addictive habit. I’ve seen cases where people run up signifi-
cant consumer debt three or four times and then refinance their home the
same number of times over the years to bail themselves out.
135
Chapter 7: Taming Taxes

An appreciating home creates the illusion that excess spending isn’t really
costing you. But debt is debt, and all borrowed money has to be repaid. In the
long run, you wind up with greater mortgage debt, and paying it off takes a
bigger bite out of your monthly income. Refinancing and establishing home
equity lines cost you more in terms of loan application fees and other charges
(points, appraisals, credit reports, and so on).
At a minimum, the continued expansion of your mortgage debt handicaps
your ability to work toward other financial goals. In the worst case, easy
access to borrowing encourages bad spending habits that can lead to bank-
ruptcy or foreclosure on your debt-ridden home.
Contributing to charities
You can deduct contributions to charities if you itemize your deductions.
For example:
 Most people know that when they write a check for $50 to their favorite
church or college, they can deduct it. Note: Make sure that you get a
receipt for contributions of $250 or more.
 Many taxpayers overlook the fact that you can also deduct expenses for
work you do with charitable organizations. For example, when you go to
a soup kitchen to help prepare and serve meals, you can deduct your
transportation costs. Keep track of your driving mileage and other com-
muting expenses.
 You also can deduct the fair market value (which can be determined
by looking at the price of similar merchandise in thrift stores) of dona-
tions of clothing, household appliances, furniture, and other goods to
charities. (Many charities will even drive to your home to pick up the
stuff.) Find out whether organizations such as the Salvation Army,
Goodwill, or others are interested in your donation. Just make sure that
you keep some documentation — write up an itemized list and get it
signed by the charity. Consider taking pictures of your more valuable
donations.
 You can even donate securities and other investments to charity. In fact,
donating an appreciated investment gives you a tax deduction for the
full market value of the investment and eliminates your need to pay tax
on the (unrealized) profit.
136
Part II: Saving More, Spending Less 

Remembering auto registration 
fees and state insurance
If you don’t currently itemize, you may be surprised to discover that your
state income taxes can be itemized. When you pay a fee to the state to regis-
ter and license your car, you can itemize a portion of the expenditure as a
deduction (on Schedule A, line 7, “Personal Property Taxes”). The IRS allows
you to deduct the part of the fee that relates to the value of your car. The state
organization that collects the fee should be able to tell you what portion of
the fee is deductible. (Some states detail on the invoice what portion of the
fee is tax-deductible.)
Several states have state disability insurance funds. If you pay into these funds
(check your W-2), you can deduct your payments as state and local income
taxes on line 5 of Schedule A. You may also claim a deduction on this line for
payments you make into your state’s unemployment compensation fund.
Deducting miscellaneous expenses
A number of so-called miscellaneous expenses are deductible on Schedule A.
Most of these expenses relate to your job or career and the management of
your finances:
 Educational expenses: You may be able to deduct the cost of tuition,
books, and travel to and from classes if your education is related to your
career. Specifically, you can deduct these expenses if your course work
improves your work skills. Courses the law or your employer requires
you to take to maintain your position are deductible. Continuing educa-
tion classes for professionals may also be deductible. Note: Educational
expenses that lead to your moving into a new field or career are not
deductible.
 Job searches and career counseling: After you obtain your first job,
you may deduct legitimate costs related to finding another job within
your field. For example, suppose that you’re a chef in a steakhouse in
Chicago and you decide that you want to do stir-fry in Los Angeles.
You take a crash course in vegetarian cooking and then fly to L.A. a
couple times for interviews. You can deduct the cost of the course and
your trips — even if you don’t change jobs. And if you hire a career coun-
selor to help you, you can deduct that cost as well. On the other hand, if
you’re burned out on cooking and you decide that you want to become a
massage therapist in L.A., that’s a new career. You may be rejuvenated,
but you won’t generate deductions from changing jobs.
137
Chapter 7: Taming Taxes

 Expenses related to your job that aren’t reimbursed: When you pay for
your own subscriptions to trade journals to keep up with your field or
buy a new desk and chair to ease back pain, you can deduct these costs.
If your job requires you to wear special clothes or a uniform (for example,
you’re an EMT), you can write off the cost of purchasing and cleaning
these clothes, as long as they aren’t suitable for wearing outside of work.
When you buy a computer for use outside the office at your own expense,
you may be able to deduct the cost if the computer is for the convenience
of your employer, is a condition of your employment, and is used more
than half the time for business. Union dues and membership fees for
professional organizations are also deductible.
 Investment and tax-related expenses: Investment and tax-advisor fees
are deductible, as are subscription costs for investment-related publica-
tions. Accounting fees for preparing your tax return or conducting tax
planning during the year are deductible; legal fees related to your taxes
are also deductible. If you purchase a home computer to track your
investments or prepare your taxes, you can deduct that expense, too.
When you deduct miscellaneous expenses, you get to deduct only the
amount that exceeds 2 percent of your AGI (adjusted gross income). AGI is
your total wage, interest, dividend, and all other income minus retirement
account contributions, self-employed health insurance, alimony paid, and
losses from investments.
Deducting self-employment expenses
When you’re self-employed, you can deduct a multitude of expenses from
your income before calculating the tax you owe. If you buy a computer or
office furniture, you can deduct those expenses. (Sometimes they need to be
gradually deducted, or depreciated, over time.) Salaries for your employees,
office supplies, rent or mortgage interest for your office space, and phone/
communications expenses are also generally deductible.
Many self-employed folks don’t take all the deductions they’re eligible for.
In some cases, people simply aren’t aware of the wonderful world of deduc-
tions. Others are worried that large deductions will increase the risk of an
audit. Spend some time finding out more about tax deductions; you’ll be con-
vinced that taking full advantage of your eligible deductions makes sense and
saves you money.
The following are common mistakes made by people who are their own
bosses:
138
Part II: Saving More, Spending Less 

 Being an island unto yourself. When you’re self-employed, going it
alone is usually a mistake when it comes to taxes. You must educate
yourself to make the tax laws work for rather than against you. Hiring
tax help is well worth your while. (See “Professional hired help,” later in
this chapter, for info on hiring tax advisors.)
 Making administrative tax screw-ups. As a self-employed individual,
you’re responsible for the correct and timely filing of all taxes owed on
your income and employment taxes on your employees. You need to
make estimated tax payments on a quarterly basis. And if you have
employees, you also need to withhold taxes from each paycheck they
receive and make timely payments to the IRS and the appropriate state
authorities. In addition to federal and state income tax, you also need to
withhold and send in Social Security and any other state or locally man-
dated payroll taxes.
To pay taxes on your income, use Form 1040-ES. This form, along with
instructions, can be obtained from the IRS (800-829-3676; www.irs.gov).
The form comes complete with an estimated tax worksheet and the four
payment coupons you need to send in with your quarterly tax payments.
If you want to find the rules for withholding and submitting taxes from
employees’ paychecks, ask the IRS for Form 941 and Form 940, which is
for unemployment insurance. And unless you’re lucky enough to live in
a state with no income taxes, you need to call for your state’s estimated
income tax package. Another alternative is to hire a payroll firm, such as
Paychex, to do all this drudgery for you. Scrutinize and negotiate their
expenses.
 Failing to document expenses. When you pay with cash, following
the paper trail for all the money you spent can be hard for you to do
(and for the IRS, in the event you’re ever audited). At the end of the year,
how are you going to remember how much you spent for parking or
client meals if you fail to keep a record? How will you survive an IRS
audit without proper documentation?
Debit cards are accepted most places and provide a convenient paper
trail. (Be careful about getting a debit card in your business’s name,
because some banks don’t offer protection against fraudulent use of
business debit cards.) Otherwise, you need a system or written record
of your daily petty cash purchases. Most pocket calendars or daily orga-
nizers include ledgers that allow you to track these small purchases.
If you aren’t that organized, at least get a receipt for cash transactions
and stash them in a file folder in your desk. Or keep receipts in envelopes
labeled with the month and year.
 Failing to fund a retirement plan. You should be saving money toward
retirement anyway, and you can’t beat the tax break. People who are
self-employed are allowed to save a substantial portion of their net
income on an annual basis. To find out more about SEP-IRAs, Keoghs,
and other retirement plans, see Chapter 11.
139
Chapter 7: Taming Taxes

 Failing to use tax numbers to help manage business. If you’re a small-
business owner who doesn’t track her income, expenses, staff perfor-
mance, and customer data on a regular basis, your tax return may be the
one and only time during the year when you take a financial snapshot of
your business. After you go through all the time, trouble, and expense to
file your tax return, make sure you reap the rewards of all your work; use
those numbers to help analyze and manage your business.
Some bookkeepers and tax preparers can provide you with management
information reports on your business from the tax data they compile for
you. Just ask! See “Software and Web sites,” later in this chapter, for my
recommendations.
 Failing to pay family help. If your children, spouse, or other relatives
help with some aspect of your business, consider paying them for the
work. Besides showing them that you value their work, this practice may
reduce your family’s tax liability. For example, children are usually in a
lower tax bracket. By shifting some of your income to your child, you
cut your tax bill.
Reducing Investment Income Taxes
The distributions and profits on investments that you hold outside of tax-
sheltered retirement accounts are exposed to taxation when you receive them.
Interest, dividends, and capital gains (profits from the sale of an investment
at a price that’s higher than the purchase price) are all taxed.
Although this section explains some of the best methods for reducing the
taxes on investments exposed to taxation, Chapter 12 discusses how and
where to invest money held outside of tax-sheltered retirement accounts
such as IRAs and 401(k) plans.
Investing in tax-free money 
market funds and bonds
When you’re in a high enough tax bracket, you may find that you come out
ahead with tax-free investments. Tax-free investments pay investment
income, which is exempt from federal tax, state tax, or both. (See Part III
for details.)
140
Part II: Saving More, Spending Less 

Tax-free investments yield less than comparable investments that produce tax-
able income. But because of the difference in taxes, the earnings from tax-free
investments can end up being greater than what you’re left with from taxable
investments.
Tax-free money market funds can be a better alternative to bank savings
accounts (where interest is subject to taxation). Likewise, tax-free bonds are
intended to be longer-term investments that pay tax-free interest, so they
may be a better investment option for you than bank certificates of deposit,
Treasury bills and bonds, and other investments that produce taxable income.
(See Chapter 12 for specifics on which tax-free investments may be right for
your situation.)
Selecting other tax-friendly investments
Too often, when selecting investments, people mistakenly focus on past rates
of return. We all know that the past is no guarantee of the future. But choos-
ing an investment with a reportedly high rate of return without considering
tax consequences is an even worse mistake. What you get to keep — after
taxes — is what matters in the long run.
For example, when comparing two similar funds, most people prefer a fund
that averages returns of 14 percent per year to one that earns 12 percent per
year. But what if the 14-percent-per-year fund, because of greater taxable dis-
tributions, causes you to pay a lot more in taxes? What if, after factoring in
taxes, the 14-percent-per-year fund nets just 9 percent, while the 12-percent-
per-year fund nets an effective 10 percent return? In such a case, you’d be
unwise to choose a fund solely on the basis of the higher (pre-tax) reported
rate of return.
I call investments that appreciate in value and don’t distribute much in the
way of highly taxed income tax-friendly. (Some in the investment business use
the term tax-efficient.) See Chapter 10 for more information on tax-friendly
stocks and stock mutual funds.
Real estate is one of the few areas with privileged status in the tax code. In addi-
tion to deductions allowed for mortgage interest and property taxes, you can
depreciate rental property to reduce your taxable income. Depreciation is a
special tax deduction allowed for the gradual wear and tear on rental real
estate. When you sell investment real estate, you may be eligible to conduct
a tax-free exchange when buying a so-called replacement rental property.
See Chapter 14 for a crash course in real estate.
141
Chapter 7: Taming Taxes

Making your profits long-term
As I discuss in Part III, when you buy growth investments such as stocks and
real estate, you should do so for the long-term — ideally ten or more years.
The tax system rewards your patience with lower tax rates on your profits.
When you’re able to hold on to an investment (outside of a retirement account)
such as a stock, bond, or mutual fund for more than one year, you get a tax
break if you sell that investment at a profit. Specifically, your profit is taxed
under the lower capital gains tax rate schedule. If you’re in the 25 percent or
higher federal income tax bracket, you pay just 15 percent of your long-term
capital gains’ profit in federal taxes. (The same lower tax rate applies to stock
dividends.) If you’re in the 10 or 15 percent federal income tax brackets, the
long-term capital gains tax rate is just 5 percent (and is actually scheduled to
fall to 0 percent in 2008).
Does funding retirement accounts 
still make sense?
Historically, taking advantage of opportunities to direct money into retire-
ment accounts gives you two possible tax benefits. First, your contributions
to the retirement account may be immediately tax-deductible (see Chapter 11
for details). Second, the distributions and growth of the investments in the
retirement accounts aren’t generally taxed until withdrawal.
In the preceding section, I mention a tax break for long-term capital gains and
on stock dividends. This break, unfortunately, applies only to investments
held outside of retirement accounts. If you realize a long-term capital gain or
receive stock dividends inside a retirement account, those investment returns
are taxed at the relatively ordinary income tax rates. Thus, some have argued
you shouldn’t fund retirement accounts. In most cases, the people making
the argument have a vested interest.
Unless you have a specific goal (such as saving for a home purchase or to
start a business) that necessitates having access to your money that you
don’t have with a retirement account, there are but two atypical situations
when not funding a retirement account could make sense:
 You’re temporarily in a very low tax bracket. This could happen, for
example, if you lose your job for an extended period of time or are in
school. In these cases, you’re likely not to have lots of spare money to
142
Part II: Saving More, Spending Less 

contribute to a retirement account anyway! If you have some employ-
ment income, consider the Roth IRA (see Chapter 11).
 You have too much money socked away already. If you have a large net
worth inside retirement accounts, which could get hit by estate taxes (see
Chapter 17), continuing to fund retirement may be counterproductive.
Enlisting Education Tax Breaks
Being so labor intensive, education is often costly. Recognizing that, as well
as the overall societal benefits from better-educated people, the government
offers plenty of tax reduction opportunities in the tax laws. Knowing that you
don’t want to read the dreadful tax code, here’s a summary of key provisions
you should know about for yourself and your kids if you have them:
 Tax deductions for college expenses: You may take up to a $4,000 tax
deduction on IRS Form 1040 for college costs so long as your adjusted
gross income (AGI) is less than $65,000 for single taxpayers and less
than $130,000 for married couples filing jointly. (Note: You may take up
to a $2,000 tax deduction if your AGI is between $65,000 and $80,000 for
single taxpayers and between $130,000 and $160,000 for married couples
filing jointly.)
 Tax-free investment earnings in special accounts: Money invested in
Education Savings Accounts (ESAs) and in section 529 plans is sheltered
from taxation and is not taxed upon withdrawal so long as the money is
used to pay for eligible education expenses. Subject to eligibility require-
ments, you may contribute up to $2,000 annually to ESAs. 529 plans
allow you to sock away over $200,000. Please be aware, however, that
funding such accounts may harm your potential financial aid. Please see
Chapter 12 for details on these accounts.
 Tax credits: The Hope Scholarship and Lifetime Learning Credits pro-
vide tax relief to low- and moderate-income earners facing education
costs. The Hope credit may be up to $1,500 in each of the first two years
of college, and the Lifetime Learning credit, up to $2,000 per taxpayer.
Each student may take only one of these credits per tax year. And in a
year in which a credit is taken, you may neither withdraw money from
an ESA or 529 plan nor take a tax deduction for your college expenses.
Please be sure to read Chapter 13 for the best ways and strategies to pay for
educational expenses.
143
Chapter 7: Taming Taxes

Getting Help from Tax Resources
All sorts of ways to prepare your tax return exist. Which approach makes
sense for you depends on the complexity of your situation and your know-
ledge of taxes.
Regardless of which approach you use, you should be taking financial moves
during the year to reduce your taxes. By the time you actually file your return
in the following year, it’s often too late for you to take advantage of many tax-
reduction strategies.
IRS assistance
If you have a simple, straightforward tax return, filing it on your own using
only the IRS instructions is fine. This approach is as cheap as you can get.
The main costs are time, patience, photocopying expenses (you should
always keep a copy for your files), and postage for mailing the completed
tax return.
IRS publications don’t have Tip or Warning icons. And the IRS has been
known to give wrong information from time to time. When you call the IRS
with a question, be sure to take notes about your conversation to protect
yourself in the event of an audit. Date your notes and include the name and
identification number of the tax employee you talked to, the questions you
asked, and the employee’s responses. File your notes in a folder with a copy
of your completed return.
In addition to the standard instructions that come with your tax return, the
IRS offers some free (actually, paid for with your tax dollars) and sometimes
useful booklets. Publication 17, Your Federal Income Tax, is designed for indi-
vidual tax-return preparation. Publication 334, Tax Guide for Small Businesses,
is for (you guessed it) small-business tax-return preparation. These publica-
tions are more comprehensive than the basic IRS instructions. Call 800-829-3676
to request these booklets, or visit the IRS Web site at www.irs.gov.
Preparation and advice guides
Books about tax preparation and tax planning that highlight common problem
areas and are written in clear, simple English are invaluable. They supple-
ment the official instructions not only by helping you complete your return
correctly but also by showing you how to save as much money as possible.
144
Part II: Saving More, Spending Less 

Consider picking up a copy of the latest edition of Taxes For Dummies, which
I co-authored (Wiley Publishing).
Software and Web sites
If you have access to a computer, good tax-preparation software can be help-
ful. TaxCut and TurboTax are programs that I have reviewed and rated as the
best. If you go the software route, I highly recommend having a good tax
advice book by your side.
For you Web surfers, the Internal Revenue Service Web site (www.irs.gov) is
among the better Internet tax sites, believe it or not. The Tax and Accounting
Sites Directory at www.taxsites.com is another good Web site with links to
many other useful tax sites.
Professional hired help
Competent tax preparers and advisors can save you money — sometimes
more than enough to pay their fees — by identifying tax-reduction strategies
you may overlook. They can also help reduce the likelihood of an audit,
which can be triggered by blunders. Mediocre and lousy tax preparers, on
the other hand, may make mistakes and not be aware of sound ways to
reduce your tax bill.
Tax practitioners come with varying backgrounds, training, and credentials.
The four main types of tax practitioners are preparers, enrolled agents (EAs),
Certified Public Accountants (CPAs), and tax attorneys. The more training
and specialization a tax practitioner has (and the more affluent his clients),
the higher his hourly fee usually is. Fees and competence vary greatly. If you
hire a tax advisor and you’re not sure of the quality of work performed and
the soundness of the advice, try getting a second opinion.
Preparers
Preparers generally have the least amount of training of all the tax practitioners,
and a greater proportion of them work part-time. As with financial planners,
no national regulations apply to preparers, and no licensing is required.
Preparers are appealing because they’re relatively inexpensive — they can do
most basic returns for around $100 or so. The drawback of using a preparer
is that you may hire someone who doesn’t know much more than you do.
145
Chapter 7: Taming Taxes

Preparers make the most sense for folks who have relatively simple financial
lives, who are budget-minded, and who hate doing their own taxes. If you’re
not good about hanging onto receipts or you don’t want to keep your own
files with background details about your taxes, you should definitely shop
around for a tax preparer who’s committed to the business. You may need
all that stuff someday for an audit, and many tax preparers keep and
organize their clients’ documentation rather than return everything each
year. Also, going with a firm that’s open year-round may be a safer option
(some small shops are open only during tax season) in case tax questions
or problems arise.
Enrolled agents (EAs)
A person must pass IRS scrutiny in order to be called an enrolled agent.
This license allows the agent to represent you before the IRS in the event
of an audit. Continuing education is also required; the training is generally
longer and more sophisticated than it is for a typical preparer.
Enrolled agents’ fees tend to fall between those of a preparer and a CPA (see
the next section). Returns that require a few of the more common schedules
(such as Schedule A for deductions and Schedule D for capital gains and
losses) shouldn’t cost more than $200 to $300 to prepare.
EAs are best for people who have moderately complex returns and don’t
necessarily need complicated tax-planning advice throughout the year
(although some EAs provide this service as well). You can get names and
telephone numbers of EAs in your area by contacting the National Association
of Enrolled Agents (NAEA). You can call the NAEA at 202-822-6232 or visit its
Web site at www.naea.org.
Certified public accountants (CPAs)
Certified public accountants go through significant training and examination
before receiving the CPA credential. In order to maintain this designation,
a CPA must also complete a fair number of continuing education classes
every year.
CPA fees vary tremendously. Most charge $100+ per hour, but CPAs at large
companies and in high-cost-of-living areas tend to charge somewhat more.
If you’re self-employed and/or you file lots of other schedules, you may want
to hire a CPA. But you don’t need to do so year after year. If your situation
grows complex one year and then stabilizes, consider getting help for the
perplexing year and then using preparation guides, software, or a lower-cost
preparer or enrolled agent in the future.

Tax attorneys
Tax attorneys deal with complicated tax problems and issues that usually
have some legal angle. Unless you’re a super-high-income earner with a 
complex financial life, hiring a tax attorney to prepare your annual return is
prohibitively expensive. In fact, many tax attorneys don’t prepare returns as
a normal practice.
Because of their level of specialization and training, tax attorneys tend to have
the highest hourly billing rates — $200 to $300+ per hour is not unusual.
Dealing with an Audit
On a list of real-life nightmares, most people would rank tax audits right up
there with root canals, rectal exams, and court appearances. Many people
are traumatized by audits because they feel like they’re on trial and being
accused of a crime. Take a deep breath and don’t panic.
You may be getting audited simply because a business that reports tax infor-
mation on you, or someone at the IRS, made an error regarding the data on
your return. In the vast majority of cases, the IRS conducts its audit by corre-
sponding with you through the mail.
Audits that require you to schlep to the local IRS office are the most feared
type of audit. In these cases, about 20 percent of such audited returns are left
unchanged by the audit — in other words, the taxpayer didn’t end up owing
more money. In fact, if you’re the lucky sort, you may be one of the 5 percent of
folks who actually gets a refund because the audit finds a mistake in your favor!
Unfortunately, you’ll most likely be one of the roughly 75 percent of audit sur-
vivors who end up owing more tax money. The amount of additional tax that
you owe in interest and penalties hinges on how your audit goes.
Getting your act together
Preparing for an audit is sort of like preparing for a test at school. The IRS
will let you know which sections of your tax return it wants to examine.
The first decision you face when you get an audit notice is whether to handle
it yourself or hire a tax advisor to represent you. Hiring representation may
help you save time, stress, and money.
147
Chapter 7: Taming Taxes

If you normally prepare your own return and you’re comfortable with your
understanding of the areas being audited, handle the audit yourself. When the
amount of tax money in question is small when compared to the fee you’d pay
the tax advisor to represent you, self-representation is probably your best
option. However, if you’re likely to turn into a babbling, intimidated fool and
you’re unsure of how to present your situation, hire a tax advisor to repre-
sent you. (See “Professional hired help,” earlier in this chapter, for information
about whom to hire.)
If you decide to handle the audit yourself, get your act together sooner rather
than later. Don’t wait until the night before to start gathering receipts and
other documentation. You may need to contact others to get copies of docu-
ments you can’t find.
You need to document and be ready to speak only about the areas the audit
notice says are being investigated. Organize the various documents and
receipts into folders. You want to make it as easy as possible for the auditor
to review your materials. Don’t show up, dump shopping bags full of receipts
and paperwork on the auditor’s desk, and say, “Here it is — you figure it out.”
Whatever you do, don’t ignore your audit request letter. The IRS is the ultimate
bill-collection agency. And if you end up owing more money (the unhappy
result of most audits), the sooner you pay, the less interest and penalties
you’ll owe.
Surviving the day of reckoning
Two people with identical situations can walk into an audit and come out
with very different results. The loser can end up owing much more in taxes
and have the audit expanded to include other parts of the return. The winner
can end up owing no additional tax or even owing less.
Here’s how to be a winner in your tax audit:
 Treat the auditor as a human being. This advice may be obvious, but it
isn’t practiced by taxpayers very often. You may be resentful or angry
about being audited. You may be tempted to gnash your teeth and tell
the auditor how unfair it is that an honest taxpayer like you had to
spend hours getting ready for this. You may feel like ranting and raving
about how the government wastes too much of your tax money, or that
the party in power is out to get you. Bite your tongue.
148
Part II: Saving More, Spending Less 

Believe it or not, most auditors are decent people just trying to do their
jobs. They’re well aware that taxpayers don’t like seeing them. Don’t suck
up, either — just relax and be yourself. Behave as you would around a
boss you like — with respect and congeniality.
 Stick to the knitting. Your audit is for discussing only the sections of
your tax return that are in question. The more you talk about other
areas or things that you’re doing, the more likely the auditor will probe
into other items. Don’t bring documentation for parts of your return that
aren’t being audited. Besides creating more work for yourself, you may
be opening up a can of worms that doesn’t need to be opened. Should
the auditor inquire about areas that aren’t covered by the audit notice,
politely say that you’re not prepared to discuss those other issues and
that another meeting should be scheduled.
 Don’t argue when you disagree. State your case. When the auditor
wants to disallow a deduction or otherwise increase the taxes you owe
and you disagree, state once why you don’t agree with his assessment.
If the auditor won’t budge, don’t get into a knock-down, drag-out con-
frontation. He or she may not want to lose face and is inclined to find
additional tax money — that’s the auditor’s job. 
When necessary, you can plead your case with several people who work
above your auditor. If this method fails and you still feel wronged, you
can take your case to tax court.
 Don’t be intimidated. Most auditors are not tax geniuses. The work is
stressful — being in a job where people dislike seeing you is not easy.
Turnover is quite high. Thus, many auditors are fairly young, just-out-of-
school types who majored in something like English, history, or sociology.
They may know less about tax and financial matters than you do. The basic
IRS tax boot camp that auditors go through doesn’t come close to cover-
ing all the technical details and nuances in the tax code. So you may not
be at such a disadvantage in your tax knowledge after all, especially if
you work with a tax advisor (most tax advisors know more about the tax
system than the average IRS auditor).

aking wise investments doesn’t have to be complicated. However,
many investors get bogged down in the morass of the thousands of
investment choices out there and the often-conflicting perspectives on how
to invest. This chapter helps you grasp the important “bigger picture” issues
that can help you ensure that your investment plan meshes with your needs
and the realities of the investment marketplace.
Establishing Your Goals
Before you select a specific investment, first determine your investment
needs and goals. Why are you saving money — what are you going to use it
for? You don’t need to earmark every dollar, but you should set some major
objectives. Establishing objectives is important because the expected use of
the money helps you determine how long to invest it. And that, in turn, helps
you determine which investments to choose.
The risk level of your investments should factor in your time frame and your
comfort level. Investing in high-risk vehicles doesn’t make sense if you’ll have to
spend all your profits on stress-induced medical bills. For example, suppose
you’ve been accumulating money for a down payment on a home you want to
buy in a few years. You can’t afford much risk with that money. You’re going
to need that money sooner rather than later. Putting that money in the stock
market, then, is probably not a wise move. As I discuss later in this chapter,
the stock market can drop a lot in a year or over several consecutive years.
So stocks are probably too risky a place to invest money you plan to use soon.

Perhaps you’re saving toward a longer-term goal, such as retirement, that’s 20
or 30 years away. In this case, you’re in a position to make riskier investments,
because your holdings have more time to bounce back from temporary losses
or setbacks. You may want to consider investing in growth investments, such
as stocks, in a retirement account that you leave alone for 20 years or longer.
You can tolerate year-to-year volatility in the market — you have time on
your side. If you haven’t yet done so, take a tour through Chapter 4, which
helps you contemplate and set your financial goals.
Understanding the Primary Investments
For a moment, forget all the buzzwords, jargon, and product names you’ve
heard tossed around in the investment world — in many cases, they’re only
meant to obscure what an investment really is and to hide the hefty fees and
commissions. Imagine a world with only two investment flavors — chocolate
and vanilla ice cream (or low-fat frozen yogurt for you health-minded folks).
The investment world is really just as simple. You have only two major
investment choices: You can be a lender or an owner.
Looking at lending investments
You’re a lender when you invest your money in a bank certificate of deposit
(CD), a treasury bill, or a bond issued by a company like General Motors, for
example. In each case, you lend your money to an organization — a bank, the
federal government, or GM. You’re paid an agreed-upon rate of interest for
lending your money. The organization also promises to have your original
investment (the principal) returned to you on a specific date.
Getting paid all the interest in addition to your original investment (as
promised) is the best that can happen with a lending investment. Given that
the investment landscape is littered with carcasses of failed investments, this
is not a result to take for granted.
The worst that can happen with a lending investment is that you don’t get
everything you’re promised. Promises can be broken under extenuating cir-
cumstances. When a company goes bankrupt, for example, you can lose all
or part of your original investment.
154
Part III: Building Wealth with Wise Investing 

Another risk associated with lending investments is that even though you
get what you were promised, the ravages of inflation may make your money
worth less — it has less purchasing power than you thought it would. Back in
the 1960s, for example, high-quality companies issued long-term bonds that
paid approximately 4 percent interest. At the time, buying a long-term bond
seemed like a good deal, because the cost of living was increasing by only
2 percent per year. When inflation rocketed to 6 percent and higher, those
4 percent bonds didn’t seem so attractive. The interest and principal didn’t
buy nearly the amount they did years earlier when inflation was lower.
Table 8-1 shows the reduction in the purchasing power of your money at
varying rates of inflation after just ten years.
Table 8-1
Reduction in Purchasing Power Due to Inflation
Inflation Rate
Reduction in Purchasing Power after Ten Years
6 percent
–44 percent
8 percent
–54 percent
10 percent
–61 percent
Some conservative-minded investors make the common mistake of thinking
that they’re diversifying their long-term investment money by buying several
bonds, some CDs, and an annuity. The problem, however, is that all these
investments pay a relatively low fixed rate of return that’s exposed to the
vagaries of inflation.
A final drawback to lending investments is that you don’t share in the success
of the organization to which you lend your money. If the company doubles
or triples in size and profits, your principal and interest rate don’t double or
triple in size along with it; they stay the same. Of course, such success should
ensure that you get your promised interest and principal.
Exploring ownership investments
You’re an owner when you invest your money in an asset, such as a company
or real estate, that has the ability to generate earnings or profits. Suppose that
you own 100 shares of Verizon Communications stock. With billions of shares
of stock outstanding, Verizon is a mighty big company — your 100 shares rep-
resent a tiny piece of it.
155
Chapter 8: Important Investment Concepts

What do you get for your small slice of Verizon? As a stockholder, although
you don’t get free calling, you do share in the profits of a company in the
form of annual dividends and an increase (you hope) in the stock price if the
company grows and becomes more profitable. Of course, you receive these
benefits if things are going well. If Verizon’s business declines, your stock
may be worth less (or even worthless!).
Real estate is another one of my favorite financially rewarding and time-
honored ownership investments. Real estate can produce profits when it’s
rented out for more than the expense of owning the property or sold at a
price higher than what you paid for it. I know numerous successful real estate
investors (myself included) who have earned excellent long-term profits.
The value of real estate depends not only on the particulars of the individual
property but also on the health and performance of the local economy.
When companies in the community are growing and more jobs are being pro-
duced at higher wages, real estate often does well. When local employers are
laying people off and excess housing is sitting vacant because of previous
overbuilding, rent and property values are likely to fall.
Finally, many Americans have also built substantial wealth through small
business. According to Forbes magazine, more of the United States’ (and the
world’s) wealthiest individuals have built their wealth through their stake in
small businesses than through any other vehicle. Small business is the engine
that drives much of our economic growth. Although firms with fewer than
20 employees account for about one-quarter of all employees, such small
firms were responsible for nearly half of all new jobs created in the past two
decades.
You can participate in small business in a variety of ways. You can start your
own business, buy and operate an existing business, or simply invest in
promising small businesses. In the chapters ahead, I explain each of these
major investment types in detail.
Shunning Gambling Instruments 
and Behaviors
Although investing is often risky, it’s not gambling. Gambling is putting your
money into schemes that are sure to lose you money over time. That’s not to
say that everyone loses or that you lose every time you gamble. However, the
deck is stacked against you. The house wins most of the time.
156
Part III: Building Wealth with Wise Investing 

Horse-racing tracks, gambling casinos, and lotteries are set up to pay out 50
to 60 cents on the dollar. The rest goes to profits and the administration of
the system — don’t forget that these are businesses. Sure, your chosen horse
may win a race or two, but in the long run, you’re almost guaranteed to lose
about 40 to 50 percent of what you bet. Would you put your money in an
“investment” where your expected return was negative 40 percent?
Forsake futures, options, 
and other derivatives
Futures, options, and commodities are derivatives, or financial investments
whose value is derived from the performance of another security such as a
stock or bond.
You may have heard the radio ad from the firm Fleecem, Cheatem, and
Leavem, advocating that you buy heating oil futures because of conflicts in
the Middle East and the upcoming rise in heating oil usage due to the cold
weather months. You call the firm and are impressed by the smooth-talking
vice president who spends so much time with little ol’ you. His logic makes
sense, and he spent a lot of time with you, so you send him a check for $10,000.
Buying futures isn’t much different from blowing $10,000 at the craps tables
in Las Vegas. Futures prices depend on short-term, highly volatile price
movements. As with gambling, you occasionally win when the market moves
the right way at the right time. But in the long run, you’re gonna lose. In fact,
you can lose it all.
Options are as risky as futures. With options, you’re betting on the short-term
movements of a specific security. If you have inside information (such as
knowing in advance when a major corporate development is going to occur),
you can get rich. But insider trading is illegal. You may end up in jail like
Martha Stewart did.
Honest brokers who help their clients invest in stocks, bonds, and mutual
funds will tell you the truth about commodities, futures, and options. A former
broker I know who worked for various major brokerage firms for 12 years
told me, “I had one client who made money in options, futures, or commodi-
ties, but the only reason he came out ahead was because he was forced to
pull money out to close on a home purchase just when he happened to be
ahead. The commissions were great for me, but there’s no way a customer
will make money in them.” Remember these words if you’re tempted to
gamble with futures, options, and the like.
157
Chapter 8: Important Investment Concepts

Futures and options are not always used for speculation and gambling. Some
sophisticated professional investors use them to hedge, or actually reduce
the risk of, their broad investment holdings. When using them in this fashion,
things don’t often work out the way that the pros hoped. You, the individual
investor, should steer clear of futures and options.
Ditch daytrading
Daytrading — which is the rapid buying and selling of securities online — 
is a newer and equally foolish vehicle for individual investors to pursue.
Placing trades via the Internet is far cheaper than the older methods of trad-
ing (such as telephoning a broker), but the more you trade, the more trading
costs eat into your investment capital.
Frequent trading also increases your tax bill as profits realized over short
periods of time are taxed at your highest possible tax rate (see Chapter 7).
You can certainly make some profits when daytrading. However, over an
extended period of time, you’ll inevitably underperform the broad market
averages. In those rare instances where you may do a little better than the
market averages, it’s rarely worth the time and personal sacrifices that you
and your family and friends endure.
Understanding Investment Returns
The previous sections describe the difference between ownership and lend-
ing investments, and they help you distinguish gambling and speculation
from investing. “That’s all well and good,” you say, “but how do I choose
which type of investments to put my money into? How much can I make,
and what are the risks?”
Good questions. I’ll start with the returns you might make. I say “might”
because I’m looking at history, and history is a record of the past. Using 
history to predict the future — especially the near future — is dangerous.
History may repeat itself, but not always in exactly the same fashion and
not necessarily when you expect it to.
During this past century, ownership investments such as stocks and real estate
returned around 10 percent per year, handily beating lending investments such
as bonds (around 5 percent) and savings accounts (roughly 4 percent) in the
investment performance race. Inflation has averaged 3 percent per year.
158
Part III: Building Wealth with Wise Investing 

If you already know that the stock market can be risky, you may be wondering
why investing in stocks is worth the anxiety and potential losses. Why bother
for a few extra percent per year? Well, over many years, a few extra percent per
year can really magnify the growth of your money (see Table 8-2). The more
years you have to invest, the greater the difference a few percent makes in
your returns.
Table 8-2

Investing is not a spectator sport. You can’t earn good returns on stocks
and real estate if you keep your money in cash on the sidelines. If you
invest in growth investments such as stocks and real estate, don’t chase
one new investment after another trying to beat the market average returns.
The biggest value is to be in the market, not to beat it.
Sizing Investment Risks
Many investors have a simplistic understanding of what risk means and how
to apply it to their investment decisions. For example, when compared to the
yo-yo motions of the stock market, a bank savings account may seem like a
less risky place to put your money. Over the long term, however, the stock
market usually beats the rate of inflation, while the interest rate on a savings
account does not. Thus, if you’re saving your money for a long-term goal like
retirement, a savings account can be a “riskier” place to put your money.
Before you invest, ask yourself these questions:
 What am I saving and investing this money for? In other words, what’s
my goal?
 What is my timeline for this investment — when will I use this money?
 What is the historical volatility of the investment I’m considering, and
does that suit my comfort level and timeline for this investment?
159
Chapter 8: Important Investment Concepts

After you answer these questions, you’ll have a better understanding of risk
and you’ll be able to match your savings goals to their most appropriate
investment vehicles. In Chapter 4, I help you consider your savings goals and
timeline. I address investment risk and returns in the sections that follow.
Comparing the risks of stocks and bonds
Given the relatively higher historic returns I mention for ownership invest-
ments in the previous section, some people think that they should put all
their money in stocks and real estate. So what’s the catch?
The risk with ownership investments is the short-term fluctuations in their
value. During the last century, stocks declined, on average, by more than
10 percent (in one particular year) every five years. Drops in stock prices of
more than 20 percent occurred, on average, once every ten years. Real estate
prices suffer similar periodic setbacks.
Therefore, in order to earn those generous long-term returns from ownership
investments like stocks and real estate, you must be willing to tolerate volatil-
ity. You absolutely should not put all your money in the stock or real estate
market. You should not invest your emergency money or money you expect
to use within the next five years in such volatile investments.
The shorter the time period that you have for holding your money in an
investment, the less likely that growth-oriented investments like stocks
will beat out lending-type investments like bonds. Table 8-3 illustrates the 
historical relationship between stock and bond returns based on number of
years held.
Table 8-3

Likelihood of Stocks Beating Bonds

Some types of bonds have higher yields than others, but the risk-reward rela-
tionship remains intact (see Chapter 9 for more on bonds). A bond generally
pays you a higher rate of interest when it has a
160
Part III: Building Wealth with Wise Investing 

 Lower credit rating — to compensate for the higher risk of default and
the higher likelihood of losing your investment
 Longer-term maturity — to compensate for the risk that you’ll be unhappy
with the bond’s set interest rate if the market level of interest rates
moves up
Focusing on the risks you can control
I always asked students in my personal finance class that I used to teach at
the University of California to write down what they’d like to learn. Here’s
what one student had to say: “I want to learn what to invest my money in
now, as the stock market is overvalued and interest rates are about to go up,
so bonds are dicey and banks give lousy interest — HELP!”
This student recognizes the risk of price fluctuations in her investments, but
she also seems to believe, like too many people, that you can predict what’s
going to happen. How does she know that the stock market is overvalued,
and why hasn’t the rest of the world figured it out? How does she know that
interest rates are about to go up, and why hasn’t the rest of the world figured
that out, either?
When you invest in stocks and other growth-oriented investments, you must
accept the volatility of these investments. Invest the money that you have
earmarked for the longer-term in these vehicles. Minimize the risk of these
investments through diversification. Don’t buy just one or two stocks; buy a
number of stocks. Later in this chapter, I discuss what you need to know
about diversification.
Discovering low-risk, high-return 
investments
Despite what professors teach in the nation’s leading business and finance
graduate school programs, low-risk investments that almost certainly lead to
high returns are available. I can think of at least four such investments:
 Paying off consumer debt. If you’re paying 10, 14, or 18 percent interest
on an outstanding credit card or other consumer loan, pay it off before
investing. To get a comparable return through other investment vehicles
(after the government takes its share of your profits), you’d have to start
a new career as a loan shark. If, between federal and state taxes, you’re
in a 33 percent tax bracket and you’re paying 12 percent interest on con-
sumer debt, you’d need to annually earn a whopping 18 percent on your
investments pre-tax to justify not paying off the debt. Good luck!
161
Chapter 8: Important Investment Concepts

When your only source of funds for paying off debt is a small emergency
reserve equal to a few months’ living expenses, paying off your debt may
involve some risk. Tap into your emergency reserves only if you have a
backup source — for example, the ability to borrow from a willing family
member or against a retirement account balance.
 Investing in your health. Eat healthy, exercise, and relax.
 Investing in friends and family. Invest time and effort in improving your
relationships with loved ones.
 Investing in personal and career development. Pick up a new hobby,
improve your communication skills, or read widely. Take an adult educa-
tion course or go back to school for a degree. Your investment should
lead to greater happiness and perhaps even higher paychecks.
Diversifying Your Investments
Diversification is one of the most powerful investment concepts. It refers to
saving your eggs (or investments) in different baskets.
Diversification requires you to place your money in different investments
with returns that are not completely correlated. This is a fancy way of saying
that when some of your investments are down in value, odds are that others
are up in value.
To decrease the chances of all of your investments getting clobbered at the
same time, you must put your money in different types of investments, such
as bonds, stocks, real estate, and small business. (I cover all these invest-
ments and more in Chapter 9.) You can further diversify your investments by
investing in domestic as well as international markets.
Within a given class of investments such as stocks, investing in different
types of stocks that perform well under various economic conditions is
important. For this reason, mutual funds, which are diversified portfolios of
securities such as stocks or bonds, are a highly useful investment vehicle.
When you buy into a mutual fund, your money is pooled with the money of
many others and invested in a vast array of stocks or bonds.
You can look at the benefits of diversification in two ways:
 Diversification reduces the volatility in the value of your whole portfolio.
In other words, your portfolio can achieve the same rate of return that a
single investment can provide with less fluctuation in value.
 Diversification allows you to obtain a higher rate of return for a given
level of risk.
162
Part III: Building Wealth with Wise Investing 

Keep in mind that no one, no matter whom he works for or what credentials
he has, can guarantee returns on an investment. You can do good research
and get lucky, but no one is free from the risk of losing money. Diversification
allows you to hedge the risk of your investments. See Figures 8-1, 8-2, and 8-3
to get an idea of how diversifying can reduce your risk. (The figures in these
charts are adjusted for inflation.) Notice that different investments did better
during different time periods. Because the future can’t be predicted, diversi-
fying your money into different investments is safer. (In the 1990s, stocks
appreciated greatly, and bonds did pretty well, too, while gold and silver did
poorly. In the early 2000s, stocks did poorly while bonds and precious metals
did well. In the mid 2000s, stocks produced the best returns.)

Chapter 8: Important Investment Concepts

Spread the wealth: Asset allocation
Asset allocation refers to how you spread your investing dollars among differ-
ent investment options (stocks, bonds, money market accounts, and so on).
Before you can intelligently decide how to allocate your assets, you need to
ponder a number of issues, including your present financial situation, your
goals and priorities, and the pros and cons of various investment options.
Although stocks and real estate offer attractive long-term returns, they can
sometimes suffer significant declines. Thus, these investments are not suit-
able for money that you think you may want or need to use within, say, the
next five years.
Money market and bond investments are good places to keep money that you
expect to use soon. Everyone should have a reserve of money — about three
to six months’ worth of living expenses in a money market fund — that they
can access in an emergency. Shorter-term bonds or bond mutual funds can
serve as a higher-yielding, secondary emergency cushion. (Refer to Chapter 4
for more on emergency reserves.)
Bonds can also be useful for some longer-term investing for diversification
purposes. For example, when investing for retirement, placing a portion of
your money in bonds helps buffer stock market declines. The remaining
chapters in Part III detail your various investment options and explain how
to select those that best meet your needs.

Allocating money for the long term
Investing money for retirement is a classic long-term goal that most of us
have. Your current age and the number of years until you retire are the
biggest factors to consider when allocating money for long-term purposes.
The younger you are and the more years you have before retirement, the
more comfortable you should be with growth-oriented (and more volatile)
investments, such as stocks and investment real estate.
One useful guideline for dividing or allocating your money between longer-term-
oriented growth investments such as stocks and more-conservative lending
investments such as bonds is to subtract your age from 110 (or 120 if you
want to be aggressive; 100 to be more conservative) and invest the resulting
percentage in stocks. You then invest the remaining amount in bonds.
For example, if you’re 30 years old, you invest from 70 (100 – 30) to 90 
(120 – 30) percent in stocks. The portion left over — 10 to 30 percent —
is invested in bonds.
Table 8-4 lists some guidelines for allocating long-term money. All you need to
figure out is how old you are and the level of risk you’re comfortable with.
Table 8-4
Allocating Long-Term Money
Your Investment Attitude
Bond Allocation (%)
Stock Allocation (%)
“Play it safe”
= Age
= 100 – age
“Middle-of-the-road”
= Age – 10
= 110 – age
“Aggressive”
= Age – 20
= 120 – age
For example, if you’re the conservative sort who doesn’t like a lot of risk but
recognizes the value of striving for some growth and making your money work
harder, you’re a middle-of-the-road type. Using Table 8-4, if you’re 40 years
old, you may consider putting 30 percent (40 – 10) in bonds and 70 percent
(110 – 40) in stocks.
In most employer retirement plans, mutual funds are the typical investment
vehicle. If your employer’s retirement plan includes more than one stock
mutual fund as an option, you may want to try discerning which options are
best by using the criteria I outline in Chapter 10. In the event that all your
retirement plan’s stock fund options are good, you could simply divide your
stock allocation equally among the choices.
165
Chapter 8: Important Investment Concepts

When one or more of the choices is an international stock fund, consider 
allocating a percentage of your stock fund money to overseas investments: at
least 20 percent for play-it-safe investors, 25 to 35 percent for middle-of-the-
road investors, and as much as 35 to 50 percent for aggressive investors.
If the 40-year-old middle-of-the-roader from the previous example is investing
70 percent in stocks, about 25 to 35 percent of the stock fund investments
(which works out to be about 18 to 24 percent of the total) can be invested
in international stock funds.
Historically, most employees haven’t had to make their own investing deci-
sions with retirement money. Pension plans, in which the company directs
the investments, were more common in previous years. It’s interesting to
note that in a typical pension plan, companies choose to allocate the major-
ity of money to stocks (about 60 percent), with a bit less placed in bonds
(about 35 percent) and other investments. For more information on investing
in retirement accounts, see Chapter 11.
Sticking with your allocations: Don’t trade
The allocation of your investment dollars should be driven by your goals and
desire to take risk. As you get older, gradually scaling back on the riskiness
(and therefore growth potential) of your portfolio generally makes sense.
Don’t tinker with your portfolio daily, weekly, monthly, or even annually.
(Every three to five years or so, you may want to rebalance your holdings to
get your mix to a desired asset allocation, as discussed in the previous sec-
tion.) You should not engage in trading with the hopes of buying into a hot
investment and selling your losers. Jumping onto a “winner” and dumping a
“loser” may provide some short-term psychological comfort, but in the long-
term, such an investment strategy can produce below-average returns.
When an investment gets front-page coverage and everyone is talking about
its stunning rise, it’s definitely time to take a reality check. The higher the
value of an investment rises, the greater the danger that it’s overpriced.
Its next move may be downward. Don’t follow the herd.
During the late 1990s, many technology stocks (especially Internet) had spec-
tacular rises, thus attracting a lot of attention. Just because the U.S. economy
is increasingly becoming technology-based, it doesn’t mean that any price
you pay for a technology stock is fine. Some investors who neglected to do
basic research and bought into the attention-grabbing, high-flying technology
stocks lost 80 percent or more of their investments in the early 2000s — ouch!
166
Part III: Building Wealth with Wise Investing 

Conversely, when things look bleak (as when stocks in general suffered signif-
icant losses in the early 2000s), giving up hope is easy — who wants to be
associated with a loser? However, investors who forget about their overall
asset allocation plan and panic and sell after a major decline miss out on a
tremendous buying opportunity.
Many people like buying everything from clothing to cars to ketchup on sale —
yet whenever the stock market has a clearance sale, most investors stampede
for the exits instead of snatching up great buys. Demonstrate your courage;
don’t follow the herd.
Investing lump sums via 
dollar-cost averaging
When you have a large chunk of cash to invest — whether you received it
from an accumulation of funds over the years, an inheritance, or a recent
windfall from work you’ve done — you may have a problem deciding what
to do with it. Many people, of course, would like to have your problem.
(You’re not complaining, right?) You want to invest your money, but you’re a
bit skittish, if not outright terrified, at the prospect of investing the lump of
money all at once.
If the money is residing in a savings or money market account, you may feel
like it’s wasting away. You want to put it to work! My first words of advice are
“Don’t rush.” Nothing is wrong with earning a small return in a money market
account. (See Chapter 12 for my recommendations of the best money funds.)
Remember that a money market fund beats the heck out of rushing into an
investment in which you may lose 20 percent or more. I sometimes get calls
from people in a state of near panic. Typically, these folks have CDs coming
due, and they feel that they must decide exactly where they want to invest
the money in the 48 hours before the CD matures.
Take a deeeep breath. You have absolutely no reason to rush into an impor-
tant decision. Tell your friendly banker that when the CD matures, you want
to put the proceeds into the bank’s highest-yielding savings or money market
account. That way, your money continues to earn interest while you buy
yourself some breathing room.
One approach to investing is called dollar-cost averaging (DCA). With DCA,
you invest your money in equal chunks on a regular basis — such as once a
month — into a diversified group of investments.
167
Chapter 8: Important Investment Concepts

For example, if you have $60,000 to invest, you can invest $2,500 per month
until it’s all invested, which takes a couple years. The money awaiting future
investment isn’t lying fallow; you keep it in a money market account so it can
earn a bit of interest while waiting its turn.
The attraction of DCA is that it allows you to ease into riskier investments
instead of jumping in all at once. If the price of the investment drops after
some of your initial purchases, you can buy some later at a lower price. If you
dump all your money into the “sure win” investment all at once and then it
drops like a stone, you’ll be kicking yourself for not waiting. (The flip side of
DCA is that when your investment of choice appreciates in value, you may
wish that you had invested your money faster.)
168
Part III: Building Wealth with Wise Investing 
Keeping your investing wits 
during uncertain times
During times like the early 2000s, some investors
abandon the stock market for good. That’s why
the rebound from a severe bear market — and
the down stock-market cycle that began in 2000
has been the worst in magnitude and duration in
decades — takes time to develop. Although some
people who have been burned badly learn that
they’re not cut out for stock investing, the rest of
us should take stock of our investing approaches
and adjust our practices and expectations.
In the early 2000s, the stock market began
falling — with some growth stocks, especially
technology stocks, plunging like stocks do in a
depression. Layoffs mounted, and September 11
undermined consumer confidence. Then the gen-
eral public learned that some major companies —
Enron, WorldCom, and Global Crossing — pulled
the wool over investors’ eyes with shady account-
ing techniques that artificially inflated earnings.
Concern about further terrorist attacks, small-
pox, and war with Iraq (and perhaps other
nations) hung like dark clouds on the horizon.
I see many similarities between the early 2000s
and the early 1970s, when a multitude of problems
(that could not have been predicted) unfolded.
The early ’70s saw record trade and budget
deficits, inflation was rearing its ugly head, and
we had the invasion of Cambodia, the Arab oil
embargo, gas lines, and that period’s Arab-Israeli
conflict — the Yom Kippur War. Vice President
Spiro Agnew resigned over the exposure of his
personal income tax evasion and acceptance of
bribes while working in Maryland’s government.
Then news of Watergate broke, and Nixon’s
impeachment hearings began. After flirting with
the 1,000 level since 1966, the Dow Jones
Industrial Average plunged below 600 after Nixon
resigned in 1974. Many investors soured on stocks
and swore off the market forever. That reaction
was unfortunate, because even with the recent,
severe stock market decline, stocks are still 15-
fold higher today than they were back in 1974.
Don’t let a poor string of events sour you on stock
investing. History has repeatedly proven that
continuing to buy stocks during down markets
increases your long-term returns. Throwing in
the towel is the worst thing you can do in a
slumping market. And don’t waste time trying to
find a way to beat the system. Buy and hold a
diversified portfolio of stocks. Remember that
the financial markets reward investors for
accepting risk and uncertainty.

Another drawback of DCA is that you may get cold feet as you continue to
pour money into an investment that’s dropping in value. Many people who
are attracted to DCA because they fear that they may buy before a price drop
end up bailing out of what feels like a sinking ship.
DCA can also cause headaches with your taxes when the time comes to sell
investments held outside retirement accounts. When you buy an investment
at many different times and prices, the accounting becomes muddied as you
sell blocks of the investment.
DCA is most valuable when the money you want to invest represents a large
portion of your total assets and you can stick to a schedule. Make DCA auto-
matic so that you’re less likely to chicken out should the investment fall after
your initial purchases. Most of the investment firms I recommend in the next
few chapters provide automatic exchange services.
Acknowledging Differences 
among Investment Firms
Thousands of firms sell investments and manage money. Banks, mutual fund
companies, securities brokerage firms, and even insurance companies all vie
for your dollars.
Just to make matters more complicated, each industry plays in the others’
backyards. You can find mutual fund companies that offer securities broker-
age, insurance firms that are in the mutual fund business, and mutual fund
companies that offer banklike accounts and services. You may benefit from
this competition and one-stop shopping convenience. On the other hand,
some firms are novices at particular businesses and count on some people’s
shopping by brand-name recognition.
Focusing on the best firms
Make sure that you do business with a firm that
 Offers the best value investments in comparison to their competitors.
Value is the combination of performance (including service) and cost.
Given the level of risk that you’re comfortable with, you want invest-
ments that offer higher rates of return, but you don’t want to have to
pay a small fortune for them. Commissions, management fees, mainte-
nance fees, and other charges can turn a high-performance investment
into a mediocre or poor one.
169
Chapter 8: Important Investment Concepts

 Employs representatives who do not have an inherent self-interest in
steering you into a particular type of investment. This criterion has
nothing to do with whether an investment firm hires polite, well-educated,
or well-dressed people. The most important factor is the way the com-
pany compensates its employees. If the investment firm’s personnel are
paid on commission, pass on that firm. Give preference to investing
firms that don’t tempt their employees to push one investment over
another in order to generate more fees.
No-load (commission-free) mutual fund companies
Mutual funds are an ideal investment vehicle for most investors. No-load
mutual fund companies are firms through which you can invest in mutual
funds without paying sales commissions. In other words, every dollar you
invest goes to work in the mutual funds you choose — nothing is siphoned
off to pay sales commissions. See Chapter 10 for details on investing in
mutual funds.
Discount brokers
In one of the most beneficial changes for investors in this century, the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) deregulated the retail brokerage
industry on May 1, 1975. Prior to this date, investors were charged fixed 
commissions when they bought or sold stocks, bonds, and other securities.
In other words, no matter which brokerage firm an investor did business with,
the cost of the firm’s services was set (and the level of commissions was high).
After the 1975 deregulation, brokerage firms could charge people whatever
their little hearts desired.
Competition inevitably resulted in more and better choices. Many new 
brokerage firms (that didn’t do business the old way) opened. They were
dubbed discount brokers because the fees they charged customers were sub-
stantially lower than what brokers charged under the old fixed-fee system.
Even more important than saving customers money, discount brokers 
established a vastly improved compensation system that greatly reduced
conflicts of interest. Discount brokers generally pay the salaries of their brokers.
The term discount broker is actually not an enlightening one. It’s certainly true
that this new breed of brokerage firm saves you lots of money when you invest.
You can easily save 50 to 80 percent through the major discount brokers.
But these firms’ investments are not “on sale” or “second-rate.” Discount 
brokers are simply brokers without major conflicts of interest. Of course,
like any other for-profit enterprise, they’re in business to make money, but
they’re much less likely to steer you wrong for their own benefit.
Be careful of discount brokers selling load mutual funds. (I discuss the rea-
sons you should shun these brokers in Chapter 10.)
170
Part III: Building Wealth with Wise Investing 

Places to consider avoiding
The worst places to invest are those that charge you a lot, have mediocre- or
poor-performing investments, and have major conflicts of interest. The prime
conflict of interest arises when investment firms pay their brokers commissions
on the basis of what and how much they sell. The result: The investment firms
sell lots of stuff that pays fat commissions, and they churn, or cause a rapid
turnover of, your account. (Because each transaction has a fee, the more you
buy and sell, the more money they make.)
Some folks who call themselves financial planners or financial consultants
work on commission. In addition to working at the bigger brokerage firms,
many of them belong to so-called broker-dealer networks, which provide back-
office support and investment products to sell. When a person claiming to be
a financial planner or advisor is part of a broker-dealer network, odds are
quite high that you’re dealing with an investment salesperson. See Chapter 18
for more background on the financial planning industry and questions to ask
an advisor you’re thinking about hiring.
Commissions and their impact on human behavior
Investment products bring in widely varying commissions. The products that
bring in the highest commissions tend to be the ones that money-hungry bro-
kers push the hardest.
Table 8-5 lists the commissions that you pay and that come out of your invest-
ment dollars when you work with brokers, financial consultants, and financial
planners who work on commission.

What to do when you’re fleeced by a broker
You can’t sue a broker just because you lose
money on that person’s investment recommen-
dations. However, if you have been the victim of
one of the following cardinal financial sins, you
may have some legal recourse:
 Misrepresentation and omission: If you
were told, for example, that a particular
investment guarantees returns of 15 per-
cent per year and then the investment ends
up plunging in value by 50 percent, you
were misled. Misrepresentation can also be
charged if you’re sold an investment with
hefty commissions after you were originally
told that it was commission-free.
 Unsuitable investments: Retirees who need
access to their capital are often advised to
invest in limited partnerships (or LPs, dis-
cussed in Chapter 9) for safe, high yields.
The yields on most LPs end up being anything
but safe. LP investors have also discovered
how illiquid (or not readily converted into
cash) their investments are — some can’t
be liquidated for up to ten years or more.
 Churning: If your broker or financial planner
is constantly trading your investments, odds
are that his or her weekly commission check
is benefiting at your expense.
 Rogue elephant salespeople: When your
planner or broker buys or sells without your
approval or ignores your request to make a
change, you may be able to collect for losses
caused by these actions.
Two major types of practitioners — securities
lawyers and arbitration consultants — stand
ready to help you recover your lost money. You
can find securities lawyers by looking under
“Attorneys — Securities” in the Yellow Pages or
calling your local bar association for referrals.
Arbitration consultants can be found in the phone
book under “Arbitrators.” If you come up dry, try
contacting business writers at a major news-
paper in your area or at your favorite personal
finance magazine. These sources may be able to
give you names and numbers of folks they know.
Most lawyers and consultants work on a 
contingency-fee basis — they get a percentage
of damages (about 20 to 40 percent of the
amount collected). They also often ask for an
upfront fee, ranging from several hundred to
several thousands of dollars, to help them cover
their expenses and time. If they take your case
and lose, they generally keep the upfront
money. Securities lawyers are usually a more
expensive option.
You may want to go to arbitration — an agree-
ment you made (probably without realizing it)
when you set up an account to work with the
broker or planner. Arbitration is usually much
quicker, cheaper, and easier than going to court.
You can even choose to represent yourself.
Both sides present their case to a panel of three
arbitrators. The arbitrators then make a decision
that neither side can squabble over or appeal.
If you decide to prepare for arbitration by yourself,
the nonprofit American Arbitration Association
can send you a package of background materi-
als to help with your case. Check your phone
directory for a local branch, or contact the asso-
ciation’s headquarters (335 Madison Avenue,
10th Floor, New York, NY 10017-4605; 800-778-
7879; Web site www.adr.org).

Besides the fact that you can never be sure that you’re getting an unbiased
recommendation from a salesperson working on commission, you’re wasting
money unnecessarily. All good investments can be bought on a no-load
(commission-free) basis. For example, you can purchase no-load mutual
funds.
When you’re unsure about an investment product that’s being pitched to you
(and even when you are sure), ask for a copy of the prospectus. In the first
few pages, check out whether the investment includes a commission (also
known as a load). Although salespeople can hide behind obscure titles such
as vice president or financial consultant, a prospectus must detail whether
the investment carries a commission.
Investment salespeople’s conflicts of interest
Financial consultants (also known as stockbrokers), financial planners, and
others who sell investment products can have enormous conflicts of interest
when recommending strategies and specific investment products. Commissions
and other financial incentives can’t help but skew the advice of even the
most earnest and otherwise well-intentioned salespeople.
Numerous conflicts of interest can damage your investment portfolio. The fol-
lowing are the most common conflicts to watch out for:
 Pushing higher-commission products: As I discuss earlier in this chap-
ter, commissions on investment products vary tremendously. Products
like limited partnerships, commodities, options, and futures are at the
worst end of the spectrum for you (and the best end of the spectrum for
a salesperson). Investments such as no-load mutual funds and Treasury
bills that are 100 percent commission-free are at the best end of the
spectrum for you (and therefore, the worst end of the spectrum for a
salesperson).
Surprisingly, commission-based brokers and financial planners don’t
have to give you the prospectus (where commissions are detailed)
before you buy a financial product that carries commissions (as with a
load mutual fund). In contrast, commission-free investment companies,
such as no-load mutual fund companies, must send a prospectus before
taking a mutual fund order. Commission-based investment salespeople
should also be required to provide a prospectus and disclose any com-
missions upfront and in writing before making a sale. I suppose that if
they were actually required to follow these guidelines, more people
would choose to buy investments elsewhere — and politicians might
start telling the truth!
173
Chapter 8: Important Investment Concepts

 Recommending active trading: Investment salespeople often advise you
to trade frequently into and out of different securities. They usually base
their advice on current news events or an analyst’s comments on the
security. Sometimes these moves are valid, but more often they’re not.
In extreme cases, brokers trade on a monthly basis. By the end of the
year, they’ve churned through your entire portfolio. Needless to say, all
these transactions cost you big money in trading fees.
Diversified mutual funds (see Chapter 10) make more sense for most
people. You can invest in mutual funds free of sales commissions.
Besides saving money on commissions, you earn better long-term
returns by having an expert money manager work for you.
 Failing to recommend investing through retirement plans: If you’re not
taking advantage of retirement savings plans (see Chapter 11), you may
be missing out on valuable tax benefits. The initial contributions to most
retirement plans are tax-deductible, and your money compounds with-
out taxation over the years. An investment salesperson is not likely to
recommend that you contribute to your employer’s retirement plan —
a 401(k) for example. Such contributions cut into the money you have
available to invest with your friendly salesperson.
If you’re self-employed, salespeople are somewhat more likely to recom-
mend that you fund a retirement plan because they can set up such
plans for you. You’re better off setting up a retirement plan through 
a no-load mutual fund company (see Chapters 10 and 11).
 Pushing high-fee products: Many of the brokerage firms that used to sell
investment products only on commission moved into fee-based invest-
ment management. This change is an improvement for investors because
it reduces some of the conflicts of interest caused by commissions.
On the other hand, these brokers charge extraordinarily high fees, which
are usually quoted as a percentage of assets under management, on their
managed-investment (or wrap) accounts. For more information, see the
“Wrap (or managed) accounts” sidebar.
Valuing brokerage research
Brokerage firms and the brokers who work for them frequently argue that
their research is better. With their insights and recommendations, they say,
you’ll do better and “beat the market averages.”
Wall Street analysts are often overly optimistic when it comes to predicting
corporate profits. If analysts were simply inaccurate or bad estimators, you’d
expect that they’d sometimes underestimate and, at other times, overesti-
mate companies’ earnings. The discrepancy identifies yet another conflict of
interest among many of the brokerage firms.
174
Part III: Building Wealth with Wise Investing 

Brokerage firm analysts are reluctant to write a negative report about a com-
pany because the firms these analysts work for also solicit companies to
issue new stock to the public. What better way to show businesses your
potential for selling shares to the public at a high price than by showing how
much you believe in certain companies and writing glowing reports about
their future prospects?
175
Chapter 8: Important Investment Concepts
Wrap (or managed) accounts
Wrap accounts (also called managed accounts)
are all the rage among commission-based bro-
kerage firms. These accounts go by a variety of
names, but they’re all similar in that they charge
a fixed percentage of the assets under man-
agement to invest your money through money
managers.
Wrap accounts can be poor investments because
their management expenses may be extraordi-
narily high — up to 3 percent per year (some
even higher) of assets under management.
Remember that in the long haul, stocks can
return about 10 percent per year before taxes.
So if you’re paying 3 percent per year to have
your money managed in stocks, 30 percent of
your return (before taxes) is siphoned off. But
don’t forget — because the government sure
won’t — that you pay a good chunk of money in
taxes on your 10 percent return as well. So the
3 percent wrap actually ends up depleting 40 to
50 percent of your after-tax profits!
The best no-load (commission-free) mutual
funds offer investors access to the nation’s best
investment managers for a fraction of the cost
of wrap accounts. You can invest in dozens of
top-performing funds for an annual expense of
1 percent per year or less. Some of the best fund
companies offer excellent funds for a cost as
low as 0.2 to 0.5 percent (see Chapter 10).
You may be told, in the marketing of wrap
accounts, that you’re getting access to invest-
ment managers who don’t normally take money
from small-fry investors like you. Not a single
study shows that the performance of money
managers has anything to do with the minimum
account they handle. Besides, no-load mutual
funds hire many of the same managers who
work at other money management firms.
You also may be told that you’ll earn a higher
rate of return, so the extra cost is worth it. “You
could have earned 18 to 25 percent per year,”
they say, “had you invested with the ‘Star of
Yesterday’ investment management company.”
The key word here is had. History is history.
Many of yesterday’s winners become tomor-
row’s losers or mediocre performers.
You also need to remember that, unlike mutual
funds, whose performance records are audited
by the SEC, wrap account performance records
may include marketing hype. Showing only the
performance of selected accounts — those that
performed the best — is the most common ploy.

Seeing through Experts Who 
Predict the Future
Believing that you can increase your investment returns by following the
prognostications of certain gurus is a common mistake that some investors
make. Many of us may want to believe that some experts can predict the
future of the investment world. Believing in gurus makes it easier to accept
the risk you know you’re taking when trying to make your money grow.
The sage predictions that you read in an investment newsletter or hear
from an “expert” who is repeatedly quoted in financial publications make
you feel protected — sort of like Linus and his security blanket.
Investment newsletter subscribers and guru followers would be better off
buying a warm blanket instead — it has a lot more value and costs a whole
lot less! No one can predict the future. If they could, they’d be so busy invest-
ing their own money and getting rich that they wouldn’t have the time and
desire to share their secrets with you.
Investment newsletters
Many investment newsletters purport to time the markets, telling you exactly
the right time to get into and out of certain stocks or mutual funds (or the
financial markets in general). Such an approach is doomed to failure in the
long run. By failure, I mean that this approach won’t beat the tried-and-true
strategy of buy and hold.
I see people paying hundreds of dollars annually to subscribe to all sorts of
market-timing and stock-picking newsletters. One client of mine, an attorney,
subscribed to several newsletters. When I asked him why, he said that their
marketing materials claimed that if you followed their advice, you would
make a 20 percent per year return on your money. But in the four years that
he’d followed their advice, he actually lost money, despite appreciating finan-
cial markets overall.
Before you ever consider subscribing to any investment newsletter, examine
its historic track record through avenues such as Hulbert Financial Digest.
The investment newsletter’s marketing materials typically hype the supposed
returns that the publication’s recommendations have produced. Sadly, newslet-
ters seem to be able to make lots of bogus claims without suffering the timely
wrath of securities regulators.

Don’t get predictive advice from newsletters. If newsletter writers were so
smart about the future of financial markets, they’d be making lots more
money as money managers. The only types of investment newsletters and
periodicals that you should consider subscribing to are those that offer
research and information rather than predictions. I discuss the investment
newsletters that fit the bill in the subsequent investment chapters.
Investment gurus
Investment gurus come and go. Some of them get their 15 minutes of fame
on the basis of one or two successful predictions that someone in the press
remembers (and makes famous). A classic example is a former market ana-
lyst at Shearson named Elaine Garzarelli.
Garzarelli became famous for predicting the stock market’s plummet in the fall
of 1987. Her fund, Smith Barney Shearson Sector Analysis, was established just
before the crash. Supposedly, Garzarelli’s indicators warned her to stay out
of stocks, which she did, and in doing so, she saved her fund from the plunge.
Shearson, being a money-minded brokerage, quickly motivated its brokers to
sell shares in Garzarelli’s fund. In addition to her having avoided the crash, it
didn’t hurt that Shearson brokers were being rewarded with a hefty 5 percent
sales commission for selling her fund. By the end of 1987, investors had poured
nearly $700 million into this fund.
In 1988, Garzarelli’s fund was the worst-performing fund among funds invest-
ing in growth stocks. From 1988 to 1990, Garzarelli’s fund underperformed
the Standard & Poor 500 average by about 43 percent! In 1987 — the year
of the crash — Garzarelli had outperformed the S&P 500 by about 26 percent.
So the amount she saved her investors by avoiding the crash was lost — along
with more — in the years that followed. In fact, Garzarelli’s performance was
so dismal in the years following the crash that Shearson eventually fired her.
Despite her poor long-term track record, Garzarelli is still quoted as a market
soothsayer. She now manages money privately and hawks investment
newsletters. The following marketing hype, promoting her newsletter,
recently appeared in a mailed brochure entitled “The Garzarelli Edge”:
“The proven, scientific system that has produced compounded yearly
gains of 20.2% since 1982!”
“Elaine Garzarelli has called every major turn in the Dow since 1982.”
177
Chapter 8: Important Investment Concepts

Now, if these comments were true, why did Garzarelli’s investment fund per-
form so poorly, and why did Shearson fire her in the mid-1990s following
numerous years of inaccurate predictions and the dismal performance of her
mutual fund? I also find it humorous that the 20.2 percent return was report-
edly “audited by a Big-6 accounting firm.” Down in the fine print, however, it
says, “Audit Pending.” I bet it’s still pending — probably with the same folks
who audited Enron’s financials (and went under)!
New gurus often get exposure and gain popularity through television. Anyone
who’s done some channel flipping couldn’t help but notice Jim Cramer’s flail-
ing arms, loud voice, and crazed looking expressions! I’ve watched portions
of his CNBC show on numerous occasions and had followed his career for
years prior to his arrival on cable television.
Back in the 1990s, SmartMoney magazine did a big article on Cramer, which
purported to show what a great stock picker he was with the hedge fund
(more on such funds in Chapter 9) that he ran at the time. The article showed
Cramer’s supposedly high hedge fund returns. However, when I inquired, I
learned that all those returns were self-reported by Cramer. I tried on several
occasions to contact his company and get more details and documentation
and was routinely blown off.
I have long counseled that you should never believe a claimed return unless
it’s been independently audited (the way that all mutual fund returns are).
To date, I’ve never seen an independent audit of Cramer’s claimed hedge fund
returns. When I contacted his organization, they simply sent me the same
unaudited returns similar to what they provided to SmartMoney magazine.
As for the track record of Cramer’s online newsletter, the Hulbert Financial
Digest is the only independent organization that tracks the recommendations
of newsletter writers. According to John Kimble, senior analyst with Hulbert
Financial, “A couple of years ago, they asked us if we wanted to be on the 
distribution list for their Action Alerts Plus online newsletter and they sent
us e-mails for about six weeks and then stopped. Mark Hulbert sent them a
reminder six months ago and they still haven’t sent it.”
Commentators and experts who publish predictive newsletters and are 
interviewed in the media can’t predict the future. Ignore the predictions and
speculations of self-proclaimed gurus and investment soothsayers. The few
people who have a slight leg up on everyone else aren’t going to share their
investment secrets — they’re too busy investing their own money! If you have
to believe in something to offset your fears, believe in good information and
proven investment managers. And don’t forget the value of optimism, faith,
and hope — regardless of what or whom you believe in!

Leaving You with Some Final Advice
I cover a lot of ground in this chapter. In the remaining chapters in this part, I
detail different investment choices and accounts and how to build a champion
portfolio! Before you move on, here are several other issues to keep in mind
as you make important investing choices:
 Don’t invest based on sales solicitations. Companies that advertise and
solicit prospective customers aggressively with tactics such as telemar-
keting offer some of the worst financial products with the highest fees.
Companies with great products don’t have to reach their potential cus-
tomers this way. Of course, all companies have to do some promotion.
But the companies with the best investment offerings don’t have to use
the hard-sell approach; they get plenty of new business through the
word-of-mouth recommendations of satisfied customers.
 Don’t invest in what you don’t understand. The mistake of not under-
standing the investments you purchase usually follows from the preceding
no-no — buying into a sales pitch. When you don’t understand an invest-
ment, odds are good that it won’t be right for you. Slick-tongued brokers
(who may call themselves financial consultants, advisors, or planners)
who earn commissions based on what they sell can talk you into inap-
propriate investments. Before you invest in anything, you should know
its track record, its true costs, and how liquid (easily convertible to cash)
it is.
 Minimize fees. Avoid investments that carry high sales commissions and
management expenses (usually disclosed in a prospectus). Virtually all
investments today can be purchased without a salesperson. Besides
paying unnecessary commissions, the bigger danger in investing through
a salesperson is that you may be directed to a path that’s not in your best
interests. Management fees create a real drag on investment returns.
Not surprisingly, higher-fee investments, on average, perform worse
than alternatives with lower fees. High ongoing management fees often
go toward lavish offices, glossy brochures, and skyscraper salaries, or
toward propping up small, inefficient operations. Do you want your
hard-earned dollars to support either of these types of businesses?
 Pay attention to tax consequences. Even if you never become an invest-
ment expert, you’re smart enough to know that the more money you pay
in taxes, the less you have for investing and playing with. See Chapter 11
for info on how retirement accounts can help boost your investment
returns. For investments outside retirement accounts, you need to match
the types of investments to your tax situation (see Chapter 12).

Investment Choices

W
hich vehicle you choose for your investment journey depends on
where you’re going, how fast you want to get there, and what risks
you’re willing to take along the way. If you haven’t yet read Chapter 8, please
do so now. In it, I cover a number of investment concepts, such as the differ-
ence between lending and ownership investments, that will enhance your
ability to choose among the common investment vehicles I discuss in this
chapter.
Slow and Steady Investments
Everyone should have some money in stable, safe investment vehicles.
For example, this would include money that you’ve earmarked for your 
short-term bills, both expected and unexpected. Likewise, if you’re saving
money for a home purchase within the next few years, you certainly don’t
want to risk that money on the roller coaster of the stock market.
The investment options that follow are appropriate for money you don’t want
to put at great risk.

Transaction/checking accounts
Transaction/checking accounts are best used for depositing your monthly
income and paying for your expenditures. If you want to have unlimited
check-writing privileges and access to your money with an ATM card, check-
ing accounts at local banks are often your best bet.
Here’s how not to be taken by banks:
 Use a smaller bank or credit union. You can generally get a better
checking account deal at a credit union or a smaller bank. Because you
can easily obtain cash through ATM outlets in supermarkets and other
retail stores, you may not need to do business with Big City Bank, which
has branch offices at every intersection.
 Shop around. Some banks don’t require you to maintain a minimum bal-
ance to avoid a monthly service charge when you direct deposit your
paychecks. Make sure that you shop around for accounts that don’t ding
you $1.50 here for the use of an ATM and $12 there for a low balance.
 Limit the amount you keep in checking. Keep only enough money in
the account for your monthly bill payment needs. If you consistently
keep more than a few thousand dollars in a checking account, get the
excess out. You can earn more in a savings or money market account,
which I describe in the following section.
 Don’t do your checking through the bank. Some folks (myself included)
don’t have a bank checking account. How do they do that? They have
discount brokerage accounts that allow unlimited check-writing within
a money market fund. (See Chapter 10 for recommended firms; also see
my discussion in Chapter 19 about paying your bills via your computer
and through other automatic means.)
Savings accounts and money market funds
Savings accounts are available through banks; money market funds are avail-
able through mutual fund companies. Savings accounts and money market
funds are nearly identical, except that money market funds generally pay a
better rate of interest. The interest rate paid to you, also known as the yield,
fluctuates over time, depending on the level of interest rates in the overall
economy. (Note that some banks offer money market accounts, which are
basically like savings accounts and should not be confused with money
market mutual funds.)
182
Part III: Building Wealth with Wise Investing 

The federal government backs bank savings accounts with Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance. Money market funds are not insured.
You shouldn’t give preference to a bank account just because your investment
(principal) is insured. In fact, your preference should lean toward money
market funds, because the better ones are higher yielding than the better bank
savings accounts. And money market funds offer check writing and other easy
ways to access your money (for more on money funds, please see Chapter 10).
Money market funds have several advantages over bank savings accounts:
 The best money market funds have higher yields.
 If you’re in a higher tax bracket, you may net more after factoring in
taxes using tax-free money market funds. No savings account pays tax-
free interest.
 Most money market funds come with free check-writing privileges.
(The only stipulation is that each check must be written for a minimum
amount — $250 is common.)
As with money you put into bank savings accounts, money market funds are
suitable for money that you can’t afford to see dwindle in value.
Bonds
When you invest in a bond, you effectively lend your money to an organization.
When a bond is issued, it includes a specified maturity date at which time the
principal will be repaid. Bonds are also issued at a particular interest rate, or
what’s known as a coupon. This rate is fixed on most bonds. So, for example,
if you buy a five-year, 6 percent bond issued by Home Depot, you’re lending
your money to Home Depot for five years at an interest rate of 6 percent per
year. (Bond interest is usually paid in two equal, semi-annual installments.)
The value of a bond generally fluctuates with changes in interest rates. For
example, if you’re holding a bond issued at 6 percent and rates increase to
8 percent on comparable, newly issued bonds, your bond decreases in value.
(Why would anyone want to buy your bond at the price you paid if it yields
just 6 percent and 8 percent can be obtained elsewhere?)
Some bonds are tied to variable interest rates. For example, you can buy bonds
that are adjustable-rate mortgages, on which the interest rate can fluctuate.
As an investor, you’re actually lending your money to a mortgage borrower —
indirectly, you’re the banker making a loan to someone buying a home.
183
Chapter 9: Understanding Your Investment Choices

Bonds differ from one another in the following major ways:
 The type of institution to which you’re lending your money: With 
municipal bonds, you lend your money to the state government; with
Treasuries, you lend your money to the federal government; with GNMAs
(Ginnie Maes), you lend your money to a mortgage holder; with corporate
bonds, you lend your money to a corporation.
 The credit quality of the borrower to whom you lend your money:
This refers to the probability that the borrower will pay you the interest
and return your principal as agreed.
 The length of maturity of the bond: Short-term bonds mature within a
few years, intermediate bonds within 3 to 10 years, and long-term bonds
within 30 years. Longer-term bonds generally pay higher yields but fluc-
tuate more with changes in interest rates.
Bonds are rated by major credit-rating agencies for their safety, usually on a
scale where AAA is the highest possible rating. For example, high-grade cor-
porate bonds (AAA or AA) are considered the safest (that is, most likely to
pay you back). Next in safety are general bonds (A or BBB), which are still
safe but just a little less so. Junk bonds (rated BB or lower), popularized by
Michael Milken, are actually not all that junky; they’re just lower in quality
and have a slight (1 or 2 percent) probability of default.
Some bonds are callable, which means that the lender can decide to pay you
back earlier than the previously agreed-upon date. This event usually occurs
when interest rates fall and the lender wants to issue new, lower-interest-rate
bonds to replace the higher-rate bonds outstanding. To compensate you for
early repayment, the lender typically gives you a small premium over what
the bond is currently valued at.
184
Part III: Building Wealth with Wise Investing 
The overused certificate of deposit
A certificate of deposit (CD) is another type of
bond that’s issued by a bank. With a CD, as with
a real bond, you agree to lend your money to an
organization (in this case, a bank) for a prede-
termined number of months or years. Generally,
the longer you agree to lock up your money, the
higher the interest rate you receive.
With CDs, you pay a penalty for early with-
drawal. If you want your money back before the
end of the CD’s term, you get whacked with the
loss of a number of months’ worth of interest.
CDs also don’t tend to pay very competitive
interest rates. You can usually beat the interest
rate on shorter-term CDs (those that mature
within a year or so) with the best money market
mutual funds, which offer complete liquidity
without any penalty.

Building Wealth with 
Ownership Vehicles
The three best legal ways to build wealth are to invest in stocks, real estate,
and small business. I found this to be true from observing many clients and
other investors and from my own personal experiences.
Stocks
Stocks, which represent shares of ownership in a company, are the most
common ownership investment vehicle. When companies go public, they
issue shares of stock that people like you and I can purchase on the major
stock exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock
Exchange, and NASDAQ (National Association of Securities Dealers Automated
Quotation system), or on the over-the-counter market.
As the economy grows and companies grow with it and earn greater profits,
stock prices (and dividend payouts on those stocks) generally follow suit.
Stock prices and dividends don’t move in lockstep with earnings, but over
the years, the relationship is pretty close. In fact, the price/earnings ratio —
which measures the level of stock prices relative to (or divided by) company
earnings — of U.S. stocks has averaged approximately 15 (although it’s tended
to be higher during periods of low inflation). A price-earnings ratio of 15 simply
means that stock prices per share, on average, are selling at about 15 times
those companies’ earnings per share.
Companies that issue stock (called publicly held companies) include automo-
bile manufacturers, computer software producers, fast-food restaurants,
hotels, magazine and newspaper publishers, supermarkets, wineries, zipper
manufacturers, and everything in between! (You can even invest overseas —
see the “International stocks” sidebar.) By contrast, some companies are 
privately held, which means that they’ve elected to have their stock owned
by senior management and a small number of affluent investors. Privately
held companies’ stocks do not trade on a stock exchange, so folks like you
and me can’t buy stock in such firms.
Companies differ in what industry or line of business they’re in and also in size.
In the financial press, you often hear companies referred to by their market
capitalization, which is the value of their outstanding stock (the number of total
shares multiplied by the market price per share). When describing the sizes
of companies, Wall Street has done away with such practical adjectives as big
and small and replaced them with expressions like large cap and small cap
(where cap stands for capitalization). Such is the language of financial geekiness.
185
Chapter 9: Understanding Your Investment Choices

Investing in the stock market involves occasional setbacks and difficult
moments (just like raising children or going mountain climbing), but the
overall journey should be worth the effort. Over the past two centuries, the
U.S. stock market has produced an annual average rate of return of about
10 percent. However, the market, as measured by the Dow Jones Industrial
Average, fell more than 20 percent during 16 different periods in the 20th cen-
tury. On average, these periods of decline lasted less than two years. So if
you can withstand a temporary setback over a few years, the stock market is
a proven place to invest for long-term growth.
186
Part III: Building Wealth with Wise Investing 
International stocks
Not only can you invest in company stocks that
trade on the U.S. stock exchanges, but you can
also invest in stocks overseas. Aside from folks
with business connections abroad, why would
the average citizen want to invest in stocks
overseas?
I can give you several reasons. First, many invest-
ing opportunities exist overseas. If you look at
the total value of all stocks outstanding world-
wide, the value of U.S. stocks is in the minority.
Another reason for investing in international
stocks is that when you confine your investing to
U.S. securities, you miss a world of opportunities,
not only because of business growth available
in other countries but also because you get the
opportunity to diversify your portfolio even further.
International securities markets don’t move in
tandem with U.S. markets. During various U.S.
stock market drops, some international stock mar-
kets drop less, while others actually rise in value.
Some people hesitate to invest in overseas
securities for silly reasons. One column I came
across in a big city paper was entitled “Plenty
of Pitfalls in Foreign Investing: Timing is all in
earning a decent return.” The piece went on to
say, “But as with sex, commuting and baseball,
timing is everything in the stock market.” Smart
stock market investors know better than to try to
time their investments. The piece also ominously
warned, “Foreign stock markets have been
known to evaporate overnight.” I wish I could
say the same for the jobs of some bone-headed
financial journalists!
Others are concerned that overseas investing
hurts the U.S. economy and contributes to a loss
of American jobs. I have some counterargu-
ments. First, if you don’t profit from the growth of
economies overseas, someone else will. If there’s
money to be made, Americans may as well be
there to participate. Profits from a foreign com-
pany are distributed to all stockholders, no matter
where they live. Dividends and stock price
appreciation know no national boundaries.
Also, recognize that you already live in a global
economy — making a distinction between U.S.
and non-U.S. companies is no longer appropri-
ate. Many companies that are headquartered in
the United States also have overseas opera-
tions. Some U.S. firms derive a large portion of
their revenue from their international divisions.
Conversely, many firms based overseas also
have U.S. operations. An increasing number of
companies are worldwide operations. You don’t
get the full benefit of international investing by
buying just large multinational companies head-
quartered in the United States. The overseas
diversification advantage is obtained by investing
in companies that trade on foreign exchanges.

You can invest in stocks by making your own selection of individual stocks or
by letting a mutual fund manager (discussed in Chapter 10) do it for you.
Discovering the relative advantages of mutual funds
Efficiently managed mutual funds offer investors of both modest and substan-
tial means low-cost access to high-quality money managers. Mutual funds
span the spectrum of risk and potential returns, from nonfluctuating money
market funds (which are similar to savings accounts) to bond funds (which
generally pay higher yields than money market funds but fluctuate with
changes in interest rates) to stock funds (which offer the greatest potential
for appreciation but also the greatest short-term volatility).
Investing in individual securities should be done only by those who really
enjoy doing it. Mutual funds, if properly selected, are a low-cost, quality way
to hire professional money managers. Over the long haul, you’re not going to
beat full-time professional managers who are investing in the securities of the
same type and risk level. Chapter 10 is devoted to mutual funds.
Understanding exchange traded and hedge 
funds and managed accounts
Mutual funds aren’t the only game in town when it comes to hiring a profes-
sional money manager. In recent years, three somewhat similar options have
been increasingly promoted to individual investors:
 Exchange traded funds (ETFs): These are the most similar to mutual
funds except that they trade on a major stock exchange and, unlike
mutual funds, can be bought and sold during the trading day. The best
ETFs have very low fees, and like an index fund (see Chapter 10), they
invest to track the performance of a stock market index.
 Hedge funds: These privately managed funds are for wealthier investors
and generally take more risk (some even go bankrupt) than a typical
mutual fund. The fees can be steep — typically 20 percent of the hedge
fund’s annual returns. I do not recommend them.
 Managed accounts: The major brokerage firms, which employ brokers
on commission, offer access to private money managers. In reality, this
option isn’t really different from getting access to fund managers via
mutual funds, but you’ll generally pay a much higher fee, which reduces
this option’s attractiveness.
Investing in individual stocks
My experience is that plenty of people choose to invest in individual securi-
ties because they think that they’re smarter or luckier than the rest. I don’t
know you personally, but it’s safe to say that in the long run, your investment
choices aren’t going to outperform those of a full-time investment professional.
187
Chapter 9: Understanding Your Investment Choices

As a financial counselor, I noticed a distinct difference between the sexes
on this issue. Perhaps because of the differences in how people are raised,
testosterone levels, or whatever, men tend to have more of a problem swal-
lowing their egos and admitting that they’re better off not selecting their own
individual securities. Maybe the desire to be a stock picker is genetically
linked to not wanting to ask for directions!
Investing in individual stocks entails numerous drawbacks and pitfalls:
 You’ll have to spend a significant amount of time doing research.
When you’re considering the purchase of an individual security, you
should know a lot about the company in which you’re thinking about
investing. Relevant questions to ask about the company include:
What products does it sell? What are its prospects for future growth
and profitability? How much debt does the company have? You need
to do your homework not only before you make your initial investment
but also on an ongoing basis for as long as you hold the investment.
Research takes your valuable free time and sometimes costs money.
Don’t fool yourself or let others fool you into thinking that picking and
following individual companies and their stocks is simple, requires little
time, or is far more profitable than investing in mutual funds.
 Your emotions will probably get in your way. Analyzing financial 
statements, corporate strategy, and competitive position requires
great intellect and insight. However, those skills aren’t nearly enough.
Will you have the stomach to hold on after what you thought was a 
sure-win stock plunges 50 percent while the overall stock market holds
steady or even climbs? Will you have the courage to dump such a stock
if your new research suggests that the plummet is the beginning of the
end rather than just a big bump in the road? When your money is on the
line, emotions often kick in and undermine your ability to make sound
long-term decisions. Few people have the psychological constitution to
outfox the financial markets.
 You’re less likely to diversify. Unless you have tens of thousands of 
dollars to invest in different stocks, you probably can’t cost-effectively
afford to develop a diversified portfolio. For example, when you’re
investing in stocks, you need to hold companies in different industries,
different companies within an industry, and so on. By not diversifying,
you unnecessarily add to your risk.
 You’ll face accounting and bookkeeping hassles. When you invest in
individual securities outside retirement accounts, you must report that
transaction on your tax return every time you sell a specific security.
Even if you pay someone else to complete your tax return, you still have
the hassle of keeping track of statements and receipts.
188
Part III: Building Wealth with Wise Investing 

Of course, you may find some people (with a vested interest) who try to con-
vince you that picking your own stocks and managing your own portfolio
of stocks is easy and more profitable than investing in, say, a mutual fund.
In my experience, such stock-picking cheerleaders fall into at least one of the
following categories:
 Newsletter writers: Whether in print, on television, or on a Web site,
some pundits pitch the notion that professional money managers are
just overpaid buffoons and that you can handily trounce the pros with
little investment of your time by simply putting your money into the
pundits’ stock picks. Of course, what these self-anointed gurus are
really selling is either an ongoing newsletter (which can run upwards
of several hundred dollars per year) or your required daily visitation of
their advertising-stuffed Web sites. How else will you be able to keep up
with their announced buy-and-sell recommendations? These supposed
experts want you to be dependent on continually following their advice.
Of course, you may be wondering, “Hey, if these pundits were such
geniuses at picking the best stocks, why aren’t they making piles of
money just investing rather than selling their supposed brilliant insights
on the cheap?” Go to the head of the class and don’t waste your time
and money following such pundits’ picks! (I discuss investment newslet-
ters in Chapter 8 and Web sites in Chapter 19.)
 Book authors: Go into any bookstore with a decent-sized investing sec-
tion and you’ll find plenty of books claiming that they can teach you a
stock-picking strategy for beating the system. Never mind the fact that
the author has no independently audited track demonstrating his success!
The book publisher of at least one investment group was successfully
sued over hyping and distorting the group’s actual investment success.
 Stockbrokers: Some brokers steer you toward individual stocks for sev-
eral reasons that benefit the broker and not you. First, as I discuss in
Chapter 8, the high-commission brokerage firms can make handsome
profits for themselves by getting you to buy stocks. Secondly, brokers
can use changes in the company’s situation to encourage you to then
sell and buy different stocks, generating even more commissions. Lastly,
as with newsletter writers, this whole process forces you to be depen-
dent on the broker, leaving you broker!
Researching individual stocks can be more than a full-time job, and if you
choose to take this path, remember that you’ll be competing against the pro-
fessionals who do so on a full-time basis. If you derive pleasure from picking
and following your own stocks, or you want an independent opinion of some
stocks you currently own, useful research reports are available from Value
Line (800-833-0046) and Morningstar’s Web site (www.morningstar.com).
I also recommend that you limit your individual stock picking to no more
than 20 percent of your overall investments.

Chapter 9: Understanding Your Investment Choices

Generating wealth with real estate
Over the generations, real estate owners and investors have enjoyed rates of
return comparable to those produced by the stock market, thus making real
estate another time-tested method for building wealth. However, like stocks,
real estate goes through good and bad performance periods. Most people
who make money investing in real estate do so because they invest over
many years.
Buying your own home is the best place to start investing in real estate.
The equity (the difference between the market value of the home and the loan
owed on it) in your home that builds over the years can become a significant
part of your net worth. Among other things, this equity can be tapped into to
help finance other important money and personal goals, such as retirement,
college, and starting or buying a business. Moreover, throughout your adult
life, owning a home should be less expensive than renting a comparable
home. See Chapter 14 for the best ways to buy and finance real estate.
Real estate: Not your ordinary investment
Besides providing solid rates of return, real estate also differs from most
other investments in several other respects. Here’s what makes real estate
unique as an investment:
190
Part III: Building Wealth with Wise Investing 
Individual stock dividend reinvestment plans
Many corporations allow existing shareholders
to reinvest their dividends (their share in com-
pany profits) in more shares of stock without
paying brokerage commissions. In some cases,
companies allow you to make additional cash
purchases of more shares of stock, also com-
mission-free.
In order to qualify, you must first generally buy
some shares of stock through a broker (although
some companies allow the initial purchases to
be made directly from them). Ideally, you should
purchase these initial shares through a discount
broker to keep your commission burden as low
as possible.
Some investment associations also have plans
that allow you to buy one or just a few shares to
get started. I’m not enamored of these plans,
because this type of investing is generally avail-
able and cost-effective for investments held only
outside retirement accounts. You typically need to
complete a lot of paperwork to invest in a number
of different companies’ stock. Life is too short to
bother with these plans for this reason alone.
Finally, even with those companies that do sell
stock directly without charging an explicit com-
mission like a brokerage firm, you pay plenty of
other fees. Many plans charge an upfront enroll-
ment fee, fees for reinvesting dividends, and a
fee when you want to sell.

 Usability: You can’t live in a stock, bond, or mutual fund (although I 
suppose you could glue together a substantial fortress with all the paper
these companies fill your mailbox with each year). Real estate is the only
investment you can use (living in or renting out) to produce income.
 Land is in limited supply: Last time I checked, the percentage of the
Earth occupied by land wasn’t increasing (actually, land mass is shrink-
ing with the melting of the polar ice caps). And because humans like
to reproduce, the demand for land and housing continues to grow.
Consider the areas that have the most expensive real estate prices in
the world — Hong Kong, Tokyo, Hawaii, San Francisco, and Manhattan.
In these densely populated areas, virtually no new land is available for
building new housing.
 Zoning shapes potential value: Local government regulates the zoning
of property, and zoning determines what a property can be used for.
In most communities these days, local zoning boards are against big
growth. This position bodes well for future real estate values. Also know
that in some cases, a particular property may not have been developed
to its full potential. If you can figure out how to develop the property,
you can reap large profits.
 Leverage: Real estate is also different from other investments because
you can borrow a lot of money to buy it — up to 80 to 90 percent or
more of the value of the property. This borrowing is known as exercising
leverage: With only a small investment of 10 to 20 percent down, you’re
able to purchase and own a much larger investment. When the value of
your real estate goes up, you make money on your investment and on
all the money you borrowed. (In case you’re curious, you can leverage
non-retirement-account stock and bond investments through margin
borrowing. However, you have to make a much larger “down payment” —
about double to triple when compared with buying real estate.)
For example, suppose that you plunk down $20,000 to purchase a prop-
erty for $100,000. If the property appreciates to $120,000, you make a
profit of $20,000 (on paper) on your investment of just $20,000. In other
words, you make a 100 percent return on your investment. But leverage
cuts both ways. If your $100,000 property decreases in value to $80,000,
you actually lose (on paper) 100 percent of your original $20,000 invest-
ment, even though the property value drops only 20 percent in value.
 Hidden values: In an efficient market, the price of an investment accurately
reflects its true worth. Some investment markets are more efficient than
others because of the large number of transactions and easily accessible
information. Real estate markets can be inefficient at times. Information
is not always easy to come by, and you may find an ultramotivated or
uninformed seller. If you’re willing to do some homework, you may be
able to purchase a property below its fair market value (perhaps by as
much as 10 to 20 percent).
191
Chapter 9: Understanding Your Investment Choices

Just as with any other investment, real estate has its drawbacks. For starters,
buying or selling a property generally takes time and significant cost. When
you’re renting property, you discover firsthand the occasional headaches of
being a landlord. And especially in the early years of rental property owner-
ship, the property’s expenses may exceed the rental income, producing a net
cash drain.
The best real estate investment options
Although real estate is in some ways unique, it’s also like other types of
investments in that prices are driven by supply and demand. You can invest
in homes or small apartment buildings and then rent them out. In the long
run, investment-property buyers hope that their rent income and the value
of their properties will increase faster than their expenses.
192
Part III: Building Wealth with Wise Investing 
Comparing real estate and stocks
Real estate and stocks have historically pro-
duced comparable returns. Deciding between
the two depends less on the performance of the
markets than on you and your situation. Consider
the following major issues when deciding which
investment may be better for you:
 The first and most important question to ask
yourself is whether you’re cut out to handle
the responsibilities that come with being a
landlord. Real estate is a time-intensive
investment (a property manager can help,
but their cost takes a sizable chunk of your
rental income). Investing in stocks can be
time-intensive as well, but it doesn’t have to
be if you use professionally managed
mutual funds (see Chapter 10).
 An often-overlooked drawback to investing
in real estate is that you earn no tax bene-
fits while you’re accumulating your down
payment. Retirement accounts such as
401(k)s, SEP-IRAs, Keoghs, and so on (see
Chapter 11) give you an immediate tax
deduction as you contribute money to them.
If you haven’t exhausted your contributions
to these accounts, consider doing so before
chasing after investment real estate.
 Ask yourself which investments you have a
better understanding of. Some folks feel
uncomfortable with stocks and mutual
funds because they don’t understand them.
If you have a better handle on what makes
real estate tick, you have a good reason to
consider investing in it.
 Figure out what will make you happy. Some
people enjoy the challenge that comes with
managing and improving rental property; it
can be a bit like running a small business. If
you’re good at it and you have some good
fortune, you can make money and derive
endless hours of enjoyment.
Although few will admit it, some real estate
investors get an ego rush from a tangible dis-
play of their wealth. Sufferers of this “edifice
complex” can’t obtain similar pleasure from a
stock portfolio detailed on a piece of paper
(although others have been known to boast of
their stock-picking prowess).

When selecting real estate for investment purposes, remember that local 
economic growth is the fuel for housing demand. In addition to a vibrant
and diverse job base, you want to look for limited supplies of both existing
housing and land on which to build. When you identify potential properties
in which you may want to invest, run the numbers to understand the cash
demands of owning the property and the likely profitability. See Chapter 14
for help determining the costs of real estate ownership.
When you want to invest directly in real estate, residential housing — such
as single-family homes or small multi-unit buildings — may be an attractive
investment. Buying properties close to “home” offers the advantage of allow-
ing you to more easily monitor and manage what’s going on. The downside is
that you’ll be less diversified — more of your investments will be dependent
on the local economy.
If you don’t want to be a landlord — one of the biggest drawbacks of invest-
ment real estate — consider investing in real estate through real estate
investment trusts (REITs). REITs are diversified real estate investment compa-
nies that purchase and manage rental real estate for investors. A typical REIT
invests in different types of property, such as shopping centers, apartments,
and other rental buildings. You can invest in REITs either by purchasing them
directly on the major stock exchanges or by investing in a real estate mutual
fund (see Chapter 10) that invests in numerous REITs.
The worst real estate investments
Not all real estate investments are good; some aren’t even real investments.
The bad ones are characterized by burdensome costs and problematic eco-
nomic fundamentals:
 Limited partnerships: Avoid limited partnerships (LPs) sold through
brokers and financial consultants. LPs are inferior investment vehicles.
They’re so burdened with high sales commissions and ongoing manage-
ment fees that deplete your investment that you can do better elsewhere.
The investment salesperson who sells you such an investment stands to
earn a commission of up to 10 percent or more — so only 90 cents of each
dollar gets invested. Each year, LPs typically siphon off another several
percent for management and other expenses. Most partnerships have
little or no incentive to control costs. In fact, they have a conflict of inter-
est that forces them to charge more to enrich the managing partners.
Unlike a mutual fund, you can’t vote with your dollars. If the partnership
is poorly run and expensive, you’re stuck. LPs are illiquid (not readily
convertible into cash without a substantial loss). You can’t access your
money until the partnership is liquidated, typically seven to ten years
after you buy in.
193
Chapter 9: Understanding Your Investment Choices

Brokers who sell LPs often tell you that while your investment is growing
at 20 percent or more per year, you get handsome dividends of 8 percent
or so annually. Many of the yields on LPs have turned out to be bogus.
In some cases, partnerships prop up their yields by paying back investors’
principals (without telling them, of course). As for returns — well —
most LP investors of a decade ago are lucky to have half their original
investment left. The only thing limited about a limited partnership is its
ability to make you money.
 Time shares: Time shares are another nearly certain money loser. With a
time share, you buy a week or two of ownership, or usage, of a particular
unit (usually a condominium in a resort location) per year. If, for exam-
ple, you pay $8,000 for a week (in addition to ongoing maintenance fees),
you’re paying the equivalent of more than $400,000 for the whole unit,
when a comparable unit nearby may sell for only $150,000. The extra
markup pays the salespeople’s commissions, administrative expenses,
and profits for the time share development company.
People usually get enticed into buying a time share when they’re enjoy-
ing a vacation someplace. They’re easy prey for salespeople who want
to sell them a souvenir of the trip. The “cheese in the mousetrap” is an
offer of something free (for example, a free night’s stay in a unit) for
going through the sales presentation.
If you can’t live without a time share, consider buying a used one.
Many previous buyers, who more than likely have lost a good chunk of
money, are trying to dump their shares (which should tell you some-
thing). In this case, you may be able to buy a time share at a fair price.
But why commit yourself to taking a vacation in the same location and
building at the same time each year? Many time shares let you trade your
weeks for other times and other places; however, doing so is a hassle —
you’re charged an extra fee, and your choices are usually limited to time
slots that other people don’t want (that’s why they’re trading them!).
 Second homes: The weekend getaway is a sometimes romantic notion
and an extended part of the so-called American dream — a place you
can escape to a couple of times a month. When your vacation home is
not in use, you may be able to rent it out and earn some income to help
defray the expense of keeping it up.
If you can realistically afford the additional costs of a second (or vaca-
tion) home, I’m not going to tell you how to spend your extra cash.
But please don’t make the all-too-common mistake of viewing a second
home as an investment. The way most people use them, they’re not.
Most second-home owners seldom rent out their property — they typi-
cally do so 10 percent or less of the time. As a result, second homes are
usually money drains.
194
Part III: Building Wealth with Wise Investing 

The supposed tax benefits are part of the attraction of a second home.
Even when you qualify for some or all of them, tax benefits only partially
reduce the cost of owning a property. In some cases, the second home is
such a cash drain that it prevents its owners from contributing to and
taking advantage of tax-deductible retirement savings plans.
If you aren’t going to rent out a second home most of the time, ask your-
self whether you can afford such a luxury. Can you accomplish your
other financial goals — saving for retirement, paying for the home in
which you live, and so on — with this added expense? Keeping a second
home is more of a consumption than investment decision. Few people
can afford more than one home.
Investing in small business 
(and your career)
With what type of investment have people built the greatest wealth? If you said
the stock market or real estate, you’re wrong. The answer is small business.
You can invest in small business by starting one yourself (and thus finding
yourself the best boss you’ve probably ever had), buying an existing busi-
ness, or investing in someone else’s small business. Even if small business
doesn’t interest you, your own job should, so I present some tips on making
the most of your career.
Launching your own enterprise
When you have self-discipline and a product or service you can sell, starting
your own business can be both profitable and fulfilling. Consider first what
skills and expertise you possess that you can use in your business. You don’t
need a “eureka”-type idea or invention to start a small business. Millions of
people operate successful businesses that are hardly unique, such as dry
cleaners, restaurants, tax preparation firms, and so on.
Begin exploring your idea by first developing a written business plan. Such a
plan should detail your product or service, how you’re going to market it,
your potential customers and competitors, and the economics of the busi-
ness, including the start-up costs.
Of all the small-business investment options, starting your own business
involves the most work. Although you can do this work on a part-time basis
in the beginning, most people end up running their business full-time — it’s
your new job, career, or whatever you want to call it.
195
Chapter 9: Understanding Your Investment Choices

I’ve been running my own business for most of my working years, and I
wouldn’t trade that experience for the corporate life. That’s not to say that
running my own business doesn’t have its drawbacks and down moments.
But in my experience counseling small-business owners, I’ve seen many
people of varied backgrounds, interests, and skills succeed and be happy
with running their own businesses.
In most people’s eyes, starting a new business is the riskiest of all small-
business investment options. But if you’re going into a business that uses
your skills and expertise, the risk isn’t nearly as great as you may think.
Many businesses can be started with little cash by leveraging your existing
skills and expertise. You can build a valuable company and job if you have
the time to devote. As long as you check out the competition and offer a
valued service at a reasonable cost, the principal risk with your business
comes from not doing a good job marketing what you have to offer. If you
can market your skills, you’re home free.
As long as you’re thinking about the risks of starting a business, consider the
risks of staying in a job you don’t enjoy or that doesn’t challenge or fulfill
you. If you never take the plunge, you may regret that you didn’t pursue your
dreams.
Buying an existing business
If you don’t have a specific product or service you want to sell but you’re
skilled at managing and improving the operations of a company, buying a
small business may be for you. Finding and buying a good small business
takes much time and patience, so be willing to devote at least several months
to the search. You may also need to enlist financial and legal advisors to help
inspect the company, look over its financial statements, and hammer out a
contract.
Although you don’t have to go through the riskier start-up period if you buy a
small business, you’ll likely need more capital to buy an established enterprise.
You’ll also need to be able to deal with stickier personnel and management
issues. The history of the organization and the way things work will predate
your ownership of the business. If you don’t like making hard decisions, firing
people who don’t fit with your plans, and coercing people into changing the
way they do things, buying an existing business likely isn’t for you.
Some people perceive buying an existing business as being safer than start-
ing a new one. Buying someone else’s business can actually be riskier. You’re
likely to shell out far more money upfront, in the form of a down payment, to
buy an existing business. If you don’t have the ability to run the business and
it does poorly, you have more to lose financially. In addition, the business
may be for sale for a reason — it may not be very profitable, it may be in
decline, or it may generally be a pain in the neck to operate.
196
Part III: Building Wealth with Wise Investing 

Good businesses don’t come cheap. If the business is a success, the current
owner has already removed the start-up risk from the business, so the price
of the business should be at a premium to reflect this lack of risk. When you
have the capital to buy an established business and you have the skills to run
it, consider going this route.
Investing in someone else’s small business
Are you someone who likes the idea of profiting from successful small busi-
nesses but doesn’t want the day-to-day headaches of being responsible for
managing the enterprise? Then investing in someone else’s small business
may be for you. Although this route may seem easier, few people are actually
cut out to be investors in other people’s businesses. The reason: Finding and
analyzing opportunities isn’t easy.
Are you astute at evaluating corporate financial statements and business
strategies? Investing in a small, privately held company has much in common
with investing in a publicly traded firm (as is the case when you buy stock),
but it also has a few differences. One difference is that private firms aren’t
required to produce comprehensive, audited financial statements that adhere
to certain accounting principles. Thus, you have a greater risk of not having
sufficient or accurate information when evaluating a small private firm.
Another difference is that unearthing private small-business investing oppor-
tunities is harder. The best private companies who are seeking investors 
generally don’t advertise. Instead, they find prospective investors through
networking with people such as business advisors. You can increase your
chances of finding private companies to invest in by speaking with tax, legal,
and financial advisors who work with small businesses. You can also find
interesting opportunities through your own contacts or experience within a
given industry.
Don’t consider investing in someone else’s business unless you can afford to
lose all of what you’re investing. Also, you should have sufficient assets so
that what you’re investing in small, privately held companies represents only
a small portion (20 percent or less) of your total financial assets.
Investing in your career
In my work with financial counseling clients over the years and from observ-
ing friends and colleagues, I’ve witnessed plenty of people succeed working
for employers. So I don’t want to leave you with the impression that financial
success equates with starting, buying, or investing in someone else’s small
business.
197
Chapter 9: Understanding Your Investment Choices

You can and should invest in your career. Some time-tested, proven ways to
do that include
 Networking: Some people wait to network until they’ve been laid off or
are really hungry to change jobs. Take an interest in what others do for a
living and you’ll learn and grow from the experience, even if you choose
to stay with your current employer or in your chosen field.
 Making sure you keep learning: Whether it’s reading quality books or
other publications or taking some night courses, find ways to build on
your knowledge base.
 Considering the risk in the status quo: Many folks are resistant to
change and get anxious thinking about what could go wrong when taking
a new risk. I know when I was ready to walk away from a six-figure con-
sulting job with a prestigious firm and open my own financial counseling
firm, a number of my relatives and friends thought I had lost my marbles.
I’m glad I didn’t listen to their fears and worries!
Off the Beaten Path: Investment 
Odds and Ends
The investments that I discuss in this section sometimes belong on their own
planet (because they’re not an ownership or lending vehicle). Here are the
basics on these other common, but odd, investments.
Precious metals
Gold and silver have been used by many civilizations as currency or a medium
of exchange. One advantage of precious metals as a currency is that they can’t
be debased by the government. With paper currency, such as U.S. dollars, the
government can simply print more. This process can lead to the devaluation
of a currency and inflation. It takes a whole lot more work to make more gold.
Just ask Rumpelstiltskin.
Holdings of gold and silver can provide a so-called hedge against inflation.
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, inflation rose dramatically in the United
States. This largely unexpected rise in inflation depressed stocks and bonds.
Gold and silver, however, rose tremendously in value — in fact, more than 500
percent (even after adjusting for inflation) from 1972 to 1980 (see Chapter 8).
Such periods are unusual. Precious metals have produced decent returns in
the early and mid 2000s. Over many decades, precious metals tend to be
lousy investments. Their rate of return tends to keep up with the rate of 
inflation but not surpass it.
198
Part III: Building Wealth with Wise Investing 

When you want to invest in precious metals as an inflation hedge, your best
option is to do so through mutual funds (see Chapter 10). Don’t purchase
precious metals futures. They’re not investments; they’re short-term gambles
on which way gold or silver prices may head over a short period of time.
You should also stay away from firms and shops that sell coins and bullion
(not the soup, but bars of gold or silver). Even if you can find a legitimate
firm (not an easy task), the cost of storing and insuring gold and silver is
quite costly. You won’t get good value for your money. I hate to tell you this,
but the Gold Rush is over.
Annuities
Annuities are a peculiar type of insurance and investment product. They’re a
sort of savings-type account with slightly higher yields that are backed by
insurance companies.
As with other types of retirement accounts, money placed in an annuity com-
pounds without taxation until it’s withdrawn. However, unlike most other
types of retirement accounts, such as 401(k)s, SEP-IRAs, and Keoghs, you
don’t receive upfront tax breaks on contributions you make to an annuity.
Ongoing investment expenses also tend to be much higher than in retirement
plan accounts. Therefore, consider an annuity only after you fully fund tax-
deductible retirement accounts. (For more help on deciding whether to
invest in an annuity, read Chapter 12.)
Collectibles
The collectibles category is a catchall for antiques, art, autographs, baseball
cards, clocks, coins, comic books, diamonds, dolls, gems, photographs, rare
books, rugs, stamps, vintage wine, and writing utensils — in other words, any
material object that, through some kind of human manipulation, has become
more valuable to certain humans.
Notwithstanding the few people who discover on the Antiques Roadshow that
they own an antique of significant value, collectibles are generally lousy
investment vehicles. Dealer markups are enormous, maintenance and protec-
tion costs are draining, research is time-consuming, and people’s tastes are
quite fickle. All this for returns that, after you factor in the huge markups,
rarely keep up with inflation.
Buy collectibles for your love of the object, not for financial gain. Treat col-
lecting as a hobby, not as an investment. When buying a collectible, try to
avoid the big markups by cutting out the middlemen. Buy directly from the
artist or producer if you can.

Investing in Mutual Funds
In This Chapter
 Why funds?
 Checking out the different types of funds
 Choosing the best funds
 Evaluating your fund’s performance
 Monitoring and selling your funds
W
hen you invest in a mutual fund, an investment company pools your
money with the money of many other like-minded individuals and
invests it in stocks, bonds, and other securities. Think of it as a big invest-
ment club without the meetings! When you invest through a typical mutual
fund, several hundred million to billions of dollars may be invested along
with your money.
If you’re thinking of joining the club, read on to discover the benefits of
investing in mutual funds and the types of funds available. In this chapter, I
advise you on analyzing and choosing your funds, explain how to track your
investments, and help you decide when to sell.
Understanding the Benefits
of Mutual Funds
Mutual funds rank right up there with microwave ovens, sticky notes, and
plastic wrap as one of the best modern inventions. To understand their suc-
cess is to grasp how and why funds can work for you. Here are the benefits
you receive when you invest in mutual funds:
 Professional management: Mutual funds are managed by a portfolio man-
ager and research team whose full-time jobs are to screen the universe of
investments for those that best meet the stated objectives of the fund.

These professionals call and visit companies, analyze companies’ financial
statements, and speak with companies’ suppliers and customers. In short,
the team does more research and analysis than you could ever hope to do
in your free time.
Fund managers are typically graduates of the top business and finance
schools in the country, where they learn the principles of portfolio man-
agement and securities valuation and selection. The best fund managers
typically have a decade of experience or more in analyzing and selecting
investments, and many measure their experience in decades rather than
years.
 Low cost: The most-efficiently managed stock mutual funds cost less
than 1 percent per year in fees (bonds and money market funds cost
much less). Because mutual funds typically buy or sell tens of thousands
of shares of a security at a time, the percentage commissions these
funds pay are far less than what you pay to buy or sell a few hundred
shares on your own. In addition, when you buy a no-load fund, you avoid
paying sales commissions (known as loads) on your transactions. I dis-
cuss these types of funds throughout this chapter.
 Diversification: Mutual fund investing enables you to achieve a level of
diversification that is difficult to reach without tens of thousands of dol-
lars and a lot of time to invest. If you go it alone, you should invest
money in at least 8 to 12 different securities in different industries to
ensure that your portfolio can withstand a downturn in one or more of
the investments. Proper diversification allows a mutual fund to receive
the highest possible return at the lowest possible risk given its objec-
tives. The most unfortunate investors during major stock market down-
swings have been individuals who had all their money riding on only a
few stocks that plunged in price by 90 percent or more.
 Low cost of entry: Most mutual funds have low minimum-investment
requirements, especially for retirement account investors. Even if you
have a lot of money to invest, you should also consider mutual funds.
Join the increasing numbers of companies and institutions (who have
the biggest bucks of all) that are turning to the low-cost, high-quality,
money-management services that mutual funds provide.
 Audited performance records and expenses: In their prospectuses,
all mutual funds are required to disclose historical data on returns,
operating expenses, and other fees. The Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) and accounting firms check these disclosures for
accuracy. Also, several firms (such as Morningstar, Inc.) report hundreds
of fund statistics, allowing comparisons of performance, risk, and many
other factors.
202
Part III: Building Wealth with Wise Investing 

 Flexibility in risk level: Among the different mutual funds, you can
choose a level of risk that you’re comfortable with and that meets your
personal and financial goals. If you want your money to grow over a long
period of time, you may want to select funds that invest more heavily in
stocks. If you need current income and don’t want investments that fluc-
tuate in value as widely as stocks, you may choose more-conservative
bond funds. If you want to be sure that your invested principal doesn’t
drop in value (perhaps because you may need your money in the short
term), you can select a money market fund.
Exploring Various Fund Types
One of the major misconceptions about mutual funds is that they’re all
invested in stocks. They’re not. Figure 10-1 shows how the money currently
invested in mutual funds breaks down.
As you can see, much (about 40 percent) of mutual fund money is not
invested in stocks. When you hear folks talk about the “riskiness” of mutual
funds, even in the media, you know that they’re overlooking this fact: All
mutual funds are not created equal. Some funds, such as money market
funds, carry virtually no risk that your investment will decline in value.
When mutual fund companies package and market funds, the names they
give their funds aren’t always completely accurate or comprehensive. For
example, a stock fund may not be totally invested in stocks. Twenty percent
of it may be invested in bonds. Don’t assume that a fund invests exclusively
in U.S. companies, either — it may invest in international firms, as well.
Note: If you haven’t yet read Chapters 8 and 9, which provide an overview of
investment concepts and vehicles, doing so can enhance your understanding
of the rest of this chapter.

Chapter 10: Investing in Mutual Funds

Money market funds
Money market funds are the safest type of mutual funds for people concerned
about losing their invested dollars. As with bank savings accounts, the value
of your original investment does not fluctuate. (For more background on the
advantages of money funds, see Chapter 9.)
These funds are closely regulated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. Hundreds of billions of dollars of individuals’ and institutions’
money are invested in hundreds of money market funds. The industry has
never caused an individual to lose even a penny of principal.
Money market funds are extremely safe. The risk difference versus a bank
account is nil. General purpose money market funds invest in safe, short-term
bank certificates of deposit, U.S. Treasuries, and corporate commercial paper
(short-term debt), which is issued by the largest and most creditworthy
companies.
Money market fund investments can exist only in the most creditworthy
securities and must have an average maturity of less than 120 days. In the
unlikely event that an investment in a money market fund’s portfolio goes
sour, the mutual fund company that stands behind the money market fund
will almost certainly cover the loss.
If the lack of insurance on money market funds still spooks you, select a
money market fund that invests exclusively in U.S. government securities,
which are virtually risk-free because they’re backed by the full strength and
credit of the federal government (as is the FDIC insurance system). These
types of accounts typically pay less interest (usually 1⁄4 percent less),
although the interest is free of state income tax.
Bond funds
Bonds are IOUs. When you buy a newly issued bond, you lend your money
typically to a corporation or government agency. A bond mutual fund is noth-
ing more than a large group (pack, herd, gaggle, whatever) of bonds.
Bond funds typically invest in bonds of similar maturity (the number of years
that elapse before the borrower must pay back the money you lend). The
names of most bond funds include a word or two that provides clues about
the average length of maturity of their bonds. For example, a short-term bond
fund typically concentrates its investments in bonds maturing in the next two
to three years. An intermediate-term fund generally holds bonds that come
due within three to ten years. The bonds in a long-term fund usually mature
in more than ten years.
204
Part III: Building Wealth with Wise Investing 

In contrast to an individual bond that you buy and hold until it matures, a
bond fund is always replacing bonds in its portfolio to maintain its average
maturity objective. Therefore, if you know that you absolutely, positively
must have a certain principal amount back on a particular date, individual
bonds may be more appropriate than a bond fund.
Like money market funds, bond funds can invest in tax-free bonds, which are
appropriate for investing money you hold outside retirement accounts if
you’re in a reasonably high tax bracket.
Bond funds are useful when you want to live off dividend income or you don’t
want to put all your money in riskier investments such as stocks and real
estate (perhaps because you plan to use the money soon).
Stock funds
Stock mutual funds, as their name implies, invest in stocks. These funds are
often referred to as equity funds. Equity — not to be confused with equity in
real estate — is another word for stocks. Stock mutual funds are often catego-
rized by the type of stocks they primarily invest in.
Stock types are first defined by size of company (small, medium, or large).
The total market value (capitalization) of a company’s outstanding stock
determines its size. Small-company stocks, for example, are usually defined
as companies with total market capitalization of less than $1 billion.
Stocks are further categorized as growth or value. Growth stocks represent com-
panies that are experiencing rapidly expanding revenues and profits and typi-
cally have high stock prices relative to their current earnings or asset (book)
values. These companies tend to reinvest most of their earnings back into their
infrastructure to fuel future expansion. Thus, growth stocks typically pay low
dividends. (See the later “Dividends” section for more information.)
Value stocks are at the other end of the spectrum. Value stock investors look
for good buys. They want to invest in stocks that are cheaply priced in rela-
tion to the profits per share and book value (assets less liabilities) of the
company. Value stocks are usually less volatile than growth stocks.
These categories are combined in various ways to describe how a mutual
fund invests its money. One fund may focus on large-company growth stocks,
while another fund may limit itself to small-company value stocks. Funds
are further classified by the geographical focus of their investments: U.S.,
international, worldwide, and so on (see the section “U.S., international,
and global funds”).

Chapter 10: Investing in Mutual Funds

Balancing bonds and stocks: Hybrid funds
Hybrid funds invest in a mixture of different types of securities. Most com-
monly, they invest in bonds and stocks. These funds are usually less risky
and volatile than funds that invest exclusively in stocks. In an economic
downturn, bonds usually hold up in value better than stocks do. However,
during good economic times when the stock market is booming, the bond
portions of these funds tend to drag down their performance a bit.
Hybrid mutual funds are typically known as balanced funds or asset allocation
funds. Balanced funds generally try to maintain a fairly constant percentage of
investments in stocks and bonds. Asset allocation funds tend to adjust the mix
of different investments according to the portfolio manager’s expectations of
the market. Of course, exceptions do exist — some balanced funds make major
shifts in their allocations, whereas some asset allocation funds maintain a rela-
tively fixed mix. You should note that most funds that shift money around
instead of staying put in good investments rarely beat the market averages
over a number of years.
Hybrid funds are a way to make fund investing simple. They give you instant
diversification across a variety of investing options. They also make it easier
for stock-skittish investors to invest in stocks while avoiding the high volatil-
ity of pure stock funds.
U.S., international, and global funds
Unless they have words like international, global, worldwide, or world in their
names, most funds focus their investments in the United States. But even
funds without one of these terms attached may invest money internationally.
The only way to know for sure where a fund is currently invested (or where
the fund may invest in the future) is to ask. You can start by calling the toll-
free number of the mutual fund company you’re interested in. A fund’s annual
report (which often can be found on the fund company’s Web site) also
details where the fund is investing.
When a fund has the term international in its name, it typically means that the
fund can invest anywhere in the world except the United States. The term
worldwide or global generally implies that a fund invests anywhere in the
world, including the United States. I generally recommend avoiding worldwide
or global funds for two reasons. First, thoroughly following the financial mar-
kets and companies is hard enough for a fund manager to do solely in the
United States or a specific international market; following the markets and
companies in both is even more difficult. Second, most of these funds charge
high operating expenses — often well in excess of 1 percent per year — which
puts a drag on returns.
206

Index funds
Index funds are funds that can be (and are, for the most part) managed by a
computer. An index fund’s assets are invested to replicate an existing market
index such as Standard & Poor’s 500, an index of 500 large U.S. company
stocks. (Important note: In Chapters 11 and 12, I recommend and prefer, for its
better diversification, a total U.S. stock market index fund over the S&P 500
index fund.)
Over long periods (ten years or more), index funds outperform about three-
quarters of their peers! How is that possible? How can a computer making
mindless, predictable decisions beat an intelligent, creative, MBA-endowed
portfolio manager with a crack team of research analysts scouring the market
for the best securities? The answer is largely cost. The computer does not
demand a high salary or need a big corner office. And index funds don’t need
a team of research analysts.
Most active fund managers can’t overcome the handicap of high operating
expenses that pull down their funds’ rates of return. As I discuss later in this
chapter, operating expenses include all the fees and profit that a mutual fund
extracts from a fund’s returns before the returns are paid to you. For example,
207
Chapter 10: Investing in Mutual Funds
Funds of funds
An increasing number of fund providers are
responding to overwhelmed investors by offer-
ing a simplified way to construct a portfolio: a
mutual fund that diversifies across numerous
other mutual funds — or a fund of funds. When
a fund of funds is done right, it helps focus fund
investors on the important big-picture issue of
asset allocation — how much of your invest-
ment money you put into bonds versus stocks.
Although the best funds of funds appear to
deliver a high-quality, diversified portfolio of
funds in one fell swoop, funds of funds are not
all created equal and not all are worthy of your
investment dollars.
The fund of funds idea is not new. In fact, the
concept has been around many years. High
fees gave the earlier funds of funds, run in the
1950s by the late Bernie Cornfeld, a bad name.
He established a fund of funds outside the
United States and tacked on many layers of
fees. Although the funds were profitable for his
enterprise, duped investors suffered a contin-
ual drain of high fees. The Cornfeld episode is
an important reason why the Securities and
Exchange Commission has been careful in
approving new funds of funds.
The “newer” funds of funds developed by the
larger fund companies are investor friendly and
ones that I recommend. Vanguard’s LifeStrategy,
Fidelity’s Freedom, and T. Rowe Price’s Spectrum
funds of funds add no extra fees for packaging
together the individual funds. Long-term perfor-
mance of many of these is solid. Annual operat-
ing fees on the underlying funds at Vanguard are
less than 0.3 percent.

the average U.S. stock fund has an operating expense ratio of 1.4 percent per
year. So a U.S. stock index fund with an expense ratio of just 0.2 percent per
year has an advantage of 1.2 percent per year.
Another not-so-inconsequential advantage of index funds is that you can’t
underperform the market. Some funds do just that because of the burden of
high fees and/or poor management. For money invested outside retirement
accounts, index funds have an added advantage: Lower taxable-capital-gains
distributions are made to shareholders because less trading of securities is
conducted and a more stable portfolio is maintained.
Yes, index funds may seem downright boring. When you invest in them, you
give up the opportunity to brag to others about your shrewd investments
that beat the market averages. On the other hand, with a low-cost index fund,
you have no chance of doing much worse than the market (which more than
a few mutual fund managers do).
Index funds make sense for a portion of your investments, because beating the
market is difficult for portfolio managers. The Vanguard Group (800-662-7447,
www.vanguard.com), headquartered in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, is the
largest and lowest-cost mutual-fund provider of index funds.
Specialty (sector) funds
Specialty funds don’t fit neatly into the previous categories. These funds are
often known as sector funds, because they tend to invest in securities in spe-
cific industries.
208
Part III: Building Wealth with Wise Investing 
Socially responsible funds
Select mutual funds label themselves socially
responsible. This term means different things to
different people. In most cases, though, it
implies that the fund avoids investing in compa-
nies whose products or services harm people
or the world at large — tobacco manufacturers,
for example. Because cigarettes and other
tobacco products kill hundreds of thousands of
people and add billions of dollars to health care
costs, most socially responsible funds shun
tobacco companies.
Socially responsible investing presents chal-
lenges. For example, your definition of social
responsibility may not match the definition
offered by the investment manager who’s run-
ning a fund. Another problem is that even if you
can agree on what’s socially irresponsible (such
as selling tobacco products), funds aren’t always
as clean as you would think or hope. Even though
a fund avoids tobacco manufacturers, it may well
invest in retailers that sell tobacco products.
If you want to consider a socially responsible
fund, review the fund’s recent annual report that
lists the specific investments the fund owns.
Also consider giving directly to charities (and
getting a tax deduction) instead.

In most cases, you should avoid investing in specialty funds. Investing in
stocks of a single industry defeats one of the major purposes of investing in
mutual funds — diversification. Another good reason to avoid specialty funds
is that they tend to carry much higher expenses than other mutual funds.
Specialty funds that invest in real estate or precious metals may make sense
for a small portion (10 percent or less) of your investment portfolio. These
types of funds can help diversify your portfolio, because they can do better
during times of higher inflation.
Selecting the Best Mutual Funds
When you go camping in the wilderness, you can do a number of things to
maximize your chances for happiness and success. You can take maps to
keep you on course, food for nourishment, proper clothing to stay dry and
warm, and some first-aid gear to treat minor injuries. But regardless of how
much advance preparation you do, you may have a problematic experience.
You may take the wrong trail, trip on a rock and break your ankle, or lose
your food to a tenacious bear that comes romping through camp one night.
And so it is with mutual funds. Although most mutual fund investors are
rewarded for their efforts, you get no guarantees. You can, however, follow
some simple, common-sense guidelines to help keep you on the trail and
increase your odds of investment success and happiness. The issues in the
following sections are the main ones to consider.
Reading prospectuses and annual reports
Mutual fund companies produce information that can help you make deci-
sions about mutual fund investments. Every fund is required to issue a
prospectus. This legal document is reviewed and audited by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. Most of what’s written isn’t worth the
time it takes to slog through it.
The most valuable information — the fund’s investment objectives, costs,
and performance history — is summarized in the first few pages of the
prospectus. Make sure that you read this part. Skip the rest, which is com-
prised mostly of tedious legal details.
Funds also produce annual reports that discuss how the fund has been doing
and provide details on the specific investments a fund holds. If, for example,
you want to know which countries an international fund invests in, you can
find this information in the fund’s annual report.
209
Chapter 10: Investing in Mutual Funds

Keeping costs low
The charges you pay to buy or sell a fund, as well as the ongoing fund operating
expenses, can have a big impact on the rate of return you earn on your invest-
ments. Many novice investors pay too much attention to a mutual fund’s prior
performance (in the case of stock funds) or to the fund’s current yield (in the
case of bond funds). Doing so is dangerous because a fund can inflate its return
or yield in many (risky) ways. And what worked yesterday may flop tomorrow.
A study conducted by the Investment Company Institute confirms what I’ve
long observed among fund buyers: Only 43 percent of fund buyers who were
surveyed bothered to examine the fees and expenses of the fund they ended
up buying. The majority of fund buyers — 57 percent, to be exact — didn’t
know what the funds were charging them to manage their money!
Fund costs are an important factor in the return you earn from a mutual fund.
Fees are deducted from your investment. All other things being equal, high
fees and other charges depress your returns. What are a fund’s fees, you ask?
Good question — read on to find the answers.
Eliminating loads
Loads are upfront commissions paid to brokers who sell mutual funds. Loads
typically range from 3 percent to as high as 8.5 percent of your investment.
(An astonishing 73 percent of fund buyers surveyed by the Investment
Company Institute didn’t know whether the fund they bought charged a sales
load!) Sales loads have two problems:
 Sales loads are a needless cost that drags down your investment
returns. Because commissions are paid to the salesperson and not to
the fund manager, the manager of a load fund doesn’t work any harder
and isn’t any more qualified than a manager of a no-load fund. Common
sense suggests, and studies confirm, that load funds perform worse, on
average, than no-loads when factoring in the load because the load
charge is subtracted from your payment before being invested.
 The power of self-interest can bias your broker’s advice. Although this
issue is rarely discussed, it’s even more problematic than the issue of
extra sales costs. Brokers who work for a commission are interested in
selling you commission-based investment products; therefore, their best
interests often conflict with your best interests.
Although you may be mired in high-interest debt or underfunding your
retirement plan, salespeople almost never advise you to pay off your
credit cards or put more money into your 401(k). To get you to buy, they
tend to exaggerate the potential benefits and obscure the risks and draw-
backs of what they sell. They don’t take the time to educate investors.
I’ve seen too many people purchase investment products through bro-
kers without understanding what they’re buying, how much risk they’re
taking, and how these investments will affect their overall financial lives.
210
Part III: Building Wealth with Wise Investing 

Invest in no-load (commission-free) funds. The only way to be sure that a
fund is truly no-load is to look at the prospectus for the fund. Only there, in
black and white and without marketing hype, must the truth be told about
sales charges and other fund fees. When you want investing advice, hire a
financial advisor on a fee-for-service basis (see Chapter 18), which should
cost less and minimize potential conflicts of interest.
Decreasing operating expenses
All mutual funds charge ongoing fees. The fees pay for the operational costs
of running the fund — employees’ salaries, marketing, servicing the toll-free
phone lines, printing and mailing published materials, computers for tracking
investments and account balances, accounting fees, and so on. Despite being
labeled “expenses,” the profit a fund company extracts for running the fund is
added to the tab, as well.
The fund’s operating expenses are quoted as an annual percentage of your
investment and are essentially invisible to you, because they’re deducted
before you’re paid any return. The expenses are charged on a daily basis, so
you don’t need to worry about trying to get out of a fund before these fees
are deducted.
You can find a fund’s operating expenses in the fund’s prospectus. Look in
the expenses section and find a line that says something like “Total Fund
Operating Expenses.” You can also call the fund’s toll-free number and ask a
representative.
Within a given sector of mutual funds (for example, money market, short-
term bonds, or international stock), funds with low annual operating fees can
more easily produce higher total returns for you. Although expenses matter
on all funds, some types of funds are more sensitive to high expenses than
others. Expenses are critical on money market mutual funds and very impor-
tant on bond funds. Fund managers already have a hard time beating the
averages in these markets; with higher expenses added on, beating the aver-
ages is nearly impossible.
With stock funds, expenses are a less important (but still significant) factor in
a fund’s performance. Don’t forget that, over time, stocks average returns of
about 10 percent per year. So if one stock fund charges 1 percent more in
operating expenses than another fund, you’re already giving up an extra 10
percent of your expected returns.
Some people argue that stock funds that charge high expenses may be justi-
fied in doing so if they generate higher rates of return. Evidence doesn’t show
that these stock funds actually generate higher returns. In fact, funds with
higher operating expenses tend to produce lower rates of return. This trend
makes sense, because operating expenses are deducted from the returns a
fund generates.
211
Chapter 10: Investing in Mutual Funds

Stick with funds that maintain low total operating expenses and don’t charge
loads (commissions). Both types of fees come out of your pocket and reduce
your rate of return. You have no reason to pay a lot for the best funds. (In
Chapters 11 and 12, I provide some specific fund recommendations as well as
sample portfolios for investors in different situations.)
Evaluating historic performance
A fund’s performance, or historic rate of return, is another factor to weigh
when selecting a mutual fund. As all mutual funds are supposed to tell you,
past performance is no guarantee of future results. An analysis of historic
mutual fund performance proves that some of yesterday’s stars turn into
tomorrow’s skid-row bums.
Many former high-return funds achieved their results by taking on high risk.
Funds that assume higher risk should produce higher rates of return. But
high-risk funds usually decline in price faster during major market declines.
Thus, in order for a fund to be considered a best fund, it must consistently
deliver a favorable rate of return given the degree of risk it takes.
When assessing an individual fund, compare its performance and volatility
over an extended period of time (five or ten years will do) to a relevant market
index. For example, compare funds that focus on investing in large U.S. compa-
nies to the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. Compare funds that invest in U.S.
stocks of all sizes to the Wilshire 5000 Index. Indexes also exist for bonds, for-
eign stock markets, and almost any other type of security you can imagine.
Assessing fund manager and
fund family reputations
Much is made of who manages a specific mutual fund. As Peter Lynch, the
retired and famous former manager of the Fidelity Magellan fund, said, “The
financial press made us Wall Street types into celebrities, a notoriety that was
largely undeserved. Stock stars were treated as rock stars. . . .”
Although the individual fund manager is important, no fund manager is an
island. The resources and capabilities of the parent company are equally
important. Different companies have different capabilities and levels of exper-
tise in relation to the different types of funds. When you’re considering a
particular fund — for example, the Barnum & Barney High-Flying Foreign
Stock fund — examine the performance history and fees not only of that fund
but also of similar foreign stock funds at the Barnum & Barney company. If
Barnum’s other foreign stock funds have done poorly, or Barnum & Barney
212
Part III: Building Wealth with Wise Investing 

offers no other such funds because it’s focused on its circus business, those
are strikes against its High-Flying fund. Also be aware that “star” fund man-
agers tend to be associated with higher-expense funds to help pay their rock-
star salaries.
Rating tax friendliness
Investors often overlook tax implications when selecting mutual funds for
nonretirement accounts. Numerous mutual funds effectively reduce their
shareholders’ returns because of their tendency to produce more taxable dis-
tributions — that is, capital gains (especially short-term gains, which are
taxed at the highest federal income tax rate) and dividends. (See the
“Dividends” and “Capital gains” sections later in this chapter.)
Mutual fund capital gains distributions have an impact on an investor’s after-
tax rate of return. All mutual fund managers buy and sell stocks over the
course of a year. Whenever a mutual fund manager sells securities, any gain
or loss from those securities must be distributed to fund shareholders.
Securities sold at a loss can offset securities sold at a profit.
When a fund manager has a tendency to cash in more winners than losers,
investors in the fund receive a high amount of taxable gains. So, even though
some funds can lay claim to producing higher total returns, after you factor in
taxes, they actually may not produce higher total returns.
Choosing mutual funds that minimize capital gains distributions helps you
defer taxes on your profits. By allowing your capital to continue compounding
as it would in a retirement account, you receive a higher total return. When
you’re a long-term investor, you benefit most from choosing mutual funds that
minimize capital gains distributions. The more years that appreciation can
compound without being taxed, the greater the value to you as the investor.
Investors who purchase mutual funds outside tax-sheltered retirement
accounts should also consider the time of year they purchase shares in
funds. December is the most common month in which mutual funds make
capital gains distributions. When making purchases late in the year, ask if and
when the fund may make a significant capital gains distribution. Consider
delaying purchases in such funds until after the distribution date.
Determining your needs and goals
Selecting the best funds for you requires an understanding of your invest-
ment goals and risk tolerance. What may be a good fund for your next-door
neighbor may not necessarily be a good fund for you. You have a unique
financial profile.
213
Chapter 10: Investing in Mutual Funds

If you’ve already determined your needs and goals — terrific! If you haven’t,
refer to Chapter 4. Understanding yourself is a good part of the battle. But
don’t shortchange yourself by not being educated about the investment
you’re considering. If you don’t understand what you’re investing in and how
much risk you’re taking, stay out of the game.
Deciphering Your Fund’s Performance
When you look at a statement for your mutual fund holdings, odds are that
you’re not going to understand it. Getting a handle on how you’re doing is the
hardest part. Most people want to know (and have a hard time figuring out)
how much they made or lost on their investment.
You can’t simply calculate your return by comparing the share price of the
fund today to the share price you originally paid. Why not? Because mutual
funds make distributions (of dividends and capital gains), which gives you
more shares of the fund.
Distributions create an accounting problem, because they reduce the share
price of a fund. (Otherwise you could make a profit from the distribution by
buying into it just before a distribution is made.) Therefore, over time, follow-
ing just the share price of your fund doesn’t tell you how much money you
made or lost.
The only way to figure out exactly how much you made or lost on your
investment is to compare the total value of your holdings in the fund today
with the total dollar amount you originally invested. If you invested chunks of
money at various points in time and you want to factor in the timing of your
various investments, this exercise becomes complicated. (Check out my
investment software recommendations in Chapter 19 if you want your com-
puter to help you crunch the numbers.)
The total return of a fund is the percentage change of your investment over a
specified period. For example, a fund may tell you that in 2006, its total return
was 15 percent. Therefore, if you invested $10,000 in the fund on the last day
of 2005, your investment would be worth $11,500 at the end of 2006. To find
out a fund’s total return, you can call the fund company’s toll-free number,
visit the company’s Web site, or read the fund’s annual report.
The following three components make up your total return on a fund:
 Dividends (includes interest paid by money market or bond funds)
 Capital gains distributions
 Share price changes
214
Part III: Building Wealth with Wise Investing 

Dividends
Dividends are income paid by investments. Both bonds and stocks can pay
dividends. Bond fund dividends tend to be higher (as a percentage of the
amount you have invested in a fund). When a dividend distribution is made,
you can receive it as cash (which is good if you need money to live on) or as
more shares in the fund. In either case, the share price of the fund drops to
offset the payout. So if you’re hoping to strike it rich by buying into a bunch
of funds just before their dividends are paid, don’t bother. You’ll just end up
paying more in income taxes.
If you hold your mutual fund outside a retirement account, the dividend dis-
tributions are taxable income (unless they come from a tax-free municipal
bond fund). Dividends are taxable whether or not you reinvest them as addi-
tional shares in the fund. Thanks to the 2003 tax law changes, stock dividends
are taxed at a low rate — 5 percent for those in the federal 10 and 15 percent
tax brackets and 15 percent for everyone in the higher federal tax brackets.
Capital gains
When a mutual fund manager sells a security in the fund, net gains realized
from that sale (the difference from the purchase price) must be distributed to
you as a capital gain. Typically, funds make one annual capital gains distribu-
tion in December, but distributions can be paid multiple times per year.
As with a dividend distribution, you can receive your capital gains distribu-
tion as cash or as more shares in the fund. In either case, the share price of
the fund drops to offset the distribution.
For funds held outside retirement accounts, your capital gains distribution is
taxable. As with dividends, capital gains are taxable whether or not you rein-
vest them in additional shares in the fund. Capital gains distributions can be
partly comprised of short-term and long-term gains. As I discuss in Chapter 7,
profits realized on securities sold after more than a one-year holding period
are taxed at the lower long-term capital gains rate. Short-term gains are taxed
at the ordinary income tax rate.
If you want to avoid making an investment in a fund that is about to make a
capital gains distribution, check with the fund to determine when capital
gains are distributed. Capital gains distributions increase your current-year
tax liability for investments made outside of retirement accounts. (I discuss
this concept in more detail in Chapter 12.)
215
Chapter 10: Investing in Mutual Funds

Share price changes
You also make money with a mutual fund when the share price increases.
This occurrence is just like investing in a stock or piece of real estate. If the
mutual fund is worth more today than it was when you bought it, you made a
profit (on paper, at least). In order to realize or lock in this profit, you need to
sell your shares in the fund.
There you have it. Here are the components of a mutual fund’s total return:
Dividends + Capital Gains + Share Price 
Distributions   Changes     = Total Return
Evaluating and Selling Your Funds
How closely you follow your funds is up to you, depending on what makes
you happy and comfortable. I don’t recommend tracking the share prices of
your funds (or other investments, for that matter) on a daily basis; it’s time-
consuming and nerve-racking, and it can make you lose sight of the long-term
picture. When you track your investments too closely, you’re more likely to
panic when times get tough. And with investments held outside of retirement
accounts, every time you sell an investment at a profit, you get hit with taxes.
A monthly or quarterly check-in is more than frequent enough for following
your funds. Many publications carry total return numbers over varying peri-
ods so you can determine the exact rate of return you’re earning.
Trying to time and trade the markets so that you buy at lows and sell at highs
rarely works. Yet an entire industry of investment newsletters, hotlines,
online services, and the like purport to be able to tell you when to buy and
sell. Don’t waste your time and money on such predictive nonsense. (See
Chapter 8 for more info about gurus and newsletters.)
You should consider selling a fund when it no longer meets the criteria men-
tioned in “Selecting the Best Mutual Funds,” earlier in this chapter. If a fund
underperforms its peers for at least a two-year period, or if a fund jacks up its
management fees, it may be a good time to sell. But if you do your homework
and buy good funds from good fund companies, you shouldn’t have to do
much trading.
Finding and investing in good funds isn’t rocket science. Chapters 11 and 12
recommend some specific mutual funds using the criteria discussed earlier in
this chapter. If you’re still not satiated, pick up a copy of the latest edition of
my book Mutual Funds For Dummies (Wiley Publishing).

Chapter 11
Investing in Retirement Accounts
In This Chapter
 Deciding among different retirement accounts
 Determining how to allocate money in retirement accounts
 Moving your retirement account to a new firm
T
his chapter helps you make sense of the various retirement account
options and decide how to invest money you currently hold inside — or
plan to contribute to — retirement accounts. (To see how much money you
should be saving toward retirement, flip to Chapter 4.)
The numerous types of retirement accounts can be confusing; however, when
compared to the often overwhelming world of investing outside retirement
accounts, investing inside tax-sheltered retirement accounts — IRAs, 401(k)s,
SEP-IRAs, and Keoghs — is less complicated for two reasons:
 The range of possible retirement account investments is more limited.
Direct investments, such as real estate and investments in small, pri-
vately owned companies, are not generally available or accessible in
most retirement accounts.
 When you invest in a retirement account, your returns aren’t taxed as
you earn them. Money inside retirement accounts compounds and
grows without taxation. You generally pay taxes on these funds only
when you withdraw money from the account (except with Roth IRAs,
where qualified withdrawals of investment earnings are not taxed).
Direct transfers to another investment firm are not withdrawals, so
they’re not taxed.
Read on. I cover all the bases in this chapter first.
Looking at Types of Retirement Accounts
Retirement accounts offer numerous benefits. In most cases, your contribu-
tions to retirement accounts are tax-deductible. The contribution limits
increased significantly the earlier part of this decade. And when you place

your money inside the retirement account, it compounds without taxation
until you withdraw it. (Some accounts, such as the newer Roth IRA, even
allow for tax-free withdrawal of investment earnings.) If your adjusted gross
income is below $50,000 per year ($25,000 for single taxpayers), you may be
eligible for a new, special tax credit for making retirement account contribu-
tions — please refer to Table 7-2 in Chapter 7. The following sections detail
the types of retirement accounts and explain how to determine whether
you’re eligible and how to make the best use of them.
Employer-sponsored plans
Your employer sets up this type of retirement plan and usually provides a lim-
ited selection of investment options. All you have to do is contribute away and
choose how to spread your money among the menu of investment choices.
401(k) plans
For-profit companies offer 401(k) plans. The silly name comes from the section
of the tax code that establishes and regulates these plans. A 401(k) generally
allows you to save up to $15,000 per year (for 2006), usually through payroll
deductions. If you’re age 50 or older, you can stash away even more — $20,000
for 2006. Your employer’s plan may have lower limits, though. Your contribu-
tions to a 401(k) are excluded from your reported income and thus are gener-
ally free from federal and state income taxes (although they are subject to
Social Security and Medicare taxes). Future year limits will increase in $500
increments to keep pace with inflation.
Some employers don’t allow you to contribute to a 401(k) plan until you work
for them for a full year. Others allow you to start contributing right away.
Some employers also match a portion of your contributions. They may, for
example, match half of your first 6 percent of contributions; so in addition to
saving a lot of taxes, you get a bonus from the company.
If you’re a high-income earner and you contribute such a significant percent-
age of each paycheck that you hit the plan maximum before the end of the
year, you may lose out on some matching money. You may be better off
spreading your contributions over the full calendar year. Check with your
company’s benefits department for your plan’s specifics.
Thanks to technological innovations and the growth of the mutual fund
industry, smaller companies (those with fewer than 100 employees) can offer
401(k) plans, too. In the past, it was prohibitively expensive for smaller com-
panies to administer 401(k)s. If your company is interested in this option,
contact some of the leading mutual fund organizations and discount broker-
age firms that I discuss in Chapter 12 and in the section “Allocating money in
plans you design,” later in this chapter.

403(b) plans
Nonprofit organizations offer 403(b) plans to their employees. As with
401(k)s, your contributions to these plans are excluded from federal and
state income taxes. The 403(b) plans are more often known as tax-sheltered
annuities, the name for insurance company investments that satisfy the
requirements for 403(b) plans. For the benefit of 403(b) retirement plan par-
ticipants, no-load (commission-free) mutual funds can be used in 403(b)
plans. (See Chapter 10 for more on mutual funds.)
Nonprofit employees are allowed to annually contribute up to 20 percent or
$15,000 of their salary ($20,000 if age 50 or older), whichever is less, for tax
year 2006. (Future year-limits will increase with the cost of living in $500 incre-
ments.) Employees who have 15 or more years of service may be allowed to
contribute beyond the standard limits. Ask your employee benefits department
or the investment provider for the 403(b) plan about eligibility requirements
and the details of your personal contribution limit.
219
Chapter 11: Investing in Retirement Accounts
Can your employer steal your retirement 
plan money?
The short answer, unfortunately, is yes.
However, the vast majority of employees, par-
ticularly those who work for larger and more
established companies, need not worry.
Some companies that administer 401(k) plans
have been cited by the U.S. Labor Department for
being too slow in putting money that employees
had deferred from their paychecks into employee
401(k) investment accounts. In the worst cases,
companies diverted employees’ 401(k) money to
pay corporate bills. Many business owners who
engaged in such practices used 401(k) money as
a short-term emergency fund.
In cases where companies failed and funds
were diverted from employee 401(k) accounts,
the funds were lost. In situations where the
employer delayed placing the money into the
employees’ 401(k) accounts, employees simply
lost out on earning returns on their investments
during the period. When your contributions are
in your 401(k) account, they’re financially and
legally separate from your employer. Thus, your
funds are still protected even if your employer
goes bankrupt.
After conducting hundreds of investigations, the
Labor Department issued rulings requiring
employers to contribute employee retirement
contributions to their proper accounts within 90
days. In addition to keeping tabs on your
employer to ensure that money withheld from
your paycheck is contributed into your account
within this time frame, you should also periodi-
cally check your 401(k) statement to make sure
that your contributions are being invested as
you instructed.

If you work for a nonprofit or public-sector organization that doesn’t offer
this benefit, make a fuss and insist on it. Nonprofit organizations have no
excuse not to offer a 403(b) plan to their employees. Unlike a 401(k), this type
of plan requires virtually no out-of-pocket expenses from the employer. The
only requirement is that the organization must deduct the appropriate contri-
bution from employees’ paychecks and send the money to the investment
company handling the 403(b) plan.
Some nonprofits don’t offer 403(b)s. Or in addition to 403(b)s, some nonprof-
its may offer insurance company tax-sheltered annuities. When compared to
insurance company annuities, no-load (no sales charges) mutual funds are
superior investment vehicles on several fronts:
 Mutual fund companies have a longer and more successful investment
track record than do insurance companies, many of which have only
recently entered the mutual fund arena.
 Insurance annuities charge higher annual operating expenses, often two
to three times those of efficiently managed no-load mutual funds. These
high expenses reduce your returns.
 Insurance company insolvency (bankruptcy) can risk the safety of your
investment in an annuity, whereas the value of a mutual fund depends
only on the value of the securities in the fund. Fund companies don’t fail.
 Insurance annuities come with significant charges for early surrender;
403(b) plans with mutual funds don’t include these charges.
With some 403(b) plans, you may borrow against your fund balance without
penalty. If this capability is important to you, check with your employer to
see whether the company plan allows loans. Although many insurance annu-
ities advertise borrowing as an advantage, it can also be a drawback, because
it may encourage you to raid your retirement savings.
As long as your employer allows it, you may want to open a 403(b) account at
the investment companies I suggest in the section “Allocating money in plans
you design,” later in this chapter.
457 plans
Some nonprofit organizations offer 457 plans. Like 403(b) or 401(k) plans, 457
plans offer participants the ability to contribute money from their paychecks
on a pre-tax basis and thus save on federal and state taxes.
Money that you contribute to a tax-exempt organization’s 457 plan is not sep-
arate from the organization’s finances. Thus, if the nonprofit goes belly up —
a rare but not impossible occurrence in the nonprofit world — your retirement
funds could be in jeopardy.
220
Part III: Building Wealth with Wise Investing 

Don’t consider contributing to a tax-exempt organization’s 457 plan until you
exhaust contributions to your 403(b). The 2006 tax year contribution limits
for a 457 plan are $15,000 per year ($20,000 if age 50 or older). Future year-
limits will increase with inflation.
Self-employed plans
When you work for yourself, you don’t have an employer to do the legwork
necessary for setting up a retirement plan. You need to take the initiative.
Although setting up a retirement account on your own requires more work,
you can select and design a plan that meets your needs. Self-employment
retirement savings plans often allow you to put more money away on a tax-
deductible basis than do employers’ plans.
When you have employees, you’re required to provide coverage for them
under these plans with contributions comparable to the company owners’
(as a percentage of salary). Some part-time (fewer than 1,000 hours per year)
and newer employees (less than a few years of service) may be excluded.
Many small-business owners either don’t know about this requirement or
choose to ignore it; they set up plans for themselves but fail to cover their
employees. The danger is that the IRS and state tax authorities may discover
small-business owners’ negligence, sock them with big penalties, and disqual-
ify their prior contributions. Don’t muck up this area, because self-employed
people and small businesses get their tax returns audited at a relatively
high rate.
To get the most from contributions as an employer, consider the following
advice:
 Educate your employees about the value of retirement savings plans.
You want them to understand, but more importantly, you want them to
appreciate your investment.
 Select a Keogh plan (see “Keoghs,” later in this chapter) that requires
employees to stay a certain number of years before they vest fully in
their contributions. Reward long-term contributors to your company’s
success.
 Consider offering a 401(k) or SIMPLE (Savings Incentive Match Plan for
Employees) if you have more than ten employees. (For more information
on the SIMPLE, see the Department of Labor’s Web site at www.dol.gov/
ebsa/publications/simple.html.)
Making retirement contributions doesn’t have to increase your personnel
costs. In the long run, you build the contributions you make for your employ-
ees into their total compensation package — which includes salary and bene-
fits such as health insurance.
221
Chapter 11: Investing in Retirement Accounts

SEP-IRAs
SEP-IRA (Simplified Employee Pension Individual Retirement Account) plans
require little paperwork to set up. SEP-IRAs allow you to sock away 20 per-
cent of your self-employment income (business revenue minus deductions),
up to a maximum of $44,000 (tax year 2006). Future contribution limits will
rise with inflation in $1,000 increments.
Each year, you decide the amount you want to contribute — with no mini-
mums. Your contributions to a SEP-IRA are deducted from your taxable
income, saving you big-time on federal and state taxes. As with other retire-
ment plans, your money compounds without taxation until you withdraw it.
Keoghs
Setting up and administering Keogh plans requires a bit more paperwork
than SEP-IRAs. The historic appeal of certain types of Keoghs was that they
allow you to put away a greater amount of your self-employment income (rev-
enue less your deductions). However, Keogh plans now have the same contri-
bution limits (20 percent of net self-employment income up to $44,000 per
year) that SEP-IRA plans have. (This is the 2006 tax year limit; future limits
will increase with inflation in $1,000 increments.)
Keogh plans still hold some unique appeal for business owners who seek to
maximize their own personal retirement plan contributions relative to those
made for employees. All types of Keogh plans allow vesting schedules, which
require employees to remain with the company a number of years before
they earn the right to their full retirement account balances.
222
Part III: Building Wealth with Wise Investing 
Don’t be hoodwinked into a “private pension plan”
Employers who don’t want to make retirement
plan contributions on behalf of their employees
are bait for insurance salespeople selling so-
called “private pension plans.” Basically, these
plans are cash value life insurance policies that
combine life insurance protection with a savings-
type account. (See Chapter 16 for more details.)
The selling hook of these plans is that you can
save money for yourself, but you don’t need to
contribute money on your employees’ behalf.
And your contributions compound without tax-
ation over the years.
Sound too good to be true? Well, life insurance
salespeople who earn hefty commissions from
selling cash value life policies won’t tell you
about the big negatives of these plans. Unlike
contributions to true retirement savings plans
such as SEP-IRAs and Keoghs, you derive no
upfront tax deduction. Your investment returns
will be quite mediocre, especially due to these
plans’ high and hidden fees.
Also, if you don’t need life insurance protection,
the cost of such coverage is wasted when you
save through these plans.

Keogh plans also allow for Social Security integration. Without going into all
the gory tax details, integration effectively allows those in the company who
are high-income earners (usually the owners) to receive larger-percentage
contributions for their accounts than the less-highly compensated employ-
ees. The logic behind this idea is that Social Security benefits top out when
you earn more than $94,200 (for 2006). Social Security integration allows you
to make up for this ceiling.
Keoghs come in several flavors:
 Profit-sharing plans: These plans have the same contribution limits as
SEP-IRAs. So why would you want the headaches of a more complicated
plan when you can’t contribute more to it? These plans appeal to
owners of small companies who want to minimize the contributions to
which their employees are entitled, which is done through the use of
vesting schedules and Social Security integration.
 Money-purchase pension plans: These plans now have the same contri-
bution limits as SEP-IRA plans. Flexibility is not allowed on the percent-
age contribution you make each year — it’s fixed. Thus, these plans
make the most sense for employers who are comfortable enough finan-
cially to continue making contributions that are a high percentage of
their salary.
 Defined-benefit plans: These plans are for people who are willing and
able to put away more than $44,000 per year — which, as you can imag-
ine, few people can do. If you’re a consistently high-income earner who’s
older than 45 and you want to save more than $44,000 per year in a
retirement account, you may want to consider these plans. If you’re
interested in defined-benefit plans, hire an actuary to crunch the num-
bers and calculate how much you can contribute to such a plan.
Individual retirement accounts (IRAs)
Anyone with employment income can contribute to an Individual retirement
account. You may contribute up to $4,000 each year — $5,000 if you’re age 50
or older. (In 2008, the contribution limits increase to $5,000; and if you’re 50
and older, then it’s $6,000.) If you earn less than these contribution limits,
you can contribute up to the amount you earn. This rule has an exception if
you’re a nonworking spouse: As long as the working spouse earned at least
$8,000 in income, the nonworking spouse can put up to $4,000 per year into
a so-called spousal IRA, and the working spouse, up to $4,000 into his or her
own IRA.
Another exception to earning employment income makes you eligible to con-
tribute to an IRA: receiving alimony.
223
Chapter 11: Investing in Retirement Accounts

Your contributions to an IRA may or may not be tax-deductible. For tax year
2006, if you’re single and your adjusted gross income is $50,000 or less for the
year, you can deduct your full IRA contribution. If you’re married and file your
taxes jointly, you’re entitled to a full IRA deduction if your AGI (adjusted gross
income) is $75,000 per year or less. (For 2007 and beyond, these thresholds
bump up to $50,000 and $80,000, respectively.) If you make more than these
amounts, you can take a full IRA deduction if and only if you’re not an active
participant in any other retirement plan. The only way to know for certain
whether you’re an active participant is to look at your W-2 Form — that small-
ish (4-by-81⁄2-inch) document your employer sends you early in the year to file
with your tax returns. An X mark in a little box in section 13 on that form indi-
cates whether you’re an active participant in an employer retirement plan.
If your adjusted gross income is higher than the previously mentioned amounts
by less than $10,000, you’re eligible for a partial IRA deduction, even if you’re
an active participant in another plan. The IRS 1040 instruction booklet comes
with a worksheet that allows you to do the calculations for your situation.
If you can’t deduct your contribution to a standard IRA, consider making a
contribution to a newer type of IRA called the Roth IRA. With the Roth IRA,
the contribution is not deductible (you’re contributing after-tax dollars), but
earnings inside the account are shielded from tax; and unlike a standard IRA,
qualified withdrawals from the account, including investment earnings, are
free from income tax. Single taxpayers with an AGI less than $95,000, and
joint filers with an AGI less than $150,000 can contribute up to $4,000 per year
to a Roth IRA ($5,000 for those age 50 and older), provided that they have at
least that amount in earned income. (As with regular IRAs, Roth IRA contribu-
tion limits increase in 2008 to $5,000 for people under 50 and $6,000 for those
age 50 and older.)
To make a qualified (tax-free) withdrawal, you must be at least 591⁄2 and have
held the account for at least five years. An exception to the age rule is made
for first-time home buyers, who can withdraw up to $10,000 toward the down
payment on a principal residence.
Annuities: An odd investment
Annuities are peculiar investment products. They’re contracts that are backed
by an insurance company. If you, the annuity holder (investor), die during the
so-called accumulation phase (that is, prior to receiving payments from the
annuity), your designated beneficiary is guaranteed to receive the amount of
your contribution. In this sense, annuities look a bit like life insurance.
224
Part III: Building Wealth with Wise Investing 

Annuities, like IRAs, allow your capital to grow and compound without taxa-
tion. You defer taxes until withdrawal. Annuities carry the same penalties for
withdrawal prior to age 591⁄2 as do other retirement accounts.
Unlike an IRA, which has an annual contribution limit, you can deposit as
much as you want into an annuity in any year — even a million dollars or
more if you have it! As with a so-called nondeductible IRA, you get no upfront
tax deduction for your contributions.
225
Chapter 11: Investing in Retirement Accounts
Inappropriate retirement account investments
Some investments for retirement accounts
simply don’t make sense. The basic problem
stems from otherwise intelligent folks’ forgetting,
ignoring, or simply not knowing that retirement
accounts are sheltered from taxation; you want
to maximize this benefit by selecting investment
vehicles that would otherwise be taxed.
Investments that produce income that is tax-free
either at the federal or state level don’t generally
make much sense inside retirement accounts.
Tax-free securities always yield less than their
taxable counterparts, so you’re essentially giving
away free yield when you invest in such securi-
ties inside retirement accounts.
Investing in municipal bonds inside a retirement
account is a big no-no, and the better investment
firms don’t let you make this mistake. Municipals
are free from federal taxation (and state tax, too,
if you buy such a bond issued in your state). As
such, they yield significantly less than an equiv-
alent bond that pays fully taxable dividends.
Lots of people make the mistake (albeit a smaller
one) of investing in Treasuries — that is, U.S.
Treasury bills, notes, or bonds — inside retire-
ment accounts. When you buy Treasuries, you
get the safety net of a government guarantee, but
you also get a bond that produces interest free
of state tax. Fully taxable bonds yield more than
state-tax-free Treasuries. And the safety of
Treasuries can be replicated in other bonds.
Although annuities are retirement vehicles, as
noted earlier in this chapter, they have no place
inside retirement accounts. Annuities allow
your investment dollars to compound without
taxation. In comparison to other investments
that don’t allow such tax deferral, annuities
carry much higher annual operating expenses,
which depress your returns.
Purchasing an annuity inside an IRA, 401(k), or
other type of retirement account is like wearing
a belt and suspenders together. Either you have
a peculiar sense of style, or you’re spending too
much time worrying about your pants falling
down. In my experience, many people who mis-
takenly invest in annuities inside retirement
accounts have been misled by investment
salespeople.
Limited partnerships are treacherous, high-
commission, high-cost (and hence low-return)
investments sold through investment salespeo-
ple. Part of their supposed allure, however, is
the tax benefits they generate. But when you
buy and hold a limited partnership in a retire-
ment account, you lose the ability to take advan-
tage of many of the tax deductions. The
illiquidity of LPs may also mean that you can’t
make required retirement account withdrawals
when needed. These are just some of the many
reasons to avoid investing in limited partner-
ships. (For more reasons, see Chapter 9.)

Contributing to an annuity may make sense if
 You have exhausted contributions to employer-sponsored and self-
employed plans. Your contributions to these retirement accounts are
tax-deductible, while annuity contributions are not.
 You have made the maximum contribution possible to an IRA, even if
it’s not tax-deductible. Annuities carry higher fees (which reduce your
investment returns) because of the insurance that comes with them; IRA
investments offer you slightly better returns. Roth IRAs also allow for
tax-free withdrawal of investment earnings.
 You expect to leave the money compounding in the annuity for at
least 15 years. It typically takes this long for the benefits of tax-deferred
compounding to outweigh the higher annuity fees and treatment of all
withdrawn annuity earnings at the higher ordinary income tax rates. If
you’re close to or are actually in retirement, tax-friendly investments
made outside of retirement accounts (discussed in Chapter 12) are
preferable.
For details about other investment options and the best places to purchase
annuities, see Chapter 12, where I discuss investing money outside of retire-
ment accounts.
Allocating Your Money
in Retirement Plans
With good reason, people are concerned about placing their retirement
account money in investments that can decline in value. You may feel that
you’re gambling with dollars intended for the security of your golden years.
Most working folks need to make their money work hard in order for it to grow
fast enough to provide this security. This involves taking some risk; you have
no way around it. Luckily, if you have 15 to 20 years or more before you need
to draw on the bulk of your retirement account assets, time is on your side. As
long as the value of your investments has time to recover, what’s the big deal
if some of your investments drop a bit over a year or two? The more years you
have before you’re going to retire, the greater your ability to take risk.
The section on asset allocation in Chapter 8 can help you decide how to
divide your money among different investment options based on your time
frame and risk tolerance.
226
Part III: Building Wealth with Wise Investing 

Prioritizing retirement contributions
When you have access to various retirement accounts, prioritize which
account you’re going to use first by determining how much each gives you
in return. Your first contributions should be to employer-based plans that
match your contributions. After that, contribute to any other employer or self-
employed plans that allow tax-deductible contributions. After you contribute
as much as possible to these tax-deductible plans (or if you don’t have access
to such plans), contribute to an IRA. If you max out on contributions to an IRA
or you don’t have this choice because you lack employment income, consider
an annuity (see “Annuities: An odd investment,” earlier in this chapter).
Setting up a retirement account
Investments and account types are different issues. People sometimes get con-
fused when discussing the investments they make in retirement accounts —
especially people who have a retirement account, such as an IRA, at a bank.
They don’t realize that you can have your IRA at a variety of financial institu-
tions (for example, a mutual fund company or brokerage firm). At each finan-
cial institution, you can choose among the firm’s investment options for
putting your IRA money to work.
No-load, or commission-free, mutual fund and discount brokerage firms are
your best bet for establishing a retirement account. For more specifics, see
my recommendations throughout the remainder of this chapter.
Allocating money when your employer
selects the investment options
In some company-sponsored plans, such as 401(k)s, you’re limited to the
predetermined investment options your employer offers. In the following
sections, I discuss typical investment options for 401(k) plans in order of
increasing risk and, hence, likely return. Then I follow with examples for
how to allocate your money across the different types of common employer
retirement plan options.
Money market/savings accounts
For regular contributions that come out of your paycheck, the money market
or savings account option makes little sense. Some people who are skittish
about the stock and bond markets are attracted to money market and savings
accounts because they can’t drop in value. However, the returns are low . . .
so low that you have a great risk that your investment will not stay ahead of,
or even keep up with, inflation and taxes (which are due upon withdrawal of
your money from the retirement account).
227
Chapter 11: Investing in Retirement Accounts

Don’t be tempted to use a money market fund as a parking place until the
time that you think stocks and bonds are cheap. In the long run, you won’t be
doing yourself any favors. As I discuss in Chapter 8, timing your investments
to attempt to catch the lows and avoid the peaks is not possible.
You may need to keep money in the money market investment option if you
utilize the borrowing feature that some retirement plans allow. Check with
your employee benefits department for more details. After you retire, you
may also want to use a money market account to hold money you expect to
withdraw and spend within a year or so.
Bond mutual funds
Bond mutual funds (which I describe in Chapter 10) invest in a mixture of
typically high-quality bonds. Bonds pay a higher rate of interest or dividends
than money funds. Depending on whether your plan’s option is a short-term,
intermediate-term, or long-term fund (maybe you have more than one type),
the bond fund’s current yield is probably a percent or two higher than the
money market fund’s yield.
Bond funds carry higher yields than money market funds, but they also carry
greater risk, because their value can fall if interest rates increase. However,
bonds tend to be more stable in value than stocks.
Aggressive, younger investors should keep a minimum amount of money in
bond funds. Older folks who want to invest conservatively can place more
money in bonds (see the asset allocation discussion in Chapter 8).
Guaranteed-investment contracts (GICs)
Guaranteed-investment contracts are backed by an insurance company, and
they typically quote you a rate of return projected one or a few years for-
ward. The positive return is certain — so you don’t have the uncertainty that
you normally face with bond or stock investments (unless, of course, the
insurance company fails).
The attraction of these investments is that your account value does not fluc-
tuate (at least, not that you can see). Insurers normally invest your money
mostly in bonds and maybe a bit in stocks. The difference between what
these investments generate for the insurer and what they pay in interest to
GIC investors is profit to the insurer. A GIC’s yield is usually comparable to
that of a bond fund.
For people who hit the eject button the moment that a bond fund slides a bit
in value, GICs are soothing to the nerves. And they’re certainly higher yield-
ing than a money market or savings account.
228
Part III: Building Wealth with Wise Investing 

Like bonds, however, GICs don’t give you the opportunity for long-term
growth. Over the long haul, you should earn a better return in a mixture of
bond and stock investments. In GICs, you pay for the peace of mind of a guar-
anteed return with lower long-term returns.
GICs also have another minor drawback: Insurance companies, unlike mutual
funds, can and do fail, putting GIC investment dollars at risk. Some employ-
ers’ retirement plans have been burned by insurance company failures.
Balanced mutual funds
Balanced mutual funds invest primarily in a mixture of stocks and bonds.
This one-stop-shopping concept makes investing easier and smoothes out
fluctuations in the value of your investments — funds investing exclusively in
stocks or in bonds make for a rougher ride. These funds are solid options
and, in fact, can be used for a significant portion of your retirement plan con-
tributions. See Chapter 10 to find out more about balanced funds.
Stock mutual funds
Stock mutual funds invest in stocks, which often provide greater long-term
growth potential but also wider fluctuations in value from year to year. Some
companies offer a number of different stock funds, including funds that invest
overseas. Unless you plan to borrow against your funds to purchase a home
(if your plan allows), you should have a healthy helping of stock funds. See
Chapter 10 for an explanation of the different types of stock funds as well as
for details on how to evaluate a stock fund.
Stock in the company you work for
Some companies offer employees the option of investing in the company’s
stock. I generally advocate avoiding this option for the simple reason that
your future income and other employee benefits are already riding on the
success of the company. If the company hits the skids, you may lose your job
and your benefits. You certainly don’t want the value of your retirement
account to depend on the same factors.
In the early 2000s, you may have heard all the hubbub about companies such
as Enron going under and the employees losing piles of money in their retire-
ment savings plans. Enron’s bankruptcy in and of itself shouldn’t have caused
direct problems in Enron’s 401(k) plan. The problem was that Enron required
employees to hold substantial amounts of Enron company stock. Thus, when
the company tanked, employees lost their jobs and their retirement savings
balances.
229
Chapter 11: Investing in Retirement Accounts

Congress is (belatedly) weighing bills that would greatly limit companies
from being able to force employees to hold retirement plan money in com-
pany stock. In the meantime, many companies with Enron-like retirement sav-
ings plans are redesigning their plans and not requiring employees to hold
such large portions in company stock for so many years.
If you think that your company has its act together and the stock is a good
buy, investing a portion of your retirement account is fine — but no more
than 25 percent. Now, if your company is on the verge of hitting it big and the
stock is soon to soar, you’ll of course be kicking yourself for not putting more
of your money into the company’s stock. But when you place a big bet on
your company’s stock, be prepared to suffer the consequences if the stock
tanks. Don’t forget that lots of smart investors track companies’ prospects,
so odds are that the current value of your company’s stock is reasonably fair.
Some employers offer employees the option to buy company stock at a dis-
count, sometimes as much as 15 percent, when compared to its current
market value. If your company offers a discount on its stock, take advantage
of it. When you sell the stock as your employer’s plan allows (usually after a
certain holding period), you should be able to lock in a decent profit.
Some asset allocation examples
Using the methodology that I outline in Chapter 8 for allocating money,
Table 11-1 shows a couple examples of how people in different employer
plans may choose to allocate their 401(k) investments among the plan’s
investment options.
Please note that making allocation decisions is not a science. Use the formu-
las in Chapter 8 as a guideline.

Allocating money in plans you design
With self-employed plans (SEP-IRAs and Keoghs), certain 403(b) plans for
nonprofit employees, and IRAs, you may select the investment options as
well as the allocation of money among them. In the sections that follow, I give
some specific recipes that you may find useful for investing at some of the
premier investment companies.
To establish your retirement account at one of these firms, simply pick up
your telephone, dial the company’s toll-free number, and ask the representa-
tive to mail you an account application for the type of account (for example,
SEP-IRA, 403(b), and so on) you want to set up. You can also have the com-
pany mail you background information on specific mutual funds. If you’re
enamored with the Internet, many investment firms provide downloadable
account applications, and some allow you to complete the application online.
Note: In the examples, I recommend a conservative portfolio and an aggres-
sive portfolio for each firm. I use the terms conservative and aggressive in a
relative sense. Because some of the funds I recommend do not maintain fixed
percentages of their different types of investments, the actual percentage of
stocks and bonds that you end up with may vary slightly from the targeted
percentages. Don’t sweat it.
Where you have more than one fund choice, you can pick one or split the
suggested percentage among them. If you don’t have enough money today to
divide your portfolio up as I suggest, you can achieve the desired split over
time as you add more money to your retirement accounts.
Vanguard
Vanguard (800-662-7447; www.vanguard.com) is a mutual fund powerhouse.
It’s the largest no-load fund company, and it consistently has the lowest oper-
ating expenses in the business. Historically, Vanguard’s funds have excellent
performance when compared to those of its peers, especially among conserv-
atively managed bond and stock funds.

If you don’t want to risk too much, try this:
 Vanguard Total Bond Market Index — 25 percent
 Vanguard Star (fund of funds) — 60 percent
 Vanguard International Value and/or Vanguard Total International Stock

Or you can place 100 percent in Vanguard LifeStrategy Growth (fund of
funds). Note that this portfolio places less money overseas than the preced-
ing example.
Fidelity
Fidelity Investments (800-544-8888; www.fidelity.com) is the largest
provider of mutual funds in terms of total assets. However, some Fidelity
funds assess sales charges (no such funds are recommended in the sections
that follow).

Discount brokers
As I discuss in Chapter 8, a discount brokerage account can allow you cen-
tralized, one-stop shopping and the ability to hold mutual funds from a vari-
ety of leading fund companies. Some funds are available without transaction
fees, although most of the better funds require you to pay a small transaction
fee when you buy funds through a discount broker. The reason: The dis-
counter is a middleman between you and the fund companies. You have to
232
Part III: Building Wealth with Wise Investing 

weigh the convenience of being able to buy and hold funds from multiple
fund companies in a single account versus the lower cost of buying funds
directly from their providers. A $25 to $30 transaction fee can gobble a size-
able chunk of what you have to invest, especially if you’re investing smaller
amounts.
Among brokerage firms or brokerage divisions of mutual fund companies, for
breadth of fund offerings and competitive pricing, I like TD Ameritrade
(800-934-4448; www.tdwaterhouse.com), T. Rowe Price (800-225-5132;

Chapter 11: Investing in Retirement Accounts
Should I use more than one investment firm?
The firms I recommend in this chapter offer a
large-enough variety of investment options,
managed by different fund managers, that you
can feel comfortable concentrating your money
at one firm. Discovering the nuances and
choices of just one firm rather than several and
having fewer administrative hassles are the
advantages of a focused approach.
If you like the idea of spreading your money
around, you may want to invest through a
number of different firms. With a discount bro-
kerage account (see Chapter 8), you can eat
your cake and have it, too. You can diversify
across different mutual fund companies through
one brokerage firm. However, you’ll pay small
transaction fees on some of your purchases and
sales of funds.

Transferring Retirement Accounts
With the exception of plans maintained by your employer that limit your
investment options, such as most 401(k)s, you can move your money held in
an SEP-IRA, Keogh, IRA, and many 403(b) plans (also known as tax-sheltered
annuities) to almost any major investment firm. Moving the money is pretty
simple: If you can fill out a couple short forms and send them back in a
postage-paid envelope, you can transfer an account. The investment firm to
which you’re transferring your account does the rest.
Transferring accounts you control
Here’s a step-by-step list of what you need to do to transfer a retirement
account to another investment firm. Even if you’re working with a financial
advisor, you should be aware of this process (called a direct trustee-to-trustee
transfer) to ensure that no hanky-panky takes place on the advisor’s part.
1. Decide where you want to move the account.
I recommend several investment companies in this chapter, along with
some sample portfolios within those firms. You may also want to consult
the latest editions of some of my other books, including Mutual Funds
For Dummies and Investing For Dummies (Wiley Publishing).
2. Obtain an account application and asset transfer form.
Call the toll-free number of the firm you’re transferring the money to and
ask for an account application and asset transfer form for the type of
account you’re transferring — for example, SEP-IRA, Keogh, IRA, or
403(b). You can also visit the firm’s Web site, but for this type of request,
I think most people find it easier to speak directly to someone.
Ask for the form for the same type of account you currently have at the
company from which you’re transferring the money. You can determine
the account type by looking at a recent account statement — the account
type should appear near the top of the form or in the section with your
name and address. If you can’t figure out the account type on a cryptic
statement, call the firm where the account is currently held and ask a
representative to tell you what kind of account you have.
Never, ever sign over assets such as checks and security certificates to a
financial advisor, no matter how trustworthy and honest he or she may
seem. The advisor could bolt with them quicker than you can say “Bonnie
and Clyde.” Transfers should not be completed this way. Besides, you’ll
find it easier to handle the transfer by following the information in this
section.
234
Part III: Building Wealth with Wise Investing 

3. Complete and mail the account application and asset transfer form.
Completing these for your new investment firm opens your new account
and authorizes the transfer.
You shouldn’t take possession of the money in your retirement account
when moving it over to the new firm. The tax authorities impose huge
penalties if you perform a transfer incorrectly. Let the company to which
you’re transferring the money do the transfer for you. If you have ques-
tions or problems, the firm(s) to which you’re transferring your account
has armies of capable employees waiting to help you. Remember, these
firms know that you’re transferring your money to them, so they should
roll out the red carpet.
4. Figure out which securities you want to transfer and which need to be
liquidated.
Transferring existing investments in your account to a new investment
firm can sometimes be a little sticky. Transferring such assets as cash
(money market funds) or securities that trade on any of the major stock
exchanges is not a problem.
If you own publicly traded securities, transferring them as is (also
known as transferring them in kind) to your new investment firm is
better, especially if the firm offers discount brokerage services. You can
then sell your securities through that firm more cheaply.
If you own mutual funds unique to the institution you’re leaving, check
with your new firm to see whether it can accept them. If not, you need to
contact the firm that currently holds them to sell them.
Certificates of deposit are tricky to transfer. Ideally, you should send in
the transfer forms several weeks or so before the CDs mature — few
people do this. If the CD matures soon, call the bank and tell it that when
the CD matures, you would like the funds to be invested in a savings or
money market account that you can access without penalty when your
transfer request lands in the bank’s mailbox.
5. Let the firm from which you’re transferring the money know that
you’re doing so. (This step is optional.)
If the place you’re transferring the money from doesn’t assign a specific
person to your account, you can definitely skip this step. When you’re
moving your investments from a brokerage firm where you dealt with
a particular broker, deciding whether to follow this step can be more
difficult.
Most people feel obligated to let their representative know that they’re
moving their money. In my experience, calling the person with the “bad
news” is usually a mistake. Brokers or others who have a direct financial
stake in your decision to move your money will try to sell you on stay-
ing. Some may try to make you feel guilty for leaving, and some may
even try to bully you.
235
Chapter 11: Investing in Retirement Accounts

Writing a letter may seem like the coward’s way out, but writing usually
makes leaving your broker easier for both of you. You can polish what
you have to say, and you don’t put the broker on the defensive. Although
I don’t want to encourage lying, not telling the whole truth may be an
even better idea. Excuses, such as that you have a family member in the
investment business who will manage your money for free, may help you
avoid an uncomfortable confrontation.
Then again, telling an investment firm that its charges are too high or
that it misrepresented and sold you a bunch of lousy investments may
help the firm improve in the future. Don’t fret too much — do what’s
best for you and what you’re comfortable with. Brokers are not your
friends. Even though the broker may know your kids’ names, your
favorite hobbies, and your birthday, you have a business relationship
with him.
Transferring your existing assets typically takes a month to complete. If the
transfer is not completed within one month, get in touch with your new
investment firm to determine the problem. If your old company isn’t cooper-
ating, call a manager there to help get the ball rolling.
The unfortunate reality is that an investment firm will cheerfully set up a new
account to accept your money on a moment’s notice, but it will drag its feet,
sometimes for months, when the time comes to relinquish your money. To
light a fire under the behinds of the folks at the investment firm, tell a man-
ager at the old firm that you’re going to send letters to the National
Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) and the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) if it doesn’t complete your transfer within the next week.
Moving money from an employer’s plan
When you leave a job, particularly if you’re retiring or being laid off after
many years of service, money-hungry brokers and financial planners proba-
bly will be on you like a pack of bears on a tree leaking sweet honey. If you
seek financial help, tread carefully — Chapter 18 helps you avoid the pitfalls
of hiring such assistance.
When you leave a job, you’re confronted with a slightly different transfer chal-
lenge: moving money from an employer plan into one of your own retirement
accounts. (As long as your employer allows it, you may be able to leave your
money in your old employer’s plan. Evaluate the quality of the investment
choices using the information I provide in this part of the book.) Typically,
employer retirement plan money can be rolled over into your own IRA. Check
with your employer’s benefits department or a tax advisor for details.
236
Part III: Building Wealth with Wise Investing 

Federal tax law requires employers to withhold, as a tax, 20 percent of any
retirement account disbursements to plan participants. So if you’re person-
ally taking possession of your retirement account money in order to transfer
it to an IRA, you must wait until you file your annual tax return to be reim-
bursed by the government for this 20 percent withholding. This withholding
creates a problem, because if you don’t replace the 20 percent withholding
into the rollover IRA, the IRS treats the shortfall as an early distribution sub-
ject to income tax and penalties.
Never take personal possession of money from your employer’s retirement
plan. To avoid the 20 percent tax withholding and a lot of other hassles,
simply inform your employer of where you want your money to be sent. Prior
to doing so, establish an appropriate account (an IRA, for example) at the
investment firm you intend to use. Then tell your employer’s benefits depart-
ment where you’d like your retirement money transferred. You can send your
employer a copy of your account statement, which contains the investment
firm’s mailing address and your account number.

I
n this chapter, I discuss investment options for money held outside retire-
ment accounts, and I include some sample portfolio recommendations.
(Chapter 11 reviews investments for money inside retirement accounts.) This
distinction may seem somewhat odd — it’s not one that’s made in most finan-
cial books and articles. However, thinking of these two types of investments
differently can be useful because
 Investments held outside retirement accounts are subject to taxation.
You have a whole range of different investment options to consider
when taxes come into play.
 Money held outside retirement accounts is more likely to be used
sooner than funds held inside retirement accounts. Why? Because
you’ll generally have to pay far more in income taxes to access money
inside rather than outside retirement accounts.
 Funds inside retirement accounts have their own nuances. For example,
when you invest through your employer’s retirement plan, your invest-
ment options are usually limited to a handful of choices. And special rules
govern transfer of your retirement account balances.
Getting Started
Suppose that you have some money sitting around in a bank savings account
or money market mutual fund. Your money is earning a small amount of inter-
est, but you want to invest it more profitably. You need to remember two
things about investing this type of money:

 Earning a little is better than losing 20 to 50 percent or more. Just talk
to anyone who bought a lousy investment. Be patient. Educate yourself
before you invest.
 To earn a higher rate of return, you must be willing to take more risk.
In order to earn a better rate of return, you need to consider investments
that fluctuate in value — of course, the value can drop as well as rise.
You approach the vast sea of investment options and start stringing up your
rod to go fishing. You hear stories of people catching big ones — cashing in
big on stocks or real estate that they bought years ago. Even if you don’t
have delusions of grandeur, you’d at least like your money to grow faster
than the cost of living.
But before you cast your investment line, consider the following often over-
looked ways to put your money to work and earn higher returns without
much risk. These options may not be as exciting as hunting the big fish out
there, but they should easily improve your financial health.
Paying off high-interest debt
Many folks have credit card or other consumer debt that costs more than 10
percent per year in interest. Paying off this debt with savings is like putting
your money in an investment with a guaranteed return that’s equal to the
rate you’re paying on the debt.
For example, if you have credit card debt outstanding at 14 percent interest,
paying off that loan is the same as putting your money to work in an invest-
ment with a sure 14 percent annual return. Remember that the interest on
consumer debt is not tax-deductible, so you actually need to earn more than
14 percent investing your money elsewhere in order to net 14 percent after
paying taxes. (See Chapter 5 for more details if you’re still not convinced.)
Paying off some of or your entire mortgage may make sense, too. This finan-
cial move isn’t as clear as erasing consumer debt, because the mortgage
interest rate is lower than it is on consumer debt and is usually tax-
deductible. (See Chapter 14 for more details on this strategy.)
Taking advantage of tax breaks
Make sure that you take advantage of the tax benefits offered on retirement
accounts. If you work for a company that offers a retirement savings plan
such as a 401(k), fund it at the highest level you can manage. If you earn self-
employment income, look into SEP-IRAs and Keoghs. (I discuss retirement-
plan options in Chapter 11.)
240
Part III: Building Wealth with Wise Investing 

If you need to save money outside retirement accounts for shorter-term goals
(for example, to buy a car or a home, or to start or buy a small business),
then by all means, save money outside retirement accounts. This chapter can
assist you with thinking through investing money in taxable accounts (non-
retirement accounts exposed to taxation).
Understanding Taxes
on Your Investments
When you invest money outside of a retirement account, investment distribu-
tions — such as interest, dividends, and capital gains — are subject to cur-
rent taxation. Too many folks (and too many of their financial advisors)
ignore the tax impact of their investment strategies. You need to pay atten-
tion to the tax implications of your investment decisions before you invest
your money.
Consider a person in a combined 40 percent tax bracket (federal plus state
taxes) who keeps extra cash in a taxable bond paying 5.0 percent interest. If
she pays 40 percent of her interest earnings in taxes, she ends up keeping
just 3.0 percent. With a similar but tax-free bond, she could easily earn more
than this amount, completely free of federal and/or state taxes.
Another mistake some people make is investing in securities that produce
tax-free income when they’re not in a high enough tax bracket to benefit. Now
consider a person in a combined 20 percent tax bracket who is investing in
securities that produce tax-free income. Suppose that he invests in a tax-free
investment that yields 4.5 percent. A comparable taxable investment is yield-
ing 7 percent. If he had instead invested in the taxable investment at a 7 per-
cent yield, the after-tax yield would have been 5.6 percent. Thus, he is losing
out on yield by being in the tax-free investment, even though he may feel
happy in it because the yield isn’t taxed.
To decide between comparable taxable and tax-free investments, you need to
know your marginal tax bracket (tax rate you pay on an extra dollar of taxable
income) and the rates of interest or yield on each investment. Here are some
general guidelines based upon your federal income tax bracket. (Check out
Table 7-1 in Chapter 7 to see what tax bracket you’re in.)
In the sections that follow, I give specific advice about investing your money
while keeping an eye on taxes.
241
Chapter 12: Investing in Taxable Accounts

Fortifying Your Emergency Reserves
In Chapter 4, I explain the importance of keeping sufficient money in an emer-
gency reserve account. From such an account, you need two things:
 Accessibility: When you need to get your hands on the money for an
emergency, you want to be able to do so quickly and without penalty.
 Highest possible return: You want to get the highest rate of return pos-
sible without risking your principal. This doesn’t mean that you should
simply pick the money market or savings option with the highest yield,
because other issues such as taxes are a consideration. What good is
earning a slightly higher yield if you pay a lot more in taxes?
The following sections give you info on investments that are suitable for
emergency reserves.
Bank and credit union accounts
When you have a few thousand dollars or less, your best and easiest path is
to keep this excess savings in a local bank or credit union. Look first to the
institution where you keep your checking account.
Keeping this stash of money in your checking account, rather than in a sepa-
rate savings account, makes financial sense if the extra money helps you
avoid monthly service charges when your balance occasionally dips below
the minimum. Compare the service charges on your checking account with
the interest earnings from a savings account.
For example, suppose that you’re keeping $2,000 in a savings account to earn
2 percent interest versus earning no interest on your checking account
money. Over the course of a year, you earn $40 interest on that savings
account. If you incur a $9 per month service charge on your checking
account, you pay $108 per year. So keeping your extra $2,000 in a checking
account may be better if it keeps you above a minimum balance and erases
that monthly service charge. (However, if you’re more likely to spend the
extra money in your checking account, keeping it in a separate savings
account where you won’t be tempted to spend it may be better.)
Money market mutual funds
Money market funds, a type of mutual fund (see Chapter 11), are just like bank
savings accounts — but better, in most cases. The best money market funds
pay higher yields than bank savings accounts and offer you check-writing
242
Part III: Building Wealth with Wise Investing 

privileges. And if you’re in a high tax bracket, you can select a tax-free money
market fund, which pays interest that’s free from federal and/or state tax — a
feature you can’t get with a bank savings account.
The yield on a money market fund is an important consideration. The operat-
ing expenses deducted before payment of dividends is the single biggest
determinant of yield. All other things being equal (which they usually are
with different money market funds), lower operating expenses translate into
higher yields for you. With interest rates as low as they are these days, seek-
ing out money funds with the lowest operating expenses is now more vital
than ever.
Doing most or all of your fund shopping (money-market and otherwise) at
one good fund company can reduce the clutter in your investing life. Chasing
after a slightly higher yield offered by another company is sometimes not
worth the extra paperwork and administrative hassle. On the other hand,
there’s no reason why you can’t invest in funds at multiple firms (as long as
you don’t mind the extra paperwork), using each for its relative strengths.
Most mutual fund companies don’t have many local branch offices, so you
may have to open and maintain your money market mutual fund through the
fund’s toll-free phone line, Web site, or the mail. Distance has its advantages.
Because you can conduct business by mail, the Internet, and the phone, you
don’t need to go schlepping into a local branch office to make deposits and
withdrawals. I’m happy to report that I haven’t visited a bank office in years.
Despite the distance between you and your mutual fund company, your
money is still accessible via check writing, and you can also have money
wired to your local bank on any business day. Don’t fret about a deposit
being lost in the mail; it rarely happens, and no one can legally cash a check
made payable to you, anyway. Just be sure to endorse the check with the
notation “for deposit only” under your signature.
(For that matter, driving or walking to your local bank isn’t 100 percent safe.
Imagine all the things that could happen to you or your money en route to the
bank. You could slip on a banana peel, drop your deposit down a sewer grate,
get mugged, walk into a bank holdup, get run over by a bakery truck. . . .)
Watch out for “sales”
Beware of money market mutual funds that have a “sale” by temporarily
waiving (sometimes called absorbing) operating expenses, which lets a fund
boost its yield. These sales never last long; the operating expenses come
back and deflate that too-good-to-be-true yield like a nail in a bike tire. Some
fund companies run sales because they know that a major portion of the fund
buyers who are lured in won’t bother leaving when they jack up operating
expenses.
243
Chapter 12: Investing in Taxable Accounts

You’re better off sticking with funds that maintain “everyday low operating
expenses” to get the highest long-term yield. I recommend such funds in the
next section. However, if you want to move your money to companies having
specials and then move it back out when the special is over, be my guest. If
you have lots of money and don’t mind paperwork, it may be worth the
bother.
Recommended money market mutual funds
In this section, I recommend good money market mutual funds. As you
peruse this list, remember that the money market fund that works best for
you depends on your tax situation. Throughout the list, I try to guide you to
funds that generally make sense for people in particular tax brackets.
 Money market funds that pay taxable dividends are appropriate when
you’re not in a high tax bracket. Some of my favorites include
• Fidelity Cash Reserves and Fidelity Money Market (800-544-8888;
www.fidelity.com)
• USAA Money Market (800-382-8722; www.usaa.com)
• Vanguard Prime Money Market (800-662-7447; www.vanguard.com)
 U.S. Treasury money market funds are appropriate if you prefer a money
fund that invests in U.S. Treasuries, which have the safety of government
backing, or if you’re in a high state tax bracket (5 percent or higher)
but not in a high federal tax bracket. Vanguard (800-662-7447; www.
vanguard.com) offers a couple good options:
• Vanguard Treasury Money Market
• Vanguard Admiral Treasury Money Market
 The following tax-free money market funds are appropriate when you’re
in a high federal and state tax bracket:
• Fidelity Arizona Municipal Money Market (800-544-8888; www.
fidelity.com)
• USAA California Money Market (800-382-8722; www.usaa.com)
• Vanguard California Tax-Exempt Money Market (800-662-7447;
www.vanguard.com)
• Fidelity Massachusetts AMT Tax-Free Money Market (800-544-8888;
www.fidelity.com)
• Vanguard New Jersey Tax-Exempt Money Market (800-662-7447;
www.vanguard.com)
• USAA New York Money Market (800-382-8722; www.usaa.com)
244
Part III: Building Wealth with Wise Investing 

• Vanguard New York Tax-Exempt Money Market (800-662-7447;
www.vanguard.com)
• Vanguard Ohio Tax-Exempt Money Market (800-662-7447; www.
vanguard.com)
• Vanguard Pennsylvania Tax-Exempt Money Market (800-662-7447;
www.vanguard.com)
• USAA Virginia Money Market (800-382-8722; www.usaa.com)
A number of states don’t offer the money market fund options listed in the
preceding list (and those that do may have minimums that are too high). In
some cases, no options exist. In other cases, the funds available (and not on
the recommended list) for that particular state have such high annual operat-
ing expenses, and therefore such low yields, that you’re better off in one of
the more competitively run federal-tax-free-only funds in the following list.
The following federal-tax-free-only money market funds (the dividends on
these are state taxable) are appropriate when you’re in a high federal but not
state bracket, or if you live in a state that doesn’t have competitive state- and
federal-tax-free funds available:
 Vanguard Tax-Exempt Money Market (800-662-7447; www.vanguard.com)
 Fidelity AMT Tax-Free Money Market (800-544-8888; www.fidelity.com)
 T. Rowe Price Summit Municipal Money Market (800-638-5660; www.
troweprice.com)
 USAA Tax-Exempt Money Market (800-382-8722; www.usaa.com)
Investing for the Longer Term 
(A Few Years or More)
Important note: This section (together with its recommended investments)
assumes that you have a sufficient emergency reserve stashed away and are
taking advantage of tax-deductible retirement account contributions. (Please
see Chapter 3 for more on these goals.)
Asset allocation refers to the process of figuring out what portion of your
wealth you should invest in different types of investments. You often (and
most appropriately) practice asset allocation with retirement accounts,
because this money is earmarked for the long-term. Ideally, more of your
245
Chapter 12: Investing in Taxable Accounts

saving and investing should be conducted through tax-sheltered retirement
accounts. These accounts generally offer the best way to lower your long-
term tax burden (see Chapter 11 for details).
If you plan to invest outside retirement accounts, asset allocation for these
accounts should depend on how comfortable you are with risk. But your
choice of investments should also be suited to how much time you have until
you plan to use the money. That’s not because you won’t be able to sell these
investments on short notice if necessary (most of them you can). Investing
money in a more volatile investment is simply riskier if you need to liquidate
it in the short term.
For example, suppose that you’re saving money for a down payment on a
house and are about one to two years away from having enough to make your
foray into the real estate market. If you had put this “home” money into the
U.S. stock market near the beginning of one of the stock market’s 20 to 50 per-
cent corrections (such as what happened in the early 2000s), you’d have been
mighty unhappy. You would have seen a substantial portion of your money
vanish in short order and would’ve seen your home dreams put on hold.
Defining your time horizons
The different investment options in the remainder of this chapter are organized
by time frame. All the recommended investment funds that follow assume that
you have at least a several-year time frame and are no-load (commission-free)
mutual funds. Mutual funds can be sold on any business day, usually with a
simple phone call. Funds come with all different levels of risk, so you can
choose funds that match your time frame and desire to take risk. (Chapter 10
discusses all the basics of mutual funds.)
The recommended investments are also organized by your tax situation. (If
you don’t know your current tax bracket, be sure to review Chapter 7.)
Following are summaries of the different time frames associated with each
type of fund:
 Short-term investments: These investments are suitable for a period of
a few years — perhaps you’re saving money for a home or some other
major purchase in the near future. When investing for the short-term,
look for liquidity and stability — features that rule out real estate and
stocks.
Recommended investments include shorter-term bond funds, which are
higher-yielding alternatives to money market funds. If interest rates
increase, these funds drop slightly in value — a couple percent or so
(unless rates rise tremendously). I also discuss Treasury bonds and cer-
tificates of deposit (CDs) later in this chapter.
246
Part III: Building Wealth with Wise Investing 

 Intermediate-term investments: These investments are appropriate for
more than a few years but less than ten years. Investments that fit the
bill are intermediate-term bonds and well-diversified hybrid funds
(which include some stocks as well as bonds).
 Long-term investments: If you have a decade or more for investing your
money, you can consider potentially higher-return (and therefore riskier)
investments. Stocks, real estate, and other growth-oriented investments
can earn the most money if you’re comfortable with the risk involved.
See Chapter 8 for information on investing the portion that you intend to
hold for the long term.
Bonds and bond funds
Bond funds that pay taxable dividends are generally appropriate when you’re
not in a high tax bracket. Here are some of my favorites:
 Short-term: Vanguard Short-Term Investment-Grade (800-662-7447; www.
vanguard.com)
 Intermediate-term: Dodge & Cox Income (800-621-3979; www.dodge
andcox.com); Harbor Bond (800-422-1050; www.harborfunds.com);
Vanguard Total Bond Market Index (800-662-7447; www.vanguard.com)
 Long-term: Vanguard Long-Term Investment-Grade (800-662-7447;
www.vanguard.com)
The following sections discuss other bond funds, as well as the individual
bonds you can buy through Treasury Direct.
U.S. Treasury bond funds
U.S. Treasury bond funds are appropriate if you prefer a bond fund that
invests in U.S. Treasuries (which have the safety of government backing), or
when you’re in a high state tax bracket (5 percent or higher) but not a high
federal tax bracket. For good Treasury bond funds, look no further than the
Vanguard Group, which offers short-, intermediate-, and long-term U.S.
Treasury funds with a low 0.24 percent operating expense ratio. With a
$100,000 minimum, Vanguard’s Admiral series of U.S. Treasury funds offers
even higher yields thanks to an even lower expense ratio of 0.12 percent.
Buying Treasuries from the Federal Reserve Bank
If you want an even cheaper method of investing in Treasury bonds than
you can get through the thrifty Vanguard Treasury funds, try this: Purchase
Treasuries directly from the Federal Reserve Bank. To open an account
through the Treasury Direct program, call 800-722-2678, or visit their Web
site at www.treasurydirect.gov.
247
Chapter 12: Investing in Taxable Accounts

The Federal Reserve Bank charges $25 annually for accounts with more than
$100,000 in Treasury bonds. Smaller accounts are free of any fees. The oper-
ating expenses of even the leanest mutual funds can’t compete with these
rates!
You do sacrifice a bit of liquidity, however, when purchasing Treasury bonds
directly from the government. You can sell your bonds, prior to maturity,
through the Treasury (for a $45 fee), but it takes some time and hassle. If you
want daily access to your money, buy a recommended Vanguard fund and
pay the company’s low management fee.
248
Part III: Building Wealth with Wise Investing 
Inflation-indexed Treasury bonds
Like a handful of other nations, the U.S. Treasury
now offers inflation-indexed government bonds.
Because a portion of these Treasury bonds’
return is pegged to the rate of inflation, the
bonds offer investors a safer type of Treasury
bond investment option.
To understand the relative advantages of an infla-
tion-indexed bond, take a brief look at the rela-
tionship between inflation and a normal bond.
When an investor purchases a normal bond, he’s
committing himself to a fixed yield over a set
period of time — for example, a bond that
matures in ten years and pays 6 percent interest.
However, changes in the cost of living (inflation)
are not fixed, so they’re difficult to predict.
Suppose that an investor put $10,000 into a reg-
ular bond in the 1970s. During the life of his
bond, he would’ve unhappily watched escalat-
ing inflation. During the time he held the bond,
and by the time his bond matured, he would’ve
witnessed the erosion of the purchasing power
of his $600 of annual interest and $10,000 of
returned principal.
Enter the inflation-indexed Treasury bond. Say
that you have $10,000 to invest and you buy a ten-
year, inflation-indexed bond that pays you a real
rate of return (this is the return above and
beyond the rate of inflation) of, say, 2 percent.
This portion of your return is paid out in interest.
The other portion of your return is from the infla-
tion adjustment to the principal you invested. The
inflation portion of the return gets put back into
principal. So if inflation were running at about 2
percent, as it has in recent years, your $10,000 of
principal would be indexed upwards after one
year to $10,200. In the second year of holding this
bond, the 2 percent real return of interest would
be paid on the increased ($10,200) principal base.
If inflation skyrocketed and was running at, say,
8 percent rather than 2 percent per year, your
principal balance would grow 8 percent per year,
and you’d still get your 2 percent real rate of
return on top of that. Thus, an inflation-indexed
Treasury bond investor would not see the pur-
chasing power of his invested principal or annual
interest earnings eroded by unexpected inflation.
The inflation-indexed Treasuries can be a good
investment for conservative, inflation-worried
bond investors, as well as taxpayers who want to
hold the government accountable for increases
in inflation. The downside: Inflation-indexed
bonds can yield slightly lower returns, because
they’re less risky compared to regular Treasury
bonds.

State- and federal-tax-free bond funds
State- and federal-tax-free bond funds are appropriate when you’re in high
federal and state (5 percent or higher) tax brackets. Vanguard (800-662-7447;
www.vanguard.com) has the best selection of state-specific tax-free
bond funds. USAA (800-382-8722; www.usaa.com) and, to a lesser extent,
Fidelity (800-544-8888; www.fidelity.com) — for higher balance ($10,000)
customers — offer some of the better state-specific bond funds.
Federal-tax-free-only bond funds
Federal-tax-free-only bond funds (the dividends on them are state-taxable) are
appropriate when you’re in a high federal bracket but a low state bracket
(less than 5 percent) or when you live in a state that doesn’t have state- and
federal-tax-free funds available. Vanguard (800-662-7447; www.vanguard.com)
offers the best selection of federal-tax-free bond funds.
Certificates of deposit (CDs)
For many decades, bank CDs have been a popular investment for folks with
some extra cash that isn’t needed in the near future. With a CD, you get a
higher rate of return than you get on a bank savings account. And unlike with
bond funds, your principal does not fluctuate in value.
Compared to bonds, however, CDs have a couple drawbacks:
 In a CD, your money is not accessible unless you cough up a fairly big
penalty — typically six months’ interest. With a no-load (commission-
free) bond fund, you can access your money without penalty — whether
you need some or all of your money next week, next month, or next year.
 CDs come in only one tax flavor — taxable. Bonds, on the other hand,
come in tax-free (federal and/or state) and taxable flavors. So if you’re a
higher-tax-bracket investor, bonds offer you a tax-friendly option that
CDs can’t.
In the long run, you should earn more — perhaps 1 to 2 percent more per
year — and have better access to your money in bond funds than in CDs.
Bond funds make particular sense when you’re in a higher tax bracket and
you’d benefit from tax-free income on your investments. If you’re not in a
high tax bracket and you have a bad day whenever your bond fund takes a
dip in value, consider CDs. Just make sure that you shop around to get the
best interest rate.
249
Chapter 12: Investing in Taxable Accounts

One final piece of advice: Don’t buy CDs simply for the FDIC (Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation) insurance. Much is made, particularly by bankers, of
the FDIC government insurance that comes with bank CDs. The lack of this
insurance on high-quality bonds shouldn’t be a big concern for you. High-
quality bonds rarely default; even if a fund were to hold a bond that
defaulted, that bond would probably represent only a tiny fraction (less than
1 percent) of the value of the fund, having little overall impact.
Besides, the FDIC itself is no Rock of Gibraltar. Banks have failed and will con-
tinue to fail. Yes, you are insured if you have less than $100,000 in a bank.
However, if the bank crashes, you may have to wait a long time and settle for
less interest than you thought you were getting. You’re not immune from
harm, FDIC or no FDIC.
If the government backing you receive through FDIC insurance allows you to
sleep better, you can invest in Treasuries (see “Bonds and bond funds,” ear-
lier in this chapter), which are government-backed bonds.
Stocks and stock funds
Stocks have stood the test of time for building wealth. (In Chapter 9, I discuss
picking individual stocks versus investing through stock mutual funds.)
Remember that when you invest in stocks in taxable (non-retirement)
accounts, all the distributions on those stocks, such as dividends and capital
gains, are taxable. Stock dividends and long-term capital gains do benefit
from lower tax rates (maximum of 15 percent).
Some stock picking advocates argue that you should shun stock funds due to
tax considerations. I disagree. You can easily avoid stock funds that generate a
lot of short-term capital gains, which are taxed at the relatively high ordinary
income tax rates. Additionally, increasing numbers of fund companies offer tax-
friendly stock funds, which are appropriate if you don’t want current income or
you’re in a high federal tax bracket and seek to minimize receiving taxable dis-
tributions on your funds. Vanguard (800-662-7447; www.vanguard.com) offers
the best menu of tax-managed stock funds. Alternatively, you can invest in a
wider variety of diversified stock funds inside an annuity (see the following
section). Also consider some of the stock funds I recommend in Chapter 11.
Annuities
As I discuss in Chapter 11, annuities are accounts that are partly insurance
but mostly investment. Consider contributing to an annuity only after you
exhaust contributions to all your available retirement accounts. Because
annuities carry higher annual operating expenses than comparable mutual
250
Part III: Building Wealth with Wise Investing 

funds, you should consider them only if you plan to leave your money
invested, preferably, for 15 years or more. Even if you leave your money
invested for that long, the tax-friendly funds discussed in the previous sec-
tions of this chapter can allow your money to grow without excessive annual
taxation.
The best annuities can be purchased from no-load (commission-free) mutual
fund companies — specifically Vanguard (800-662-7447; www.vanguard.com),
Fidelity (800-544-4702; www.fidelity.com), and T. Rowe Price (800-638-5660;
www.troweprice.com).
Real estate
Real estate can be a financially and psychologically rewarding investment. It
can also be a money pit and a real headache if you buy the wrong property or
get a “tenant from hell.” (I discuss the investment particulars of real estate in
Chapter 9 and the nuts and bolts of buying real estate in Chapter 14.)
Small-business investments
Investing in your own business or someone else’s established small business
can be a high-risk but potentially high-return investment. The best options
are those you understand well. See Chapter 9 for more information about
small-business investments.

Expenses
In This Chapter
 Understanding the financial aid system
 Looking at the right and wrong ways to save for college
 Figuring out how much you need to save
 Finding ways to pay for college when the time comes
 Exploring educational investment options
I
f you’re like most parents (or potential future parents), just turning to this
chapter makes you anxious. Such trepidation is understandable. According
to much of what you read about educational expenses (particularly college
expenses), if costs keep rising at the current rate, you’ll have to spend
upwards of a million dollars to give your youngster a quality (college and
graduate school) education.
Whether you’re about to begin a regular college investment plan or you’ve
already started saving, your emotions may lead you astray. The hype about
educational costs may scare you into taking a path that’s less financially bene-
ficial than others available. However, quality education for your child doesn’t
have to — and probably won’t — cost you as much as those gargantuan pro-
jections suggest. In this chapter, I explain the inner workings of the financial
aid system, help you gauge how much money you’ll need, and discuss educa-
tional investment options so that you can keep a cool head (and some money
in your pocket) when all is said and done.
Figuring Out How the Financial Aid
System Works
Just as your child shouldn’t choose a college based solely on whether she
thinks she can get in, she shouldn’t choose a college on the basis of whether

you think you can afford it. Except for the affluent, who have plenty of cash
available to pay for the full cost of college, everyone else should apply for
financial aid. More than a few parents who don’t think that they qualify for
financial aid are pleasantly surprised to find that their children have access
to loans as well as grants, which don’t have to be repaid. (And your ability to
pay often isn’t a consideration when scholarship committees hand out
money — see “Tips for getting loans, grants, and scholarships,” later in this
chapter, for info on scholarships.)
Completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), which is
available from any high school or college, is the first step in the financial aid
process. (Internet users can fill out the form online at www.fafsa.ed.gov.)
As its name implies, you pay nothing for submitting this application other
than the time to complete the paperwork. Some private colleges also require
that you complete the Financial Aid Form (FAF), which asks for more informa-
tion than the FAFSA. Some schools also supplement the FAFSA with PROFILE
forms; these forms are mainly used by costly private schools to differentiate
need among financial aid applicants.
States have their own financial aid programs, so apply to these programs as
well if your child plans to attend an in-state college. You and your child can
check with your local high school or college financial aid office to get the nec-
essary forms. Some colleges also require submission of supplementary forms
directly to them.
The data you supply through student aid forms is run through a financial
needs analysis, a standard methodology approved by the U.S. Congress. The
needs analysis considers a number of factors, such as your income and
assets, age and need for retirement income, number of dependents, number
of family members in college, and unusual financial circumstances, which you
explain on the application.
The financial needs analysis calculates how much money you, as the
parent(s), and your child, as the student, are expected to contribute toward
educational expenses. Even if the needs analysis determines that you don’t
qualify for needs-based financial aid, you may still have access to loans that
are not based on need if you go through the financial aid application process.
So make sure that you apply for financial aid!
Treatment of retirement accounts
Under the current financial needs analysis, the value of your retirement plans
is not considered an asset. By contrast, money that you save outside retire-
ment accounts, especially money in the child’s name, is counted as an asset
and reduces your eligibility for financial aid.
254
Part III: Building Wealth with Wise Investing 

Therefore, forgoing contributions to your retirement savings plans in order
to save money in a taxable account for Junior’s college fund doesn’t make
sense. When you do, you pay higher taxes both on your current income and
on the interest and growth of the college fund money. In addition to paying
higher taxes, you’re expected to contribute more to your child’s educational
expenses.
So while your children are years away from applying to college, make sure
that you fully fund your retirement accounts, such as 401(k)s, SEP-IRAs, and
Keoghs. In addition to getting an immediate tax deduction in the year you
contribute money, future growth on your earnings will grow without taxation
while you’re maximizing your child’s chances of qualifying for aid.
Let me stress the need to get an early start on saving. Most retirement
accounts limit how much you can contribute each year. See Chapter 11 for
more on saving for your golden years.
Treatment of money in the kids’ names
If you plan to apply for financial aid, save money in your name rather than
in your children’s names (such as via custodial accounts). Colleges expect a
much greater percentage of the money in your children’s names (35 percent)
to be used annually for college costs than the money in your name (about
6 percent).
However, if you’re affluent enough to foot your child’s college bill without
outside help, investing in your kid’s name can save you money in taxes.
Read on.
Traditional custodial accounts
Parents control a custodial account until the child reaches either the age of 18
or 21, depending upon the state in which you reside. Prior to your child’s
reaching age 14, the first $800 of interest and dividend income is tax free; the
next $800 is taxed at 10 percent. Any income above $1,600 is taxed at the par-
ents’ marginal tax rate. After age 14, all income generated by investments in
your child’s name is taxed at your child’s rate, presumably a lower tax rate.
Education Savings Accounts
The newer Education Savings Account (ESA) is another option that, like a
traditional custodial account, generally makes the most sense for affluent
parents who don’t expect to apply for or need any type of financial aid.
As with regular custodial accounts, parents who have their kids apply for
financial aid will be penalized by college financial aid offices for having ESA
balances.
255
Chapter 13: Investing for Educational Expenses

Subject to eligibility requirements, you can put up to $2,000 per child per
year into an ESA. Single taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes (AGIs) of
$110,000 or more and couples with AGIs of $220,000 or more may not con-
tribute to an ESA (although another individual, such as a grandparent, may
make the contribution to the child’s account). Although the contribution is
not tax-deductible, the future investment earnings compound without taxa-
tion. Upon withdrawal, the investment earnings are not taxed (unlike with
a traditional retirement account) as long as the money is used for qualified
education expenses and, in the year of withdrawal, the HOPE or Lifetime
Learning tax credit is not claimed for the student. See the latest edition of
Taxes For Dummies, which I co-wrote (Wiley Publishing), for more details.
Section 529, state-sponsored college savings plans
Section 529 plans (named after Internal Revenue Code Section 529 and also
known as qualified state tuition plans) are among the newest educational sav-
ings plans. A parent or grandparent can generally put more than $200,000 per
beneficiary into one of these plans. Up to $55,000 may be placed in a child’s
college savings account immediately, and this amount counts for the next five
years’ worth of $11,000 annual tax-free gifts allowed under current gifting laws.
(Money contributed to the account is not considered part of the donor’s tax-
able estate. However, if the donor gives $55,000 and then dies before five years
are up, a proportionate amount of that gift will be charged back to the donor’s
estate.)
The attraction of the Section 529 plans is that money inside the plans com-
pounds without tax, and if it’s used to pay for college tuition, room and
board, and other related higher education expenses, the investment earnings
and appreciation can be withdrawn tax-free. You can generally invest in any
state plan to pay college expenses in any state, regardless of where you live.
In addition to paying college costs, the money in Section 529 plans may also
be used for graduate school expenses. Some states provide additional tax
benefits on contributions to their state-sanctioned plan.
Unlike the money in a custodial account, with which a child may do as he
pleases when he reaches either the age of 18 or 21 (the age varies by state),
these state tuition plans must be used for higher education expenses. However,
most state plans do allow you to change the beneficiary. You can also take the
money back out of the plan if you change your mind. (You will, however, owe
tax on the withdrawn earnings plus a penalty — typically 10 percent.)
A big potential drawback of the Section 529 plans — especially for families
hoping for some financial aid — is that college financial aid offices may treat
assets in these plans as belonging to the child, which can greatly diminish
financial aid eligibility.
256
Part III: Building Wealth with Wise Investing 

Another potential drawback with some plans is that you can’t control how
the money is invested. Instead, the investment provider(s) may decide how
to invest the money. In most plans, the further your child is from college age,
the more aggressive the investment mix. As your child approaches college
age, the investment mix is tilted to more conservative investments. Some
state plans have high investment management fees, and some plans don’t
allow transfers to other plans.
Please also be aware that a future Congress could change the tax laws affect-
ing these plans, diminishing the tax breaks or increasing the penalties for
nonqualified withdrawals.
Clearly, these plans have both pros and cons. They generally make the most
sense for affluent parents (or grandparents) to establish for children who
don’t expect to qualify for financial aid. Do a lot of research and homework
before investing in any plan. Check out the investment track record, alloca-
tions, and fees in each plan, as well as restrictions on transferring to other
plans or changing beneficiaries.
Treatment of home equity and other assets
Your family’s assets may also include equity in real estate and businesses that
you own. Although the federal financial aid analysis no longer counts equity in
your primary residence as an asset, many private (independent) schools con-
tinue to ask parents for this information when making their own financial aid
determinations. Therefore, paying down your home mortgage more quickly
instead of funding retirement accounts can harm you financially: You may end
up with less financial aid and a higher tax bill.
Strategizing to Pay for Educational
Expenses
Now I get more specific about what college may cost your kids and how
you’re going to pay for it. I don’t have just one solution, because how you
help pay for your child’s college costs depends on your own unique situation.
However, in most cases, you may have to borrow some money, even if you
have some available cash that can be directed to pay the college bills as you
receive them.
257
Chapter 13: Investing for Educational Expenses

Estimating college costs
College can cost a lot. The total costs — including tuition, fees, books, sup-
plies, room, board, and transportation — vary substantially from school to
school. The total average annual cost is running around $34,000 per year
at private colleges and around $17,000 at public colleges and universities 
(in-state rate). The more expensive schools can cost up to one-third more.
Ouch!
Is all this expense worth it? Although many critics of higher education claim
that the cost of a college education shouldn’t be rising faster than inflation
and that costs can, and should, be contained, denying the value of going to
college is hard. Whether you’re considering a local community college, your
friendly state university, or a selective Ivy League institution, investing in
education is usually worth the effort and the cost.
An investment is an outlay of money for an expected profit. Unlike a car,
which depreciates in value, an investment in education yields monetary,
social, and intellectual profits. A car is more tangible in the short term, but an
investment in education (even if it means borrowing money) gives you more
bang for your buck in the long run.
Colleges are now finding themselves subject to the same types of competition
that companies confront. As a result, some colleges are clamping down on
rising costs. As with any other product or service purchase, it pays to shop
around. You can find good values — colleges that offer competitive pricing
and provide a quality education. Although you don’t want your son or daugh-
ter to choose a college simply because it costs the least, you also shouldn’t
allow a college choice without any consideration or recognition of cost.
Setting realistic savings goals
If you have money left over after taking advantage of retirement accounts, by
all means, try to save for your children’s college costs. You should save in
your name unless you know that you aren’t going to apply for financial aid,
including those loans that are available regardless of your economic situation.
Be realistic about what you can afford for college expenses given your other
financial goals, especially saving for retirement (see Chapter 4). Being able to
personally pay 100 percent of the cost of a college education, especially at a
four-year private college, is a luxury of the affluent. If you’re not a high-income
earner, consider trying to save enough to pay a third or, at most, half of the
cost. You can make up the balance through loans, your child’s employment
before and during college, and the like.

you’re saving will grow at the rate of college inflation. (In the happy event that your investment
return exceeds the rate of college inflation, you end up with a little more than you expected.)
** The average cost of a four-year private college education today is about $136,000; the average
cost of a four-year public college education is about $68,000. If your child has an expensive taste in
schools, you may want to tack 20 to 30 percent onto the average figures.
*** The amount you need to save (calculated in line 5) needs to be increased once per year to
reflect the increase in college inflation — 5 or 6 percent should do.
Tips for getting loans, grants, 
and scholarships
A host of financial aid programs, including a number of loan programs, allow
you to borrow at fair interest rates. Federal government educational loans
have variable interest rates — which means that the interest rate you’re
charged floats, or varies, with the overall level of interest rates. Most pro-
grams add a few percent to the current interest rates on three-month to one-
year Treasury bills. Thus, current rates on educational loans are in the
vicinity of rates charged on fixed-rate mortgages. The rates are also capped
so that the interest rate on your student loan can never exceed several per-
cent more than the initial rate on the loan.
259
Chapter 13: Investing for Educational Expenses

A number of loan programs, such as unsubsidized Stafford Loans and Parent
Loans for Undergraduate Students (PLUS), are available even when your
family is not deemed financially needy. Only subsidized Stafford Loans, on
which the federal government pays the interest that accumulates while the
student is still in school, are limited to students deemed financially needy.
Most loan programs limit the amount that you can borrow per year, as well as
the total you can borrow for a student’s educational career. If you need more
money than your limits allow, PLUS loans can fill the gap: Parents can borrow
the full amount needed after other financial aid is factored in. The only obsta-
cle is that you must go through a credit qualification process. Unlike pri-
vately funded college loans, you can’t qualify for a federal loan if you have
negative credit (recent bankruptcy, more than three debts over three months
past due, and so on). For more information from the federal government
about these student loan programs, call the Federal Student Aid Information
Center at 800-433-3243 or visit their Web site at studentaid.ed.gov.
If you’re a homeowner, you may be able to borrow against the equity (market
value less the outstanding mortgage loan) in your property. This option is
useful because you can borrow against your home at a reasonable interest
rate, and the interest is generally tax-deductible. Some company retirement
plans — for example, 401(k)s — allow borrowing as well.
Parents are allowed to make penalty-free withdrawals from individual retire-
ment accounts if the funds are used for college expenses. Although you won’t
be charged an early-withdrawal penalty, the IRS (and most states) will treat
the amount withdrawn as income, and your income taxes will increase
accordingly. On top of that, the financial aid office will look at your beefed-up
income and assume that you don’t need as much financial aid.
In addition to loans, a number of grant programs are available through
schools, the government, and independent sources. You can apply for federal
government grants via the FAFSA (see “Figuring Out How the Financial Aid
System Works,” earlier in this chapter). Grants available through state gov-
ernment programs may require a separate application. Specific colleges and
other private organizations (including employers, banks, credit unions, and
community groups) also offer grants and scholarships.
One of the most important aspects of getting financial aid is choosing to apply,
even if you’re not sure whether you qualify. You may be able to lower your
expected contribution by reducing your qualifying assets. (For more informa-
tion on how those in charge of handing out financial aid evaluate how much of
the bill you can foot, see “Figuring Out How the Financial Aid System Works.”)

Many scholarships and grants don’t require any extra work on your part —
simply apply for financial aid through colleges. Other aid programs need
seeking out — check directories and databases at your local library, your
child’s school counseling department, and college financial aid offices.
You can also contact local organizations, churches, employers, and so 
on. You have a better chance of getting scholarship money through these
avenues.
Your child can work and save money during high school and college. In 
fact, if your child qualifies for financial aid, he or she is expected to con-
tribute a certain amount to education costs from savings and employment
during the school year or summer breaks. Besides giving Junior a stake
in his own future, this training encourages sound personal financial
management.
Investing Educational Funds
Financial companies pour billions of dollars into advertising for investment
and insurance products that they claim are best for making your money
grow for your children. Don’t get sucked in by these ads.
What makes for good and bad investments in general applies to invest-
ments for educational expenses, too. Stick with basic, proven, lower-cost
investments. (Chapter 9 explains what you generally need to look for and
beware of.) The following sections focus on considerations specific to
college funding.
Good investments: No-load mutual funds
As I discuss in Chapter 10, the professional management and efficiency of the
best no-load mutual funds makes them a tough investment to beat. Chapters
11 and 12 provide recommendations for investing money in funds both inside
and outside tax-sheltered retirement accounts.
Gearing the investments to the time frame involved until your children will
need to use the money is the most important issue with no-load mutual
funds. The closer your child gets to attending college and using the money
saved, the more conservatively the money should be invested.
261
Chapter 13: Investing for Educational Expenses

Bad investments
Life insurance policies that have cash values are some of the most oversold
investments for funding college costs. Here’s the usual pitch: “Because you
need life insurance to protect your family, why not buy a policy that you can
borrow against to pay for college?”
The reason you shouldn’t invest in this type of policy to fund college costs is
that you’re better off contributing to retirement accounts that give you an
immediate tax deduction that saving through life insurance doesn’t offer.
Because life insurance that comes with a cash value is more expensive, par-
ents are more likely to make a second mistake — not buying enough cover-
age. If you need and want life insurance, you’re better off buying lower-cost
term life insurance (see Chapter 16).
Another poor investment for college expenses is one that fails to keep you
ahead of inflation, such as savings or money market accounts. You need
your money to grow so that you can afford educational costs down the road.
Prepaid tuition plans should generally be avoided. A few states have
developed plans that allow you to pay college costs at a specific school
(calculated for the age of your child). The allure of these plans is that by
paying today, you eliminate the worry of not being able to afford rising
costs in the future.
This logic doesn’t work for several reasons. First, odds are quite high that
you don’t have the money today to pay in advance. Second, putting money
into such plans reduces your eligibility for financial aid dollar for dollar. If
you have that kind of extra dough around, you’re better off using it for other
purposes (and you’re not likely to worry about rising costs anyway). You
can invest your own money — that’s what the school’s going to do with it,
anyway.
Besides, how do you know which college your child will want to attend
and how long it may take him or her to finish? Coercing your child into
the school you’ve already paid for is a sure ticket to long-term problems
in your relationship.
Overlooked investments
Too often, I see parents knocking themselves out to make more money so
that they can afford to buy a bigger home, purchase more expensive cars,
take better vacations, and send their kids to more expensive (and therefore
262
Part III: Building Wealth with Wise Investing 

supposedly better) private high schools and colleges. Sometimes families
want to send younger children to costly elementary schools, too. Families
stretch themselves with outrageous mortgages or complicated living arrange-
ments so that they can get into neighborhoods with top-rated public schools
or send their kids to expensive private elementary schools.
The best school in the world for your child is you and your home. The reason
many people I know (including my siblings and I) were able to attend some
of the top educational institutions in this country is that concerned parents
worked hard, not just at their jobs, but at spending time with the kids when
they were growing up. Rather than working to make more money (with the
best of intentions of buying educational games or trips, or sending the kids
to better schools), try focusing more attention on your kids. In my humble
opinion, you can do more for your kids by spending more time with them.
I see parents scratching their heads about their child’s lack of academic inter-
est and achievement — they blame the school, TV, video games, or society at
large. These factors may contribute to the problem, but education begins in
the home. Schools can’t do it alone.
Living within your means not only allows you to save more of your income
but also frees up more of your time for raising and educating your children.
Don’t underestimate the value of spending more time with your kids and
giving them your attention.

B
uying a home or investing in real estate can be financially and psycho-
logically rewarding. On the other hand, owning real estate can be a real
pain in the posterior, because purchasing and maintaining property can be
quite costly, time-consuming, and emotionally draining.
Perhaps you’re looking to escape your rented apartment and buy your first
home. Or maybe you’re interested in cornering the local real estate market
and making millions in investment property. In either case, you can learn
many lessons from real estate buyers who’ve traveled before you.
Note: Although this chapter focuses primarily on real estate in which you’re
going to live — otherwise known by those in the trade as owner-occupied
property — much of what this chapter covers is relevant to real estate
investors. (For additional information on buying investment real estate —
property that you rent out to others — see Chapter 9.)
Deciding Whether to Buy or Rent
You may be tired of moving from rental to rental. Perhaps your landlord
doesn’t adequately keep up the place, or you have to ask permission to

hang a picture on the wall. You may desire the financial security and rewards
that seem to come with home ownership. Or maybe you just want a place to
call your own.
Any one of these reasons is “good enough” to want to buy a home. But you
should take stock of your life and your financial health before you decide to
buy so you can decide whether you still want to buy a home and how much
you can really afford to spend. You need to ask yourself some bigger questions.
Assessing your timeline
From a financial standpoint, you really shouldn’t buy a place unless you can
anticipate being there for at least three years (preferably five or more).
Buying and selling a property entails a lot of expenses, including the cost of
getting a mortgage (points, application, and appraisal fees), inspection
expenses, moving costs, real estate agents’ commissions, and title insurance.
To cover these transaction costs plus the additional costs of ownership, a prop-
erty needs to appreciate about 15 percent.
If you need or want to move in a couple years, counting on 15 percent appre-
ciation is risky. If you’re fortunate and you happen to buy before a sharp
upturn in housing prices, you may get it. If you’re unlucky, you’ll probably
lose money on the deal.
Some people are willing to invest in real estate even when they don’t expect
to live in it for long and would consider turning their home into a rental.
Doing so can work well financially in the long haul, but don’t underestimate
the responsibilities that come with being a landlord. Also, most people need
to sell their first home in order to tap all the cash that they have in it so that
they can buy the next one.
Determining what you can afford
Although buying and owning your own home can be a wise financial move in
the long run, it’s a major purchase that can send shock waves through the
rest of your personal finances. You’ll probably have to take out a 15- to 30-
year mortgage to finance your purchase. The home you buy will need mainte-
nance over the years. Owning a home is a bit like running a marathon: Just as
you should be in good physical shape to successfully run a marathon, you
should be in good financial health when you buy a home.
266
Part III: Building Wealth with Wise Investing 

I have seen too many people fall in love with a home and make a rash deci-
sion without taking a hard look at the financial ramifications. Take stock of
your overall financial health (especially where you stand in terms of retire-
ment planning), before you buy property or agree to a particular mortgage.
Don’t let the financial burdens of a home control your financial future.
Don’t trust a lender when he tells you what you can “afford” according to
some formulas the bank uses to figure out what kind of a credit risk you are.
To determine how much a potential home buyer can borrow, lenders look
primarily at annual income; they pay no attention to some major aspects of a
borrower’s overall financial situation. Even if you don’t have money tucked
away into retirement savings, or you have several children to clothe, feed,
and help put through college, you still qualify for the same size loan as other
people with the same income (assuming equal outstanding debts). Only you
can figure out how much you can afford, because only you know what your
other financial goals are and how important they are to you.
Here are some important financial questions that no lender will ask or care
about but that you should ask yourself before buying a home:
 Are you saving enough money monthly to reach your retirement goals?
 How much do you spend (and want to continue spending) on fun things
such as travel and entertainment?
 How willing are you to budget your expenses in order to meet your
monthly mortgage payments and other housing expenses?
 How much of your children’s expected college educational expenses do
you want to be able to pay for?
The other chapters in this book can help you answer these important ques-
tions. Chapter 4 in particular will help you think through saving for important
financial goals.
Many homeowners run into financial trouble because they don’t know their
spending needs and priorities or how to budget for them. Some of these
owners have trouble curtailing their spending despite the large amount of
debt they just incurred; in fact, some spend even more for all sorts of furni-
ture and remodeling. Many people prop up spending habits with credit. For
this reason, a surprisingly large percentage — some studies say about half —
of people who borrow additional money against their home equity use the
funds to pay consumer debts.
267
Chapter 14: Investing in Real Estate: Your Home and Beyond

Calculating how much you can borrow
Mortgage lenders want to know your ability to repay the money you borrow.
So you have to pass a few tests that calculate the maximum amount the
lender is willing to lend you. For a home in which you’ll reside, lenders total
up your monthly housing expenses. They define your housing costs as
mortgage payment + property taxes + insurance
Lenders typically loan you up to about 35 percent of your monthly gross
(before taxes) income for the housing expense. (If you’re self-employed, take
your net income from the bottom line of your federal tax form Schedule C and
divide by 12 to get your monthly gross income.)
Lenders also consider your other debts when deciding how much to lend
you. These other debts diminish the funds available to pay your housing
expenses. Lenders add the amount you need to pay down your other con-
sumer debts (auto loans, credit cards) to your monthly housing expense. The
monthly total costs of these debt payments plus your housing costs typically
cannot exceed 40 percent.
One general rule says that you can borrow up to three times (or two and one-
half times) your annual income when buying a home. But this rule is a really
rough estimate. The maximum that a mortgage lender will loan you depends
on interest rates. If rates fall (as they have during much of the past decade),
the monthly payment on a mortgage of a given size also drops. Thus, lower
interest rates make real estate more affordable.
Table 14-1 gives you a ballpark idea of the maximum amount you may be eligi-
ble to borrow. Multiply your gross annual income by the number in the
second column to determine the approximate maximum you may be able to
borrow. For example, if you’re getting a mortgage with a rate around 7 per-
cent and your annual income is $50,000, multiply 3.5 by $50,000 to get
$175,000 — the approximate maximum mortgage allowed.
Comparing the costs of owning 
versus renting
The cost of owning a home is an important financial consideration for many
renters. Some people assume that owning costs more. In fact, owning a home
doesn’t have to cost a truckload of money; it may even cost less than renting.

*If you’re self-employed, this is your net income (after expenses but before taxes).
On the surface, buying a place seems a lot more expensive than renting.
You’re probably comparing your monthly rent (measured in hundreds of dol-
lars to more than $1,000, depending on where you live) to the purchase price
of a property, which is usually a much larger number — perhaps $150,000 to
$500,000 or more. When you consider a home purchase, you’re forced to
think about your housing expenses in one huge chunk rather than in small
monthly installments (like a rent check).
Tallying up the costs of owning a place can be a useful and not-too-complicated
exercise. To make a fair comparison between ownership and rental costs, you
need to figure what it will cost on a monthly basis to buy a place you desire
versus what it will cost to rent a comparable place. The worksheet in Table 14-2
enables you to do such a comparison. Note: In the interest of reducing the
number of variables, all this “figuring” assumes a fixed-rate mortgage, not an
adjustable-rate mortgage. (For more info on mortgages, see “Financing Your
Home,” later in this chapter.)
Also, I ignore what economists call the opportunity cost of owning. In other
words, when you buy, the money you put into your home can’t be invested
elsewhere, and the foregone investment return on that money, say some
economists, should be considered a cost of owning a home. I choose to
ignore this concept for two reasons. First, and most importantly, I don’t agree
with this line of thinking. When you buy a home, you’re investing your money
in real estate, which historically has offered solid long-term returns (see
Chapter 8). And secondly, I have you ignore opportunity cost because it
greatly complicates the analysis.

Now compare line 8 in Table 14-2 with the monthly rent on a comparable
place to see which costs more — owning or renting.
Mortgage
To determine the monthly payment on your mortgage, simply multiply the
relevant number (or multiplier) from Table 14-3 by the size of your mortgage
expressed in thousands of dollars (divided by 1,000). For example, if you’re
taking out a $100,000, 30-year mortgage at 6.5 percent, you multiply 100 by
6.32 for a $632 monthly payment.
Property taxes
You can ask a real estate person, mortgage lender, or your local assessor’s
office what your annual property tax bill would be for a house of similar
value to the one you’re considering buying (the average is 1.5 percent of
your property’s value). Divide this amount by 12 to arrive at your monthly
property tax bill.
Tax savings in home ownership
Generally speaking, mortgage interest and property tax payments for your
home are tax-deductible on Schedule A of IRS Form 1040 (see Chapter 7).
Here’s a shortcut that works quite well in determining your tax savings in
home ownership: Multiply your federal tax rate (see Table 7-1 in Chapter 7)
by the total amount of your property taxes and mortgage payment. Technically
speaking, not all of your mortgage payment is tax-deductible — only the
portion of the mortgage payment that goes toward interest. In the early years

of your mortgage, nearly all of your payment goes toward interest. On the
other hand, your property taxes will probably rise over time. You may earn
state tax benefits from your deductible mortgage interest and property taxes,
as well.
If you want to more accurately determine how home ownership may affect
your tax situation, get out your tax return and try plugging in some reason-
able numbers to estimate how your taxes will change. You can also speak
with a tax advisor or pick up a copy of the latest edition of Taxes For
Dummies, which I co-authored (Wiley Publishing).
Considering the long-term costs of renting
When you crunch the numbers to find out what owning rather than renting a
comparable place may cost you on a monthly basis, you may discover that
owning isn’t as expensive as you thought. Or you may find that owning costs
more than renting. This discovery may tempt you to think that, financially
speaking, renting is cheaper than owning.
271
Chapter 14: Investing in Real Estate: Your Home and Beyond

Be careful not to jump to conclusions. Remember that you’re looking at the
cost of owning versus renting today. What about 5, 10, 20, or 30 years from
now? As an owner, your biggest monthly expense — the mortgage payment —
does not increase (assuming that you buy your home with a fixed-rate mort-
gage). Your property taxes, homeowner’s insurance, and maintenance
expenses — which are generally far less than your mortgage payment —
increase with the cost of living.
When you rent, however, your entire monthly rent is subject to the vagaries
of inflation. Living in a rent-controlled unit, where the annual increase
allowed in your rent is capped, is the exception to this rule. Rent control
does not eliminate price hikes; it just limits them.
Suppose that you’re comparing the costs of owning a home that costs
$240,000 to renting that same home for $1,200 a month. Table 14-4 compares
the cost per month of owning the home (after factoring in tax benefits) to
your rental costs over 30 years. This comparison assumes that you take out a
mortgage loan equal to 80 percent of the cost of the property at a fixed rate
of 7 percent and that the rate of inflation of your homeowner’s insurance,
property taxes, maintenance, and rent is 4 percent per year. I further assume
that you’re in a moderate combined 35 percent federal and state tax bracket.

As you can see in Table 14-4, in the first few years, owning a home costs a
little more than renting it. In the long run, however, owning is less expensive,
because more of your rental expenses increase with inflation. And don’t forget
that you’re building equity in your property as a homeowner; that equity will
be quite substantial by the time that you have your mortgage paid off.
You may be thinking that if inflation doesn’t rise 4 percent per year, renting
could end up being cheaper. This is not necessarily so. Suppose that inflation
didn’t exist. Your rent wouldn’t escalate, but home ownership expenses
wouldn’t either. And with no inflation, you could probably refinance your
mortgage at a rate lower than 7 percent. If you do the math, owning would
still cost less in the long run with lower inflation, but the advantage of owning
is less than during periods of higher inflation. Also, in case you’re wondering
272
Part III: Building Wealth with Wise Investing 

what happens in this analysis if you’re in a different tax bracket, owning would
still cost less in the long run — the cost savings widen a bit for people in higher
tax brackets and lessen a bit for those in lower tax brackets.
Recognizing advantages to renting
Although owning a home and investing in real estate generally pay off hand-
somely over the long-term, to be fair and balanced, I must say that renting
has its advantages. Some of the financially successful renters I’ve seen
include people who pay low rent, either because they made housing sacri-
fices or they live in a rent-controlled building. If you’re consistently able to
save 10 percent or more of your earnings, you’re probably well on your way
to achieving your future financial goals.
As a renter, you can avoid worrying about or being responsible for fixing up
the property — that’s your landlord’s responsibility. You also have more
financial and psychological flexibility as a renter. If you want to move, you
can generally do so a lot easier as a renter than you can as a homeowner.
Having a lot of your money tied up in your home is another challenge that you
don’t face when renting over the long haul. Some people enter their retirement
years with a substantial portion of their wealth in their homes. As a renter,
you can have all your money in financial assets that you can tap into more
easily. Homeowners who have a major chunk of equity tied up in a home at
retirement can downsize to a less costly property to free up cash and/or take
out a reverse mortgage (discussed later in this chapter) on their home equity.
Financing Your Home
After you look at your financial health, figure out your timeline, and compare
renting costs to owning costs, you need to confront the tough task of obtain-
ing a hunk of debt to buy a home (unless you’re independently wealthy). A
mortgage loan from a bank or other source makes up the difference between
the cash you intend to put into the purchase and the agreed-upon selling
price of the real estate.
Understanding the two major types
of mortgages
Like many other financial products, you have zillions of mortgages to choose
from. The differences can be important or trivial, expensive or not. Two
major types of mortgages exist — those with a fixed interest rate and those
with a variable or adjustable rate.
273
Chapter 14: Investing in Real Estate: Your Home and Beyond

Fixed-rate mortgages, which are usually issued for a 15- or 30-year period,
have interest rates that never, ever change. The interest rate you pay the
first month is the same rate you pay the last month (and every month in
between). Because the interest rate stays the same, your monthly mortgage
payment amount doesn’t change. With a fixed-rate mortgage, you have no
uncertainty or interest rate worries.
Fixed-rate loans are not risk-free, however. If interest rates fall significantly
after you obtain your mortgage, you face the danger of being stuck with your
higher-cost mortgage if you’re unable to refinance (see “Refinancing your
mortgage,” later in this chapter). You can be turned down for a refinance
because of deterioration in your financial situation or a decline in the value
of your property. Even if you’re eligible to refinance, you may have to spend
significant time and money to complete the process.
In contrast to a fixed-rate mortgage, an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) car-
ries an interest rate that varies over time. With an adjustable-rate mortgage,
you can start with one interest rate and then have different rates for every
year (or possibly every month) during a 30-year mortgage. Thus, the size of
your monthly payment fluctuates. Because a mortgage payment makes an
unusually large dent in most homeowners’ checkbooks anyway, signing up
for an ARM without understanding its risks is dangerous.
The attraction of ARMs is the potential interest savings. For the first few
years of an adjustable loan, the interest rate is typically lower than it is on a
comparable fixed-rate loan. After that, the cost depends on the overall trends
in interest rates. When interest rates drop, stay level, or rise just a little, you
probably continue to pay less for your adjustable. On the other hand, when
rates rise more than a percent or two and then stay elevated, the adjustable
can cost you more than a fixed-rate loan.
Choosing between fixed- and 
adjustable-rate mortgages
You should weigh the pros and cons of each mortgage type and decide what’s
best for your situation before you go out to purchase a piece of real estate or
refinance a loan. In the real world, most people ignore this advice. The excite-
ment of purchasing a home tends to cloud one’s judgment. My experience
has been that few people look at their entire financial picture before making
major real estate decisions. You may end up with a mortgage that could
someday seriously overshadow the delight you have for your little English
herb garden out back.
Consider the issues I discuss in this section before you decide which kind of
mortgage — fixed or adjustable — is right for you.
274
Part III: Building Wealth with Wise Investing 

How willing and able are you to take on financial risk?
Take stock of how much risk you can take with the size of your monthly mort-
gage payment. You can’t afford much risk, for example, if your job and income
are unstable and you need to borrow a lot. I define a lot as “close to the maxi-
mum a bank is willing to lend you.” A lot can also mean that you have no slack
in your monthly budget — in other words, you’re not regularly saving money. If
you’re in this situation, stick with a fixed-rate loan.
Don’t take an adjustable simply because the initially lower interest rates allow
you to afford the property you want to buy (unless you’re absolutely certain
that your income will rise to meet future payment increases). Try setting your
sights on a property that you can afford — with a fixed-rate mortgage.
If interest rates rise, a mushrooming adjustable mortgage payment may test
the lower limits of your checking account balance. When you don’t have
emergency savings you can tap to make the higher payments, how can you
afford the monthly payments — much less all the other expenses of home
ownership?
And don’t forget to factor in reasonably predictable future expenses that may
affect your ability to make payments. For example, are you planning to start a
family soon? If so, your income may fall while your expenses rise (as they
surely will).
If you can’t afford the highest allowed payment on an adjustable-rate mort-
gage, don’t take it. You shouldn’t accept the chance that the interest rate may
not rise that high — it might, and then you could lose your home! Ask your
lender to calculate the highest possible maximum monthly payment on your
loan. That’s the payment you’d face if the interest rate on your loan were to
go to the highest level allowed (the lifetime cap).
You need to also consider your stress level. If you have to start following
interest rate movements, it’s probably not worth gambling on rates. Life is
too short!
On the other hand, maybe you’re in a position to take the financial risks that
come with an adjustable-rate mortgage. An adjustable places much of the risk
of fluctuating rates on you (most adjustables, however, limit, or cap, the rise
in the interest rate allowed on your loan). In return for your accepting some
interest-rate risk, lenders cut you a deal — an adjustable’s interest rate starts
lower and stays lower if the overall level of interest rates doesn’t rise sub-
stantially. Even if rates go up, they’ll probably come back down over the life
of your loan. So if you can stick with your adjustable for better and for worse,
you may still come out ahead over the long term. Typical caps are 2 percent
per year and 6 percent over the life of the loan.
275
Chapter 14: Investing in Real Estate: Your Home and Beyond

You may feel financially secure in choosing an adjustable loan if you have a
hefty financial cushion accessible in the event that rates go up, you take out a
smaller loan than you’re qualified for, or you’re saving more than 10 percent
of your income.
How long do you plan to keep the mortgage?
A mortgage lender takes extra risk when committing to a constant interest
rate for 15 to 30 years. Lenders don’t know what may happen in the interven-
ing years, so they charge you a premium for their risk.
The savings on most adjustables is usually guaranteed in the first two or
three years, because an adjustable-rate mortgage starts at a lower interest
rate than a fixed one. If rates rise, you can end up giving back or losing the
savings you achieve in the early years of the mortgage. In most cases, if you
aren’t going to keep your mortgage more than five to seven years, you’re
probably paying unnecessary interest costs to carry a fixed-rate mortgage.
Another mortgage option is a hybrid loan, which combines features of both
the fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgages. For example, the initial rate may
hold constant for a number of years — three to five years is common — and
then adjust once a year or every six months thereafter. These hybrid loans
may make sense for you if you foresee a high probability of keeping your loan
seven to ten years or less but want some stability in your monthly payments.
The longer the initial rate stays locked in, the higher the rate.
Shopping for fixed-rate mortgages
Of the two major types of mortgages I discuss earlier in this chapter, fixed-
rate loans are generally easier to shop for and compare. The following sec-
tions cover what you need to know when shopping for fixed-rate mortgages.
Trading off interest rates and points
The interest rate is the annual amount a lender charges you for borrowing its
money. The interest rate on a fixed-rate loan must always be quoted with the
points on the loan.
Points are upfront fees paid to your lender when you close on your loan.
Points are actually percentages: One point is equal to 1 percent of the loan
amount. So when a lender tells you that 1.5 points are on a quoted loan, you
pay 1.5 percent of the amount you borrow as points. On a $100,000 loan, for
example, 1.5 points cost you $1,500.
If one lender offers 30-year mortgages at 6.75 percent and another lender
offers them at 7 percent, the 7 percent loan isn’t necessarily worse. You also
need to consider how many points each lender charges.
276
Part III: Building Wealth with Wise Investing 

The interest rate and points on a fixed-rate loan go together and move in
opposite directions. If you’re willing to pay more points on a given loan, the
lender will often reduce the interest rate. Paying more in upfront points can
save you a lot of money in interest, because the interest rate on your loan
determines your payments over a long, long time — 15 to 30 years. If you pay
fewer points, your interest rate increases. Paying less in points may appeal to
you if you don’t have much cash for closing on your loan.
Suppose Lender X quotes you 6.75 percent on a 30-year fixed-rate loan and
charges one point (1 percent). Lender Y, who quotes 7 percent, doesn’t
charge any points. Which is better? The answer depends mostly on how long
you plan to keep the loan.
The 6.75-percent loan is 0.25 percent less than the 7 percent loan. Year in and
year out, the 6.75 percent loan saves you 0.25 percent. But because you have
to pay 1 percent (one point) upfront on the 6.75 percent loan, it takes about
four years to earn back the savings to cover the cost of that point. So if you
expect to keep the loan less than four years, go with the 7 percent option.
To perform an apples-to-apples comparison of mortgages from different
lenders, get interest rate quotes at the same point level for each mortgage.
For example, ask each lender for the interest rate on a loan for which you pay
one point.
Be wary of lenders who advertise no-point loans as though they’re offering
something for nothing. Remember, if a loan has no points, it’s guaranteed to
have a higher interest rate. That’s not to say that the loan is better or worse
than comparable loans from other lenders. But don’t get sucked in by a no-
points sales pitch. Most lenders who spend big bucks advertising these types
of loans rarely have the best deals.
Understanding other lender fees
In addition to charging you points and the ongoing interest rate, lenders tack
on all sorts of other upfront fees when processing your loan. You need to know
the total of all lender fees so that you can compare different mortgages and
determine how much completing your home purchase is going to cost you.
Lenders can nickel and dime you with a number of fees other than points.
Actually, you pay more than nickels and dimes — $300 here and $50 there
adds up in a hurry! Here are the main culprits:
 Application and processing fees: Most lenders charge several hundred
dollars to complete your paperwork and process it through their under-
writing (loan evaluation) department. The justification for this fee is that
if your loan is rejected or you decide not to take it, the lender needs to
cover the costs. Some lenders return this fee to you upon closing if you
go with their loan (after you’re approved).
277
Chapter 14: Investing in Real Estate: Your Home and Beyond

 Credit report: Many lenders charge a modest fee (about $50) for obtain-
ing a copy of your credit report. This report tells the lender whether
you’ve been naughty or nice to other lenders in the past. If you have
problems on your credit report, clean them up before you apply (see
“Increasing your approval chances,” later in this chapter; also check out
Chapter 2 for info on checking your credit report).
 Appraisal: The property for which you’re borrowing money needs to be
valued. If you default on your mortgage, your lender doesn’t want to get
stuck with a property worth less than you owe. For most residential
properties, the appraisal cost is typically several hundred dollars.
 Title and escrow charges: These not-so-inconsequential costs are dis-
cussed in the section, “Remembering title insurance and escrow fees,”
later in this chapter.
Get a written itemization of charges from all lenders you are seriously consid-
ering so that you can more readily compare different lenders’ mortgages and
so you have no surprises when you close on your loan. And to minimize your
chances of throwing money away on a loan for which you may not qualify,
ask the lender whether you may not be approved for some reason. Be sure to
disclose any problems you’re aware of that are on your credit report or with
the property.
Some lenders offer loans without points or other lender charges. Note:
Lenders aren’t charities. If they don’t charge points or other fees, they have
to make up the difference by charging a higher interest rate on your loan.
Consider such loans only if you lack cash for closing or if you’re planning to
use the loan for just a few years.
Shunning balloon loans
Be wary of balloon loans. They look like fixed-rate loans, but they really
aren’t. With a balloon loan, the large remaining loan balance becomes fully
due at a predetermined time — typically within three to ten years. Balloon
loans are dangerous because you may not be able to refinance into a new
loan to pay off the balloon loan when it comes due. What if you lose your job
or your income drops? What if the value of your property drops and the
appraisal comes in too low to qualify you for a new loan? What if interest
rates rise and you can’t qualify for the higher rate on a new loan? Taking a
balloon loan is a high-risk maneuver that can backfire.
Don’t take a balloon loan unless the following three conditions are true:
 You really, really want a certain property.
 The balloon loan is your only financing option.
 You’re positive that you’re going to be able to refinance when the bal-
loon loan comes due.
278
Part III: Building Wealth with Wise Investing 

If you take a balloon loan, get one that takes as much time as possible before
it comes due.
Inspecting adjustable-rate
mortgages (ARMs)
Although sorting through myriad fixed-rate mortgage options is enough to
give most people a headache, comparing the bells and whistles of ARMs can
give you a mortgage migraine. Caps, indexes, margins, and adjustment peri-
ods — you can spend weeks figuring it all out. If you’re clueless about per-
sonal finances — or just think that you are — shopping for adjustables scores
a 9.9 degree of difficulty on the financial frustration scale.
Unfortunately, you have to wade through a number of details to understand
and compare one adjustable to another. Bear with me. And remember
throughout this discussion that calculating exactly which ARM is going to
cost you the least is impossible, because the cost depends on so many vari-
ables. Selecting an ARM has a lot in common with selecting a home: You have
to make trade-offs and compromises based on what’s important to you.
Understanding the start rate
Just as the name implies, the start rate is the interest rate your ARM starts
with. Don’t judge a loan by this rate. You won’t be paying this attractively low
rate for long. The interest rate will rise as soon as the terms of the mortgage
allow.
Start rates are probably one of the least important items to focus on when
comparing adjustables. (You’d never know this from the way some lenders
advertise adjustables — you see ads with the start rate in 3-inch bold type
and everything else in microscopic footnotes!)
279
Chapter 14: Investing in Real Estate: Your Home and Beyond
Beware of prepayment penalties
Avoid loans with prepayment penalties. You pay
this charge, usually 2 to 3 percent of the loan
amount, when you pay off your loan before
you’re supposed to.
Prepayment penalties don’t typically apply
when you pay off a loan because you sell the
property. But if you refinance such a loan in
order to take advantage of lower interest rates,
you almost always get hit by the prepayment
penalties if the loan calls for such penalties.
The only way to know whether a loan has a pre-
payment penalty is to ask. If the answer is yes,
find yourself another mortgage.

The formula (which includes index and margin) and rate caps are far more
important for determining what a mortgage will cost you in the long run.
Some people have labeled the start rate a teaser rate, because the initial rate
on your loan is set artificially low to entice you. In other words, even if the
market level of interest rates doesn’t change, your adjustable is destined to
increase — 1 to 2 percent is not uncommon.
Determining the future interest rate
You’d never (I hope) agree to a loan if your lender’s whim and fancy deter-
mined your future interest rate. You need to know exactly how a lender fig-
ures out how much your interest rate is going to increase. All adjustables are
based on the following formula, which specifies how the future interest rate
on your loan is set:
index + margin = interest rate
Indexes are often (but not always) widely quoted in the financial press, and
the specific one used on a given adjustable loan is chosen by the lender.
The six-month Treasury bill rate is an example of an index that’s used on
some mortgages.
The margin is the amount added to the index to determine the interest rate
you pay on your mortgage. Most loans have margins of around 2.5 percent.
So, for example, the interest rate of a mortgage could be driven by the follow-
ing formula:
six-month Treasury bill rate + 2.5 percent = interest rate
In this situation, if six-month Treasuries are yielding 4.5 percent, the interest
rate on your loan should be 7.0 percent. This figure is known as the fully
indexed rate. If this loan starts at 5.0 percent and the rate on six-month
Treasuries stays the same, your loan should eventually increase to 7.0 percent.
The margin on a loan is hugely important. When you’re comparing two loans
that are tied to the same index and are otherwise equivalent, the loan with
the lower margin is better. The margin determines the interest rate for every
year you hold the mortgage.
Indexes differ mainly in how rapidly they respond to changes in interest
rates. Following are the more common indexes:
 Treasury bills (T-bills): These indexes are based on government IOUs
(Treasury bills), and there are a whole lot of them out there. Most
adjustables are tied to the interest rate on 6-month or 12-month T-bills.
280
Part III: Building Wealth with Wise Investing 

 Certificates of deposit (CDs): Certificates of deposit are interest-bearing
bank investments that lock you in for a specific period of time. ARMs are
usually tied to the average interest rate banks are paying on six-month
CDs. Like T-bills, CDs tend to respond quickly to changes in the market
level of interest rates. Unlike T-bills, CD rates tend to move up a bit more
slowly when rates rise and come down faster when rates decline.
 11th District Cost of Funds: This index tends to be among the slower-
moving indexes. ARMs tied to 11th District Cost of Funds tend to start
out at a higher interest rate. A slower-moving index has the advantage
of moving up less quickly when rates are on the rise. On the other hand,
you need to be patient to realize the benefit of falling interest rates.
281
Chapter 14: Investing in Real Estate: Your Home and Beyond
Avoid negative amortization and interest-only
loans if you’re stretching
As you make mortgage payments over time,
the loan balance you still owe is gradually
reduced — this process is known as amortiz-
ing the loan. The reverse of this process —
increasing your loan balance — is called neg-
ative amortization.
Negative amortization is allowed by some
ARMs. Your outstanding loan balance can grow
even though you’re continuing to make mort-
gage payments when your mortgage payment
is less than it really should be.
Some loans cap the increase of your monthly
payment but not of the interest rate. The size of
your mortgage payment may not reflect all the
interest you owe on your loan. So rather than
paying off the interest and some of your loan
balance (or principal) every month, you’re
paying off some but not all of the interest you
owe. Thus, the extra unpaid interest you still
owe is added to your outstanding debt.
Taking on negative amortization is like paying
only the minimum payment required on a credit
card bill. You keep racking up greater interest
charges on the balance as long as you make
only the artificially low payment. Doing so
defeats the whole purpose of borrowing an
amount that fits your overall financial goals. And
you may never get your mortgage paid off!
Another type of potentially concerning loan, the
interest-only mortgage, is being promoted heav-
ily in higher cost housing markets that stretch
buyers’ budgets. In the early years of an interest-
only loan, the monthly payment is kept lower
because only interest is being paid; no payment
is going to reduce the loan balance. What many
folks don’t realize is that at a set number of years
into the mortgage (for instance, three, five, or
seven), principal payments kick in as well, which
dramatically increases the monthly payment.
Avoid negative-amortization mortgages. The
only way to know for certain whether a loan
includes negative amortization is to ask. Some
lenders aren’t forthcoming about telling you.
You’ll find it more frequently on loans that
lenders consider risky. If you’re having trouble
finding lenders who are willing to deal with your
financial situation, be especially careful.
Tread carefully with interest-only mortgages. Do
not consider interest-only loans if you’re
stretching to be able to afford a home, and con-
sider one only if you understand how they work
and can afford the inevitable jump in payments.

Adjustment period or frequency
Every so many months, the mortgage-rate formula is applied to recalculate
the interest rate on an adjustable-rate loan. Some loans adjust monthly.
Others adjust every 6 or 12 months.
In advance of each rate change, the lender should send you a notice telling
you what your new rate is. All things being equal, the less frequently your loan
adjusts, the less financial uncertainty you have in your life. Less-frequent
adjustments usually coincide with a loan starting at a higher interest rate.
Understanding rate caps
When the initial interest rate expires, the interest rate fluctuates based on
the formula of the loan. Almost all adjustables come with rate caps. The
adjustment cap limits the maximum rate change (up or down) allowed at
each adjustment. On most loans that adjust every six months, the adjust-
ment cap is 1 percent.
Loans that adjust more than once per year often limit the maximum rate
change allowed over the entire year as well. On most such loans, the annual
rate cap is 2 percent.
Almost all adjustables come with lifetime caps, which limit the highest rate
allowed over the entire life of the loan. ARMs often have lifetime caps that are
5 to 6 percent higher than the start rate (though higher lifetime caps are
increasingly common during the current low-interest-rate period). Before
taking an adjustable, figure out the maximum possible payment at the lifetime
cap to be sure that you can handle it.
Other ARM fees
Just as with fixed-rate mortgages, ARMs can carry all sorts of additional
lender-levied charges. See the section “Understanding other lender fees,”
earlier in this chapter, for details.
Avoiding the down-payment blues
You can generally qualify for the most favorable mortgage terms by making a
down payment of at least 20 percent of the purchase price of the property. In
addition to saving money on interest, you can avoid the added cost of private
mortgage insurance (PMI) by putting down this much. (To protect against
losing money in the event you default on your loan, lenders usually require
PMI, which costs several hundred dollars per year on a typical mortgage.)
282
Part III: Building Wealth with Wise Investing 

Many people don’t have the equivalent of 20 percent or more of the purchase
price of a home so that they can avoid paying private mortgage insurance.
Here are a number of solutions for coming up with that 20 percent faster or
buying with less money down:
 Go on a spending diet. One sure way to come up with a down payment
is to raise your savings rate by slashing your spending. Take a tour
through Chapter 6 to find strategies for cutting back on your spending.
 Consider lower-priced properties. Some first-time home buyers have
expectations that are too grand. Smaller properties and ones that need
some work can help keep down the purchase price and, therefore, the
required down payment.
 Find partners. You can often get more home for your money when you
buy a building in partnership with one, two, or a few people. Make sure
you write up a legal contract to specify what’s going to happen if a part-
ner wants out, divorces, or passes away.
 Seek reduced down-payment financing. Some lenders will offer you a
mortgage even though you may be able to put down only 3 to 10 percent
of the purchase price. You must have solid credit to qualify for such
loans, and you generally have to obtain and pay for the extra expense of
private mortgage insurance (PMI), which protects the lender if you
default on the loan. When the property value rises enough or you pay
down the mortgage enough to have 20 percent equity in the property,
you can drop the PMI.
Some property owners or developers may be willing to finance your pur-
chase with 10 percent or less down. You can’t be as picky about proper-
ties, because not as many are available under these terms — many need
work or haven’t been sold yet for other reasons.
 Get assistance from family. If your parents, grandparents, or other rela-
tives have money dozing away in a savings or CD account, they may be
willing to lend (or even give) you the down payment. You can pay them
an interest rate higher than the rate they’re currently earning but lower
than what you’d pay to borrow from a bank — a win/win situation for
both of you. Lenders generally ask whether any portion of the down pay-
ment is borrowed and will reduce the maximum amount they’re willing
to loan you accordingly.

Buying For Dummies (Wiley Publishing), which I co-authored with real estate
guru Ray Brown.

Chapter 14: Investing in Real Estate: Your Home and Beyond

Comparing 15-year and 
30-year mortgages
Many people don’t have a choice between 15- and 30-year mortgages. To afford
the monthly payments on their desired home, they need to spread the loan
payments over a longer period of time, and a 30-year mortgage is the only
answer. A 15-year mortgage has higher monthly payments because you pay it
off faster. With fixed-rate mortgages hovering around 6 percent, a 15-year mort-
gage comes with payments that are about 35 to 40 percent higher than those
for a 30-year mortgage.
Even if you can afford these higher payments, taking the 15-year option isn’t
necessarily better. The money for making extra payments doesn’t come out
of thin air. You may have better uses (which I discuss later in this section) for
your excess funds.
And if you opt for a 30-year mortgage, you maintain the flexibility to pay it off
faster (except in those rare cases where you have to pay a prepayment
penalty). By making additional payments on a 30-year mortgage, you can
create your own 15-year mortgage. But if the need arises, you can fall back to
making only the payments required on your 30-year schedule.
Locking yourself into higher monthly payments with a 15-year mortgage
comes with a risk. If money gets too tight in the future, you can fall behind in
your mortgage payments. You may be able to refinance your way out of the
predicament, but you can’t count on it. If your finances worsen or your prop-
erty declines in value, you may have trouble qualifying for a refinance.
Suppose that you qualify for a 15-year mortgage and you’re financially com-
fortable with the higher payments; the appeal of paying off your mortgage 15
years sooner is enticing. Besides, the interest rate is lower — generally up to
1⁄2 percent lower — on a 15-year mortgage. So if you can afford the higher pay-
ments on the 15-year mortgage, you’d be silly not to take it, right? Not so fast.
You’re really asking whether you should pay off your mortgage slowly or
more quickly. And the answer isn’t simple — it depends.
If you have the time and inclination (and a good financial calculator), you can
calculate how much interest you can save or avoid through a faster payback.
I have a friendly word of advice about spending hours crunching numbers:
don’t. You can make this decision by considering some qualitative issues.
First, think about alternative uses for the extra money you’d be throwing into
paying down the mortgage. What’s best for you depends on your overall
financial situation and what else you can do with the money. If you would end
up blowing the extra money at the racetrack or on an expensive car, pay
down the mortgage. That’s a no-brainer.
284
Part III: Building Wealth with Wise Investing 

But suppose that you take the extra $100 or $200 per month that you were
planning to add to your mortgage payment and contribute it to a retirement
account instead. This step may make financial sense. Why? Because contribu-
tions to 401(k)s, SEP-IRAs, Keoghs, and other types of retirement accounts
(discussed in Chapter 11) are tax-deductible.
When you add an extra $200 to your mortgage payment to pay off your mort-
gage faster, you receive no tax benefits. When you dump that $200 into a
retirement account, you get to subtract that $200 from the income on which
you pay taxes. If you’re paying 35 percent in federal and state income taxes,
you shave $70 (that’s $200 multiplied by 35 percent) off your tax bill.
In most cases, you get to deduct your mortgage interest on your tax return.
So if you’re paying 6 percent interest, your mortgage may really cost you only
around 4 percent after you factor in the tax benefits. If you think you can do
better (remember to consider the taxes on investment returns) by investing
elsewhere (stocks, investment real estate, and so on), go for it. Investments
such as stocks and real estate have generated better returns over the long
haul. These investments carry risk, though, and they’re not guaranteed to
produce any return.
If you’re uncomfortable investing and you’d otherwise leave the extra money
sitting in a money market fund or savings account, you’re better off paying
down the mortgage. When you pay down the mortgage, you invest your
money in a sure thing with a modest return.
If you have pre-college-age kids, you have an even better reason to fund
retirement accounts before you consider paying down your mortgage quickly.
Retirement account balances are generally not counted as an asset when
determining financial aid for college expenses. By contrast, many schools still
count equity in your home (the difference between its market value and your
loan balance) as an asset. Your reward for paying down your mortgage bal-
ance may be less financial aid! (See Chapter 13 for more details about financ-
ing educational expenses.)
Paying down your mortgage faster, especially when you have children, is
rarely a good financial decision if you haven’t exhausted contributions to
your retirement accounts. Save in your retirement accounts first and get the
tax benefits.
Finding the best lender
As with other financial purchases, you can save a lot of money by shopping
around. It doesn’t matter whether you shop around on your own or hire
someone to help you. Just do it!
285
Chapter 14: Investing in Real Estate: Your Home and Beyond

On a 30-year, $180,000 mortgage, for example, getting a mortgage that costs
0.5 percent less per year saves you about $20,000 in interest over the life of
the loan (given current interest rate levels). That’s enough to buy a decent
car! On second thought, save it!
Shopping for a lender on your own
In most areas, you can find many mortgage lenders. Although having a large
number of lenders to choose from is good for competition, it also makes
shopping a chore.
Large banks whose names you recognize from their advertising usually don’t
offer the best rates. Make sure that you check out some of the smaller lend-
ing institutions in your area. Also, check out mortgage bankers, who, unlike
banks, only do mortgages. The better mortgage bankers offer some of the
most competitive rates.
Real estate agents can also refer you to lenders with whom they’ve previously
done business. These lenders may not necessarily offer the most competitive
rates — the agent simply may have done business with them in the past.
You can also look in the real estate section of one of the larger Sunday news-
papers in your area for charts of selected lender interest rates. These tables
are by no means comprehensive or reflective of the best rates available. In
fact, many of them are sent to newspapers for free by firms that distribute
mortgage information to mortgage brokers. Use the tables as a starting point
by calling the lenders who list the best rates.
HSH Associates (800-873-2837; www.hsh.com) publishes mortgage informa-
tion for each of the 50 states. For $23, the company will send you a list of
dozens of lenders’ rate quotes. You need to be a real data junkie to wade
through these multipage reports full of numbers and abbreviations, though.
Hiring a mortgage broker
Insurance agents peddle insurance, real estate agents sell real estate, and
mortgage brokers deal in mortgages. They buy mortgages at wholesale from
lenders and then mark them up to retail before selling them to you. The mort-
gage brokers get their income from the difference, or spread. The terms of the
loan obtained through a broker are generally the same as the terms you
obtain from the lender directly.
Mortgage brokers get paid a percentage of the loan amount — typically 0.5 to
1 percent. This commission is negotiable, especially on larger loans that are
more lucrative. Ask a mortgage broker what his cut is. Many people don’t ask
for this information, so some brokers may act taken aback when you inquire.
Remember, it’s your money!
286
Part III: Building Wealth with Wise Investing 

The chief advantage of using a mortgage broker is that the broker can shop
among lenders to get you a good deal. If you’re too busy or disinterested to
shop around for a good deal on a mortgage, a competent mortgage broker
can probably save you money. A broker can also help you through the
tedious process of filling out all those horrible documents lenders demand
before giving you a loan. And if you have credit problems or an unusual prop-
erty, a broker may be able to match you up with a hard-to-find lender who’s
willing to offer you a mortgage.
When evaluating a mortgage broker, be on guard for those who are lazy and
don’t continually shop the market looking for the best mortgage lenders.
Some brokers place their business with the same lenders all the time, and
those lenders don’t necessarily offer the best rates. Also watch out for sales-
people who earn big commissions pushing certain loan programs that aren’t
in your best interests. These brokers aren’t interested in taking the time to
understand your needs and discuss your options. Thoroughly check a
broker’s references before doing business.
Even if you plan to shop on your own, talking to a mortgage broker may still
be worthwhile. At the very least, you can compare what you find with what
brokers say they can get for you. Just be careful. Some brokers tell you what
you want to hear and then aren’t able to deliver when the time comes.
When a loan broker quotes you a really good deal, ask who the lender is. (Most
brokers refuse to reveal this information until you pay the few hundred dollars
to cover the appraisal and credit report.) You can check with the actual lender
to verify the interest rate and points the broker quotes you and make sure that
you’re eligible for the loan.
Increasing your approval chances
A lender can take several weeks to complete your property appraisal and an
evaluation of your loan package. When you’re under contract to buy a prop-
erty, having your loan denied after waiting several weeks can mean that you
lose the property as well as the money you spent applying for the loan and
having the property inspected. Some property sellers may be willing to give
you an extension, but others won’t.
Here’s how to increase your chances of having your mortgage approved:
 Get your finances in shape before you shop. You won’t have a good
handle on what you can afford to spend on a home until you whip your
personal finances into shape. Do so before you begin to make offers on
properties. This book can help you. If you have consumer debt, elimi-
nate it — the more credit card, auto loan, and other consumer debt you
287
Chapter 14: Investing in Real Estate: Your Home and Beyond

rack up, the less mortgage you qualify for. In addition to the high inter-
est rate and the fact that it encourages you to live beyond your means,
you now have a third reason to get rid of consumer debt. Hang onto the
dream of owning a home, and plug away at paying off consumer debts.
 Clear up credit report problems. If you think you may have errors
on your credit report, get a copy before you apply for a mortgage.
Chapter 2 provides contact information for the major credit bureaus
and explains how to obtain a free copy of your credit report, as well as
correct any mistakes or clear up blemishes.
 Get preapproved or prequalified. When you get prequalified, a lender
speaks with you about your financial situation and then calculates the
maximum amount they’re willing to lend you based on what you tell
them. Preapproval is much more in-depth and includes a lender’s review
of your financial statements. Just be sure not to waste your time and
money getting preapproved if you’re not really ready to get serious
about buying.
 Be upfront about problems. Late payments, missed payments, or debts
that you never bothered to pay can come back to haunt you. The best
defense against loan rejection is to avoid it in the first place. You can
sometimes head off potential rejection by disclosing to your lender any-
thing that may cause a problem before you apply for the loan. That way,
you have more time to correct problems and find alternate solutions.
Mortgage brokers (see the preceding section) can also help you shop
for lenders who are willing to offer you a loan despite credit problems.
 Work around low/unstable income. When you’ve been changing jobs or
you’re self-employed, your recent economic history may be as unstable
as a country undergoing a regime change. Making a larger down pay-
ment is one way around this problem. If you put down 25 percent or
more, you may be able to get a no-income verification loan. You may
try getting a co-signer, such as a relative or good friend. As long as
they aren’t borrowed up to their eyeballs, they can help you qualify
for a larger loan than you can get on your own. Be sure that all parties
understand the terms of the agreement, including who’s responsible for
monthly payments!
 Consider a backup loan. You certainly should shop among different
lenders, and you may want to apply to more than one for a mortgage.
Although applying for a second loan means additional fees and work, it
can increase your chances of getting a mortgage if you’re attempting
to buy a difficult-to-finance property or if your financial situation
makes some lenders leery. Be sure to disclose to each lender what
you’re doing — the second lender to pull your credit report will see
that another lender has already done so.

Finding the Right Property
Shopping for a home can be fun. You get to peek inside other people’s cup-
boards and closets. But for most people, finding the right house at the right
price can take a lot of time. When you’re buying with partners or a spouse (or
children, if you choose to share the decision-making with them), finding the
right place can also entail a lot of compromise. A good agent (or several who
specialize in different areas) can help with the legwork. The following sections
cover the main things you need to consider when shopping for a home to call
your own.
Condo, town house, co-op,
or detached home?
Some people’s image of a home is a single-family dwelling — a stand-alone
house with a lawn and white picket fence. In some areas, however —
particularly in higher-cost neighborhoods — you find condominiums (you
own the unit and a share of everything else), town homes (attached or row
houses), and cooperatives (you own a share of the entire building).
The allure of such higher-density housing is that it’s generally less expensive.
In some cases, you don’t have to worry about some of the general mainte-
nance, because the owner’s association (which you pay for, directly or indi-
rectly) takes care of it.
If you don’t have the time, energy, or desire to keep up a property, shared hous-
ing may make sense for you. You generally get more living space for your dollar
and it may also provide you with more security than a stand-alone home.
As investments, however, single-family homes generally do better in the long
run. Shared housing is easier to build and hence easier to overbuild; on the
other hand, single-family houses are harder to put up because more land is
required. But most people, when they can afford it, still prefer a stand-alone
home.
With that being said, you should remember that a rising tide raises all boats.
In a good real estate market, all types of housing appreciate, although single-
family homes tend to do better. Shared housing values tend to increase the
most in densely populated urban areas with little available land for new
building.
289
Chapter 14: Investing in Real Estate: Your Home and Beyond

From an investment return perspective, if you can afford a smaller single-
family home instead of a larger shared-housing unit, buy the single-family
home. Be especially wary of buying shared housing in suburban areas with
lots of developable land.
Casting a broad net
You may have an idea about the type of property and location you’re inter-
ested in or think you can afford before you start your search. You may think,
for example, that you can afford only a condominium in the neighborhood
you’re interested in. But if you take the time to check out other communities,
you may be surprised to find one that meets most of your needs and also has
affordable single-family homes. You’d never know about this community if
you narrowed your search too quickly.
Even if you’ve lived in an area for a while and you think you know it well, look
at different types of properties in a number of communities before you narrow
your search. Be open-minded, and figure out which of your many criteria for a
home you really care about.
Finding out actual sale prices
Don’t look at just a few of the homes listed at a particular price and then get
depressed because they’re all dogs or you can’t afford what you really want.
Before you decide to renew your apartment lease, remember that properties
often sell for less than the price at which they’re listed.
Find out what the places you look at eventually sell for. Doing so gives you a
better sense of what you can really afford as well as what places are really
worth. Ask the agent or owner who sold the property what the sale price
was, or contact the town’s assessors’ office for information on how to obtain
property sale price information.
Researching the area
Even (and especially) if you fall in love with a house at first sight, go back to
the neighborhood at various times of the day and on different days of the
week. Travel to and from your prospective new home during commute hours
to see how long your commute will really take. Knock on a few doors and
meet your potential neighbors. You may discover, for example, that a flock
of chickens lives in the backyard next door or that the street and basement
frequently flood.

What are the schools like? Go visit them. Don’t rely on statistics about test
scores. Talk to parents and teachers. What’s really going on at the school?
Even if you don’t have kids, the quality of the local school has direct bearing
on the value of your property. Is crime a problem? Call the local police
department. Will future development be allowed? If so, what type? Talk to the
planning department. What are your property taxes going to be? Is the prop-
erty located in an area susceptible to major risks, such as floods, mudslides,
fires, or earthquakes? Consider these issues even if they’re not important to
you, because they can affect the resale value of your property. Make sure that
you know what you’re getting yourself into before you buy.
Working with Real Estate Agents
When you buy (or sell) a home, you’ll probably work with a real estate agent.
Real estate agents earn their living on commission. As such, their incentives
can be at odds with what’s best for you.
Real estate agents usually don’t hide the fact that they get a cut of the deal.
Property buyers and sellers generally understand the real estate commission
system. I credit the real estate profession for calling its practitioners “agents”
instead of coming up with some silly obfuscating title such as “housing
consultants.”
A top-notch real estate agent can be a significant help when you purchase or
sell a property. On the other hand, a mediocre, incompetent, or greedy agent
can be a real liability. The following sections help you sort the good from
the bad.
Recognizing conflicts of interest
Real estate agents, because they work on commission, face numerous con-
flicts of interest. Some agents may not even recognize the conflicts in what
they’re doing. The following list presents the most common conflicts of inter-
est that you need to watch out for:
 Because agents work on commission, it costs them when they spend time
with you and you don’t buy or sell. They want you to complete a deal,
and they want that deal as soon as possible — otherwise, they don’t get
paid. Don’t expect an agent to give you objective advice about what you
should do given your overall financial situation. Examine your overall
financial situation before you decide to begin working with an agent.
 Because real estate agents get a percentage of the sales price of a prop-
erty, they have a built-in incentive to encourage you to spend more.
Adjustable-rate mortgages (see “Financing Your Home,” earlier in this
291
Chapter 14: Investing in Real Estate: Your Home and Beyond

chapter) allow you to spend more, because the interest rate starts at a
lower level than that of a fixed-rate mortgage. Thus, real estate agents
are far more likely to encourage you to take an adjustable. But adjusta-
bles are a lot riskier — you need to understand these drawbacks before
signing up for one.
 Agents often receive a higher commission when they sell listings that
belong to other agents in their office. Beware. Sometimes the same
agent represents both the property seller and the property buyer in the
transaction — a real problem. Agents who are holding open houses for
sale may try to sell to an unrepresented buyer they meet at the open
house. There’s no way one person can represent the best interests of
both sides.
 Because agents work on commission and get paid a percentage of the
sales price of the property, many are not interested in working with you
if you can’t or simply don’t want to spend a lot. Some agents may reluc-
tantly take you on as a customer and then give you little attention and
time. Before you hire an agent, check references to make sure that he
works well with buyers like you.
 Real estate agents typically work a specific territory. As a result, they usu-
ally can’t objectively tell you the pros and cons of the surrounding region.
Most won’t admit that you may be better able to meet your needs by look-
ing in another area where they don’t normally work. Before you settle on
an agent (or an area), spend time figuring out the pros and cons of differ-
ent territories on your own. If you want to seriously look in more than one
area, find agents who specialize in each area.
 If you don’t get approved for a mortgage loan, your entire real estate deal
may unravel. So some agents may refer you to a more expensive lender
who has the virtue of high approval rates. Be sure to shop around — you
can probably get a loan more cheaply. Be especially wary of agents who
refer you to mortgage lenders and mortgage brokers who pay agents
referral fees. Such payments clearly bias a real estate agent’s “advice.”
 Home inspectors are supposed to be objective third parties who are
hired by prospective buyers to evaluate the condition of a property.
Some agents may encourage you to use a particular inspector with a
reputation of being “easy” — meaning he may not “find” all the house’s
defects. Remember, it’s in the agent’s best interest to seal the deal, and
the discovery of problems may sidetrack those efforts.
 Some agents, under pressure to get a house listed for sale, agree to be
accomplices and avoid disclosing known defects or problems with the
property. In most cover-up cases, it seems, the seller doesn’t explicitly
ask an agent to help cover up a problem; the agent just looks the other
way or avoids telling the whole truth. Never buy a home without having
a home inspector look it over from top to bottom.

Looking for the right qualities
in real estate agents
When you hire a real estate agent, you want to find someone who’s compe-
tent and with whom you can get along. Working with an agent costs a lot of
money — so make sure that you get your money’s worth.
Interview several agents. Check references. Ask agents for the names and
phone numbers of at least three clients they worked with in the past six
months (in the geographical area in which you’re looking). You should look
for the following traits in any agent you work with:
 Full-time employment: Some agents work in real estate as a second or
even third job. Information in this field changes constantly. The best
agents work at it full-time so that they can stay on top of the market.
 Experience: Hiring someone with experience doesn’t necessarily mean
looking for an agent who’s been kicking around for decades. Many of the
best agents come into the field from other occupations, such as business
or teaching. Some sales, marketing, negotiation, and communication skills
can certainly be picked up in other fields, but experience in buying and
selling real estate does count.
 Honesty and integrity: You trust your agent with a lot. If your agent
doesn’t level with you about what a neighborhood or particular prop-
erty is really like, you suffer the consequences.
 Interpersonal skills: An agent has to be able to get along not only with
you but also with a whole host of other people who are typically involved
in a real estate deal: other agents, property sellers, inspectors, mortgage
293
Chapter 14: Investing in Real Estate: Your Home and Beyond
Buyer’s agents/brokers
An increasing number of agents are marketing
themselves as buyer’s agents/brokers. Suppos-
edly, these folks represent your interests as a
property buyer exclusively.
Legally speaking, buyer’s agents may sign a
contract saying that they represent your — and
only your — interests. Before this enlightened
era, all agents contractually worked for the
property seller.
The title “buyer’s agent” is one of those things
that sounds better than it really is. Agents who
represent you as buyer’s brokers still get paid
only when you buy. And they still get a commis-
sion as a percentage of the purchase price. So
they still have an incentive to sell you a piece of
real estate; and the more expensive it is, the
more commission they make.

lenders, and so on. An agent doesn’t have to be Mr. or Ms. Congeniality,
but he or she should be able to put your interests first without upsetting
others.
 Negotiation skills: Putting a real estate deal together involves negotia-
tion. Is your agent going to exhaust all avenues to get you the best deal
possible? Be sure to ask the agent’s references how well the agent nego-
tiated for them.
 High quality standards: Sloppy work can lead to big legal or logistical
problems down the road. If an agent neglects to recommend thorough
and complete inspections, for example, you may be stuck with undiscov-
ered problems after the deal is done.
Agents sometimes market themselves as top producers, which means that
they sell a relatively large volume of real estate. This title doesn’t count for
much for you, the buyer. It may be a red flag for an agent who focuses on
completing as many deals as possible. When you’re buying a home, you need
an agent who has the following additional traits:
 Patience: When you’re buying a home, the last thing you want is an agent
who tries to push you into making a deal. You need an agent who’s patient
and willing to allow you the necessary time it takes to get educated and
make the best decision for yourself.
 Local market and community knowledge: When you’re looking to buy a
home in an area in which you’re not currently living, an informed agent
can have a big impact on your decision.
 Financing knowledge: As a buyer (especially a first-time buyer or some-
one with credit problems), you should look for an agent who knows which
lenders can best handle your type of situation.
Buying real estate requires somewhat different skills than selling real estate.
Few agents can do both equally well. No law or rule says that you must use
the same agent when you sell a property as you do when you buy a property.
Putting Your Deal Together
After you do your homework on your personal finances, discover how to
choose a mortgage, and research neighborhoods and home prices, you’ll
hopefully be ready to close in on your goal. Eventually you’ll find a home you
want to buy. Before you make that first offer, though, you need to understand
the importance of negotiations, inspections, and the other elements of a real
estate deal.
294
Part III: Building Wealth with Wise Investing 

Negotiating 101
When you work with an agent, the agent usually handles the negotiation
process. But you need to have a plan and strategy in mind; otherwise, you
may end up overpaying for your home. Here are some recommendations for
getting a good deal:
 Never fall in love with a property. If you have money to burn and can’t
imagine life without the home you just discovered, pay what you will.
Otherwise, remind yourself that other good properties are out there.
Having a backup property in mind can help.
 Find out about the property and owner before you make your offer.
How long has the property been on the market? What are its flaws?
Why is the owner selling? For example, if the seller is moving because she
got a job in another town and is about to close on a home purchase, she
may be willing to reduce the price to get her money out of the home. The
more you understand about the property and the seller’s motivations,
the better able you’ll be to draft an offer that meets both parties’ needs.
 Get comparable sales data to support your price. Too often, home
buyers and their agents pick a number out of the air when making an
offer. But if the offer has no substance behind it, the seller will hardly be
persuaded to lower his asking price. Pointing to recent and comparable
home sales to justify your offer price strengthens your case.
 Remember that price is only one of several negotiable items.
Sometimes sellers get fixated on selling their homes for a certain
amount. Perhaps they want to get at least what they paid for it years
ago. You may be able to get a seller to pay for certain repairs or
improvements, to pay some of your closing costs, or to offer you an
attractive loan without the extra loan fees that a bank would charge.
Likewise, the real estate agent’s commission is negotiable.
295
Chapter 14: Investing in Real Estate: Your Home and Beyond
Games agents play to get a deal done
The thirst for commission brings out the worst
in some real estate agents. They tell you fibs to
motivate you to buy on the seller’s terms. Saying
that other offers are coming in on the property
you’re interested in is one common fib. Or they
say that the seller already turned down an offer
for X dollars because he’s holding out for a
higher offer.
The car dealer trick — blaming the office
manager for not allowing them to reduce their
commission — is another tactic. Be sure to
spend the time needed to find a good agent and
to understand an agent’s potential conflicts of
interest (see the section on agents earlier in the
chapter).

Inspecting before you buy
When you buy a home, you may be making one of the biggest (if not the
biggest) purchases of your life. Unless you build homes and do contracting
work, you probably have no idea what you’re getting yourself into when it
comes to furnaces and termites.
Spend the time and money to locate and hire good inspectors and other
experts to evaluate the major systems and potential problem areas of the
home. Areas that you want to check include
 Overall condition of the property
 Electrical, heating, and plumbing systems
 Foundation
 Roof
 Pest control and dry rot
 Seismic/slide/flood risk
Inspection fees often pay for themselves. When problems that you weren’t
aware of are uncovered, the inspection reports give you the information you
need to go back and ask the property seller to fix the problems or reduce the
purchase price of the property to compensate you for correcting the deficien-
cies yourself.
As with other professionals whose services you retain, you need to make
sure that you interview at least a few inspection companies. Ask which sys-
tems they inspect and how detailed a report they’re going to prepare for you
(ask for a sample copy). Ask them for names and phone numbers of three
people who used their service within the past six months.
Never accept a seller’s inspection report as your only source of information.
When a seller hires an inspector, he may hire someone who won’t be as dili-
gent and critical of the property. What if the inspector is a buddy of the seller
or his agent? By all means, review the seller’s inspection reports if available,
but get your own as well.
And here’s one more inspection for you to do: The day before you close on
the purchase, do a brief walk-through of the property. Make sure that every-
thing is still in good order and that all the fixtures, appliances, curtains, and
other items that were to be left per the contract are still there. Sometimes
sellers (and their movers) “forget” what they’re supposed to leave or try to
test your powers of observation.
296
Part III: Building Wealth with Wise Investing 

Remembering title insurance
and escrow fees
Mortgage lenders require title insurance to protect against someone else
claiming legal title to your property. This claim can happen, for example,
when a husband and wife split up and the one who remains in the home
decides to sell and take off with the money. If both spouses are listed as
owners on the title, the spouse who sells the property (possibly by forging
the other’s signature) has no legal right to do so.
Both you and the lender can get stuck holding the bag if you buy the home
that the one spouse of this divided couple is selling. But title insurance acts
as the salvation for you and your lender. Title insurance protects you against
the risk that the spouse whose name was forged will come back and reclaim
rights to the home after it’s sold.
If you’re in the enviable position of paying cash for a property, you should
still buy title insurance, even though a mortgage lender won’t prod you to do
so. You need to protect your investment.
Escrow charges pay for neutral third-party services to ensure that the instruc-
tions of the purchase contract or refinance are fulfilled and that everyone
gets paid.
Many people don’t seem to understand that title insurance and escrow fees
vary from company to company. As a result, they don’t bother to comparison
shop; they simply use the company that their real estate agent or mortgage
lender suggests.
When you call around for title insurance and escrow fee quotes, make sure
that you understand all the fees. Many companies tack on all sorts of charges
for things such as courier fees and express mail. If you find a company with
lower prices and want to use it, ask for an itemization in writing so that you
don’t have any surprises.
Real estate agents and mortgage lenders can be a good starting point for
referrals because they usually have a broader perspective on the cost and
service quality of different companies. Call other companies as well. Agents
and lenders may be biased toward a company simply because they’re in the
habit of using it or they referred clients to it before.
297
Chapter 14: Investing in Real Estate: Your Home and Beyond

After You Buy
After you buy a home, you’ll make a number of important decisions over the
months and years ahead. This section discusses the key issues you need to
deal with as a homeowner and tells what you need to know to make the best
decision for each of them.
Refinancing your mortgage
Three reasons motivate people to refinance, or obtain a new mortgage to
replace an old one. One is obvious: to save money because interest rates have
dropped. Refinancing can also be a way to raise capital for some other pur-
pose. You can use refinancing to get out of one type of loan and into another.
The following sections can help you to decide on the best option in each case.
Spending money to save money
If your current loan has a higher rate of interest than comparable new loans,
you may be able to save money by refinancing. Because refinancing costs
money, whether you can save enough to justify the cost is open to question.
If you can recover the expenses of the refinance within a few years, go for it.
If recovering the costs will take longer, refinancing may still make sense if you
anticipate keeping the property and mortgage that long.
Be wary of mortgage lenders or brokers who tout how soon your refinance will
pay for itself; they usually oversimplify their calculations. For example, if the
refinance costs you $2,000 to complete (accounting for appraisals, loan fees
and points, title insurance, and so on) and reduces your monthly payment by
$100, lenders or brokers typically say that it’s going to take 20 months for you
to recoup the refinance costs. This estimate isn’t accurate, however, because
you lose some tax write-offs if your mortgage interest rate and payment are
reduced. You can’t simply look at the reduced amount of your monthly pay-
ment. (Mortgage lenders like to look at it, however, because it makes refinanc-
ing more attractive.) And your new mortgage will be reset to a different term
than the number of years remaining on your old one.
If you want a better estimate of your likely cost savings but don’t want to spend
hours crunching numbers, take your tax rate — for example, 27 percent — and
reduce your monthly payment savings on the refinance by this amount (see
Chapter 7). Continuing with the example in the preceding paragraph, if your
monthly payment drops by $100, you’re really saving only about $73 a month
after factoring in the lost tax benefits. So it takes about 28 months ($2,000
divided by $73) — not 20 — to recoup the refinance costs.
298
Part III: Building Wealth with Wise Investing 

Note that not all refinances cost tons of money. So-called no-cost refinances
or no-point loans minimize your out-of-pocket expenses, but as I discuss ear-
lier in this chapter, they may not be your best long-term options. Such loans
usually come with higher interest rates.
Using money for another purpose
Refinancing to pull out cash from your home for some other purpose can
make good financial sense because under most circumstances, mortgage
interest is tax-deductible. Paying off other higher-interest consumer debt —
such as on credit cards or on an auto loan — is a common reason for borrow-
ing against a home. The interest on consumer debt is not tax-deductible and
is generally at a much higher interest rate than what mortgages charge you.
If you’re starting a business, consider borrowing against your home to
finance the launch of your business. You can usually do so at a lower cost
than on a business loan.
You need to find out whether a lender is willing to lend you more money
against the equity in your home (which is the difference between the market
value of your house and the loan balance). You can use Table 14-1, earlier in
this chapter, to estimate the maximum loan for which you may qualify.
Changing loans
You may want to refinance even though you aren’t forced to raise cash or
you’re able to save money. Perhaps you’re not comfortable with your current
loan — holders of adjustable-rate mortgages often face this problem. You may
find out that a fluctuating mortgage payment makes you anxious and wreaks
havoc on your budget. The certainty of a fixed-rate mortgage may be your
salvation.
Paying money to go from an adjustable to a fixed rate is a lot like buying
insurance. The cost of the refinance is “insuring” you a level mortgage pay-
ment. Consider this option only if you want peace of mind and you plan to
stay with the property for a number of years.
Sometimes jumping from one adjustable to another makes sense. Suppose
that you can lower the maximum lifetime interest rate cap and the refinance
won’t cost much. Your new loan should have a lower initial interest rate than
the one you’re paying on your current loan. Even if you don’t save megabucks,
the peace of mind of a lower ceiling can make refinancing worth your while.
Mortgage life insurance
Shortly after you buy a home or close on a mortgage, you start getting mail
from all kinds of organizations who keep track of publicly available information
about mortgages. Most of these organizations want to sell you something, and
299
Chapter 14: Investing in Real Estate: Your Home and Beyond

they don’t tend to beat around the bush. “What will your dependents do if you
meet with an untimely demise and they’re left with a gargantuan mortgage?”
these organizations ask. In fact, this is a good financial-planning question. If
your family is dependent on your income, can they survive financially if you
pass away?
Don’t waste your money on mortgage life insurance. You may need life insur-
ance to provide for your family and help meet large obligations such as mort-
gage payments or educational expenses for your children, but mortgage life
insurance is typically grossly overpriced. (Check out the life insurance section
in Chapter 16 for advice about term life insurance.) You should consider mort-
gage life insurance only if you have a health problem and the mortgage life
insurer does not require a physical examination. Be sure to compare it with
term life options.
Is a reverse mortgage a good idea?
An increasing number of homeowners are finding, particularly in their later
years of retirement, that they lack cash. The home in which they live is usually
their largest asset. Unlike other investments, such as bank accounts, bonds,
or stocks, a home does not provide any income to the owner unless he or she
decides to rent out a room or two.
A reverse mortgage allows a homeowner who’s low on cash to tap into home
equity. For an elderly homeowner, tapping into home equity can be a difficult
thing to do psychologically. Most people work hard to feed a mortgage month
after month, year after year, until it’s finally all paid off. What a feat and what
a relief after all those years!
Taking out a reverse mortgage reverses this process. Each month, the reverse
mortgage lender sends you a check that you can spend on food, clothing,
travel, or whatever suits your fancy. The money you receive each month is
really a loan from the bank against the value of your home, which makes the
monthly check free from taxation. A reverse mortgage also allows you to stay
in your home and use its equity to supplement your monthly income.
The main drawback of a reverse mortgage is that it can diminish the estate
that you may want to pass on to your heirs or use for some other purpose.
Also, some loans require repayment within a certain number of years. The
fees and the effective interest rate you’re charged to borrow the money can
be quite high.
Because some loans require the lender to make monthly payments to you as
long as you live in the home, lenders assume that you’ll live many years in
your home so that they won’t lose money when making these loans. If you
end up keeping the loan for only a few years because you move, for example,
the cost of the loan is extremely high.
300
Part III: Building Wealth with Wise Investing 

You may be able to create a reverse mortgage within your own family network.
This technique can work if you have family members who are financially able
to provide you with monthly income in exchange for ownership of the home
when you pass away.
You have other alternatives to tapping the equity in your home. Simply selling
your home and buying a less expensive property (or renting) is one option.
Under current tax laws, qualifying house sellers can exclude a sizable portion
of their profits from capital gains tax: up to $250,000 for single taxpayers and
$500,000 for married couples.
Selling your house
The day will someday come when you want to sell your house. If you’re going
to sell, make sure you can afford to buy the next home you desire. Be espe-
cially careful if you’re a trade-up buyer — that is, if you’re going to buy an
even more expensive home. All the affordability issues discussed at the begin-
ning of this chapter apply. You also need to consider the following issues.
Selling through an agent
When you’re selling a property, you want an agent who can get the job done
efficiently and for as high a price as possible. As a seller, you need to seek an
agent who has marketing and sales expertise and is willing to put in the time
and money necessary to sell your house. Don’t necessarily be impressed by
an agent who works for a large company. What matters more is what the
agent will do to market your property.
When you list your house for sale, the contract you sign with the listing agent
includes specification of the commission to be paid if the agent is successful
in selling your house. In most areas of the country, agents usually ask for a
6 percent commission. In an area that has lower-cost housing, they may ask
for 7 percent.
Regardless of what an agent says is “typical,” “standard,” or “what my man-
ager requires,” always remember that commissions are negotiable. Because
the commission is a percentage, you have a much greater possibility of get-
ting a lower commission on a higher-priced house. If an agent makes 6 per-
cent selling both a $200,000 house and a $100,000 house, the agent makes
twice as much on the $200,000 house. Yet selling the higher-priced house
does not take twice as much work. (Selling a $400,000 house certainly doesn’t
take four times the effort of selling a $100,000 house.)
If you’re selling a higher-priced home (above $250,000), you have no reason
to pay more than a 5 percent commission. For expensive properties ($500,000
and up), a 4 percent commission may be reasonable. You may find, however,
that your ability to negotiate a lower commission is greatest when an offer
is on the table. Because you don’t want to give other agents (working with
301
Chapter 14: Investing in Real Estate: Your Home and Beyond

buyers) a reason not to sell your house, have your listing agent cut his take
rather than reduce the commission that you advertise you’re willing to pay
to an agent who brings you a buyer.
In terms of the length of the listing sales agreement you make with an agent,
three months is reasonable. When you give an agent a listing that’s too long
(6 to 12 months) in duration, the agent may simply toss your listing into the
multiple listing book and expend little effort to sell your property. Practically
speaking, if your home hasn’t sold, you can fire your agent whenever you
want, regardless of the length of the listing agreement. However, a shorter
listing may be more motivating for your agent.
Selling without a real estate agent
You may be tempted to sell without an agent so that you can save the com-
mission that’s deducted from your house’s sale price. If you have the time,
energy, and marketing experience and you can take the time to properly
value your home, you can sell your house without an agent and possibly save
some money.
The major problem with attempting to sell your house on your own is that
agents who are working with buyers don’t generally look for or show their
clients properties that are for sale by owner.
Besides saving you time, a good agent can help ensure that you’re not sued
for failing to disclose the known defects of your property. If you decide to sell
your house on your own, make sure you have access to a legal advisor who
can review the contracts. Whether you sell through an agent or not, be sure
to read the latest edition of House Selling For Dummies, which I co-wrote with
real estate expert Ray Brown (Wiley).
Should you keep your home until prices go up?
Many homeowners are tempted to hold onto their properties (when they
need to move) if the property is worth less than when they bought it or if the
real estate market is soft. Renting out your property is probably not worth
the hassle, and holding onto it is probably not worth the financial gamble. If
you need to move, you’re better off, in most cases, selling your house.
You may reason that, in a few years (during which you’d rent the property), the
real estate storm clouds will clear and you’ll be able to sell your property at a
much higher price. Here are three risks associated with this line of thinking:
 You can’t know whether property prices in the next few years are going
to rebound, stay the same, or drop even further. A property generally
needs to appreciate at least a few percent per year just to make up for all
the costs of holding and maintaining it.

 You may be unprepared for legal issues and dealings with your tenants.
If you’ve never been a landlord, don’t underestimate the hassle and
headaches associated with this job.
 If you convert your home into a rental property in the meantime and it
appreciates in value, you’re going to pay capital gains tax on your profit
when you sell it. This tax wipes out much of the advantage of having
held onto the property until prices recovered. (If you want to be a long-
term rental property owner, you can do a tax-free exchange into another
rental property when you sell.)
However, if you would realize little cash from selling and you lack other money
for the down payment to purchase your next property, you have good reason
for holding onto a home that has dropped in value.
Should you keep your home as investment property after you move?
Converting your home into rental property is worth considering if you need
or want to move. Don’t consider doing so unless it really is a long-term
proposition (ten years or more). As discussed in the preceding section, sell-
ing rental property has tax consequences.
If you want to convert your home into an investment property, you have
an advantage over someone who’s looking to buy an investment property,
because you already own your home. Locating and buying investment prop-
erty takes time and money. You also know what you have with your current
home. If you go out and purchase a property to rent, you’re starting from
scratch.
If your property is in good condition, consider what damage renters may do
to it; few renters will take care of your home the way that you would. Also
consider whether you’re cut out to be a landlord. For more information, see
the section on real estate as an investment in Chapter 9.

Insurance:
Protecting What
You’ve Got

In this part . . .
Just because insurance is boring doesn’t mean you can
ignore it! I show you how to obtain the right kind of
insurance to shield you from the brunt of unexpected
major expenses and protect your assets and future earn-
ings. I also reveal which types of insurance you do and do
not need, explain what to include and what not to include
in your policies, and tell you how much of which things
you should insure. Plus, I help you face other creepy but
important stuff such as wills, probate, and estate planning.

Need at the Best Price
In This Chapter
 Understanding my three laws of buying insurance
 What to do if you’re denied coverage
 Getting your claim money
U
nless you work in the industry, you may find insurance to be a dread-
fully boring topic. Most people associate insurance with disease, death,
and disaster and would rather do just about anything other than review or
spend money on insurance. But because you won’t want to deal with money
hassles when you’re coping with catastrophes — illness, disability, death,
fires, floods, earthquakes, and so on — you have to secure insurance well
before you need it.
Insurance is probably the most misunderstood and least monitored area of
personal finance. Studies show that more than ninety percent of Americans
purchase and carry the wrong types and amounts of insurance coverage. My
own experience as a financial counselor confirms this statistic. Most people
are overwhelmed by all the jargon in sales and policy statements. Thus, they
pay more than necessary for their policies and fail to get coverage through
the best companies.
In this chapter, I tell you how to determine what kinds of insurance you need,
explain what you can do if you’re denied coverage, and give you advice on
getting your claims filled. Later chapters discuss types of insurance in detail,
including insurance on people (Chapter 16) and on possessions (Chapter 17).

Discovering My Three Laws 
of Buying Insurance
I know your patience and interest in finding out about insurance may be lim-
ited, so I boil the subject down to three fairly simple but powerful concepts
that can easily save you thousands of dollars over the rest of your insurance-
buying years. And while you’re saving money, you can still get the coverage
you need in order to avoid a financial catastrophe.
Law I: Insure for the big stuff; 
don’t sweat the small stuff
Imagine, for a moment, that you’re offered a chance to buy insurance that
reimburses you for the cost of a magazine subscription in the event that the
magazine folds and you don’t get all the issues you paid for. Because a maga-
zine subscription doesn’t cost much, I don’t think you’d buy that insurance.
What if you could buy insurance that pays for the cost of a restaurant meal if
you get food poisoning? Even if you’re splurging at a fancy restaurant, you
don’t have a lot of money at stake, so you’d probably decline that coverage
as well.
The point of insurance is to protect against losses that would be financially
catastrophic to you, not to smooth out the bumps of everyday life. The preced-
ing examples are silly, but some people buy equally foolish policies without
knowing it. In the following sections, I tell you how to get the most appropri-
ate insurance coverage for your money. I start off with the “biggies” that are
worth your money, and then I work down to some of insurance options that
are less worthy of your dollars.
Buy insurance to cover financial catastrophes
You should insure against what could be a huge financial loss for you or your
dependents. The price of insurance isn’t cheap, but it is relatively small in
comparison to the potential total loss from a financial catastrophe.
The beauty of insurance is that it spreads risks over millions of other people.
Should your home burn to the ground, paying the rebuilding cost out of your
own pocket probably would be a financial catastrophe. If you have insurance,
the premiums paid by you and all the other homeowners collectively can
easily pay the bills.
308
Part IV: Insurance: Protecting What You’ve Got 

Think for a moment about what your most valuable assets are. (No, I don’t
mean your dry wit and your charming personality.) Also consider potential
large expenses. Perhaps they include the following:
 Future income: During your working years, your most valuable asset is
probably your future earnings. If you were disabled and unable to work,
what would you live on? Long-term disability insurance exists to help
you handle this type of situation. If you have a family that’s financially
dependent on your earnings, how would your family manage if you died?
Life insurance can fill the monetary void left by your death.
 Business: If you’re a business owner, what would happen if you were
sued for hundreds of thousands of dollars or a million dollars or more
for negligence in some work that you messed up? Liability insurance
can bail you out.
 Health: In this age of soaring medical costs, you can easily rack up a
$100,000 hospital bill in short order. Major medical health insurance cov-
erage helps you handle such expenses. And yet, a surprising number of
people don’t carry any health insurance — particularly those who work
in small businesses. (See Chapter 16 for more on health insurance.)
Psychologically, buying insurance coverage for the little things that are more
likely to occur is tempting. You don’t want to feel like you’re wasting your insur-
ance dollars. You want to get some of your money back, darn it! You’re more
likely to get into a fender bender with your car or have a package lost in the
mail than you are to lose your home to fire or suffer a long-term disability.
But if the fender bender costs $500 (which you end up paying out of your
pocket because you took my advice to take a high deductible) or the Postal
Service loses a package worth $50 or $100, you won’t be facing a financial 
disaster.
On the other hand, if you lose your ability to earn an income because of 
a disability, or if you’re sued for $1,000,000 and you’re not insured against
such catastrophes, not only will you be extremely unhappy, but you’ll also
face financial ruin. “Yes, but what are the odds,” I hear people rationalize,
“that I’ll suffer a long-term disability or that I’ll be sued for $1,000,000?”
I agree that the odds are quite low, but the risk is there. The problem is
that you just don’t know what, or when, bad luck may befall you.
And don’t make the mistake of thinking that you can figure the odds better
than the insurance companies can. The insurance companies predict the
probability of your making a claim, large or small, with a great deal of accuracy.
They employ armies of number-crunching actuaries to calculate the odds that
bad things will happen and the frequency of current policyholders’ making
particular types of claims. The companies then price their policies accordingly.
309
Chapter 15: Insurance: Getting What You Need at the Best Price

So buying (or not buying) insurance based on your perception of the likeli-
hood of needing the coverage is foolish. Insurance companies aren’t stupid;
in fact, they’re ruthlessly smart! When insurance companies price policies,
they look at a number of factors to determine the likelihood of your filing a
claim. Take the example of auto insurance. Who do you think will pay more
for auto insurance — a single male who’s age 20, lives the fast life in a high-
crime city, drives a macho, turbo sports car, and has received two speeding
tickets in the past year? Or a couple in their 40s, living in a low-crime area,
driving a four-door sedan, and having a clean driving record?
Take the highest deductible you can afford
Most insurance policies have deductibles — the maximum amount you must
pay, in the event of a loss, before your insurance coverage kicks in. On many
policies, such as auto and homeowner’s/renter’s coverage, most folks opt for
a $100 to $250 deductible.
Here are two benefits to taking a higher deductible:
 You save premium dollars. Year in and year out, you can enjoy the
lower cost of an insurance policy with a high deductible. You may be
able to shave 15 to 20 percent off the cost of your policy. Suppose, for
example, that you can reduce the cost of your policy by $150 per year by
raising your deductible from $250 to $1,000. That $750 worth of coverage
is costing you $150 per year. Thus, you’d need to have a claim of $1,000
or more every five years — highly unlikely — to come out ahead. If you
are that accident-prone — guess what — the insurance company will
raise your premiums.
 You don’t have the hassles of filing small claims. If you have a $300 loss
on a policy with a $100 deductible, you need to file a claim to get your
$200 (the amount you’re covered for after your deductible). Filing an
insurance claim can be an aggravating experience that takes hours of
time. In some cases, you may even have your claim denied after jumping
through all the necessary hoops. Getting your due may require prolonged
haggling.
When you have low deductibles, you may file more claims (although this
doesn’t necessarily mean that you’ll get more money). After filing more
claims, you may be “rewarded” with higher premiums — in addition to the
headache you get from preparing all those blasted forms! Filing more claims
may even cause cancellation of your coverage!
Avoid small-potato policies
A good insurance policy can seem expensive. A policy that doesn’t cost
much, on the other hand, can fool you into thinking that you’re getting 
something for next to nothing. Policies that cost little also cover little —
they’re priced low because they don’t cover large potential losses.
310
Part IV: Insurance: Protecting What You’ve Got 

Following are examples of common “small-potato” insurance policies that are
generally a waste of your hard-earned dollars. As you read through this list,
you may find examples of policies that you bought and that you feel paid for
themselves. I can hear you saying, “But I collected on that policy you’re telling
me not to buy!” Sure, getting “reimbursed” for the hassle of having something
go wrong is comforting. But consider all such policies that you bought or may
buy over the course of your life. You’re not going to come out ahead in the
aggregate — if you did, insurance companies would lose money! These poli-
cies aren’t worth the cost relative to the small potential benefit. On average,
insurance companies pay out just 60 cents in benefits on every dollar collected.
Many of the following policies pay back even less — around 20 cents in benefits
(claims) for every insurance premium dollar spent:
 Extended warranty and repair plans: Isn’t it ironic that right after the
salesperson persuades you to buy a television, computer, or car — in
part by saying how reliable the product is — he tries to convince you to
spend more money to insure against the failure of the item? If the prod-
uct is so good, why do you need such insurance?
Extended warranty and repair plans are expensive and unnecessary
insurance policies. Product manufacturers’ warranties typically cover
any problems that occur in the first three months to a year. After that,
paying for a repair out of your own pocket won’t be a financial catastro-
phe. Reputable manufacturers often fix problems or replace the product
without charge after a warranty has expired (within a reasonable time
period).
 Home warranty plans: If your real estate agent or the seller of a home
wants to pay the cost of a home warranty plan for you, turning down the
offer would be ungracious. (As Grandma would say, you shouldn’t look a
gift horse in the mouth.) But don’t buy this type of plan for yourself. In
addition to requiring some sort of fee (around $50) if you need a con-
tractor to come out and look at a problem, home warranty plans limit
how much they’ll pay for problems.
Your money is best spent hiring a competent inspector to uncover prob-
lems and fix them before you purchase the home. If you’re buying a
house, you should expect to spend money on repairs and maintenance;
don’t waste money purchasing insurance for such expenses.
 Dental insurance: If your employer pays for dental insurance, take
advantage of it. But you shouldn’t pay for this coverage on your own.
Dental insurance generally covers a couple teeth cleanings each year
and limits payments for more expensive work.
 Credit life and credit disability policies: Credit life policies pay a small
benefit if you die with an outstanding loan. Credit disability policies pay a
small monthly income in the event of a disability. Banks and their credit
card divisions usually sell these policies. Some companies sell insurance
to pay off your credit card bill in the event of your death or disability.
311
Chapter 15: Insurance: Getting What You Need at the Best Price

The cost of such insurance seems low, but that’s because the potential
benefits are relatively small. In fact, given what little insurance you’re
buying, these policies are usually extraordinarily expensive. If you need
life or disability insurance, purchase it. But get enough coverage, and buy
it in a separate, cost-effective policy (see Chapter 16 for more details).
If you’re in poor health and you can buy these insurance policies with-
out a medical evaluation, you represent an exception to the “don’t buy
it” rule. In this case, these policies may be the only ones to which you
have access — another reason these policies are expensive. If you’re in
good health, you’re paying for the people with poor health who can enroll
without a medical examination and who undoubtedly file more claims.
 Daily hospitalization insurance: Hospitalization insurance policies that
pay a certain amount per day, such as $100, prey on people’s fears of
running up big hospital bills. Health care is expensive — there’s no
doubt about that.
But what you really need is a comprehensive (major medical) health
insurance policy. One day in the hospital can lead to thousands, even
tens of thousands, of dollars in charges, so that $100-per-day policy may
pay for less than an hour of your 24-hour day! Daily hospitalization poli-
cies don’t cover the big-ticket expenses. If you lack a comprehensive
health insurance policy, make sure you get one (see Chapter 16)!
 Insuring packages in the mail: You buy a $40 gift for a friend, and when
you go to the post office to ship it, the friendly postal clerk asks if you
want to insure it. For a few bucks, you think, “Why not?” The U.S. Postal
Service may have a bad reputation for many reasons, but it rarely loses
or damages things. Go spend your money on something else — or better
yet, invest it.
 Contact lens insurance: The things that people in this country come up
with to waste money on just astound me. Contact lens insurance really
does exist! The money goes to replace your contacts if you lose or tear
them. Lenses are cheap. Don’t waste your money on this kind of insurance.
 Little stuff riders: Many policies that are worth buying, such as auto and
disability insurance, can have all sorts of riders added on. These riders are
extra bells and whistles that insurance agents and companies like to sell
because of the high profit margin they provide (for them). On auto insur-
ance policies, for example, you can buy a rider for a few bucks per year
that pays you $25 each time your car needs to be towed. Having your vehi-
cle towed isn’t going to bankrupt you, so it isn’t worth insuring against.
Likewise, small insurance policies that are sold as add-ons to bigger
insurance policies are usually unnecessary and overpriced. For example,
you can buy some disability insurance policies with a small amount of
life insurance added on. If you need life insurance, purchasing a suffi-
cient amount in a separate policy is less costly.
312
Part IV: Insurance: Protecting What You’ve Got 

Law II: Buy broad coverage
Purchasing coverage that’s too narrow is another major mistake people make
when buying insurance. Such policies often seem like cheap ways to put your
fears to rest. For example, instead of buying life insurance, some folks buy
flight insurance at an airport self-service kiosk. They seem to worry more
about their mortality when getting on an airplane than they do when getting
into a car. If they die on the flight, their beneficiaries collect. But should they
die the next day in an auto accident or get some dreaded disease — which is
statistically far more likely than going down in a jumbo jet — the beneficiaries
don’t collect anything from flight insurance. Buy life insurance (broad coverage
to protect your loved ones financially in the event of your death no matter
how you die), not flight insurance (narrow coverage).
The medical equivalent of flight insurance is cancer insurance. Older people,
who are fearful of having their life savings depleted by a long battle with this
dreaded disease, are easy prey for this narrow insurance. If you get cancer,
cancer insurance pays the bills. But what if you get heart disease, diabetes,
or some other disease? Cancer insurance won’t pay these costs. Purchase
major medical coverage, not cancer insurance.
Recognizing fears
Our fears, such as getting cancer, are natural and inescapable. Although we
may not have control over the emotions that our fears invoke, we must often
ignore those emotions in order to make rational insurance decisions. In other
words, getting shaky in the knees and sweaty in the palms when boarding an
airplane is okay, but letting your fear of flying cause you to make poor insurance
decisions is not okay, especially when those decisions affect the financial
security of your loved ones.
Preparing for natural disasters — insurance and otherwise
In the chapters following this one, in which I discuss specific types of insur-
ance such as disability insurance and homeowner’s insurance, I highlight the
fact that you’ll find it nearly impossible to buy broad coverage. For example,
when purchasing homeowner’s coverage, you find that losses from floods
and earthquakes are excluded. You can secure such coverage in separate
policies, which you should do if you live in an area subject to such risks
(more on this particular risk in Chapter 17). Many people don’t understand
these risks, and it’s annoying and troubling that the insurance industry 
doesn’t do more to educate customers about such gaping holes in their 
policies.
313
Chapter 15: Insurance: Getting What You Need at the Best Price

In addition to filling those voids, you should also think and plan for the nonfi-
nancial issues that inevitably arise in a catastrophe. For example, make sure
you have
 A meeting place for you and your loved ones if you’re separated during a
disaster
 An escape plan should your area by hit with flooding or some other nat-
ural disaster (tornado, hurricane, earthquake, fire, or mudslide)
314
Part IV: Insurance: Protecting What You’ve Got 
Examining misperceptions of risks
How high do you think your risks are for expiring
prematurely if you’re exposed to toxic wastes or
pesticides, or if you live in a dangerous area that
has a high murder rate? Well, actually, these risks
are quite small when compared to the risks you’re
subjecting yourself to when you get behind the
wheel of a car or light up yet another cigarette.
ABC reporter John Stossel was kind enough to
share with me the results of a study done for him
by physicist Bernard Cohen. In the study, Cohen
compared different risks. Cohen’s study showed
that our riskiest behaviors are smoking and dri-
ving. Smoking whacks an average of seven
years off a person’s life, whereas driving a car
results in a bit more than half a year of life lost,
on average. Toxic waste shaves an average of
one week off an American’s life span.
Unfortunately, you can’t buy a formal insurance
policy to protect yourself against all of life’s great
dangers and risks. But that doesn’t mean that
you must face these dangers as a helpless
victim; simple changes in behavior can help you
improve your security.
Personal health habits are a good example of 
the types of behavior you can change. If you’re
overweight and you eat unhealthy, highly
processed foods, drink alcohol excessively, and
don’t exercise, you’re asking for trouble, espe-
cially during post-middle age. Engage in these
habits, and you dramatically increase your risk
of heart disease and cancer.
So does this mean that we should all eat carrots,
tofu, and free range eggs; stay out of cars; and
cease being concerned about toxic waste? No.
But you should understand the consequences of
your behaviors before you engage in them and
minimize your risks accordingly.
You can buy all the types of traditional insurance
that I recommend in this book and still not be well
protected for the simple reason that you’re over-
looking uninsurable risks. However, not being
able to buy formal insurance to protect against
some dangers doesn’t mean that you can’t dras-
tically reduce your exposure to such risks by
modifying your behavior. For example, you can’t
buy an auto insurance policy that protects your
personal safety against drunk drivers, who are
responsible for about 17,000 American deaths
annually. However, you can choose to drive a
safe car, practice safe driving habits, and mini-
mize driving on the roads during the late evening
hours and on major holidays when drinking is
prevalent (such as New Year’s Eve, July 4th, and
so on).

 Steps you can take to make your home safer in the event of an earthquake
or fire (for instance, securing shelving and heavy objects from falling
and tipping, and installing smoke detectors and fire extinguishers)
 A plan for what you’ll do for food, clothing, and shelter should your
home become uninhabitable
You get the idea. Although you can’t possibly predict what’s going to happen
and when, you can find out about the risks of your area. In addition to buying
the broadest possible coverage, you should also make contingency plans for
disasters.
Law III: Shop around and buy direct
Whether you’re looking at auto, home, life, disability, or other types of 
coverage, some companies may charge double or triple the rates that other
companies charge for the same coverage. Insurers that charge the higher
rates may not be better about paying claims, however. You may even end up
with the worst of both possible worlds — high prices and lousy service.
Most insurance is sold through agents and brokers who earn commissions
based on what they sell. The commissions, of course, can bias what they rec-
ommend you buy.
Not surprisingly, policies that pay agents the biggest commissions also tend
to be more costly. In fact, insurance companies compete for the attention of
agents by offering bigger commissions. When I browse through magazines
and other publications targeted to insurance agents, I often see ads in which
the largest text is the commission percentage offered to agents who sell the
advertiser’s products.
Besides the attraction of policies that pay higher commissions, agents also get
hooked, financially speaking, to companies whose policies they sell frequently.
After an agent sells a certain amount of a company’s insurance policies, he or
she is rewarded with higher commission percentages (and other perks) on
any future sales. Just as airlines bribe frequent fliers with mileage bonuses,
insurers bribe agents with fatter commissions and awards such as trips and
costly goods.
Shopping around is a challenge not only because most insurance is sold by
agents working on commission but also because insurers set their rates in
mysterious ways. Every company has a different way of analyzing how much
of a risk you are; one company may offer low rates to me but not to you, and
vice versa.
315
Chapter 15: Insurance: Getting What You Need at the Best Price

Despite the obstacles, several strategies exist for obtaining low-cost, high-
quality policies. The following sections offer smart ways to shop for insurance.
(Chapters 16 and 17 recommend how and where to get the best deals on spe-
cific types of policies.)
Employer and other group plans
When you buy insurance as part of a larger group, you generally get a lower
price because of the purchasing power of the group. Most of the health and
disability policies that you can access through your employer are less costly
than equivalent coverage you can buy on your own.
Likewise, many occupations have professional associations through which you
may be able to obtain lower-cost policies. Not all associations offer better deals
on insurance — compare their policy features and costs with other options.
Life insurance is the one exception to the rule that states that group policies
offer better value than individual policies. Group life insurance plans usually
aren’t cheaper than the best life insurance policies that you can buy individu-
ally. However, group policies may have the attraction of convenience (ease
of enrollment and avoidance of lengthy sales pitches from life insurance
salespeople). Group life insurance policies that allow you to enroll without a
medical evaluation are probably going to be more expensive, because such
plans attract more people with health problems who can’t get coverage on
their own. If you’re in good health, you should definitely shop around for life
insurance (see Chapter 16 to find out how).
Insurance agents who want to sell you an individual policy can come up with
101 reasons why buying from them is preferable to buying through your
employer or some other group. In most cases, agents’ arguments for buying
an individual policy from them include a lot of self-serving hype. In some cases,
agents tell outright lies (which are hard to detect if you’re not insurance-savvy).
One valid issue that agents raise is that if you leave your job, you’ll lose your
group coverage. Sometimes that may be true. For example, if you know that
you’re going to be leaving your job to become self-employed, securing an
individual disability policy before you leave your job makes sense. However,
your employer’s health insurer may allow you to buy an individual policy
when you leave.
In the chapter that follows, I explain what you need in the policies you’re
looking for so that you can determine whether a group plan meets your
needs. In most cases, group plans, especially through an employer, offer
good benefits. So as long as the group policy is cheaper than a comparable
individual policy, you’ll save money overall buying through the group plan.
316
Part IV: Insurance: Protecting What You’ve Got 

Insurance without sales commissions
Buying policies from the increasing number of companies that are selling
their policies directly to the public without the insurance agent and the
agent’s commission is your best bet for getting a good insurance value.
Just as you can purchase no-load mutual funds directly from an investment
company without paying any sales commission (see Chapter 10), you also
can buy no-load insurance. Be sure to read Chapters 16 and 17 for more
specifics on how to buy insurance directly from insurance companies.
317
Chapter 15: Insurance: Getting What You Need at the Best Price
Choosing financially stable insurers
In addition to the price of the policy and the
insurer’s reputation and track record for paying
claims, an insurer’s financial health is important
to consider when choosing a company. If you
faithfully pay your premium dollars year after
year, you’re going to be upset if the insurer goes
bankrupt right before you have a major claim.
Insurance companies can fail just like any other
company, and dozens do in a typical year. A
number of organizations evaluate and rate, with
some sort of letter grade, the financial viability
and stability of insurance companies. The major
rating agencies include A. M. Best, Fitch,
Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s, and Weiss.
The rating agencies’ letter-grade system works
just the way it does in high school: A is better
than B or C. Each company uses a different
scale. Some companies have AAA as their high-
est rating, and then AA, A, BBB, BB, and so on.
Others use A+, A, A–, B+, B, B–, and so on. Just
as some teachers grade more easily, some
firms, such as A. M. Best, have a reputation for
giving out a greater number of high grades.
Other firms, such as Weiss, are tough graders.
Unlike in school, however, you want the tough
critics when researching where to put your
money and future security.
Just as getting more than one medical opinion is
a good idea, getting two or three financial rat-
ings can give you a better sense of the safety of
an insurance company. Stick with companies
that are in the top two — or, at worst, three —
levels on the different rating scales.
You can obtain current rating information about
insurance companies, free of charge, by asking
your agent for a listing of the current ratings. If
you’re interested in a policy sold without the
involvement of an agent, you can request the
current ratings from the insurer itself.
Although the financial health of an insurance
company is important, it’s not as big a deal as
some insurers (usually those with the highest
ratings) and agents make it out to be. Just as
financially unhealthy banks are taken over and
merged into viable ones, sickly insurers usually
follow a similar path under the direction of state
insurance regulators.
With most insurance company failures, claims
still get paid. The people who had money
invested in life insurance or annuities with the
failed insurer are the ones who usually lose out.
Even then, you typically get back 80 cents to 90
cents on the dollar of your account value with the
insurer, but you may have to wait years to get it.

Annuities, investment/insurance products traditionally sold through insurance
agents, are also now available directly to the customer, without commission.
Simply contact some of the leading no-load mutual fund companies such as
Vanguard or T. Rowe Price (see Chapter 11).
Dealing with Insurance Problems
When you seek out insurance or have insurance policies, sooner or later you’re
bound to hit a roadblock. Although insurance problems can be among the
more frustrating in life, in the following sections, I explain how to successfully
deal with the more common obstacles.
Knowing what to do if you’re 
denied coverage
Just as you can be turned down when you apply for a loan, you can also be
turned down when applying for insurance. With medical, life, or disability
insurance, a company may reject you if you have an existing medical problem
(a preexisting condition) and are therefore more likely to file a claim. When it
comes to insuring assets such as a home, you may have difficulty getting cov-
erage if the property is deemed to be in a high-risk area.

Part IV: Insurance: Protecting What You’ve Got 
The straight scoop on commissions
The commission paid to an insurance agent is
never disclosed through any of the documents
or materials that you receive when buying
insurance. The only way you can know what the
commission is and how it compares with other
policies is to ask the agent. Nothing is wrong or
impolite about asking. After all, your money pays
the commission. You need to know whether a
particular policy is being pitched harder
because of its higher commission.
Commissions are typically paid as a percentage
of the first year’s premium on the insurance
policy. (Many policies pay smaller commissions
on subsequent years’ premiums.) With life and
disability insurance policies, for example, a 50
percent commission on the first year’s premium
is not unusual. With life insurance policies that
have a cash value, commissions of 80 to 100
percent of your first year’s premium are possi-
ble. Commissions on health insurance are lower
but generally not as low as commissions on
auto and homeowner’s insurance.

Here are some strategies to employ if you’re denied coverage:
 Ask the insurer why you were denied. Perhaps the company made a
mistake or misinterpreted some information that you provided in your
application. If you’re denied coverage because of a medical condition,
find out what information the company has on you and determine
whether it’s accurate.
 Request a copy of your medical information file. Just as you have a
credit report file that details your use (and misuse) of credit, you also
have a medical information report. Once per year, you can request a free
copy of your medical information file (which typically highlights only
the more significant problems over the past seven years, not your entire
medical file or history) by calling 866-692-6901 or visiting its Web site at
www.mib.com (click on the link on the homepage for the consumer site).
If you find a mistake on your report, you have the right to request that it
be fixed. However, the burden is on you to prove that the information in
your file is incorrect. Proving that your file is incorrect can be a major
hassle — you may even need to contact physicians you saw in the
past, because their medical records may be the source of the incorrect
information.
 Shop other companies. Just because one company denies you coverage,
that doesn’t mean all insurance companies will deny you coverage.
Some insurers better understand certain medical conditions and are more
comfortable accepting applicants with those conditions. Most insurers,
however, charge higher rates to people with blemished medical histories
than they do to people with perfect health records, but some companies
penalize you less than others. An agent who sells policies from multiple
insurers, called an independent agent, can be helpful, because he or she
can shop among a number of different companies.
 Find out about state high-risk pools. A number of states act as the insurer
of last resort and provide insurance for those who can’t get it from insur-
ance companies. State high-risk pool coverage is usually bare bones, but
it beats going without any coverage. The Health Insurance Resource
Center Web site provides links to all (30+) state health coverage high-
risk pool Web sites at www.healthinsurance.org/riskpoolinfo.
Alternatively, you can check with your state department of insurance
(see the “Government” section of your local white pages) for high-risk
pools for other types of insurance, such as property coverage.
 Check for coverage availability before you buy. If you’re considering
buying a home, for example, and you can’t get coverage, the insurance
companies are trying to tell you something. What they’re effectively
saying is “We think that property is so high-risk, we’re not willing to
insure it even if you pay a high premium.”

Chapter 15: Insurance: Getting What You Need at the Best Price

Getting your due on claims
In the event that you suffer a loss and file an insurance claim, you may hope
that your insurance company is going to cheerfully and expeditiously pay
your claims. Given all the money that you shelled out for coverage and all the
hoops you jumped through to get approved for coverage in the first place,
that’s a reasonable expectation.
Insurance companies may refuse to pay you what you think they owe you for
many reasons, however. In some cases, your claim may not be covered under
the terms of the policy. At a minimum, the insurer wants documentation and
proof of your loss. Other people who have come before you have been known
to cheat, so insurers won’t simply take your word, no matter how honest and
ethical you are.
Some insurers view paying claims as an adversarial situation and take a
“negotiate tough” stance. Thinking that all insurance companies are going
to pay you a fair and reasonable amount even if you don’t make your voice
heard is a mistake.
The tips that I discuss in this section can help you ensure that you get paid
what your policy entitles you to.
Documenting your assets and case
When you’re insuring assets, such as your home and its contents, having a
record of what you own can be helpful if you need to file a claim. The best
defense is a good offense. If you keep records of valuables and can document
their cost, you should be in good shape.
A videotape is the most efficient record for documenting your assets, but a
handwritten list detailing your possessions works, too. Just remember to
keep this record someplace away from your home — if your home burns to
the ground, you’ll lose your documentation, too!
If you’re robbed or are the victim of an accident, get the names, addresses,
and phone numbers of witnesses. Take pictures of property damage and
solicit estimates for the cost of repairing or replacing whatever has been lost
or damaged. File police reports when appropriate, if for no other reason than
to bolster your documentation for the insurance claim.
Preparing your case
Filing a claim should be viewed the same way as preparing for a court trial or
an IRS audit. Any information you provide verbally or in writing can and will
be used against you to deny your claim. First, you should understand whether
your policy covers your claim (this is why getting the broadest possible 
320
Part IV: Insurance: Protecting What You’ve Got 

coverage helps). Unfortunately, the only way to find out whether the policy
covers your claim is to read it. Policies are hard to read because they use
legal language in non-user-friendly ways.
A possible alternative to reading your policy is to call the claims department
and, without providing your name (and using caller ID blocking on your phone
if you’re calling from home), ask a representative whether a particular loss
(such as the one that you just suffered) is covered under its policy. You have
no need to lie to the company, but you don’t have to tell the representative
who you are and that you’re about to file a claim, either. Your call is so you
can understand what your policy covers. However, some companies aren’t
willing to provide detailed information unless a specific case is cited.
After you initiate the claims process, keep records of all conversations and
copies of all the documents you gave to the insurer’s claims department.
If you have problems down the road, this “evidence” may bail you out.
For property damage, you should get at least a couple of reputable contractors’
estimates. Demonstrate to the insurance company that you’re trying to shop
for a low price, but don’t agree to use a low-cost contractor without knowing
that he or she can do quality work.
Approaching your claim as a negotiation
To get what you’re owed on an insurance claim, you must approach most
claims’ filings for what they are — a negotiation that is often not cooperative.
And the bigger the claim, the more your insurer will play the part of adversary.
A number of years ago, when I filed a homeowner’s insurance claim after a
major rain and wind storm significantly damaged my backyard fence, I was
greeted on a weekday by a perky, smiley adjuster. When the adjuster entered
my yard and started to peruse the damage, her demeanor changed dramati-
cally. She had a combative, hard-bargainer type attitude that I last witnessed
when I worked on some labor-management negotiations during my days as a
consultant.
The adjuster stood on my back porch, a good distance away from the fences
that had been blown over by wind and crushed by two large trees, and said that
my insurer preferred to repair damaged fences rather than replace them. “With
your deductible of $1,000, I doubt this will be worth filing a claim for,” she said.
The fence that had blown over, she reasoned, could have new posts set in
concrete. Because we had already begun to clean up some of the damage for
safety reasons, I presented to her some pictures of what the yard looked like
right after the storm; she refused to take them. She took some measurements
and said that she’d have her settlement check to us in a couple of days. The
settlement she faxed was for $1,119 — nowhere near what it would cost me
to fix the damage that was done.
321
Chapter 15: Insurance: Getting What You Need at the Best Price

Practicing persistency
When you take an insurance company’s first offer and don’t fight for what
you’re due, you may be leaving a lot of money on the table. To make my long
fence-repair story somewhat shorter, after five rounds of haggling with the
adjusters, supervisors, and finally managers, I was awarded payment to replace
the fences and clean up most of the damage. Even though all the contractors
I contacted recommended that the work be done this way, the insurance
adjuster discredited their recommendations by saying, “Contractors try to jack
up the price and recommended work once they know an insurer is involved.”
My final total settlement came to $4,888, more than $3,700 higher than the
insurer’s first offer. Interestingly, my insurer backed off its preference for
repairing the fence when the contractor’s estimates for doing that work
exceeded the cost of a new fence.
I was disappointed with the behavior of that insurance company. I know from
conversations with others that my homeowner’s insurance company is not
unusual in its adversarial strategy, especially with larger claims. And to think
that this insurer at the time had one of the better track records for paying
claims!
Enlisting support
If you’re doing your homework and you’re not making progress with the
insurer’s adjuster, ask to speak with supervisors and managers. This is the
strategy I used to get the additional $3,700 needed to get things back to
where they were before the storm.
The agent who sold you the policy may be helpful in preparing and filing the
claim. A good agent can help increase your chances of getting paid — and
getting paid sooner. If you’re having difficulty with a claim for a policy obtained
through your employer or other group, speak with the benefits department
or a person responsible for interacting with the insurer. These folks have a
lot of clout, because the agent and/or insurer doesn’t want to lose the entire
account.
If you’re having problems getting a fair settlement from the insurer of a policy
you bought on your own, try contacting the state department of insurance.
You can find the phone number in the “Government” section of the white
pages of your phone book or possibly in your insurance policy, or you can
peruse the list at the National Association of Insurance Commissioners Web
site at www.naic.org (you can find the “Link to Department of Insurance
Web sites” on their homepage).
322
Part IV: Insurance: Protecting What You’ve Got 

Hiring a public adjuster who, for a percentage of the payment (typically 5 to
10 percent), can negotiate with insurers on your behalf is another option.

Chapter 15: Insurance: Getting What You Need at the Best Price
When insurers (and government) move slowly
In 2005, when two hurricanes caused unprece-
dented damage and loss along the Gulf Coast, I
received many complaints from folks in that
region. Typical is the following note I received
from a New Orleans family in December of 2005,
more than three months after hurricane Katrina:
“We had substantial damage to our home in New
Orleans due to hurricane Katrina. We had roof
damage on August 29th and three feet of water
August 31st. Our flood insurance is through an
insurance company acting as an agent for FEMA’s
program. Our adjuster has still not turned in the
necessary paperwork for our claim. Our home
insurer made no allowance for proper removal
and disposal of asbestos shingles and we have
gotten just $2,000 for living expenses out of the
$21,000 we’re now owed. We have just gotten a
first partial payment ($40,000 out of $160,000) on
the flood insurance, but it was made out to the
wrong mortgage company so we had to send the
check back. We only know people with State
Farm insurance have received any checks.
“It is shocking that it has gone on this long. It has
been all over the papers about the delay of some
flood insurance payments being due to FEMA
not having adequate money in the till. There’s no
doubt the insurers are overwhelmed, but why is
this taking so long? I called the Louisiana
Department of Insurance and was told that insur-
ers normally have 30 days for claims according
to the insurance department (who has said they
can have 45 days in this case). It’s been over
60days since the adjuster came out to our home.”
Stories like this make me disappointed and mad.
There’s simply no excuse for large insurance
companies who are in the business of insuring
for such events not to bring the proper
resources to bear to make timely payments. The
fact that they did not do so for Gulf Coast victims
is even more reprehensible given the wide-
spread problems in that area. In addition to
home losses, many people also had job losses
to deal with and could ill afford to be without
money. Large insurers that have written flood
policies for which FEMA temporarily lacked
money should pay their policyholders. Although
the Federal government and FEMA officials
should be taken to task for allowing FEMA’s
accounts to run dry, customer-service oriented
insurers can step up and advance money that
they know will soon be coming from FEMA.
In situations like this, if you do your homework
and you’re not making progress with the
insurer’s adjuster, ask to speak with supervisors
and managers. If you’re having problems getting
a fair and timely settlement from the insurer, try
contacting your state’s department of insur-
ance. This person who wrote me was from
Louisiana, where the state department of insur-
ance had more than 1,600 hurricane-related
complaints in the first three months after hurri-
cane Katrina. To my surprise, the department’s
Director of Public Information told me that no
insurance companies have yet been fined and
penalized for delaying payments. It’s no wonder
these companies weren’t getting on the stick!

When all else fails and you have a major claim at stake, try contacting an
attorney who specializes in insurance matters. You can find these specialists
in the yellow pages under “Attorneys — Insurance Law.” Expect to pay $100+
per hour. Look for a lawyer who’s willing to negotiate on your behalf, help
draft letters, and perform other necessary tasks on an hourly basis without
filing a lawsuit. Your state department of insurance, the local bar association,
or other legal, accounting, or financial practitioners also may be able to refer
you to someone.

D
uring your working years, multiplying your typical annual income by the
number of years you plan to continue working produces a pretty big
number. That dollar amount equals what is probably your most valuable
asset — your ability to earn an income. You need to protect this asset by 
purchasing some insurance on you.
This chapter explains the ins and outs of buying insurance to protect your
income: life insurance in case of death and disability insurance in case of an
accident or severe medical condition that prevents you from working. I tell
you what coverage you should have, where to look for it, and what to avoid.
In addition to protecting your income, you also need to insure against finan-
cially catastrophic expenses. I’m not talking about December’s credit card
bill — you’re on your own with that one. I’m talking about the type of bills
that are racked up from a major surgery and a multi-week stay in the hospital.
Medical expenses today can make even the most indulgent shopping sprees
look dirt-cheap. To protect yourself from potentially astronomical medical
bills, you also need to have comprehensive health insurance.

Providing for Your Loved Ones: 
Life Insurance
You generally need life insurance only when other people depend on your
income. The following types of people don’t need life insurance to protect
their incomes:
 Single people with no children
 Working couples who could maintain an acceptable lifestyle if one of the
incomes were to disappear
 Independently wealthy people who don’t need to work
 Retired people who are living off their retirement nest egg
 Minor children (are you financially dependent upon your children?)
If others are either fully or partly dependent on your paycheck (usually a
spouse and/or child), you should buy life insurance, especially if you have
major financial commitments such as a mortgage or years of child rearing
ahead. You may also want to consider life insurance if an extended family
member is currently or is likely to be dependent on your future income.
Determining how much life 
insurance to buy
Determining how much life insurance to buy is as much a subjective decision
as it is a quantitative decision. I’ve seen some worksheets that are incredibly
long and tedious (some are worse than your tax returns). There’s no need to
get fancy. If you’re like me, your eyes start to glaze over if you have to com-
plete 20-plus lines of calculations. Figuring out how much life insurance you
need doesn’t have to be that complicated.
The main purpose of life insurance is to provide a lump sum payment to
replace the deceased person’s income. You need to ask yourself how many
years of income you want to replace. Table 16-1 provides a simple way to
figure how much life insurance you need to consider purchasing. To replace a
certain number of years’ worth of income, simply multiply the appropriate
number in the table by your annual after-tax income.

*You can roughly determine your annual after-tax income in one of two ways: You can calculate it
by getting out last year’s tax return (and Form W-2) and subtracting the federal, state, and Social
Security taxes you paid from your gross employment income; or you can estimate it by multiplying
your gross income by 80 percent if you’re a low-income earner, 70 percent if you’re a moderate-
income earner, or 60 percent if you’re a high-income earner. (Because life insurance policy payouts
are not taxed, you need to replace only after-tax income and not pre-tax income.)
Another way to determine the amount of life insurance to buy is to think
about how much you’ll need to pay for major debts or expenditures, such
as your mortgage, other loans, and college for your children. For example,
suppose that you want your spouse to have enough of a life insurance death
benefit to pay off your mortgage and half of your children’s college educa-
tion. Simply add your mortgage amount to half of your children’s estimated
college costs (see Chapter 13 for approximate numbers) and then buy that
amount of life insurance.
Social Security, if you’re covered, can provide survivors’ benefits to your spouse
and children. However, if your surviving spouse is working and earning even
a modest amount of money, he or she is going to get little if any survivor’s
benefits. Prior to reaching “full retirement age,” which is between the ages of
65 and 67, depending on when you were born (see Chapter 4), your survivor’s
benefits get reduced by $1 for every $2 you earn above $12,480 (in 2006).
If either you or your spouse anticipates earning such a low income, however,
you may want to factor your Social Security survivor’s benefits into how much
life insurance to buy. Contact the Social Security Administration by phone at
800-772-1213 or visit its Web site at www.ssa.gov to request Form 7004, which
gives you an estimate of your Social Security benefits.
The Social Security Administration can tell you how much your survivors will
receive per month in the event of your death. You should factor this benefit
into the amount of life insurance that you calculate in Table 16-1. For example,
suppose that your annual after-tax income is $25,000 and that Social Security
provides a survivor’s benefit of $10,000 annually. Therefore, for the purposes
of Table 16-1, you should determine the amount of life insurance needed to
replace $15,000 annually ($25,000 – $10,000), not $25,000.

Comparing term life insurance 
to cash value life insurance
I’m going to tell you how you can save hours of time and thousands of dol-
lars. Ready? Buy term life insurance. (The only exception is if you have a high
net worth — several million bucks or more — in which case you may want to
consider other options. See the estate-planning section in Chapter 17.) If you
already figured out how much life insurance to purchase and this is all the
advice you need to go ahead, you can skip the rest of this section and the
next and jump to the “Buying term insurance” section that follows.
If you want the details behind my recommendation for term insurance, the
following information is for you. Or maybe you heard (and have already fallen
prey to) the sales pitches from life insurance agents, most of whom love sell-
ing cash value life insurance because of its huge commissions.
Despite the variety of names that life insurance marketing departments have
cooked up for policies, life insurance comes in two basic flavors:
328
Part IV: Insurance: Protecting What You’ve Got 
“Other” life insurance
Contemplating the possibility of your untimely
demise is surely depressing. You’ll likely feel
some peace of mind when purchasing a life
insurance policy to provide for your dependents.
However, let’s take things a step further. Suppose
that you (or your spouse) pass away. Do you think
that simply buying a life insurance policy will be
sufficient “help” for the loved ones you leave
behind? Surely your contribution to your house-
hold involves far more than being a breadwinner.
For starters, you should make sure that all your
important financial documents — investment
account 
statements, 
insurance 
policies,
employee benefits materials, small-business
accounting records, and so on — are kept in
one place (such as a file drawer) that your loved
ones know about.
Do you have a will? See Chapter 17 for more
details on wills and other estate-planning 
documents.
You may also want to consider providing a list
of key contacts — such as who you recom-
mend calling (or what you recommend reading)
in the event of legal, financial, or tax quandaries.
So, in addition to trying to provide financially for
your dependents, you also need to take some time
to reflect on what else you can do to help point
them in the right direction on matters you normally
handle. With most couples, it’s natural for one
spouse to take more responsibility, say, for money
management. That’s fine; just make sure to talk
about what’s being done so that in the event that
the responsible spouse dies, the surviving
person knows how to jump into the driver’s seat.
If you have kids (and even if you don’t), you may
want to give some thought to sentimental leave-
behinds for your loved ones. These leave-behinds
can be something like a short note telling them
how much they meant to you and what you’d
like them to remember about you.

 Term insurance: This insurance is pure life insurance. You pay an
annual premium for which you receive a predetermined amount of
life insurance protection. If you, the insured person, pass away, your
beneficiaries collect; otherwise, the premium is gone but you’re grateful
to be alive!
 Cash value insurance: All other life insurance policies (whole, universal,
variable, and so on) combine life insurance with a supposed savings fea-
ture. Not only do your premiums pay for life insurance, but some of your
dollars are also credited to an account that grows in value over time,
assuming you keep paying your premiums. On the surface, this sounds
potentially attractive. People don’t like to feel that all their premium dol-
lars are getting tossed away.
But cash value insurance has a big catch. For the same amount of coverage
(for example, for $100,000 of life insurance benefits), cash value policies
cost you about eight times (800 percent) more than comparable term
policies.
Insurance salespeople know the buttons to push to get you interested in
buying the wrong kind of life insurance. In the following sections, I give you
some of the typical arguments they make for purchasing cash value polices,
followed by my perspective on each one.
“Cash value policies are all paid up after X years. You don’t want to
be paying life insurance premiums for the rest of your life, do you?”
Agents who pitch cash value life insurance present projections that imply
that after the first ten or so years of paying your premiums, you don’t need to
pay more premiums to keep the life insurance in force. The only reason you
may be able to stop paying premiums is if you pour a lot of extra money into
the policy in the early years of payment. Remember that cash value life insur-
ance costs about eight times as much as term insurance.
Imagine that you’re currently paying $500 a year for auto insurance and that
an insurance company comes along and offers you a policy for $4,000 per
year. The representative tells you that after ten years, you can stop paying
and still keep your same coverage. I’m sure that you wouldn’t fall for this
sales tactic, but many people do when they buy cash value life insurance.
You also need to be wary of the projections, because they often include 
unrealistic and lofty assumptions about the investment return that your cash
balance can earn. When you stop paying into a cash value policy, the cost of
each year’s life insurance is deducted from the remaining cash value. If the
rate of return on the cash balance is not sufficient to pay the insurance cost,
the cash balance declines, and eventually you receive notices saying that
your policy needs more funding to keep the life insurance in force.
329
Chapter 16: Insurance on You: Life, Disability, and Health

“You won’t be able to afford term insurance when you’re older.”
As you get older, the cost of term insurance increases because the risk of
dying rises. But life insurance is not something you need all your life! It’s typi-
cally bought in a person’s younger years when financial commitments and
obligations outweigh financial assets. Twenty or thirty years later, the reverse
should be true — if you use the principles in this book!
When you retire, you don’t need life insurance to protect your employment
income, because there isn’t any to protect! You may need life insurance when
you’re raising a family and/or you have a substantial mortgage to pay off, but
by the time you retire, the kids should be out on their own (you hope!), and
the mortgage should be paid down.
In the meantime, term insurance saves you a tremendous amount of money.
For most people, it takes 20 to 30 years for the premium they’re paying on a
term insurance policy to finally catch up to (equal) the premium they’ve been
paying all along on a comparable amount of cash value life insurance.
“You can borrow against the cash value at a low interest rate.”
Such a deal! It’s your money in the policy, remember? If you deposited money
in a savings or money market account, how would you like to pay for the
privilege of borrowing your own money back? Borrowing on your cash value
policy is potentially dangerous: You increase the chances that the policy will
lapse — leaving you with nothing to show for your premiums.
“Your cash value grows tax-deferred.”
Ah, a glimmer of truth at last. The cash value portion of your policy grows
without taxation until you withdraw it, but if you want tax-deferral of your
investment balances, you should first take advantage of funding 401(k)s,
403(b)s, SEP-IRAs, and Keoghs. Such accounts give you an immediate tax
deduction for your current contributions in addition to growth without taxa-
tion until withdrawal.
The money you pay into a cash value life policy gives you no upfront tax
deductions. If you exhaust the tax-deductible plans, consider a Roth IRA and
then variable annuities, which provide access to better investment options
and tax-deferred compounding of your investment dollars. Roth IRAs have
the added bonus of tax-free withdrawal of your investment earnings. (See
Chapter 11 for details on retirement accounts.)
Life insurance tends to be a mediocre investment. The insurance company
generally quotes you an interest rate for the first year; after that, the com-
pany pays you what it wants. If you don’t like the future interest rates, you
can be penalized for quitting the policy. Would you ever invest your money in
a bank account that quoted an interest rate for the first year and then penal-
ized you for moving your money within the next seven to ten years?
330
Part IV: Insurance: Protecting What You’ve Got 

“Cash value policies are forced savings.”
Many agents argue that a cash value plan is better than nothing — at least it’s
forcing you to save. This line of thinking is silly because so many people drop
cash value life insurance policies after just a few years of paying into them.
You can accomplish “forced savings” without using life insurance. Any of
the retirement savings accounts mentioned in Chapter 11 can be set up for
automatic monthly transfers. Employers offering such a plan can deduct con-
tributions from your paycheck — and it doesn’t take a commission! You can
also set up monthly electronic transfers from your bank checking account to
contribute to mutual funds (see Chapter 10).
“Life insurance is not part of your taxable estate.”
If the ownership of a life insurance policy is properly structured, the death
benefit is free of estate taxes. This part of the sales pitch is about the only
sound reasoning that exists for buying cash value life insurance. Under cur-
rent federal laws, you can pass on $2,000,000 free of federal estate taxes for
tax years 2006–2008 ($3,500,000 in 2009). But even if you’ve got that large of
a nest egg, you have numerous other ways to reduce your taxable estate
(see Chapter 17).
Making your decision
Insurance salespeople aggressively push cash value policies because of the
high commissions that insurance companies pay them. Commissions on cash
value life insurance range from 50 to 100 percent of your first year’s premium.
An insurance salesperson, therefore, can make eight to ten times more money
(yes, you read that right) selling you a cash value policy than he can selling
you term insurance.
Ultimately, when you purchase cash value life insurance, you pay the high
commissions that are built into these policies. As you can see in the policy’s
cash value table, you don’t get back any of the money that you dump into the
policy if you quit the policy in the first few years. The insurance company
can’t afford to give you any of your money back in those early years because
so much of it has been paid to the selling agent as commission. That’s why
these policies explicitly penalize you for withdrawing your cash balance
within the first seven to ten years.
Because of the high cost of cash value policies relative to the cost of term,
you’re more likely to buy less life insurance coverage than you need — that’s
the sad part of the insurance industry’s pushing of this stuff. The vast majority
of life insurance buyers need more protection than they can afford to buy with
cash value coverage.
331
Chapter 16: Insurance on You: Life, Disability, and Health

Cash value life insurance is the most oversold insurance and financial prod-
uct in the history of the financial services industry. Cash value life insurance
makes sense for a small percentage of people, such as small-business owners
who own a business worth at least several million dollars and don’t want
their heirs to be forced to sell their business to pay estate taxes in the event
of their death. (See “Considering the purchase of cash value life insurance,”
later in this chapter.)
Purchase low-cost term insurance and do your investing separately. Life insur-
ance is rarely a permanent need; over time, you can reduce the amount of term
insurance you carry as your financial obligations lessen and you accumulate
more assets.
Buying term insurance
Term insurance policies have several features to choose from. I cover the
important elements of term insurance in this section so you can make an
informed decision about purchasing it.
Choosing how often your premium adjusts
As you get older, the risk of dying increases, so the cost of your insurance
goes up. Term insurance can be purchased so that your premium adjusts
(increases) annually or after 5, 10, 15, or 20 years. The less frequently your
premium adjusts, the higher the initial premium and its incremental increases
will be.
The advantage of a premium that locks in for, say, 15 years is that you have
the security of knowing how much you’ll be paying each year for the next
15 years. You also don’t need to go through medical evaluations as frequently
to qualify for the lowest rate possible.
The disadvantage of a policy with a long-term rate lock is that you pay
more in the early years than you do on a policy that adjusts more fre-
quently. In addition, you may want to change the amount of insurance you
carry as your circumstances change. You may throw money away when you
dump a policy with a long-term premium guarantee before its rate is set to
change.
Policies that adjust the premium every five to ten years offer a happy
medium between price and predictability.
332
Part IV: Insurance: Protecting What You’ve Got 

Ensuring guaranteed renewability
Guaranteed renewability, which is standard practice on the better policies,
assures that the policy can’t be canceled because of poor health. Don’t buy
a life insurance policy without this feature unless you expect that your life
insurance needs will disappear when the policy is up for renewal.
Deciding where to buy term insurance
A number of sound ways to obtain high-quality, low-cost term insurance are
available. You may choose to buy through a local agent because you know
her or prefer to buy from someone close to home. However, you should
invest a few minutes of your time getting quotes from one or two of the fol-
lowing sources to get a sense of what’s available in the insurance market.
Gaining familiarity with the market can prevent an agent from selling you an
overpriced, high-commission policy.
Here are some sources for high-quality, low-cost term insurance:
 USAA: This company sells low-cost term insurance directly to the
public. You can contact USAA by phone at 800-531-8000.
 Insurance agency quotation services: These services provide proposals
from the highest-rated, lowest-cost companies available. Like other agen-
cies, the services receive a commission if you buy a policy from them,
which you’re under no obligation to do. They ask questions such as your
date of birth, whether you smoke, some basic health questions, and how
much coverage you want. Services that are worth considering include
• ReliaQuote: www.reliaquote.com; 888-847-8683
• SelectQuote: www.selectquote.com; 800-963-8688
• Term4Sale: www.term4sale.com
See Chapter 19 for information on how to use your computer when making
life insurance decisions.
Getting rid of cash value life insurance
If you were snookered into buying a cash value life insurance policy and you
want to part ways with it, go ahead and do so. But don’t cancel the coverage
until you first secure new term coverage. When you need life insurance, you
don’t want to have a period when you’re not covered (Murphy’s Law says
that’s when disaster will strike).
333
Chapter 16: Insurance on You: Life, Disability, and Health

Ending a cash value life insurance policy has tax consequences. For most of
these policies, you must pay tax on the amount you receive in excess of the
premiums you paid over the life of the policy. Because some life insurance
policies feature tax-deferred retirement savings, you may incur a 10 percent
federal income tax penalty on earnings withdrawn before age 591⁄2, just as you
would with an IRA. If you want to withdraw the cash balance in your life
insurance policy, consider checking with the insurer or a tax advisor to 
clarify what the tax consequences may be.
You can avoid federal income tax early withdrawal penalties and sidestep 
taxation on accumulated interest in a life insurance policy by doing a tax-free
exchange into a no-load (commission-free) variable annuity. The no-load mutual
fund company through which you buy the annuity takes care of transferring
your existing balance. (See Chapter 12 for more information about annuities.)
Considering the purchase of 
cash value life insurance
Don’t expect to get objective information from anyone who sells cash value
life insurance. Beware of insurance salespeople masquerading under the
guise of self-anointed titles, such as estate-planning specialists or financial
planners.
As I discuss earlier in the chapter, purchasing cash value life insurance may
make sense if you expect to have an estate-tax “problem.” However, cash
value life insurance is just one of many ways to reduce your estate taxes
(see the section on estate planning in Chapter 17).
Among the best places to shop for cash value life insurance policies are
 USAA: 800-531-8000
 Ameritas Direct: 800-552-3553
If you want to obtain some cash value life insurance, make sure you avoid local
insurance agents, especially while you’re in the learning stage. Agents aren’t
as interested in educating as they are in selling (big surprise). Besides, the
best cash value policies can be obtained free of most (or all) sales commis-
sions when you buy them from the sources I provide in the preceding list.
The money saved on commissions (which can easily be thousands of dollars)
is reflected in a much higher cash value for you.
334
Part IV: Insurance: Protecting What You’ve Got 

Preparing for the Unpredictable:
Disability Insurance
As with life insurance, the purpose of disability insurance is to protect your
income. The only difference is that with disability insurance, you’re protect-
ing the income for yourself (and perhaps also your dependents). If you’re
completely disabled, you still have living expenses, but you probably can’t
earn employment income.
I’m referring to long-term disabilities. If you throw out your back while reliv-
ing your athletic glory days and you wind up in bed for a couple weeks, it
won’t be as much of a financial disaster as if you were disabled in such a way
that you couldn’t work for several years. This section helps you figure out
whether you need disability insurance, how much to get, and where to find it.
Deciding whether you need coverage
Most large employers offer disability insurance to their employees. Many
small-company employees and all self-employed people are left to fend for
themselves without disability coverage. Being without disability insurance is
a risky proposition, especially if, like most working people, you need your
employment income to live on.
If you’re married and your spouse earns a large enough income that you can
make do without yours, you may want to consider skipping disability cover-
age. The same is true if you’ve already accumulated enough money for your
future years (in other words, you’re financially independent). Keep in mind,
though, that your expenses may go up if you become disabled and require
specialized care.
For most people, dismissing the need for disability coverage is easy. The odds
of suffering a long-term disability seem so remote — and they are. But if you
meet up with bad luck, disability coverage can relieve you (and possibly your
family) of a major financial burden.
Most disabilities are caused by medical problems, such as arthritis, heart
conditions, hypertension, and back/spine or hip/leg impairments. Some of
these ailments occur with advancing age, but more than one-third of all dis-
abilities are suffered by people under the age of 45. The vast majority of
these medical problems cannot be predicted in advance, particularly those
caused by random accidents.
335
Chapter 16: Insurance on You: Life, Disability, and Health

If you think you have good disability coverage through government pro-
grams, you’d better think again:
 Social Security disability: Social Security pays long-term benefits only if
you’re not able to perform any substantial, gainful activity for more than
a year or if your disability is expected to result in death. Furthermore,
Social Security disability payments are quite low because they’re intended
to provide only for basic, subsistence-level living expenses.
 Workers’ compensation: Workers’ compensation (if you have such cov-
erage through your employer) pays you benefits if you’re injured on the
job, but it doesn’t pay any benefits if you get disabled away from your
job. You need coverage that pays regardless of where and how you’re
disabled.
 State disability programs: A few states have disability insurance pro-
grams, but the coverage is typically bare bones. State programs are also
generally not a good value because of the cost for the small amount of
coverage they provide. Benefits are paid over a short period of time
(rarely more than a year).
Determining how much disability 
insurance you need
You need enough disability coverage to provide you with sufficient income to
live on until other financial resources become available. If you don’t have
much saved in the way of financial assets and you want to continue with
the lifestyle supported by your current income if you suffer a disability,
get enough disability coverage to replace your entire monthly take-home 
(after-tax) pay.
The benefits you purchase on a disability policy are quoted as the dollars per
month you receive if disabled. So if your job provides you with a $3,000-
per-month income after payment of taxes, seek a policy that provides a
$3,000-per-month benefit.
If you pay for your disability insurance, the benefits are tax-free (but hopefully
you won’t ever have to collect them). If your employer picks up the tab, your
benefits are taxable, so you need a greater amount of benefits.
In addition to the monthly coverage amount, you also need to select the
duration for which you want a policy to pay you benefits. You need a policy
that pays benefits until you reach an age at which you become financially
self-sufficient. For most people, that’s around age 65, when their Social
Security benefits kick in. If you anticipate needing your employment income
past your mid-60s, you may want to obtain disability coverage that pays you
until a later age.
336
Part IV: Insurance: Protecting What You’ve Got 

On the other hand, if you crunched some numbers (see Chapter 3) and you
expect to be financially independent by age 55, shop for a policy that pays
benefits up to that age — it’ll cost you less than one that pays benefits to you
until age 65. If you’re within five years of being financially independent or
able to retire, five-year disability policies are available, too. You may also con-
sider such short-term policies when you’re sure that someone (for example, a
family member) can support you financially over the long-term.
Identifying other features you 
need in disability insurance
Disability insurance policies have many confusing features. Here’s what to
look for — and look out for — when purchasing disability insurance:
 Definition of disability: An own-occupation disability policy provides
benefit payments if you can’t perform the work you normally do.
Some policies pay you only if you’re unable to perform a job for which
you are reasonably trained. Other policies revert to this definition after
a few years of being own-occupation.
Own-occupation policies are the most expensive because there’s a
greater chance that the insurer will have to pay you. The extra cost may
not be worth it unless you’re in a high-income or specialized occupation
and you’d have to take a significant pay cut to do something else (and
you wouldn’t be happy about a reduced income and the required
lifestyle changes).
 Noncancelable and guaranteed renewable: These features ensure that
your policy can’t be canceled because of your falling into poor health.
With policies that require periodic physical exams, you can lose your
coverage just when you’re most likely to need it.
 Waiting period: This is the “deductible” on disability insurance — the
lag time between the onset of your disability and the time you begin col-
lecting benefits. As with other types of insurance, you should take the
highest deductible (longest waiting period) that your financial circum-
stances allow. The waiting period significantly reduces the cost of the
insurance and eliminates the hassle of filing a claim for a short-term 
disability. The minimum waiting period on most policies is 30 days.
The maximum waiting period can be up to one to two years. Try a waiting
period of three to six months if you have sufficient emergency reserves.
 Residual benefits: This option pays you a partial benefit if you have a
disability that prevents you from working full-time.
 Cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs): This feature automatically increases
your benefit payment by a set percentage annually or in accordance
with changes in inflation. The advantage of a COLA is that it retains the
purchasing power of your benefits. A modest COLA, such as 4 percent,
is worth having.
337
Chapter 16: Insurance on You: Life, Disability, and Health

 Future insurability: A clause that many agents encourage you to buy,
future insurability allows you, regardless of health, to buy additional
coverage. For most people, paying for the privilege of buying more cov-
erage later is not worth it if the income you earn today fairly reflects
your likely long-term earnings (except for cost-of-living increases).
Disability insurance is sold only as a proportion of your income. You may
benefit from the future insurability option if your income is artificially
low now and you’re confident that it will rise significantly in the future.
(For example, you just got out of medical school and you’re earning a
low salary while being enslaved as a resident.)
 Insurer’s financial stability: As I discuss in Chapter 15, you should
choose insurers that’ll be here tomorrow to pay your claim. But don’t
get too hung up on the stability of the company; benefits are paid even if
the insurer fails, because the state or another insurer will almost always
bail the unstable insurer out.
Deciding where to buy disability insurance
The place to buy disability insurance with the best value is through your
employer or professional association. Unless these groups have done a lousy
job shopping for coverage, group plans offer a better value than disability
insurance you can purchase on your own. Just make sure that the group plan
meets the specifications discussed in the preceding section.
Don’t trust an insurance agent to be enthusiastic about the quality of a dis-
ability policy your employer or other group is offering. Agents have a conflict
of interest when they criticize these options, because they won’t make a com-
mission if you buy through a group.
If you don’t have access to a group policy, check with your agent or a com-
pany you already do business with. You can also contact USAA, which offers
competitively priced disability policies, by calling 800-531-8000.
Tread carefully when purchasing disability insurance through an agent. Some
agents try to load down your policy with all sorts of extra bells and whistles
to pump up the premium along with their commission.
If you buy disability insurance through an agent, use a process called list
billing. With list billing, you sign up with several other people for coverage at
the same time and are invoiced together for your coverage. It can knock up to
15 percent off an insurer’s standard prices. Ask your insurance agent how list
billing works.
338
Part IV: Insurance: Protecting What You’ve Got 

Getting the Care You Need: 
Health Insurance
Almost everyone (except the super-wealthy) needs health insurance, but not
everyone has it. Some people who can afford health insurance choose not to
buy it because they believe that they’re healthy and they’re not going to need
it. Others who opt not to buy health insurance figure that if they ever really
need health care, they’ll get it even if they can’t pay. To a large extent, they’re
right. People without health insurance generally put off getting routine care,
which can lead to small problems’ turning into big ones (which cost more
due to advanced illness, emergency room visits, and so on).
Choosing the best health plan
Before Medicare (the government-run insurance program for the elderly)
kicks in at age 65+, odds are that you’ll obtain your health insurance through
your employer. Be thankful if you do. Employer-provided coverage eliminates
the headache of having to shop for coverage, and it’s usually cheaper than
coverage you buy on your own.
Whether you have options through your employer or you have to hunt for a
plan on your own, the following sections cover the major issues to consider
when selecting among the health insurance offerings in the marketplace.
339
Chapter 16: Insurance on You: Life, Disability, and Health
Other types of “insurance” 
for protecting your income
Life insurance and disability insurance replace
your income if you die or suffer a disability. But you
may also see your income reduced or completely
eliminated if you lose your job. Although no formal
insurance exists to protect you against the forces
that can cause you to lose your job, you can do
some things to reduce your exposure to such risk:
 Make sure that you have an emergency
reserve of money that you can tap into if you
lose your job. (Chapter 4 offers specific
guidelines for deciding how much money is
right for you.)
 Attend to your skills and professional devel-
opment on a continual basis. Not only does
upgrading your education and skills ensure
that you’ll be employable if you have to look
for a new job, but it may also help you keep
your old job and earn a higher income.

Major medical coverage
You need a plan that covers the big potential expenses: hospitalization, physi-
cian, and ancillary charges, such as X-rays and laboratory work. If you’re a
woman and you think that you may want to have children, make sure that
your plan has maternity benefits.
Choice of health care providers
Plans that allow you to use any health care provider you want are becoming
less common and more expensive in most areas. Health maintenance organi-
zations (HMOs) and preferred provider organizations (PPOs) are the main
plans that restrict your choices. They keep costs down because they negoti-
ate lower rates with selected providers.
HMOs and PPOs are more similar than they are different. The main difference
is that PPOs still pay the majority of your expenses if you use a provider out-
side their approved list. If you use a provider outside the approved list with
an HMO, you typically aren’t covered at all.
If you have your heart set on particular physicians or hospitals, find out
which health insurance plans they accept as payment. Ask yourself whether
the extra cost of an open-choice plan is worth being able to use their services
if they’re not part of a restricted-choice plan. Also be aware that some plans
allow you to go outside their network of providers as long as you pay a por-
tion of the incurred medical costs. If you’re interested in being able to use
alternative types of providers, such as acupuncturists, find out whether the
plans you’re considering cover these services.
Don’t let stories of how hard it is to get an appointment with a doctor or
other logistical hassles deter you from going with an HMO or PPO plan.
These things can happen in plans with open choice, too — some doctors are
always running late or are overbooked. The idea that doctors who can’t get
patients on their own are the only ones who sign up with restricted-choice
plans is a myth. Although HMO and PPO plans do offer fewer choices when it
comes to providers, objective surveys show that customer satisfaction with
these plans is as high as it is for plans that offer more choices.
Lifetime maximum benefits
Health insurance plans specify the maximum total benefits they’ll pay over
the course of time you’re insured by their plan. Although a million dollars
may be more money than you could ever imagine being spent on your health
care, it’s the minimum acceptable level of total benefits. With the cost of
health care today, you can quickly blow through that if you develop major
health problems. Ideally, choose a plan that has no maximum or that has a
maximum of at least 5 million dollars.
340
Part IV: Insurance: Protecting What You’ve Got 

Deductibles and co-payments
To reduce your health insurance premiums, choose a plan with the highest
deductible and co-payment you can afford. As with other insurance policies,
the more you’re willing to share in the payment of your claims, the less you’ll
have to pay in premiums. Most policies have annual deductible options (such
as $250, $500, $1,000, and so on), as well as co-payment options, which are
typically 20 percent or so.
When choosing a co-payment percentage, don’t let your imagination run wild
and unnecessarily scare you. A 20 percent co-payment does not mean that
you have to come up with $20,000 for a $100,000 claim. Insurance plans gen-
erally set a maximum out-of-pocket limit on your annual co-payments (such
as $1,000, $2,000, and so on); the insurer covers 100 percent of any medical
expenses that go over that cap.
341
Chapter 16: Insurance on You: Life, Disability, and Health
Saving on taxes when spending on health care
If you expect to have out-of-pocket medical
expenses, find out whether your employer offers
a flexible spending or health care reimbursement
account. These accounts enable you to pay for
uncovered medical expenses with pre-tax dollars.
If, for example, you’re in a combined 35 percent
federal and state income tax bracket, these
accounts allow you to pay for necessary health
care at a 35 percent discount. These accounts
can also be used to pay for vision and dental care.
Be forewarned of the major stumbling blocks you
face when saving through medical reimburse-
ment accounts. First, you need to elect to save
money from your paycheck prior to the beginning
of each plan year. The only exception is at the
time of a “life change,” such as a family member’s
death, marriage, spouse’s job change, divorce,
or the birth of a child. You also need to use the
money within the year you save it, because these
accounts contain a “use or lose it” feature.
Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) are for the self-
employed and people who work for small firms.
To qualify, you must have a high-deductible (at
least $1,000 for individuals; $2,000 for families)
health insurance policy; then you can put money
earmarked for medical expenses into an invest-
ment account that offers the tax benefits —
deductible contributions and tax-deferred com-
pounding — of a retirement account (see
Chapter 4). And unlike in a flexible spending
account, you don’t have to deplete the HSA by
the end of the year: Money can compound tax-
deferred inside the HSA for years. Begin to
investigate an HSA through insurers offering
health plans you’re interested in or with the
company you currently have coverage through.
You may also be able to save on taxes if you
have a substantial amount of health care expen-
ditures in a year. You can deduct medical and
dental expenses as an itemized deduction on
Schedule A to the extent that they exceed 7.5
percent of your adjusted gross income (refer to
Chapter 7). Unless you’re a low income earner,
you need to have substantial expenses, usually
caused by an accident or major illness, to take
advantage of this tax break.

For insurance provided by your employer, consider plans with low out-of-
pocket expenses if you know that you have health problems. Because you’re
part of a group, the insurer won’t increase your individual rates just because
you’re filing more claims.
Most HMO plans don’t have deductible and co-payment options. Most just
charge a set amount — such as $25 — for a physician’s office visit.
Guaranteed renewable
You want a health insurance plan that keeps renewing your coverage without
your having to prove continued good health.
Buying health insurance
You can buy many health plans through agents, and you can also buy some
directly from the insurer. When health insurance is sold both ways, buying
through an agent usually doesn’t cost more.
If you’re self-employed or you work for a small employer that doesn’t offer
health insurance as a benefit, get proposals from the larger and older health
insurers in your area. Larger plans can negotiate better rates from providers,
and older plans are more likely to be here tomorrow.
Many insurers operate in a bunch of different insurance businesses. You want
those that are the biggest in the health insurance arena and are committed to
that business. If your coverage is canceled, you may have to search for cover-
age that allows an existing medical problem. Other health insurers won’t
want to insure you. (Find out whether your state department of insurance
offers a plan for people unable to get coverage.)
Nationally, Blue Cross, Blue Shield, Kaiser Permanente, Aetna, UnitedHealth
Group, CIGNA, Assurant, Golden Rule, Health Net, WellPoint, and Anthem are
among the older and bigger health insurers.
Also check with professional or other associations that you belong to, as
such plans sometimes offer decent benefits at a competitive price due to the
purchasing power clout that they possess. A competent independent insur-
ance agent who specializes in health insurance can help you find insurers
who are willing to offer you coverage.
Health insurance agents have a conflict of interest that’s common to all finan-
cial salespeople working on commission: The higher the premium plan they
342
Part IV: Insurance: Protecting What You’ve Got 

sell you, the bigger the commission they earn. So an agent may try to steer
you into higher-cost plans and avoid suggesting some of the strategies I dis-
cuss in the previous section for reducing your cost of coverage.
Dealing with insurance denial
When you try to enroll in a particular health insurance plan, you may be
turned down because of current or previous health problems. Your medical
information file (the medical equivalent of a credit report) may contain informa-
tion explaining why you were turned down. (See Chapter 15 for more about
medical information files.)
If you have a so-called preexisting condition (current or prior medical prob-
lems), you have several options to pursue when trying to secure health 
insurance:
 Try health insurance plans that don’t discriminate. A few plans — 
typically Blue Cross, Blue Shield, and some HMO plans, such as Kaiser
Permanente — will sometimes take you regardless of your condition.
 Find a job with an employer whose health insurer doesn’t require a
medical exam. Of course, this shouldn’t be your only reason for seeking
new employment, but it can be an important factor. If you’re married,
you may also be able to get into an employer group plan if your spouse
takes a new job.
 Find out whether your state offers a plan. A number of states maintain
“high-risk” pools that insure people who have preexisting conditions and
are unable to find coverage elsewhere (see Chapter 15 for how to find
out which states offer such plans). If your state doesn’t offer one of
these plans, I suppose that, in a drastic situation, you could move to a
nearby state that does.
Looking at retiree medical care insurance
Medicare, the government-run health insurance plan for the elderly, is a multi-
part major medical plan. Enrollment in Part A (hospital expenses) is automatic.
Part B, which covers physician expenses and other charges, including home
health care coverage; Part C, supplemental Medicare coverage (sold through
private insurers); and Part D, for prescription drugs (provided through private
insurers), are optional. Supplemental insurance policies may be of interest to
you if you want help paying for the costs that Medicare doesn’t pay.
343
Chapter 16: Insurance on You: Life, Disability, and Health

Closing Medicare’s gaps
Medigap coverage generally pays the deductibles and co-payments that
Medicare charges. For the first 60 days of hospitalization, you pay $952 total
out of your own pocket. If you have an unusually long hospital stay, you pay
$238 per day for the 61st through 90th day, $476 per day for the 91st through
150th day, and all costs beyond 150 days. Clearly, if you stay in a hospital for
many months, your out-of-pocket expenses can escalate; however, the longest
hospitalizations tend not to last for many months. Also note that Medicare’s
hospitalization benefits refresh when you’re out of the hospital for 60 consec-
utive days.
If the costs from a long hospital stay would be a financial catastrophe for you
and if you’re unable to pay for the deductibles and co-payments because
your income is low, Medicaid (the state-run medical insurance program for
low-income people) may help pay your bills. Alternatively, Medigap insurance
can help close the gap.
344
Part IV: Insurance: Protecting What You’ve Got 
Dealing with medical claims headaches
If you sign up for a health plan that has
deductibles and co-payments, make sure that
you review the benefits statements your insurer
sends you. Errors often pop up on these state-
ments and during the claims filing process. Not
surprisingly, the errors are usually at your
expense.
Make sure that your insurer has kept accurate
track of your contributions toward meeting your
plan’s annual deductible and maximum out-of-
pocket charges. Also, don’t pay any health care
providers who send you bills until you receive
proper notification from the insurance company
detailing what you are obligated to pay those
providers according to the terms of your plan.
Because most insurance companies have nego-
tiated discounted fee schedules with health
care providers, the amount that a provider bills
you is often higher than the amount they’re
legally due as per the terms of their contract with
your insurer. Your insurer’s benefits statement
should detail the approved and negotiated rate
once the claim is processed.
And don’t let providers try to bully you into
paying them the difference between what they
billed you for and what the insurer says they are
due. Providers are due only the discounted fees
they agreed to with your insurer.
Haggling with your health insurer is a real pain,
and it usually happens after you rack up signif-
icant medical expenses and may still not be
feeling well. But if you don’t stay on top of your
insurer, you can end up paying thousands of
dollars in overpayments.
If you’re overwhelmed with an avalanche of
claims and benefits statements, you may want
to consider using a health insurance claims pro-
cessing service. You can get a referral to firms
that engage in this line of work by visiting the
Alliance of Claims Assistance Professionals
Web site at www.claims.org.

Check with your physician(s) to see that he or she does not charge a fee
higher than the one listed on Medicare’s fee schedule. If your physician does
charge a higher fee, you may want to consider going to another physician if
you can’t afford the fee or if you want to save some money. Medicare often
pays only 80 percent of the physician charges that the program allows on its
fee schedule. Some physicians charge higher fees than those allowed by
Medicare.
The biggest reason that elderly people consider extra health insurance is that
Medicare pays only for the first 100 days in a skilled nursing facility. Anything
over that is your responsibility. Unfortunately, Medigap policies don’t
address this issue, either.
Long-term care insurance
Insurance agents who are eager to earn a hefty commission will often tell you
that long-term care (LTC) insurance is the solution to your concerns about an
extended stay in a nursing home. Don’t get your hopes up. Policies are com-
plicated and filled with all sorts of exclusions and limitations. On top of all
that, they’re expensive, too.
The decision to purchase LTC insurance is a trade-off. Do you want to pay
thousands of dollars annually, beginning at age 60, to guard against the 
possibility of a long-term stay in a nursing home? If you live into or past your
mid-80s, you can end up paying $100,000 or more on an LTC policy (not to
mention the lost investment earnings on these insurance premiums).
People who end up in a nursing home for years on end may come out ahead
financially when buying LTC insurance. The majority of people who stay in a
nursing home are there for less than a year, though, because they either pass
away or move out.
Medicare pays for the bulk of the cost of the first 100 days in a nursing home
as long as certain conditions are satisfied. Medicare pays for all basic ser-
vices (telephone, television, and private room charges excluded) for the first
20 days and then requires a co-payment of $119 per day for the next 80 days.
First, the nursing-home stay must follow hospitalization within 30 days, and
the nursing-home stay must be for the same medical condition that caused
the hospitalization. When you’re discharged from the nursing home, you can
qualify for an additional 100-day benefit period as long as you haven’t been
hospitalized or in a nursing home in the 60 days prior to your readmission.
If you have relatives or a spouse who will likely care for you in the event of a
major illness, you should definitely not waste your money on nursing-home
insurance. You can also bypass this coverage if you have and don’t mind
using retirement assets to help pay nursing-home costs.

Chapter 16: Insurance on You: Life, Disability, and Health

Even if you do deplete your assets, remember that you have a backup:
Medicaid (state-provided medical insurance) can pick up the cost if you
can’t. However, be aware of a number of potential drawbacks to getting 
coverage for nursing-home stays under Medicaid:
 Medicaid patients are at the bottom of the priority list. Most nursing
homes are interested in the bottom line, so the patients who bring in the
least revenue — namely Medicaid patients — get the lowest priority on
nursing-home waiting lists.
 Some nursing homes don’t take Medicaid patients. Check with your pre-
ferred nursing homes in your area to see whether they accept Medicaid.
 The states may squeeze Medicaid further. Deciding which medical 
conditions warrant coverage is up to your state. With the budget noose
tightening, some states are disallowing certain types of coverage (for
example, mental problems for elderly people who are otherwise in good
physical health).
If you’re concerned about having your stash of money wiped out by an
extended nursing-home stay and you have a strong desire to pass money to
your family or a favorite charity, you can start giving your money away while
you’re still healthy. (If you’re already in poor health, legal experts can strategize
to preserve your assets and keep them from being used to pay nursing-home
costs.)

Part IV: Insurance: Protecting What You’ve Got 
Discovering the most overlooked 
form of insurance
You buy health insurance to cover large medical
expenses, disability insurance to replace your
income in the event of a long-term disability, and
perhaps life insurance to provide money to
those dependent on your income in the event of
your death. Many people buy all the right kinds
of personal insurance, spending a small fortune
over the course of their lives. Yet they overlook
the obvious, virtually free protection: taking care
of themselves.
If you work at a desk all day and use many of life’s
modern conveniences, you may end up being the
Great American Couch Potato. Odds are that
you’ve heard of most of these methods of enhanc-
ing longevity and quality of life, but if you’re still
on the couch, the advice apparently didn’t sink in.
So, for you sofa spuds, here are seven health tips:
 Don’t smoke.
 Drink alcohol in moderation if you drink at all.
 Get plenty of rest.
 Exercise regularly.
 Eat a healthful diet (see Chapter 6 for diet
tips that can save you money and improve
your health).
 Get regular health care checkups to detect
medical, dental, and vision problems.
 Take time to smell the roses.

Consider buying nursing-home insurance if you want to retain and protect
your assets and if it gives you peace of mind to know that a long-term nursing-
home stay is covered. But do your homework. Do some comparison shopping,
and make sure that you buy a policy that pays benefits for the long term.
A year’s worth (or even a few years’ worth) of benefits won’t protect your
assets if your stay lasts longer. Also be sure to get a policy that adjusts the
daily benefit amount for increases in the cost of living. Watch out for policies
that restrict benefits to limited types of facilities and settings. Get a policy that
covers care in your home or other settings if you don’t need to be in a high-cost
nursing home, and make sure that it doesn’t require prior hospitalization for
benefits to kick in. To keep premiums down, also consider a longer exclusion
or waiting period — three to six months or a year before coverage starts.
You may also want to consider retirement communities if you’re willing to
live as a younger retiree in such a setting. After paying an entrance fee, you
pay a monthly fee, which usually covers your rent, care, and meals. Make
sure that any such facility you’re considering guarantees care for life and
accepts Medicaid in case you deplete your assets.
Making sense of Medicare’s prescription drug program
As if there weren’t enough confusing government programs, Uncle Sam had
to create yet another that began in 2006 — the Medicare (Part D) prescription
drug plan. Here are some key facts you need to know about these relatively
complicated plans, which are offered through private insurers:
 Plans make the most sense for those who expect to spend more than
$5,000 on prescription drugs. You will pay for $3,600 out of pocket of the
first $5,100 in expenses before “catastrophic coverage” kicks in. Medicare
pays 95 percent of additional drug costs above $5,100 during the calen-
dar year.
 If you choose not to enroll when you’re first eligible and then later
enroll, you’ll be charged a penalty equal to 1 percent of the national
average Part D premium for each month that has elapsed since you were
first eligible to participate. You will pay this penalty for as long as you’re
in the plan.
 If you’re on the fence about enrolling, consider starting with a low pre-
mium plan that then gives you the right to transfer into a higher cost
and better coverage plan without paying the late enrollment penalty.
 Visit www.medicare.gov for helpful information on drug plans and how
to select one. For example, click on the Formulary (drug) Finder to iden-
tify specific insurer plans that cover your current medications or your
anticipated future medications. AARP’s Web site, www.aarp.org, also
has plenty of information and resources to find out more about these
confusing plans.

Covering Your Assets
In This Chapter

 Looking at umbrella insurance
 Planning your estate
I
n Chapter 16, I discuss the importance of protecting your future income
from the possibilities of disability, death, or large, unexpected medical
expenses. But you also have to insure major assets that you acquired in the
past: your home, your car, and your personal property. You need to protect
these assets for two reasons:
 Your assets are valuable. If you were to suffer a loss, replacing the
assets with money out of your own pocket could be a financial 
catastrophe.
 A lawsuit could drain your finances. Should someone be injured or
killed in your home or because of your car, a lawsuit could be financially
devastating.
In this chapter, I explain why, how, and for how much to insure your home,
personal property, and vehicle. I also discuss excess liability insurance and
how to determine where your money will go in the event of your death.
Insuring Where You Live
When you buy a home, most lenders require that you purchase homeowner’s
insurance. But even if they don’t, you’re wise to do so, because your home
and the personal property within it are worth a great deal and would cost a
bundle to replace.
As a renter, damage to the building in which you live is not your immediate
financial concern, but you still have personal property you may want to
insure. You also have the possibility (albeit remote) that you’ll be sued by
someone who’s injured in your rental.

When shopping for a homeowner’s or renter’s policy, consider the important
features that I cover in the following sections.
Dwelling coverage: The cost to rebuild
How much would you have to spend to rebuild your home if it were com-
pletely destroyed in a fire, an attack of locusts, or whatever? The cost to
rebuild should be based on the size (square footage) of your home. Neither
the purchase price nor the size of your mortgage should determine how
much dwelling coverage you need.
If you’re a renter, rejoice that you don’t need dwelling coverage. If you’re a
condominium owner, find out whether the coverage the condo association
bought for the entire building is sufficient.
Be sure that your homeowner’s policy includes a guaranteed replacement
cost provision. This useful feature ensures that the insurance company will
rebuild the home even if the cost of construction is more than the policy cov-
erage. If the insurance company underestimates your dwelling coverage, it
has to make up the difference.
Unfortunately, insurers define guaranteed replacement cost differently. Some
companies pay for the full replacement cost of the home, no matter how
much it ends up costing. Other insurers set limits. For example, some insur-
ers may pay up to only 25 percent more than the dwelling coverage on your
policy. Ask your insurer how it defines guaranteed replacement cost.
If you have an older property that doesn’t meet current building standards,
consider buying a rider (supplemental coverage to your main insurance
policy) that pays for code upgrades. This rider covers the cost of rebuilding
your home, in the event of a loss, to comply with current building codes that
may be more stringent than the ones in place when your home was built. Ask
your insurance company what your basic policy does and doesn’t cover.
Some companies include a certain amount (for example, 10 percent of your
dwelling coverage) for code upgrades in the base policy.
Personal property coverage: 
For your things
On your homeowner’s policy, the amount of personal property coverage is
typically derived from the amount of dwelling coverage you carry. Generally,
you get personal property coverage that’s equal to 50 to 75 percent of the
dwelling coverage. This amount is usually more than enough.
350
Part IV: Insurance: Protecting What You’ve Got 

Regarding riders to cover jewelry, computers, furs, and other somewhat
costly items that may not be fully covered by typical homeowner’s policies,
ask yourself whether the out-of-pocket expense from the loss of such items
would constitute a financial catastrophe. Unless you have tens of thousands
of dollars worth of jewelry or computer equipment, skip such riders.
Some policies come with replacement cost guarantees that pay you the cost 
to replace an item. This payment can be considerably more than what the
used item was worth before it was damaged or stolen. When this feature is
not part of the standard policy sold by your insurer, you may want to pur-
chase it as a rider, if available.
As a renter or condominium owner, you need to choose a dollar amount for
the personal property you want covered. Tally it up instead of guessing —
the total cost of replacing all your personal property may surprise you.
Make a list of your belongings — or even better, take pictures or make a
video — with an estimate of what they’re worth. Keep this list updated; you’ll
need it if you have to file a claim. Retaining receipts for major purchases may
also help your case. No matter how you document your belongings, don’t
forget to keep the documentation somewhere besides your home — other-
wise, it could be destroyed along with the rest of your house in a fire or other
disaster.
Liability insurance: Coverage 
for when others are harmed
Liability insurance protects you financially against lawsuits that may arise if
someone gets injured on your property, including wounds inflicted by the
family pit bull or terrible tabby. (Of course, you should keep Bruno restrained
when guests visit — even your cranky in-laws.) At a minimum, get enough lia-
bility insurance to cover your financial assets — covering two times your
assets is better. Buying extra coverage is inexpensive and well worth the cost.
The probability of being sued is low, but if you are sued and you lose, you
could end up owing big bucks. If you have substantial assets to protect, 
you may want to consider an umbrella, or excess liability, policy. (See
“Protecting against Mega-Liability: Umbrella Insurance,” later in this chapter.)
Liability protection is one of the side benefits of purchasing a renter’s 
policy — you protect your personal property as well as insure against 
lawsuits. (But don’t be reckless with your banana peels if you get liability
insurance!)
351
Chapter 17: Covering Your Assets

Flood and earthquake insurance:
Protection from Mother Nature
You should purchase the broadest possible coverage when buying any type
of insurance (see Chapter 15). The problem with homeowner’s insurance is
that it’s not comprehensive enough — it doesn’t typically cover losses due to
earthquakes and floods. You must buy such disaster coverage piecemeal.
If an earthquake or flood were to strike your area and destroy your home,
you’d be out tens (if not hundreds) of thousands of dollars without proper
coverage. Yet many people don’t carry these important coverages, often as 
a result of some common misconceptions:
 “Not in my neighborhood.” Many people mistakenly believe that earth-
quakes occur only in California. I wish this were true for those of you
who live in the other 49 states, but it’s not. In fact, one of the strongest
earthquakes in the United States occurred in the Midwest, and known
(though less active) fault lines lie along the East Coast. The cost of
earthquake coverage is based on insurance companies’ assessment of
the risk of your area and property type, so you shouldn’t decide whether
to buy insurance based on how small you think the risk is. The risk is
already built into the price.
An estimated 20,000 communities around the country face potential
flood damage. Like earthquakes, floods are not a covered risk in stan-
dard homeowner’s policies, so you need to purchase a flood insurance
rider. Check with your current homeowner’s insurer or with the insurers
recommended in this chapter. The federal government flood insurance
program (phone 888-379-9531; Web site www.floodsmart.gov) pro-
vides background information on flood insurance policies.
 “The government will bail me out.” The vast majority of government
financial assistance is obtained through low-interest loans. Loans, unfor-
tunately, need to be repaid, and the money comes out of your pocket.
 “In a major disaster, insurers would go bankrupt anyway.” This is
highly unlikely given the reserves insurers are required to keep and the
fact that the insurance companies reinsure — that is, they buy insurance
to back up the policies they write.
People who have little equity in their property and are willing to walk away
from their property and mortgage in the event of a major quake or flood may
consider not buying earthquake or flood coverage. Keep in mind that walking
away damages your credit report, because you’re essentially defaulting on
your loan.
352
Part IV: Insurance: Protecting What You’ve Got 

You may be able to pay for much of the cost of earthquake or flood insurance
by raising the deductibles (discussed in the next section) on the main part of
your homeowner’s/renter’s insurance and other insurance policies (such as
auto insurance). You can more easily afford the smaller claims, not the big
ones. If you think flood or earthquake insurance is too costly, compare those
costs with the costs you may have to incur to completely replace your home
and personal property. Buy this insurance if you live in an area that has a
chance of being affected by these catastrophes. To help keep the cost of
earthquake insurance down, consider taking a 10 percent deductible. Most
insurers offer deductibles of 5 or 10 percent of the cost to rebuild your home.
Ten percent of the rebuilding cost is a good chunk of money. But losing the
other 90 percent is what you want to insure against.
Deductibles: Your cost with a claim
As I discuss in Chapter 15, the point of insurance is to protect against cata-
strophic losses, not the little losses. By taking the highest deductibles you’re
comfortable with, you save on insurance premiums year after year, and you
don’t have to go through the hassle of filing small claims.
Special discounts
You may qualify for special discounts. Companies and agents that sell home-
owner’s and renter’s insurance don’t always check to see whether you’re eli-
gible for discounts. After all, the more you spend on policy premiums, the
more money they make! If your property has a security system, you’re older,
or you have other policies with the same insurer, you may qualify for a lower
rate. Remember to ask.
Buying homeowner’s or renter’s insurance
Each insurance company prices its homeowner’s and renter’s policies based
on its own criteria. So the lowest-cost company for your friend’s property
may not be the lowest-cost company for you. You have to shop around at sev-
eral companies to find the best rates. The following list features companies
that historically offer lower-cost policies for most people and have decent
track records regarding customer satisfaction and the payment of claims:
 Amica: Although Amica does have good customer satisfaction, its prices
are high in some areas. You can contact the company by calling
800-242-6422.
353
Chapter 17: Covering Your Assets

 Erie Insurance: This company does business primarily in the Midwest
and Mid-Atlantic. Check your local phone directory for agents, or call
800-458-0811 for a referral to a local agent.
 GEICO: You can contact the company by calling 800-841-3000.
 Liberty Mutual: Check your local phone directory for agents.
 Nationwide Mutual: Check your local phone directory for agents.
 State Farm: Check your local phone directory for agents.
 USAA: This company provides insurance for members of the military
and their families. Call the company at 800-531-8080 (or visit their Web
site at www.usaa.com) to see whether you qualify.
Don’t worry that some of these companies require you to call a toll-free
number for a price quote. This process saves you money, because these
insurers don’t have to pay commissions to local agents hawking their poli-
cies. These companies have local claims representatives to help you if and
when you have a claim.
A number of the companies mentioned in the preceding list sell other types
of insurance (for example, life insurance) that aren’t as competitively priced.
Be sure to check out the relevant sections in this part of the book for the best
places to buy these other types of coverage if you need them.
Some state insurance departments conduct surveys to determine the insurers’
prices and tabulate complaints received. Look up your state’s department of
insurance phone number in the government section of your local phone direc-
tory or visit the National Association of Insurance Commissioners’ Web site at
www.naic.org/state_web_map.htm to find links to each state’s department
of insurance site.
Auto Insurance 101
Over the course of your life, you may spend tens of thousands of dollars on
auto insurance. Much of the money people spend on auto insurance is not
spent where it’s needed most. In other cases, the money is simply wasted.
Look for the following important features when searching for an auto insur-
ance policy.
Bodily injury/property damage liability
As with homeowner’s liability insurance, auto liability insurance provides
insurance against lawsuits. Accidents happen, especially with a car. Make
354
Part IV: Insurance: Protecting What You’ve Got 

sure that you have enough bodily injury liability insurance, which pays for
harm done to others, to cover your assets. (Coverage of double your assets is
preferable.)
If you’re just beginning to accumulate assets, don’t mistakenly assume that
you don’t need liability protection. Many states require a minimum amount —
insurers should be able to fill you in on the details for your state. Also, don’t
forget that your future earnings, which are an asset, can be garnished in a 
lawsuit.
Property damage liability insurance covers damage done by your car to other
people’s cars or property. The amount of property damage liability coverage
in an auto insurance policy is usually determined as a consequence of the
bodily injury liability amount selected. Coverage of $50,000 is a good mini-
mum to start with.
Uninsured or underinsured 
motorist liability
When you’re in an accident with another motorist and he doesn’t carry his
own liability protection (or doesn’t carry enough), uninsured or underinsured
motorist liability coverage allows you to collect for lost wages, medical
expenses, and pain and suffering incurred in the accident.
355
Chapter 17: Covering Your Assets
Coping with teen drivers
If you have a teenage driver in your household,
you’re going to be spending a lot more on auto
insurance (in addition to worrying a lot more).
Try to keep your teenager out of your car as long
as possible — this is the best advice I can offer.
If you allow your teenager to drive, you can take
a number of steps to avoid spending all your
take-home pay on auto insurance bills:
 Make sure that your teen does well in
school. Some insurers offer discounts if
your child is a strong academic achiever
and has successfully completed a driver’s
education class (which is not required).
 Get price quotes from several insurers to
see how adding your teen driver to your
policy affects the cost.
 Have your teenager share in the costs of
using the car. If you pay all the insurance, gas,
and maintenance bills, your teenager won’t
value the privilege of using your “free” car.
Of course, not letting your teen drive shouldn’t
just be about keeping your insurance bills to a
minimum. Auto accidents are the number one
cause of death for teens. For more on driving
responsibly, see the upcoming sidebar titled
“Driving safely: Overlooked auto insurance.”

If you already have comprehensive health and long-term disability insurance,
uninsured or underinsured motorist liability coverage is largely redundant.
However, if you drop this coverage, you do give up the ability to sue for gen-
eral pain and suffering and to insure passengers in your car who may lack
adequate medical and disability coverage.
To provide a death benefit to those financially dependent on you in the event
of a fatal auto accident, buy term life insurance (see Chapter 16).
Deductibles
To minimize your auto insurance premiums and eliminate the need to file
small claims, take the highest deductibles you’re comfortable with. (Most
people should consider a $500 to $1,000 deductible.) On an auto policy, two
deductibles exist: collision and comprehensive. Collision applies to claims
arising from collisions. (Note that if you have collision coverage on your own
policy, you can generally bypass collision coverage when you rent a car.)
Comprehensive applies to other claims for damages not caused by collision
(for example, a window broken by vandals).
As your car ages and loses its value, you can eventually eliminate your com-
prehensive and collision coverages altogether. The point at which you do this
is up to you. Insurers won’t pay more than the book value of your car, regard-
less of what it costs to repair or replace it. Remember that the purpose of
insurance is to compensate you for losses that are financially catastrophic 
to you. For some people, this amount may be as high as $5,000 or more —
others may choose $1,000 as their threshold point.
Special discounts
You may be eligible for special discounts on auto insurance. Don’t forget to
tell your agent or insurer if your car has a security alarm, air bags, or anti-
lock brakes. If you’re older or you have other policies or cars insured with
the same insurer, you may also qualify for discounts. And make sure that
you’re given appropriate “good driver” discounts if you’ve been accident-
and ticket-free in recent years.
And here’s another idea: Before you buy your next car, call insurers and ask
for insurance quotes for the different models you’re considering. The cost of
insuring a car should factor into your decision of which car you buy, because
the insurance costs represent a major portion of your car’s ongoing operat-
ing expenses.
356
Part IV: Insurance: Protecting What You’ve Got 

Little-stuff coverage to skip
Auto insurers have dreamed up all sorts of riders, such as towing and rental
car reimbursement. On the surface, these riders appear to be inexpensive.
But they’re expensive given the little amount you’d collect from a claim and
the hassle of filing.
Riders that waive the deductible under certain circumstances make no sense,
either. The point of the deductible is to reduce your policy cost and eliminate
the hassle of filing small claims.
Medical payments coverage typically pays a few thousand dollars for medical
expenses. If you and your passengers carry major medical insurance cover-
age, this rider isn’t really necessary. Besides, a few thousand dollars of med-
ical coverage doesn’t protect you against catastrophic expenses.
Roadside assistance, towing, and rental car reimbursement coverage pay
only small dollar amounts, and they aren’t worth buying. In fact, if you belong
to an automobile club, you may already have some of these coverages.
357
Chapter 17: Covering Your Assets
Driving safely: Overlooked auto insurance
Tragic events (murders, fires, hurricanes, plane
crashes, and so on) are well-covered by the
media, but the number of deaths that make the
front pages of our newspapers pales in com-
parison to the approximately 40,000 people who
die on America’s roads every year.
I’m not suggesting that our national media should
start reporting every automobile fatality. Even 24
hours of daily CNN coverage probably couldn’t
keep up with all the accidents on our roads. But
the real story with auto fatalities lies not in the
who, what, and where of specific accidents but
in the why. When we ask the why question, we
see how many of them are preventable.
No matter what kind of car you drive, you can
and should drive safely. Stay within the speed
limits and don’t drive while intoxicated or tired or
in adverse weather conditions. Wear your seat
belt — a U.S. Department of Transportation study
found that 60 percent of auto passengers killed
were not wearing their seat belts. And don’t try to
talk on your cell phone and write notes on a pad
of paper attached to your dashboard while bal-
ancing your coffee cup between your legs!
You can also greatly reduce your risk of dying in
an accident by driving a safe car. You don’t need
to spend buckets of money to get a car with
desirable safety features. The Consumer
Reports annual auto-buying guide has lots of
good information on individual car model safety.

Buying auto insurance
You can use the homeowner’s insurers list I present earlier in this chapter to
obtain quotes for auto insurance. In addition, you can contact Progressive by
calling 800-288-6776 or visiting their Web site at www.progressive.com.
Protecting against Mega-Liability:
Umbrella Insurance
Umbrella insurance (which is also referred to as excess liability insurance) is
additional liability insurance that’s added on top of the liability protection on
your home and car(s). If, for example, you have $700,000 in assets, you can
buy a $1,000,000 umbrella liability policy to add to the $300,000 liability insur-
ance that you have on your home and car. Expect to pay a couple hundred
dollars — a small cost for big protection. Each year, thousands of people
suffer lawsuits of more than $1,000,000 related to their cars and homes.
Umbrella insurance is generally sold in increments of $1,000,000. So how do
you decide how much you need if you have a lot of assets? As with other
insurance coverages, you should have at least enough liability insurance to
protect your assets and preferably enough to cover twice the value of those
assets.
To purchase umbrella insurance, start by contacting your existing home-
owner’s or auto insurance company.
358
Part IV: Insurance: Protecting What You’ve Got 
Diversification: Investment insurance
Insurance companies don’t sell policies that
protect the value of your investments, but you
can shield your portfolio from many of the dan-
gers of a fickle market through diversification.
If all your money is invested in bank accounts or
bonds, you’re exposed to the risks of inflation,
which can erode your money’s purchasing
power. Conversely, if the bulk of your money is
invested in one high-risk stock, your financial
future could go up in smoke if that stock
explodes.
Chapter 9 discusses the benefits of diversifica-
tion and tells you how to choose investments
that do well under different conditions. Chapter
10 discusses why mutual funds are powerful
investment vehicles that make diversification
easy and cost-effective.

You Can’t Take It with You: 
Planning Your Estate
Estate planning is the process of determining what will happen to your assets
after you die. Thinking about your mortality in the context of insurance may
seem a bit odd. But the time and cost of various estate-planning maneuvers 
is really nothing more than buying insurance: You’re ensuring that, after you
die, everything will be taken care of as you wish and taxes will be minimized.
Thinking about estate planning in this way can help you better evaluate
whether certain options make sense at particular points in your life.
Depending upon your circumstances, you may eventually want to contact 
an attorney who specializes in estate-planning matters. However, educating
yourself first about the different options is worth your time. More than a few
attorneys have their own agendas about what you should do, so be careful.
And most of the estate-planning strategies that you’re likely to benefit from
don’t require hiring an attorney.
Wills, living wills, and medical 
powers of attorney
When you have children who are minors (dependents), a will is a necessity.
The will names the guardian to whom you entrust your children if both you
and your spouse die. Should you and your spouse both die without a will
(called intestate), the state (courts and social-service agencies) decides who
will raise your children. Therefore, even if you can’t decide at this time who
you want to raise your children, you should at least appoint a trusted
guardian who can decide for you.
Having a will makes good sense even if you don’t have kids, because it gives
instructions on how to handle and distribute all your worldly possessions. If
you die without a will, your state decides how to distribute your money and
other property, according to state law. Therefore, your friends, distant rela-
tives, and favorite charities will probably receive nothing. Without any living
relatives, your money may go to the state government!
Without a will, your heirs are legally powerless, and the state may appoint an
administrator to supervise the distribution of your assets at a fee of around 5
percent of your estate. A bond typically must also be posted at a cost of sev-
eral hundred dollars.
359
Chapter 17: Covering Your Assets

A living will and a medical power of attorney are useful additions to a stan-
dard will. A living will tells your doctor what, if any, life-support measures
you prefer. A medical (or health care) power of attorney grants authority to
someone you trust to make decisions regarding your medical care options.
The simplest and least costly way to prepare a will, a living will, and a 
medical power of attorney is to use the high-quality, user-friendly software
packages that I recommend in Chapter 19. Be sure to give copies of these
documents to the guardians and executors named in the documents.
You don’t need an attorney to make a legal will. Most attorneys, in fact, pre-
pare wills and living trusts using software packages! What makes a will valid
is that three people witness your signing it.
If preparing the will all by yourself seems overwhelming, you can (instead of
hiring an attorney) use a paralegal typing service to help you prepare the
documents. These services generally charge 50 percent or less of what an
attorney charges.
Avoiding probate through living trusts
Because of our quirky legal system, even if you have a will, some or all of
your assets must go through a court process known as probate. Probate is
the legal process for administering and implementing the directions in a will.
Property and assets that are owned in joint tenancy or inside retirement
accounts, such as IRAs or 401(k)s, generally pass to heirs without having to
go through probate. However, passing through probate is necessary for most
other assets.
A living trust effectively transfers assets into a trust. As the trustee, you con-
trol those assets, and you can revoke the trust whenever you desire. The
advantage of a living trust is that upon your death, assets can pass directly to
your beneficiaries without going through probate. Probate can be a lengthy,
expensive hassle for your heirs — with legal fees tallying 5+ percent of the
value of the estate. In addition, your assets become a matter of public record
as a result of probate.
Living trusts are likely to be of greatest value to people who meet the follow-
ing criteria:
 Age 60 or older
 Single
 Assets worth more than $100,000 that must pass through probate
(including real estate, nonretirement accounts, and small businesses)
 Real property held in other states

Part IV: Insurance: Protecting What You’ve Got 

As with a will, you do not need an attorney to establish a legal and valid living
trust. (See my software recommendations in Chapter 19 and consider the
paralegal services that I mention in the preceding section on wills.) Attorney
fees for establishing a living trust can range from hundreds to thousands of
dollars. Hiring an attorney is of greatest value to people with large estates
(see the next section) who do not have the time, desire, and expertise to
maximize the value derived from estate planning.
Note: Living trusts keep assets out of probate but have nothing to do with
minimizing estate or inheritance taxes.
Reducing estate taxes
Thanks to the tax law changes passed in the early 2000s, fewer and fewer
people will have an estate tax “problem” in the years ahead. An individual
can pass $2,000,000 to beneficiaries without having to pay federal estate
taxes. (This exclusion increases to $3,500,000 in 2008.)
Whether you should be concerned about possible estate taxes depends on
several issues. How much of your assets you’re going to use up during your
life is the first and most important issue you need to consider. This amount
depends on how much your assets grow over time, as well as how rapidly
you spend money. During retirement, you’ll (hopefully) be utilizing at least
some of your money.
I’ve seen too many affluent individuals worry about estate taxes on their
money throughout their retirements. If your intention is to leave your money
to your children, grandchildren, or a charity, why not start giving while
you’re still alive so you can enjoy the act? You can give $12,000 annually to
each of your beneficiaries, tax-free. By giving away money, you reduce your
estate and, therefore, the estate taxes owed on it. Any appreciation on the
value of the gift between the date of the gift and your date of death is also out
of your estate and not subject to estate taxes.
In addition to gifting, a number of trusts allow you to minimize estate taxes.
For example, if you’re married, both you and your spouse can each pass up
to $2,000,000 to your heirs (for a total of $4,000,000), free of federal estate
taxes. You can accomplish this by establishing a bypass trust. Upon the death
of the first spouse, assets held in his or her name go into the bypass trust,
effectively removing those assets from the remaining spouse’s taxable estate.
Because the amount that can be passed free of estate taxes escalates to
$3,500,000 by 2008, a bypass trust will allow for the estate-tax-free passage 
of up to $7,000,000.

Chapter 17: Covering Your Assets

Cash value life insurance is another estate planning tool. Unfortunately, it’s a
tool that’s overused. People who sell cash value insurance — that is, insur-
ance salespeople and others masquerading as financial planners — too often
advocate life insurance as the one and only way to reduce estate taxes. Other
methods for reducing estate taxes are usually superior, because they don’t
require wasting money on life insurance.
Small-business owners whose businesses are worth several million dollars 
or more may want to consider cash value life insurance under specialized 
circumstances. If you lack the necessary additional assets to pay expected
estate taxes and you don’t want your beneficiaries to be forced to sell the
business, you can buy cash value life insurance to pay expected estate taxes.

Munro, David J. Silverman, and me (Wiley Publishing).

H
iring a competent, ethical, and unbiased financial planner or advisor to
help you make and implement financial decisions can be money well
spent. But if you pick a poor advisor or someone who really isn’t a financial
planner but a salesperson in disguise, your financial situation can get worse
instead of better. So before I talk about the different types of help to hire, I
discuss the options you have for directing the management of your personal
finances.
Surveying Your Financial 
Management Options
Everyone has three basic choices for managing money: You can do nothing,
you can do it yourself, or you can hire someone to help you.
Doing nothing
The do-nothing approach has a large following (and you thought you were
alone!). People who fall into this category may be leading exciting, interesting
lives and are therefore too busy to attend to something as mundane as dealing

with their personal finances. Or they may be leading mundane existences but
are too busy fantasizing about more-appealing ways to spend their time. For
both types, everything from a major UFO sighting to taking out the garbage
captures their imagination more than thinking about financial management.
But the dangers of doing nothing are many. Problem areas, when left to them-
selves, get worse. Putting off saving for retirement or ignoring your buildup of
debt eventually comes back to haunt you. If you don’t carry adequate insur-
ance, accidents can be devastating. Fires and earthquakes in California, flood-
ing in the Midwest, and hurricanes in the South show how precarious living
in paradise actually is.
If you’ve been following the do-nothing approach all your life, you’re now offi-
cially promoted out of it! You bought this book to find out more about per-
sonal finance and make changes in your money matters, right? So take
control and keep reading!
Doing it yourself
The do-it-yourselfers learn enough about financial topics to make informed
decisions on their own. Doing anything yourself, of course, requires you 
to invest some time in learning the basic concepts and keeping up with
changes. For some, personal financial management becomes a challenging
and absorbing interest. Others focus on what they need to do to get the 
job done efficiently.
The idea that you’re going to spend endless hours on your finances if you
direct them yourself is a myth. The hardest part of managing money for most
people is catching up on things that they should have done previously. After
you get things in order, which you can easily do with this book as your com-
panion, you shouldn’t have to spend more than an hour or two working on
your personal finances every few months (unless a major issue, like a real
estate purchase, comes up).
Some people in the financial advisory business like to make what they do
seem so complicated, comparing it to brain surgery! Their argument goes,
“You wouldn’t perform brain surgery on yourself, so why would you manage
your money yourself?” Well, to this I say, “Personal financial management
ain’t brain surgery — not even close.” You can manage on your own. In fact,
you can do a better job than most advisors. Why? Because you’re not subject
to their conflicts of interest, and you care the most about your money.

Hiring financial help
Realizing that you need to hire someone to help you make and implement
financial decisions can be a valuable insight. Spending a few hours and sev-
eral hundred dollars to hire a competent professional can be money well
spent, even if you have a modest income or assets. But you need to know
what your money is buying.
Financial planners or advisors make money in one of three ways:
 They earn commissions based on the sales of financial products.
 They can charge a percentage of your assets they’re investing.
 They can charge by the hour.
The following sections help you differentiate among the three main types of
financial planners.
Commission-based “planners”
Commission-based planners aren’t really planners, advisors, or counselors at
all — they’re salespeople. Many stockbrokers and insurance brokers are now
called financial consultants or financial service representatives in order to
glamorize the profession and obscure how they’re compensated. Ditto for
insurance salespeople calling themselves estate planning specialists.
A stockbroker referring to himself as a financial consultant is like a Honda
dealer calling himself a transportation consultant. A Honda dealer is a sales-
person who makes a living selling Hondas — period. He’s definitely not going
to tell you nice things about Ford, Chrysler, or Toyota cars — unless, of
course, he happens to sell those, too. He also has no interest in educating
you about money-saving public-transit possibilities!
Salespeople and brokers masquerading as planners can have an enormous
self-interest when they push certain products, particularly those products
that pay generous commissions. Getting paid on commission tends to skew
their recommendations toward certain strategies (such as buying investment
or life-insurance products) and to cause them to ignore or downplay other
aspects of your finances. For example, they’ll gladly sell you an investment
rather than persuade you to pay off your high-interest debts or save and
invest through your employer’s retirement plan, thereby reducing your taxes.
Table 18-1 gives you an idea of the commissions that a financial planner/
salesperson can earn by selling particular financial products.

Percentage-of-assets-under-management advisors
A financial advisor who charges a percentage of the assets that are being
managed or invested is generally a better choice than a commission-based
planner. This compensation system removes the incentive to sell you prod-
ucts with high commissions and initiate lots of transactions (to generate
more of those commissions).
The fee-based system is an improvement over product-pushers working on
commission, but it has flaws, too. Suppose that you’re trying to decide
whether to invest in stocks, bonds, or real estate. A planner who earns her
living managing your money likely won’t recommend real estate, because that
will deplete your investment capital. The planner also won’t recommend
paying down your mortgage for the same reason — she’ll claim that you can
earn more investing your money (with her help, of course) than it’ll cost you
to borrow.
Fee-based planners are also only interested in managing the money of those
who have already accumulated a fair amount of it — which rules out most
people. Many have minimums of $250,000, $500,000, or more.
Hourly-based advisors
Your best bet for professional help with your personal finances is an advisor
who charges for his time. Because he doesn’t sell any financial products, his
objectivity is maintained. He doesn’t perform money management, so he can
help you make comprehensive financial decisions with loans, retirement plan-
ning, and the selection of good investments, including real estate, mutual
funds, and small business.
368
Part V: Where to Go for More Help 

Hiring someone incompetent is the primary risk you face when selecting an
hourly-based planner. So be sure to check references and find out enough
about finances on your own to discern between good and bad financial
advice. Another risk comes from not clearly defining the work to be done 
and the approximate total cost (consider getting this all in writing) of the
planner’s service before you begin. You should also review some of the other
key questions that I outline in “Interviewing Financial Advisors: Asking the
Right Questions,” later in this chapter.
An entirely different kind of drawback occurs when you don’t follow through
on your advisor’s recommendations. You paid for his work but didn’t act on
it, so you didn’t capture its value. If part of the reason you hired the planner
in the first place was that you’re too busy or not interested enough to make
changes to your financial situation, look for this type of support in the ser-
vices you buy from the planner.
If you just need someone to act as a sounding board for ideas or to recom-
mend a specific strategy or product, you can hire an hourly-based planner for
one or two sessions of advice. You save money doing the legwork and imple-
mentation on your own. Just make sure that the planner is willing to give you
specific advice so that you can properly implement the strategy.
Deciding Whether to Hire 
a Financial Planner
If you’re like most people, you don’t need to hire a financial planner, but you
may benefit from hiring some help at certain times in your life. Good reasons for
hiring a financial planner can be similar to the reasons you have for hiring some-
one to clean your home or do your taxes. If you’re too busy, you don’t enjoy
doing it, or you’re terribly uncomfortable making decisions on your own, using a
planner for a second opinion makes good sense. And if you shy away from num-
bers and bristle at the thought of long division, a good planner can help you.
How a good financial advisor can help
The following list gives you a rundown of some of the important things a
competent financial planner can assist you with:
 Identifying problems and goals: Many otherwise intelligent people have
a hard time being objective about their financial problems. They may
ignore their debts or have unrealistic goals and expectations given their
financial situations and behaviors. And many are so busy with other
369
Chapter 18: Working with Financial Planners

aspects of their lives that they never take the time to think about what
their financial goals are. A good financial planner can give you the objec-
tive perspective you need.
Surprisingly, some people are in a better financial position than they
thought they were in relation to their goals. Good counselors really
enjoy this aspect of their jobs — good news is easier and much more fun
to deliver.
 Identifying strategies for reaching your financial goals: Your mind may
be a jumble of various plans, ideas, and concerns, along with a cobweb
or two. A good planner can help you sort out your thoughts and propose
alternative strategies for you to consider as you work to accomplish
your financial goals.
 Setting priorities: You may be doing dozens of things to improve your
financial situation, but making just a few key changes will likely have the
greatest value. Identifying the changes that fit your overall situation and
that won’t keep you awake at night is equally important. Good planners
help you prioritize.
 Saving research time and hassle: Even if you know what major financial
decisions are most important to you, doing the research can be time-
consuming and frustrating if you don’t know where to turn for good infor-
mation and advice. A good planner does research to match your needs to
the best available strategies and products. So much lousy information on
various financial topics is out there that you can easily get lost, discour-
aged, sidetracked, or swindled. A good advisor can prevent you from
making a bad decision based on poor or insufficient information.
 Purchasing commission-free financial products: When you hire a plan-
ner who charges for her time, you can easily save hundreds or thou-
sands of dollars by avoiding the cost of commissions in the financial
products you buy. Purchasing commission-free is especially valuable
when you purchase investments and insurance.
 Providing an objective voice for major decisions: When you’re trying
to figure out when to retire, how much to spend on a home purchase,
and where to invest your money, you’re faced with some big decisions.
Getting swept up in the emotions of these issues can cloud your per-
spective. A competent and sensitive advisor can help you cut through
the cloud and provide you with sound counsel.
 Helping you to just do it: Deciding what you need to do is not enough —
you have to actually do it. And although you can use a planner for
advice and then make all the changes on your own, a good counselor
can help you follow through with your plan. After all, part of the reason
you hired the advisor in the first place may be that you’re too busy or
uninterested to manage your finances.
 Mediating: If you have a spouse or partner, financial decisions can pro-
duce real fireworks — particularly financial decisions involving the
extended family. Although a counselor can’t be a therapist, a good one can
370
Part V: Where to Go for More Help 

be sensitive to the different needs and concerns of each party and can try
to find middle ground on the financial issues you’re grappling with.
 Making you money and allowing you peace of mind: The whole point
of professional financial planning is to help you make the most of your
money and plan for and attain your financial and personal goals. In the
process, the financial planner should show you how to enhance your
investment returns; reduce your spending, taxes, and insurance costs;
increase your savings; improve your catastrophic-insurance coverage;
and achieve your financial-independence goals. Putting your financial
house in order should take some weight off your mind — like that clean,
lightheaded feeling after a haircut.
Why advisors aren’t for everyone
Finding a good financial planner isn’t easy, so make sure that you want to hire
an advisor before you venture out in search of a competent one.
You should also consider your personality type before you decide to hire
help. My experience has been that some people (believe it or not) enjoy the
research and number-crunching. If this sounds like you, or if you’re not really
comfortable taking advice, you may be better off doing your own homework
and creating your own plan.
If you have a specific tax or legal matter, you may be better off hiring a good
professional who specializes in that specific field rather than hiring a financial
planner.
The Frustrations of Finding 
Good Financial Planners
Overwhelmed consumers, especially those in low- and middle-income brackets,
have few attractive options when hiring financial help. The vast majority of the
people who call themselves financial planners and financial consultants sell
products and work on commission, which creates enormous conflicts of interest.
The conflicts of interest stem from the fact that the broker has an incentive to
recommend strategies and sell products that pay generous commissions and
to ignore strategies and products that pay no or low commissions.
The few financial advisors who are fee-only make most of their fees from
money-management services. (Fee-only or fee-based means that the advisors’
fees are paid by their clients, not by companies whose products they recom-
mend.) Thus, fee-based advisors tend to focus on clients who have already
accumulated significant wealth. Fee-based advisors may also have conflicts of
371
Chapter 18: Working with Financial Planners

interest in that they gravitate toward strategies and recommendations that
involve their ongoing management of your money, and they may ignore or
dismiss tactics that diminish the pool of investment money they can manage
for you for an ongoing fee.
The following sections describe some of the problems associated with finding
a good planner.
Recognizing conflicts of interest
All professions have conflicts of interest. Some fields have more than others,
and the financial-planning field is one of those fields. Knowing where some 
of the land mines are located can certainly help. Here, then, are the most
common reasons that planners may not have 20/20 vision when giving 
financial directions.
Selling and pushing products that pay commissions
If a financial planner isn’t charging you a fee for her time, you can rest
assured that she’s earning commissions on the products she tries to sell you.
To sell financial products, this planner needs a broker’s license. A person
who sells financial products and then earns commissions from those prod-
ucts is a salesperson, not a financial planner. Financial planning done well
involves taking an objective, holistic look at your financial puzzle to deter-
mine which pieces fit it well — something brokers are neither trained nor
financially motivated to do.
To make discerning a planner’s agenda even harder, you can’t assume that
planners who charge fees for their time don’t also earn commissions selling
products. This compensation double dipping is common.
Selling products that provide a commission tends to skew a planner’s recom-
mendations. Products that carry commissions result in fewer of your dollars
going to the investments and insurance you buy. Because a commission is
earned only when a product is sold, such a product or service is inevitably
more attractive in the planner’s eyes than other options. For example, con-
sider the case of a planner who sells disability insurance that you can obtain
at a lower cost through your employer or a group trade association (see
Chapter 16). She may overlook or criticize your most attractive option
(buying through your employer) and focus on her most attractive option —
selling you a higher-cost disability policy on which she derives a commission.
Another danger of trusting the recommendation of a commission-based plan-
ner is that she may steer you toward the products that have the biggest pay-
back for her. These products are among the worst for you because they
siphon off even more of your money upfront to pay the commission. They
also tend to be among the costliest and riskiest financial products available.
372
Part V: Where to Go for More Help 

Planners who are commission-greedy may also try to churn your investments.
They encourage you to buy and sell at the drop of a hat, attributing the need
to changes in the economy or the companies you invested in. More trading
means more commissions for the broker.
Taking a narrow view
Because of the way they earn their money, many planners are biased in favor
of certain strategies and products. As a result, they typically don’t keep your
overall financial needs in mind. For example, if you have a problem with accu-
mulated consumer debts, some planners may never know (or care) because
they’re focused on selling you an investment product. Likewise, a planner
who sells a lot of life insurance tends to develop recommendations that
require you to purchase it.
Not recommending saving through your employer’s retirement plan
Taking advantage of saving through your employer’s retirement savings plan(s)
is one of your best financial options. Although this method of saving may not
be as exciting as risking your money in cattle futures, it’s not as dull as watch-
ing paint dry — and most importantly, it’s tax-deductible. Some planners are
reluctant to recommend taking full advantage of this option: It doesn’t leave
much money for the purchase of their commission-laden investment products.
373
Chapter 18: Working with Financial Planners
“Financial planning” in banks
Over recent decades, banks have witnessed an
erosion of the money in their coffers and vaults
because increasing numbers of investors real-
ized that banks are generally lousy places to
build wealth. The highest-yielding bank savings
accounts and certificates of deposit barely keep
an investor ahead of inflation. If you factor in
both inflation and taxes, these bank “invest-
ments” provide no real growth on your invest-
ment dollars.
Increasingly, banks have “financial representa-
tives” and “investment specialists” sitting in
their branches, waiting to pounce on bank cus-
tomers with big balances. In many banks, these
“financial planners” are simply brokers who are
out to sell investments that pay them (and the
bank) hefty sales commissions.
Although you may expect your bank account
balances to be confidential and off-limits to the
eager eyes of investment salespeople in banks,
numerous studies have demonstrated that
banks are betraying customer trust.
Customers often have no idea that these bank
reps are earning commissions and that those
commissions are being siphoned out of cus-
tomers’ investment dollars. Many customers
are mistaken (partly due to the banks’ and
salespeople’s poor disclosure) in believing that
these investments, like bank savings accounts,
are FDIC-insured and cannot lose value.

Ignoring debts
Sometimes paying off outstanding loans — such as credit card, auto, or even
mortgage debts — is your best investment option. But most financial plan-
ners don’t recommend this strategy because paying down debts depletes the
capital with which you could otherwise buy investments — the investments
that the broker may be trying to sell you to earn a commission or that the
advisor would like to manage for an ongoing fee.
Not recommending real estate and small business investments
Investing in real estate and small business, like paying off debts, takes money
away from your investing elsewhere. Most planners won’t help with these
choices. They may even tell you tales of real-estate- and small-business-
investing disasters to try to give you cold feet.
The value of real estate can go down just like any other investment. But over
the long haul, owning real estate makes good financial sense for most people.
With small business, the risks are higher, but so are the potential returns.
Don’t let a financial planner convince you that these options are foolish — 
in fact, if you do your homework and know what you’re doing, you can make
higher rates of return investing in real estate and small business than you can
in traditional securities such as stocks and bonds. See Part III to read more
about your options.
Selling ongoing money-management services
The vast majority of financial planners who don’t work on commission make
their money by managing your money for an ongoing fee percentage (typically
1 to 2 percent of your investment annually). Although this fee removes the
incentive to churn your account (frequently trade your investments) to run up
more commissions, the service is something that you’re unlikely to need. (As I
explain in Part III, you can hire professional money managers for less.)
An ongoing fee percentage still creates a conflict of interest; the financial
planner will tend to steer you away from beneficial financial strategies that
reduce the asset pool from which he derives his percentage. Financial strate-
gies such as maximizing contributions to your employer’s retirement savings
plan, paying off debts like your mortgage, investing in real estate or small
business, and so on may make the most sense for you. Advisors who work on
a percentage-of-assets-under-management basis may be biased against such
strategies.
Selling legal services
Some planners are in the business of drawing up trusts and providing other
estate-planning services for their clients. Although these and other legal doc-
uments may be right for you, legal matters are complex enough that the com-
petence of someone who isn’t a full-time legal specialist should be carefully
scrutinized. And lower-cost options may be available if your situation is not
complicated.
374
Part V: Where to Go for More Help 

If you need help determining whether you need these legal documents, do a
little investigating: Do some additional reading or consult an advisor who
won’t actually perform the work. If you do ultimately hire someone to per-
form estate-planning services for you, make sure that you hire someone who
specializes and works at it full time. See Chapter 17 to find out more about
estate planning.
Scaring you unnecessarily
Some planners put together nifty computer-generated projections that show
you that you’re going to need millions of dollars by the time you retire to
maintain your standard of living or that show that tuition will cost hundreds
of thousands of dollars by the time your 2-year-old is ready for college.
Waking up a client to the realities of his or her financial situation is an impor-
tant and difficult job for good financial planners. But some planners take this
task to an extreme, deliberately scaring you into buying what they’re selling.
They paint a bleak picture and imply that you can fix your problems only if
you do what they say. Don’t let them scare you; read this book and get your
financial life in order.
Creating dependency
Many financial planners create dependency by making things seem so compli-
cated that their clients feel as though they could never manage their finances
on their own. If your advisor is reluctant to tell you how you can educate your-
self about personal money management, you probably have a self-perpetuating
consultant. Financial planning is hardly the only occupation guilty of this. As
author George Bernard Shaw put it, “All professions are conspiracies against
the laity.”
Regulatory problems
The financial-planning field has a problem when it comes to oversight.
Oversight is minimal at best. In many states, anyone can hang out a shingle
and call him- or herself a financial planner. The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) polices only those financial planners who provide invest-
ment advice/management on a regular basis and oversee more than $25 mil-
lion; these advisors must register with the SEC as registered investment
advisors (RIAs). The SEC provides no oversight of planners who don’t pro-
vide investment advice/management.
States police the hundreds of thousands of people who call themselves finan-
cial planners. But most states have done little to monitor planners and pro-
tect consumers. Thus, as the nonprofit Consumer Federation of America said
in its assessment of the industry, “Today’s investors go up against a deadly
combination of abusive securities industry practices and regulatory inatten-
tiveness when investing their money.”
375
Chapter 18: Working with Financial Planners

Finding a Good Financial Planner
Locating a good financial planner who is willing to work with the not-yet-rich-
and-famous and who doesn’t have conflicts of interest can be like trying to
find a needle in a haystack. Personal referrals and associations are two meth-
ods that can serve as good starting points.
Soliciting personal referrals
Getting a personal referral from a satisfied customer you trust is one of the
best ways to find a good financial planner. Obtaining a referral from an
accountant or attorney whose judgment you tested can help as well. (Beware
that such professionals in other fields may also do some financial planning
and recommend themselves.)
The best financial planners continue to build their practices through word of
mouth. Satisfied customers are a professional’s best and least costly mar-
keters. However, you should never take a recommendation from anyone as
gospel. I don’t care who is making the referral — even if it’s your mother or
the pope. You must do your homework. Ask the planner the questions I list in
the upcoming section “Interviewing Financial Advisors: Asking the Right
Questions.” I’ve seen people get into real trouble because of blindly accepting
someone else’s recommendation. Remember that the person making the rec-
ommendation is (probably) not a financial expert. He or she may be just as
bewildered as you are.
You may get referred to a planner or broker who returns the favor by sending
business to the tax, legal, or real estate person who referred you. On more
than a few occasions, professionals in other fields have made it clear that
they would refer business to me if I referred business to them. I refused, of
course. Good professionals don’t agree to scratch each others’ backs. Hire
professionals who make referrals to others based on their competence and
ethics.
Seeking advisors through associations
Associations of financial planners are more than happy to refer you to plan-
ners in your area. But as I discuss earlier in this chapter, the major trade
associations are composed of planners who sell products and work on 
commission.

Chapter 18: Working with Financial Planners
Warning signs in planners’ cultivation techniques
The channel through which you hear of a plan-
ner may provide clues to the planner’s integrity
and way of doing business. Beware of planners
you find (or who find you) through these avenues:
 Cold calling: You’ve just come home after a
hard day. No sooner has your posterior hit
the recliner to settle in for the night when
the phone rings. It’s Joe the financial plan-
ner, and he wants to help you achieve all
your financial dreams. Cold calling (the
salesperson calls you, without an appoint-
ment) is the most inefficient way for a plan-
ner to get new clients. Cold calling is
intrusive, and it’s typically used by aggres-
sive salespeople who work on commission.
Keep a log beside your telephone. Record
the date, time, name of the organization,
and name of the caller every time you
receive a cold call. Politely but firmly tell
cold callers to never call you again. Then, if
they do call you again, you can sue them for
$500 in small claims court!
 Adult education classes: Here’s what often
happens at the adult education classes that
are offered at local universities: You pay a
reasonable fee for the course. You go to
class giddy at the prospect of learning how
to manage your finances. And then the
instructor ends up being a broker or financial
planner hungry for clients. He confuses more
than he conveys. He’s short on specifics. But
he’s more than happy to show you the way if
you contact (and hire) him outside of class.
The instructors for these courses are paid
to teach. They don’t need to solicit clients in
class, and, in fact, it’s unethical for them to
do so. I should note, however, that part of
the problem is that some universities take
advantage of the fact that such “teachers”
want to solicit business, setting the pay at a
low level. So never assume that someone
who is teaching a financial-planning course
at a local college is ethical, competent, or
looking out for your best interests. Although
I may sound cynical, assume that these
people are none of the above until they
clearly prove otherwise.
Ethical instructors who are there to teach
do not solicit clients. In fact, they may
actively discourage students from hiring
them. Smart universities pay their instruc-
tors well and weed out the instructors who
are more interested in building up their
client base than they are in teaching.
 “Free” seminars: This is a case of “you get
what you pay for.” Because you don’t pay a
fee to attend “free seminars” and the “teach-
ers” don’t get paid either, these events tend to
be clear-cut sales pitches. The “instructor”
may share some information, but smart semi-
nar leaders know that the goal of a successful
seminar is to establish himself or herself as an
expert and to whet the prospects’ appetites.
Note: Be wary of seminars targeted at select
groups, such as special seminars for people
who have received retirement-plan distribu-
tions or seminars touting “Financial Planning
for Women.” Financial planning is not spe-
cific to gender, ethnicity, or marital status.
Don’t assume that the financial planner
giving a presentation at your employer’s
office is the right planner for you, either. You
may be surprised at how little some corpo-
rate benefits departments investigate the
people they let in. In most cases, planners
are accepted simply because they don’t
charge. One organization I’m familiar with
gave preference to planners who, in addi-
tion to doing free presentations, also
brought in a catered lunch! Guess what —
this preference attracted a lot of brokers
who sell high-commission products.

Here are three solid places to start searching for good financial planners:
 The National Association of Personal Financial Advisors: The NAPFA
(800-366-2732; www.napfa.org) is made up of fee-only planners. Its
members are not supposed to earn commissions from products they sell
or recommend. However, most planners in this association earn their
living by providing money-management services and charging a fee that
is a percentage of assets under management. And most have minimums,
which can put them out of reach of the majority of people.
 The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants: The AICPA
(888-999-9256; www.cpapfs.org) is the professional association of
CPAs that can provide names of members who have completed the
Institute’s Personal Financial Specialist (PFS) program. Many of the CPAs
who have completed the PFS program provide financial advice on a fee
basis. Competent CPAs have the advantage of understanding the tax
consequences of different choices, which are important components of
any financial plan. On the other hand, it can be hard for a professional to
keep current in two broad fields.
 Garrett Planning Network: This for-profit company (www.garrett
planningnetwork.com) has developed a system for screening plan-
ners who focus on providing advice on an hourly, as needed basis with
clients. Established in 2000, they have about 250 member planners
throughout the U.S. Member planners have a variety of credentials 
and training including CFPs, Ph.D.s, MBAs, and CFAs. To join, planners
must pay a $7,500 initiation fee and $1,200 annually thereafter.
Interviewing Financial Advisors: 
Asking the Right Questions
Don’t consider hiring a financial advisor until you read the rest of this book. If
you’re not educated about personal finance, how can you possibly evaluate
the competence of someone you may hire to help you make important finan-
cial decisions?
I firmly believe that you are your own best financial advisor. However, I 
know that some people don’t want to make financial decisions without get-
ting assistance. Perhaps you’re busy or simply can’t stand making money
decisions.
You need to recognize that you have a lot at stake when you hire a financial
advisor. Besides the cost of his services, which generally don’t come cheap,
you’re placing a lot of trust in his recommendations. The more you know, the
better the advisor you end up working with, and the fewer services you need
to buy.
378
Part V: Where to Go for More Help 

The following questions will help you get to the core of an advisor’s compe-
tence and professional integrity. Get answers to these questions before you
decide to hire a financial advisor.
What percentage of your income comes
from clients’ fees versus commissions?
Asking this question first may save you the trouble and time of asking the
next nine questions. The right answer is “100 percent of my income comes
from fees paid by clients.” Anything less than 100 percent means that the
person you’re speaking to is a salesperson with a vested interest in recom-
mending certain strategies and products.
Sadly, more than a few financial advisors don’t tell the truth. In an under-
cover investigation done by Money magazine, nearly one-third of advisors
who claimed that they were fee-only turned out to be brokers who also sold
investment and insurance products on a commission basis.
How can you ferret these people out? Advisors who provide investment
advice and oversee at least $25 million must register with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC); otherwise, they generally must register
with the state that they make their principal place of business. They must 
file Form ADV, otherwise known as the Uniform Application for Investment
Adviser Registration. This lengthy document asks for the following specific
information from investment advisors:
 A breakdown of where their income comes from
 Relationships and affiliations with other companies
 Education and employment history
 The types of securities the advisory firm recommends
 The advisor’s fee schedule
In short, Form ADV provides — in black and white — answers to all the
essential questions. With a sales pitch over the phone or marketing materials
sent in the mail, a planner is much more likely to gloss over or avoid certain
issues. Although some advisors fib on Form ADV, most advisors are more
truthful on this form than they are in their own marketing.
You can ask the advisor to send you a copy of Form ADV. You can also find
out whether the advisor is registered and whether he or she has a track
record of problems by calling the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) at 800-732-0330 or by visiting its Web site at www.sec.gov. You can
also contact the department that oversees investment advisors in your state.
379
Chapter 18: Working with Financial Planners

What percentage of fees paid by clients 
is for ongoing money management versus
hourly financial planning?
The answer to how the advisor is paid provides clues to whether he has an
agenda to convince you to hire him to manage your money. If you want objec-
tive and specific financial planning recommendations, give preference to
advisors who derive their income from hourly fees. Many counselors and
advisors call themselves “fee-based,” which usually means that they make
their living managing money for a percentage.
If you want a money manager, you can hire the best quite inexpensively
through a mutual fund. Or if you have substantial assets, you can hire an
established money manager (refer to Chapter 10).
What is your hourly fee?
The rates for financial advisors range from as low as $75 per hour all the way
up to several hundred dollars per hour. If you shop around, you can find ter-
rific planners who charge around $100 to $150 per hour.
As you compare planners, remember that what matters is the total cost that
you can expect to pay for the services you’re seeking.
Do you also perform tax or legal services?
Be wary of someone who claims to be an expert beyond one area. The tax,
legal, and financial fields are vast in and of themselves, and they’re difficult
for even the best and brightest advisor to cover simultaneously.
One exception is the accountant who also performs some basic financial
planning by the hour. Likewise, a good financial advisor should have a solid
grounding in the basic tax and legal issues that relate to your personal
finances. Large firms may have specialists available in different areas.
What work and educational experience
qualifies you to be a financial planner?
This question doesn’t have one right answer. Ideally, a planner should have
experience in the business or financial services field. Some say to look for
planners with at least five or ten years of experience. I’ve always wondered
380
Part V: Where to Go for More Help 

how planners earn a living their first five or ten years if folks won’t hire them
until they reach these benchmarks! A good planner should also be good with
numbers, speak in plain English, and have good interpersonal skills.
Education is sort of like food. Too little leaves you hungry. Too much can
leave you feeling stuffed and uncomfortable. And a small amount of high
quality is better than a lot of low quality.
Because investment decisions are a critical part of financial planning, take note
of the fact that the most-common designations of educational training among
professional money managers are MBA (master of business administration)
and CFA (chartered financial analyst). And some tax advisors who work on an
hourly basis have the PFS (personal financial specialist) credential.
Have you ever sold limited partnerships?
Options? Futures? Commodities?
The correct answers here are no, no, no, and no. If you don’t know what these
disasters are, refer to Chapter 9. You also need to be wary of any financial
advisor who used to deal in these areas but now claims to have seen the light
and reformed his ways.
Professionals with poor judgment may not repeat the same mistakes, but
they’re more likely to make some new ones at your expense. My experience is
that even advisors who have been “reformed” are unlikely to be working by
the hour. Most of them either work on commission or want to manage your
money for a hefty fee.
Do you carry liability (errors 
and omissions) insurance?
Some counselors may be surprised by this question or think that you’re a
problem customer looking for a lawsuit. On the other hand, accidents
happen; that’s why insurance exists. So if the planner doesn’t have liability
insurance, she missed one of the fundamental concepts of planning: Insure
against risk. Don’t make the mistake of hiring her.
You wouldn’t (and shouldn’t) let contractors into your home to do work 
without knowing that they have insurance to cover any mistakes they make.
Likewise, you should insist on hiring a planner who carries protection in case
she makes a major mistake for which she is liable. Make sure that she carries
enough coverage given what she is helping you with.
381
Chapter 18: Working with Financial Planners

Can you provide references from clients
with needs similar to mine?
Take the time to talk to other people who have used the planner. Ask what
the planner did for them, and find out what the advisor’s greatest strengths
and weaknesses are. You can learn a bit about the planner’s track record and
style. And because you want to have as productive a relationship as possible
with your planner, the more you find out about him, the easier it’ll be for you
to hit the ground running if you hire him.
Some financial advisors offer a “complimentary” introductory consultation. If
an advisor offers a free consultation to allow you to check him out and it
makes you feel more comfortable about hiring him, fair enough. But be care-
ful: Most free consultations end up being a big sales pitch for certain prod-
ucts or services the advisor offers.
The fact that a planner doesn’t offer a free consultation may be a good sign.
Counselors who are busy and who work strictly by the hour can’t afford to
burn an hour of their time for an in-person free session. They also need to be
careful of folks seeking free advice. Such advisors usually are willing to spend
some time on the phone answering background questions. They should also
be able to send background materials by mail and provide references.
Will you provide specific strategies and
product recommendations that I can
implement on my own if I choose?
This is an important question. Some advisors may indicate that you can 
hire them by the hour. But then they provide only generic advice without
specifics. Some planners even double dip — they charge an hourly fee initially
to make you feel like you’re not working with a salesperson, and then they try
selling commission-based products. Also be aware of advisors who say that
you can choose to implement their recommendations on your own and then
recommend financial products that carry commissions.
How is implementation handled?
Ideally, you should find an advisor who lets you choose whether you want to
hire him to help with implementation after the recommendations have been
presented to you. If you know that you’re going to follow through on the
advice and you can do so without further discussions and questions, don’t
hire the planner to help you implement his recommendations.
382
Part V: Where to Go for More Help 

On the other hand, if you hire the counselor because you lack the time,
desire, and/or expertise to manage your financial life in the first place, build-
ing implementation into the planning work makes good sense.
Learning from Others’ Mistakes
Over the many years that I’ve worked as a financial counselor and now field-
ing questions from readers, I hear too many problems that people encounter
from hiring incompetent and unethical financial advisors. To avoid repeating
others’ mistakes, please remember the following:
 You absolutely must do your homework before hiring any financial advi-
sor. Despite recommendations from others about a particular advisor,
you can end up with bad advice from biased advisors.
 The financial planning and brokerage fields are minefields for con-
sumers. The fundamental problem is the enormous conflict of interest
that is created when “advisors” sell products that earn them sales com-
missions. Selling ongoing money management services creates a conflict
of interest as well.
Imagine that you have flu symptoms. Would you be comfortable seeing a
physician who didn’t charge for office visits but instead made money
only by selling you drugs? Maybe you don’t need the drugs — or at least
not so many expensive ones. Maybe what you really need is Mom’s
chicken soup and ten hours of sleep.
 The more you know, and the more you understand that investing and
other financial decisions needn’t be complicated, the more you realize
that you don’t need to spend gobs of money (or any money at all) on
financial planners and advisors. When you look in the mirror, you see
the person who has your best interests at heart and is your best finan-
cial advisor.

Chapter 19
Computer Money Management
In This Chapter
 Evaluating the different types of software and Web sites
 Performing financial tasks with your computer
A
lthough a computer may be able to assist you with your personal
finances, it simply represents one of many tools. Computers are best for
performing routine tasks (such as processing lots of bills or performing many
calculations) more quickly and for aiding you with research.
This chapter gives you an overview of how to use software and cyberspace
as you work with your finances. I tell you how to use this technology to pay
your bills, prepare taxes, research investments, plan for retirement, trade
securities, buy insurance, and plan your estate, and I direct you to the best
software and Web sites.
Surveying Software and Web Sites
You can access two major repositories of personal finance information through
your computer. Although the lines are sometimes a bit blurry between these
two categories, they’re roughly defined as software and the Internet:
 Software refers to computer programs that are either packaged in a box
or DVD case or are available to be downloaded online. Most of the mass-
marketed financial software packages sell for under $100. If you’ve ever
used a word-processing program such as Word or WordPerfect or a
spreadsheet program such as Excel, then you’ve used software.
 The Internet is a vast ocean of information that you can generally access
via a modem, cable modem, or DSL (digital subscriber line). These
devices allow your computer to talk with other computers. To access
the Internet, you need a Web browser, which you can obtain through
your Internet service provider (ISP). Most of the financial stuff on the
Internet is supplied by companies marketing their wares and, hence, is
available for free. Some sites sell their content for a fee.

Adding up financial software benefits
Although the number of personal-finance software packages and Web sites is
large and growing, quality is having a hard time keeping up, especially among
the free Internet sites. The best software can
 Guide you to better organization and management of your personal
finances
 Help you complete mundane tasks or complex calculations more quickly
and easily and provide basic advice in unfamiliar territory
 Make you feel in control of your financial life
Mediocre and bad software, on the other hand, can make you feel stupid or,
at the very least, make you want to tear your hair out. Lousy packages usu-
ally end up in the software graveyard.
Having reviewed many of the packages available, I can assure you that if
you’re having a hard time with some of the programs out there (and some-
times even with the more useful programs), you’re not at fault. Too many
packages assume that you already know things such as your tax rate, your
mortgage options, and the difference between stock and bond mutual funds.
Much of what’s out there is too technically oriented and isn’t user-friendly.
Some of it is even flawed in its financial accuracy.
A good software package, like a good tax or financial advisor, should help you
better manage your finances. It should simply and concisely explain financial
terminology, and it should help you make decisions by offering choices and
recommendations, allowing you to “play” with alternatives before following a
particular course of action.
With increasing regularity, financial software packages are being designed to
perform more than one task or to address more than one area of personal
finances. But remember that no software package covers the whole range of
issues in your financial life. Later in this chapter, I recommend some of my
favorite financial software.
Treading carefully on the Web
Like the information you receive from any medium, you have to sift out the
good from the bad when you surf the Internet. If you blindly navigate the
Internet and you naively think that everything out there is useful “informa-
tion,” “research,” or “objective advice,” you’re going to be in for a rude 
awakening.
386
Part V: Where to Go for More Help 

Most personal-finance sites on the Internet are free, which — guess what —
means that these sites are basically advertising or are dominated and driven
by advertising. If you’re looking for written material by unbiased experts or
writers — well — you can find some on the Web, but you’ll find far more
biased and uninformed stuff.
Consider the source so you can recognize bias
A report on the Internet published by a leading investment-banking firm pro-
vides a list of the “coolest finance” sites. On the list is the Web site of a major
bank. Because it’s been a long time since I was in junior high school, I’m not
quite sure what “cool” means anymore. If cool can be used to describe a well-
organized and graphically pleasing Web site, then I guess I can say that the
bank’s site is cool.
However, if you’re looking for sound information and advice, then the bank’s
site is decidedly “uncool.” It steers you in a financial direction that benefits
(not surprisingly) the bank and not you. For example, in the real-estate sec-
tion, users are asked to plug in their gross monthly income and down pay-
ment. The information is then used to spit out the supposed amount that
users can “afford” to spend on a home. No mention is given to the other
financial goals and concerns — such as saving for retirement — that affect
one’s ability to spend a particular amount of money on a home.
Consider this advice in the lending area of the site: “When you don’t have 
the cash on hand for important purchases, we can help you borrow what 
you need. From a new car, to that vacation you’ve been longing for, to new
kitchen appliances, you can make these dreams real now.” Click on a button
at the bottom of this screen — and presto, you’re on your way to racking up
credit card and auto debt. Why bother practicing delayed gratification, living
within your means, or buying something used if getting a loan is “easy” and
comes with “special privileges”?
Watch out for “sponsored” content
“Sponsored” content, a euphemism for advertising under the guise of editor-
ial content, is another problem to watch out for on Web sites. You may find a
disclaimer or note, which is often buried in small print in an obscure part of
the Web site, saying that an article is sponsored by (in other words, paid
advertising by) the “author.”
For example, one mutual-fund site states that its “primary purpose is to 
provide viewers with an independent guide that contains information and
articles they can’t get anywhere else.” The “content” of the site suggests oth-
erwise. In the “Expert’s Corner” section of the site, material is reprinted from
a newsletter that advocates frequent trading in and out of mutual funds to
time market moves. Turns out that the article is “sponsored by the featured
expert”: In other words, it’s a paid advertisement. (The track record of the
newsletter’s past recommendations, which isn’t discussed on the site, is
poor.)
387
Chapter 19: Computer Money Management

Steer clear of biased financial-planning advice
I also suggest skipping the financial-planning advice offered by financial ser-
vice companies that are out to sell you something. Such companies can’t take
the necessary objective, holistic view required to render useful advice.
For example, on one major mutual-fund company’s Web site, you find a good
deal of material on the company’s mutual funds. The site’s college-planning
advice is off the mark because it urges parents to put money in a custodial
account in the child’s name. Ignored is the fact that this will undermine your
child’s ability to qualify for financial aid (see Chapter 13), that your child will
have control of the money at either age 18 or 21 depending upon your state,
and that you’re likely better off funding your employer’s retirement plan. If
you did that, though, you couldn’t set up a college savings-plan account at
the fund company, which this area of the site prods you to do.
Shun short-term thinking
Many financial Web sites provide real-time stock quotes as a hook to a site
that is cluttered with advertising. My experience working with individual
investors is that the more short-term they think, the worse they do. And
checking your portfolio during the trading day certainly promotes short-
term thinking.
Also, beware of tips offered around the electronic water cooler — message
boards. As in the real world, chatting with strangers and exchanging ideas is
sometimes fine. However, if you don’t know the identity and competence of
message-board posters or chat-room participants, why would you follow
their financial advice or stock tips? Getting ideas from various sources is
okay, but educate yourself and do your homework before making personal
financial decisions.
If you want to best manage your personal finances and find out more, remem-
ber that the old expression “You get what you pay for” contains a grain of
truth. Free information on the Internet, especially information provided by
companies in the financial-services industry, is largely self-serving. Stick with
information providers who have proven themselves offline or who don’t have
anything to sell except objective information and advice.
Accomplishing Computer Money Tasks
In the remainder of this chapter, I detail important personal financial tasks
that your computer can assist you with. I also provide my recommendations
for the best software and Web sites to help you accomplish these chores.
388
Part V: Where to Go for More Help 

Paying your bills and tracking your money
Checkbook software automates the process of paying your bills, and it can
track your check writing and prepare reports that detail your spending by
category so you can get a handle on where the fat in your budget is. One
drawback of using these programs to track your spending is that it captures
only what you enter. Thus, the amount and spending category of your indi-
vidual credit card and cash purchases, which for most people are substantial,
are omitted unless you enter such data (or get a credit card from the soft-
ware company, which allows you to download your credit card transactions
via your computer). For a complete discussion on how to track your spend-
ing, see Chapter 3.
Quicken and Microsoft Money are good programs that I’ve reviewed in 
this category. In addition to offering the printed checks and electronic bill-
payment features, both of these packages are financial organizers. The pro-
grams allow you to list your investments and other assets, along with your
loans and other financial liabilities.
In addition to the significant investment of time necessary to figure out how
to use the software program, another drawback is cost — computer checks
are pricey. If you order checks directly from the software manufacturers
(order forms come with your software), expect to pay about $95 plus ship-
ping costs for 500 checks. You can chop these costs in half by ordering from
other companies. Checks Tomorrow (www.checkstomorrow.com), for
example, sells 500 checks for $40 plus shipping costs.
You can avoid dealing with paper checks — written or printed — by signing up
for online bill payment. With such services, you save on stamps and envelopes,
and the cost of the service may be comparable to what you’re spending on
those supplies. Such services are available to anyone with a checking account
through an increasing number of banks, credit unions, and brokerage firms, as
well as through the checkbook programs. An intermediary company that
receives your electronic instructions and pays the bill for you enacts the ser-
vice. No more stamp sticking and envelope stuffing. You can even set up regu-
larly recurring bills to be paid automatically.
You don’t need a checkbook program to pay your bills online. Simply sign 
up through a financial institution offering the service. CheckFree’s Web site
(www.checkfree.com) can direct you to firms that offer its bill-paying ser-
vice. Because most online bill-payment services charge a minimum monthly
fee, you can find cheaper ways to avoid check writing and stamp sticking. For
example, some businesses that you must pay monthly allow you to establish
a monthly electronic payment service directly with them.

Chapter 19: Computer Money Management

Planning for retirement
Good retirement-planning software and online tools can help you plan for
retirement by crunching the numbers for you. But they can also teach you
how particular changes — such as your investment returns, rate of inflation,
or your savings rate — can affect when and in what style you can retire. The
biggest time-saving aspect of retirement-planning software and Web sites is
that they let you more quickly play with and see the consequences of chang-
ing the assumptions.
Some of the major investment companies I profile in Part III of this book are
sources for some high-quality, low-cost retirement-planning tools. Here are
some good ones to consider:
 T. Rowe Price’s Web site (www.troweprice.com) has several tools that
can help you determine where you stand in terms of reaching a given
retirement goal. T. Rowe Price (800-638-5660) also offers some excellent
workbooklets for helping you plan for retirement. The company’s
Retirement Planning Guide is for those who are more than five years
from retirement, and the Retirement Readiness Guide is intended for
people who are already retired or are within five years of retirement.
Expect some marketing of T. Rowe Price’s mutual funds in these booklets
and software.
 Vanguard’s Web site (www.vanguard.com) can help with figuring sav-
ings goals to reach retirement goals as well as with managing your
budget and assets in retirement.
Preparing your taxes
Good, properly used tax-preparation software can save you time and money.
The best programs “interview” you to gather the necessary information and
select the appropriate forms based on your responses. Of course, you’re still
the one responsible for locating all the information needed to complete your
return. More-experienced taxpayers can bypass the interview and jump
directly to the forms they know they need to complete. These programs also
help flag overlooked deductions and identify other tax-reducing strategies.
TurboTax and TaxCut are among the better tax-preparation programs I’ve
reviewed.
In addition to the federal tax packages, tax-preparation programs are avail-
able for state income taxes, too. Many state tax forms are fairly easy to com-
plete because they’re based on information from your federal form. If your
state tax forms are based on your federal form, you may want to just skip
buying the state income-tax preparation packages and prepare your state
return by hand.
390
Part V: Where to Go for More Help 

If you’re mainly looking for tax forms, you can get them at no charge in tax-
preparation books or through the IRS Web site (www.irs.gov).
Researching investments
Instead of schlepping off to the library and fighting over the favorite investing
reference manuals, ponying up hundreds of dollars to buy print versions for
your own use, or slogging through voice-mail hell when you call government
agencies, you can access a variety of materials on your computer. You can
also often pay for just what you need:
 Sec.gov: This site allows unlimited free access to Securities and
Exchange Commission documents. All public corporations, as well as
mutual funds, file their reports with the agency. Be aware, however, 
that navigating this site takes patience.
 Morningstar.com: This site provides access to Morningstar’s individ-
ual stock and mutual fund reports. The reports are free, but they’re
watered-down versions of the company’s comprehensive software and
paper products. If you want to buy Morningstar’s unabridged fund
reports online, you can do so for a fee.
 Vanguard.com: Although I’m leery of financial service company 
“educational” materials because of bias and self-serving advice, some
companies do a worthy job on these materials. The investor-friendly,
penny-pinching Vanguard Group of mutual funds has an online univer-
sity on its Web site, where investors can learn the basics of fund invest-
ing. Additionally, investors in Vanguard’s funds can access up-to-date
personal account information through the site.
Trading online
If you do your investing homework, trading securities online may save you
money and perhaps some time. For years, discount brokers (which I discuss
in Chapter 8) were heralded as the low-cost source for trading. Now, online
brokers such as E*TRADE Financial (800-822-2021; www.etrade.com) and
Scottrade (800-619-7283; www.scottrade.com) have set a new lower-cost
standard. The major mutual fund companies, such as T. Rowe Price and
Vanguard, also offer competitive online services.
A number of the newer discount brokers have built their securities brokerage
business around online trading. By eliminating the overhead of branch offices
and by accepting and processing trades by computer, online brokers keep
their costs and brokerage charges to a minimum. Cut-rate electronic broker-
age firms are for people who want to direct their own financial affairs and
don’t want or need to work with a personal broker. However, some of these
391
Chapter 19: Computer Money Management

brokers have limited products and services. For example, some don’t offer
many of the best mutual funds. And my own experience with reaching live
people at some online brokers has been trying — I’ve had to wait on hold for
more than ten minutes before a customer service representative answered
the call.
Although online trading may save you on transaction costs, it can also
encourage you to trade more than you should, resulting in higher total trad-
ing costs, lower investment returns, and higher income tax bills. Following
investments on a daily basis encourages you to think short term. Remember
that the best investments are bought and held for the long haul (see Part III
for more information).
Reading and searching periodicals
Many business and financial publications are online offering investors news
and financial market data. The Wall Street Journal provides an online person-
alized edition of the paper (online.wsj.com). You can tailor the content to
meet your specific needs. The cost is $99 per year ($49 if you’re already a
Journal subscriber).
Leading business publications such as Forbes (www.forbes.com) and
BusinessWeek (www.businessweek.com) put their current magazines’ con-
tent on the Internet. However, increasing numbers of publications are charg-
ing for archived articles and for some current content for nonsubscribers to
their print magazine. Be careful to take what you read and hear in the mass
media with many grains of salt (see Chapter 20 for more on mass media).
Much of the content revolves around tweaking people’s anxieties and
dwelling on the latest crises and fads.
Buying life insurance
If loved ones are financially dependent on you, you probably know that you
need some life insurance. But add together the dread of life-insurance salespeo-
ple and a fear of death, and you have a recipe for procrastination. Although
your computer can’t stave off the Grim Reaper, it can help you find a quality,
low-cost policy that can be more than 80 percent less costly than the most
expensive options, all without having you deal with high-pressure sales tactics.
The best way to shop for term life insurance online is through one of the quo-
tation services that I discuss in Chapter 16. At each of these sites, you fill in
your date of birth, whether you smoke, how much coverage you’d like, and
for how long you’d like to lock in the initial premium. When you’re done fill-
ing in this information, a new Web page pops up with a list of low-cost quotes
(based on assumed good health) from highly rated (for financial stability)
insurance companies.
392
Part V: Where to Go for More Help 

Invariably, the quotes are ranked by how cheap they are. Although cost is
certainly an important factor, many of these services don’t do as good of a
job explaining other important factors to consider when doing your compari-
son shopping. For example, the services sometimes don’t cover the projected
and maximum rates after the initial term has expired. Be sure to ask about
these other future rates before you agree to a specific policy.
If you decide to buy a policy from one of the online agencies, you can fill 
out an online application form. The quotation agency will then mail you a
detailed description of the policy and insurer, along with your completed
application. In addition to having to deal with snail mail, you’ll also have to
deal with a medical technician, who will drop by your home to check on your
health status . . . at least until some computer genius figures out a way for
you to give a blood and urine sample online!
Preparing legal documents
Just as you can prepare a tax return with the advice of a software program,
you can also prepare common legal documents. This type of software may
save you from the often difficult task of finding a competent and affordable
attorney.
Using legal software is generally preferable to using fill-in-the-blank docu-
ments. Software has the built-in virtues of directing and limiting your choices
and preventing you from making common mistakes. Quality software also
incorporates the knowledge and insights of the legal eagles who developed
the software. And it can save you money.
If your situation isn’t unusual, legal software may work well for you. As to the
legality of documents that you create with legal software, remember that a
will, for example, is made legal and valid by your witnesses; the fact that an
attorney prepares the document is not what makes it legal.
An excellent package for preparing your own will is Quicken WillMaker Plus,
which is published by Nolo, a name synonymous with high quality and user-
friendliness in the legal publishing world. In addition to allowing you to pre-
pare wills, WillMaker can also help you prepare a living will and medical
power of attorney document. The software also allows you to create a living
trust that serves to keep property out of probate in the event of your death
(see Chapter 17). Like wills, living trusts are fairly standard legal documents
that you can properly create with the guidance of a top-notch software pack-
age. The package advises you to seek professional guidance for your situa-
tion, if necessary.

 Recognizing the mass media’s impact on investors
 Deciding whether to tune in or tune out radio and television investing coverage
 Surfing safely for investing information on the Internet
 Evaluating newspapers and magazines
 Finding the best investing books
You don’t lack options when it comes to finding radio and television
news, Web sites, newspapers, magazines, and books that talk about
money and purport to help you get rich. Tuning out poor resources and
focusing on the best ones is the real challenge.
Because you probably don’t consider yourself a financial expert, more often
than not you won’t know who to believe and listen to. I help you solve that
problem in this chapter.
Observing the Mass Media
For better and for worse, America’s mass media has a profound influence on
our culture. On the good side, news is widely disseminated these days. So if a
product is recalled or a dangerous virus breaks out in your area, you’ll proba-
bly hear about it, perhaps more than you want to, through the media — or
perhaps from tuned-in family members!
The downsides of the mass media are plenty, though.
Alarming or informing us?
Imagine sitting down to watch the evening news and hearing the following
stock market report:

“On Wall Street today, stock prices dropped a bit less than 1 percent,
extending the market’s decline of the past week. The reason: More 
people wanted to sell than buy. For the year, the U.S. market is still 
up 15 percent, which is well above the historic average annual return 
of 10 percent.”
Now contrast that report with the following report for the same day:
“Stocks plunged sharply today as the Dow Jones Industrial Average plum-
meted more than 100 points to close at its lowest level in the past 168
hours. Dell Computer saw its shares get creamed 10 percent, as the com-
pany issued a profit warning that third-quarter revenues would take a 
big hit due to the Taiwan earthquake. Banking stocks got hammered
again, and the sector has been off more than 20 percent for the past 
three months.”
Although the second news report goes into more detail, it’s meant to be more
provocative and anxiety producing. Most of the daily stock market reports I
hear in the media sound more like the second report than they do the mun-
dane, calming first report. News producers, in their quest for ratings and
advertising dollars, try to be alarming. The more you watch, the more
unnerved you get over short-term, especially negative, events.
Teaching what kind of values?
Daily doses of American mass media, including all the advertising that comes
with it, essentially communicate the following messages to us:
 Your worth as a person is directly related to your physical appearance
(including the quality of clothing and jewelry you wear) and your mater-
ial possessions — cars, homes, electronics, and other gadgets.
 The more money you make, the more “successful” you clearly are.
 The more famous you are (especially as a movie or sports star), the
more you’re worth listening to and admiring.
 Don’t bother concerning yourself with the consequences before engag-
ing in negative behavior.
 Delaying gratification and making sacrifices is for boring losers.
Continually inundating yourself with poor messages can cause you to behave
in a way that undermines your long-term happiness and financial success.
Don’t support (by watching, listening, or reading) forms of media that don’t
reflect your values and morals.
396
Part V: Where to Go for More Help 

Worshipping prognosticating pundits
Quoting and interviewing experts is perhaps the only thing that the media
loves more than hyping short-term news events. What’s the economy going
to do next quarter? What’s stock XYZ going to do next month? What’s the
stock market going to do in the next hour? No, I’m not kidding about that 
last one — the stock market cable channel CNBC regularly interviews floor
traders from the New York Stock Exchange late in the trading day to get their
opinions about what the market will do in the last hour before closing!
Prognosticating pundits keep many people tuned in because their advice is
constantly changing (and is therefore entertaining and anxiety producing),
and they lead investors to believe that investments can be maneuvered in
advance to outfox future financial market moves. Common sense suggests,
though, that no one has a working crystal ball, and if she did, she certainly
wouldn’t share such insights with the mass media for free. (For more on
experts who purport to predict the future, see Chapter 8.)
Rating Radio and Television 
Financial Programs
Over the years, money issues have received increased coverage through the
major media of television and radio. Some topics gain more coverage in radio
and television because they help draw more advertising dollars (which follow
what people are watching). When you click on the radio or television, you
don’t pay a fee to tune in to a particular channel (with pay cable channels
being an exception). Advertising doesn’t necessarily prevent a medium from
delivering coverage that is objective and in your best interests, but it sure
doesn’t help foster this type of coverage either.
For example, can you imagine a financial radio or television correspondent
saying:
“We’ve decided to stop providing financial market updates every five min-
utes because we’ve found it causes some investors to become addicted
to tracking the short-term movements in the markets and to lose sight of
the bigger picture. We don’t want to encourage people to make knee-jerk
reactions to short-term events.”
Sound-bite-itis is another problem with both of these media. Producers and
network executives believe that if you go into too much detail, viewers and
listeners will change the channel.
397
Chapter 20: On Air and in Print

Now, radio and television are hardly the only types of media that offer poor
advice and cause investor myopia. The Internet can be even worse. And I’ve
read plenty of lousy money books over the years.
Finding the Best Web Sites
Yes, the Internet is changing the world, but certainly not always for the better
and not always in such a big way. Consider the way we shop. Okay, you can
buy things online that you couldn’t in the past. Big deal — what’s the differ-
ence between buying something by calling a toll-free number or doing mail
order (which many of us did for years before the Internet got commercial-
ized) and buying something by clicking your computer mouse? Purchasing
things online simply broadens the avenues through which you can spend
money. I see a big downside here: Overspending is easier to do when you surf
the Internet a lot.
Some of the best Web sites allow you to more efficiently access information
that may help you make important investing decisions. However, this doesn’t
mean that your computer allows you to compete at the same level as profes-
sional money managers. No, the playing field isn’t level. The best pros work
at their craft full time and have far more expertise and experience than the
rest of us. Some nonprofessionals have been fooled into believing that invest-
ing online makes them better investors. My experience has been that people
who spend time online every day dealing with investments tend to trade and
react more to short-term events and have a harder time keeping the bigger
picture and their long-term goals and needs in focus.
If you know where to look, you can more easily access some types of informa-
tion. However, you often find a lot of garbage online — just as you do on
other advertiser-dominated media like television and radio. In Chapter 19, I
explain how to safely navigate online to find the best of what’s out there.
Navigating Newspapers and Magazines
Compared with radio and television, print publications generally offer length-
ier discussions of topics. And in the more financially focused publications,
the editors who work on articles generally have more background in the
topics they write about.
398
Part V: Where to Go for More Help 

Even within the better publications, I find a wide variety of quality. So don’t
instantly believe what you read, even if you read a piece in a publication you
like. Here’s how to get the most from financial periodicals:
 Read some back issues. Go to your local library (or perhaps visit the
publication’s Web site) and read some issues that are at least one to two
years old. Although reading old issues may seem silly and pointless, it
can actually be enlightening. By reviewing a number of past issues in
one sitting, you can begin to get a flavor for a publication’s style, priori-
ties, and philosophies.
 Look for solid information and perspective. Headlines reveal a lot
about how a publication perceives its role. Publications with cover 
stories such as “10 hot stocks to buy now!” and “Funds that will double
your money in the next three years!” are probably best avoided. Look 
for articles that seek to educate with accuracy, not predict.
 Note bylines. As you read a given publication over time, you should
begin to make note of the different writers. After you get to know who
the better writers are, you can skip over the ones you don’t care for 
and spend your limited free time reading the best.
 Don’t react without planning. Here’s a common example of how not to
use information and advice you glean from publications: I had a client
who had some cash he wanted to invest. He would read an article about
investing in real estate investment trusts and then go out the next week
and buy several of them. Then he’d see a mention of some technology
stock funds and invest in some of those. Eventually his portfolio was a
mess of investments that reflected the history of what he had read
rather than an orchestrated, well-thought-out investment portfolio.
Betting on Books
Reading a good book is one of my favorite ways to get a crash course on a
given financial topic. Good books can go into depth on a topic in a way that
simply isn’t possible with other resources. Books also aren’t cluttered with
advertising and the conflicts inherent therein.
As with the other types of resources I discuss in this chapter, you definitely
have to choose carefully — there’s plenty of mediocrity and garbage out
there.
399
Chapter 20: On Air and in Print

Understanding the book 
publishing business
Book publishers are businesses first. And like most businesses, their busi-
ness practices vary. Some have a reputation for care and quality; others just
want to push a product out the door with maximum hype and minimum
effort.
For instance, you may think that book publishers check out an author before
they sign him or her to write an entire book. Well, you may be surprised to
find out that some publishers don’t do their homework.
What most publishers care about first is how marketable a book and an
author are. Some authors are marketable because of their well-earned reputa-
tion for sound advice. Others are marketable because of stellar promotional
campaigns built on smoke and mirrors.
Even more troubling is that few publishers require advice guides to be tech-
nically reviewed for accuracy by an expert in the field other than the author,
who sometimes is not an expert. You, the reader, are expected to be your
own technical reviewer. But do you have the expertise to do that? (Don’t
worry; this book has been checked for accuracy.)
As an author and financial counselor, I know that financial ideas and strate-
gies can differ considerably. Different is not necessarily wrong. When a tech-
nical reviewer looks at my text and tells me that a better way is out there, I
take a second look. I may even see things in a new way. If I were the only
expert to see my book before publication, I wouldn’t get this second expert
opinion. How do you know whether a book’s been technically reviewed?
Check the credits page or the author’s acknowledgments.
Authors write books for many reasons other than to teach and educate. The
most common reason financial book authors write books is to further their
own business interests. Taking care of business interests may not always be 
a bad thing, but it’s not the best thing for you when you’re trying to educate
yourself and better manage your own finances. For example, some investment
newsletter sellers write investment books. Rather than teach you how to make
good investments, the authors make the investment world sound complicated
so that you feel the need to subscribe to their ongoing newsletters.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
You find some fun and useful chapters that can help
you with financial strategies for ten life changes and
guide you with ten tips for avoiding identity theft and
fraud. Why “tens”? Why not?

Chapter 21
Survival Guide for 
Ten Life Changes
In This Chapter
 Handling the financial challenges that arise during life changes
 Minimizing financial worries so you can focus on what matters most
S
ome of life’s changes come unexpectedly, like earthquakes. Others you
can see coming when they’re still far off, like a big storm moving in off
the horizon. Whether a life change is predictable or not, your ability to navi-
gate successfully through its challenges and adjust quickly to new circum-
stances depends largely on your degree of preparedness.
Perhaps you find my comparison of life changes to natural disasters to be a
bit negative. After all, some of the changes I discuss in this chapter should be
occasions for joy. But understand that what one defines as a “disaster” has
everything to do with preparedness. To the person who has stored no emer-
gency rations in his basement, the big snowstorm that traps him in his home
can lead to problems. But to the prepared person with plenty of food and
water, that same storm may mean a vacation from work and some relaxing
days in the midst of a winter wonderland.
First, here are some general tips that apply to all types of life changes:
 Stay in financial shape. An athlete is best able to withstand physical
adversities during competition by training and eating well in advance.
Likewise, the sounder your finances are to begin with, the better you’ll
be able to deal with life changes.
 Changes require change. Even if your financial house is in order, a
major life change — starting a family, buying a home, starting a busi-
ness, divorcing, retiring — should prompt you to review your personal
financial strategies. Life changes affect your income, spending, insur-
ance needs, and ability to take financial risk.

 Don’t procrastinate. With a major life change on the horizon, procrasti-
nation can be costly. You (and your family) may overspend and accumu-
late high-cost debts, lack proper insurance coverage, or take other
unnecessary risks. Early preparation can save you from these pitfalls.
 Manage stress and your emotions. Life changes often are accompanied
by stress and other emotional upheavals. Don’t make knee-jerk deci-
sions during these changes. Take the time to become fully informed and
recognize and acknowledge your feelings. Educating yourself is key. You
may want to hire experts to help (see Chapter 18). Don’t abdicate deci-
sions and responsibilities to advisors — the advisors may not have your
best interests at heart or fully appreciate your needs.
Here, then, are the major changes you may have to deal with at some point in
your life. I wish you more of the good changes than the bad.
Starting Out: Your First Job
If you just graduated from college or some other program, or you’re other-
wise entering the workforce, your increased income and reduction in educa-
tional expenses are probably a welcome relief. You’d think, then, that more
young adults would be able to avoid financial trouble and challenges. But
they face these challenges largely because of poor financial habits picked up
at home or from the world at large. Here’s how to get on the path to financial
success:
 Don’t use consumer credit. The use and abuse of consumer credit can
cause long-term financial pain and hardship. To get off on the right finan-
cial foot, young workers need to shun the habit of making purchases on
credit cards that they can’t pay for in full when the bill arrives in the mail.
Here’s the simple solution for running up outstanding credit card bal-
ances: Don’t carry a credit card. If you need the convenience of making
purchases with a piece of plastic, get a debit card (see Chapter 5).
 Get in the habit of saving and investing. Ideally, your savings should be
directed into retirement accounts that offer tax benefits unless you want
to accumulate down-payment money for a home or small-business pur-
chase (see Chapter 4). Thinking about a home purchase or retirement is
usually not in the active thought patterns of first-time job seekers. I’m
often asked, “At what age should a person start saving?” To me, that’s
similar to asking at what age you should start brushing your teeth. Well,
when you have teeth to brush! So I say you should start saving and
investing money from your first paycheck. Try saving 5 percent of every
paycheck and then eventually increase your saving to 10 percent. If
you’re having trouble saving money, track your spending and make cut-
backs as needed (refer to Chapters 3 and 6).
406
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

 Get insured. When you’re young and healthy, imagining yourself feeling
otherwise is hard. Many twentysomethings give little thought to the
potential for health care expenses. But because accidents and unex-
pected illnesses can strike at any age, forgoing coverage can be finan-
cially devastating. Buying disability coverage, which replaces income
lost to a long-term disability, in your first full-time job with more-limited
benefits is also wise. And as you begin to build your assets, consider
making out a will so that your assets go where you want in the event of
your death.
 Continue your education. After you get out in the work force, you 
(like many other people) may realize how little you learned in formal
schooling that can actually be used in the real world and, conversely,
how much you need to learn (like personal financial management) that
school never taught you. Read, learn, and continue to grow. Continuing
education can help you advance in your career and enjoy the world
around you.
Changing Jobs or Careers
During your adult life, you’ll almost surely change jobs — perhaps several
times a decade. I hope that most of the time you’ll be changing by your own
choice. But let’s face it: Job security is not what it used to be. Downsizing has
made victims of even the most talented workers.
Always be prepared for a job change. No matter how happy you are in your
current job, knowing that your world won’t fall apart if you’re not working
tomorrow can give you an added sense of security and encourage openness
to possibility. Whether you’re changing your job by choice or necessity, the
following financial maneuvers can help ease the transition:
 Structure your finances to afford an income dip. Spending less than
you earn always makes good financial sense, but if you’re coming up to a
possible job change, spending less is even more important, particularly
if you’re entering a new field or starting your own company and you
expect a short-term income dip. Many people view a lifestyle of thrifti-
ness as restrictive, but ultimately those thrifty habits can give you more
freedom to do what you want to do. Be sure to keep an emergency
reserve fund (see Chapter 8).
If you lose your job, batten down the hatches. You normally get little
advance warning when you lose your job through no choice of your
own. It doesn’t mean, however, that you can’t do anything financially.
Evaluating and slashing your current level of spending may be neces-
sary. Everything should be fair game, from how much you spend on
housing to how often you eat out to where you do your grocery shop-
ping. Avoid at all costs the temptation to maintain your level of 
spending by accumulating consumer debt.
407
Chapter 21: Survival Guide for Ten Life Changes

 Evaluate the total financial picture when relocating. At some point in
your career, you may have the option of relocating. But don’t call the
moving company until you understand the financial consequences of
such a move. You can’t simply compare salaries and benefits between
the two jobs. You also need to compare the cost of living between the
two areas: That includes housing, commuting, state income and prop-
erty taxes, food, utilities, and all the other major expenditure categories
that I cover in Chapter 3.
 Track your job search expenses for tax purposes. If you’re seeking a
new job in your current (or recently current) field of work, your job
search expenses may be tax-deductible, even if you don’t get a specific
job you desire. Remember, however, that if you’re moving into a new
career, your job search expenses are not tax-deductible.
Getting Married
Ready to tie the knot with the one you love? Congratulations — I hope that
you’ll have a long, healthy, and happy life together. In addition to the emo-
tional and moral commitments that you and your spouse will make to one
another, you’re probably going to be merging many of your financial deci-
sions and resources. Even if you’re largely in agreement about your financial
goals and strategies, managing as two is different from managing as one.
Here’s how to prepare:
 Take a compatibility test. Many couples never talk about their goals and
plans before marriage, and failing to do so breaks up way too many mar-
riages. Finances are just one of the many issues you need to discuss.
Ensuring that you know what you’re getting yourself into is a good way
to minimize your chances for heartache. Ministers, priests, and rabbis
sometimes offer premarital counseling to help bring issues and differ-
ences to the surface.
 Discuss and set joint goals. After you’re married, you and your spouse
should set aside time once a year, or every few years, to discuss per-
sonal and financial goals for the years ahead. When you talk about
where you want to go, you help ensure that you’re both rowing your
financial boat in unison.
 Decide whether to keep finances separate or jointly managed.
Philosophically, I like the idea of pooling your finances better. After all,
marriage is a partnership, and it shouldn’t be a his-versus-hers affair. In
some marriages, however, spouses may choose to keep some money
separate so they don’t feel the scrutiny of a spouse with different spend-
ing preferences. Spouses who have been through divorce may choose to
keep the assets they bring into the new marriage separate in order to
protect their money in the event of another divorce. As long as you’re
jointly accomplishing what you need to financially, some separation of
408
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

money is okay. But for the health of your marriage, don’t hide money
from one another, and if you’re the higher-income spouse, don’t assume
power and control over your joint income.
 Coordinate and maximize employer benefits. If one or both of you
have access to a package of employee benefits through an employer,
understand how best to make use of those benefits. Coordinating and
using the best that each package has to offer is like getting a pay raise. If
you both have access to health insurance, compare which of you has
better benefits. Likewise, one of you may have a better retirement sav-
ings plan — one that matches and offers superior investment options.
Unless you can afford to save the maximum through both your plans,
saving more in the better plan will increase your combined assets.
(Note: If you’re concerned about what will happen if you save more in
one of your retirement plans and then you divorce, in most states, the
money is considered part of your joint assets to be divided equally.)
 Discuss life and disability insurance needs. If you and your spouse can
make do without each other’s income, you may not need any income-
protecting insurance. However, if, like many husbands and wives, you
both depend on each other’s incomes, or if one of you depends fully or
partly on the other’s income, you may each need long-term disability
and term life insurance policies (refer to Chapter 16).
 Update your wills. When you marry, you should make or update your
wills. Having a will is potentially more valuable when you’re married,
especially if you want to leave money to others in addition to your
spouse, or if you have children for whom you need to name a guardian.
See Chapter 17 for more on wills.
 Reconsider beneficiaries on investment and life insurance. With 
retirement accounts and life insurance policies, you name beneficiaries
to whom the money or value in those accounts will go in the event of
your passing. When you marry, you’ll probably want to rethink your 
beneficiaries.
Buying a Home
Most Americans eventually buy a home. You don’t need to own a home to be a
financial success, but home ownership certainly offers financial rewards. Over
the course of your adult life, the real estate you own is likely going to appreciate
in value. Additionally, you’re going to pay off your mortgage someday, which
will greatly reduce your housing costs. If you’re thinking about buying a home:
 Get your overall finances in order. Before buying, analyze your current
budget, your ability to afford debt, and your future financial goals. Make
sure your expected housing expenses allow you to save properly for
retirement and other long- or short-term objectives. Don’t buy a home
based on what lenders are willing to lend.
409
Chapter 21: Survival Guide for Ten Life Changes

 Determine whether now’s the time. Buying a house when you don’t see
yourself staying put three to five years rarely makes financial sense,
especially if you’re a first-time home buyer. Buying and selling a home
gobbles up a good deal of money in transaction costs — you’ll be lucky
to recoup all those costs even within a five-year period. Also, if your
income is likely to drop or you have other pressing goals, such as start-
ing a business, you may want to wait to buy.

Having Children
If you think that being a responsible adult, holding down a job, paying your
bills on time, and preparing for your financial future are tough, wait ’til you
add kids to the equation. Most parents find that with kids in the family, the
already precious commodities of free time and money become even more
precious. The sooner you discover how to manage your time and money, the
better able you’ll be to have a sane, happy, and financially successful life as a
parent. Here are some key things to recognize and do both before and after
you begin your family:
 Set your priorities. As with many other financial decisions, starting or
expanding a family requires that you plan ahead. Set your priorities and
structure your finances and living situation accordingly. Is having a
bigger home in a particular community important, or would you rather
feel less pressure to work hard, giving you more time to spend with your
family? Keep in mind that a less hectic work life not only gives you more
free time but also often reduces your cost of living by decreasing meals
out, dry-cleaning costs, day care expenses, and so on.
 Take a hard look at your budget. Having children requires you to
increase your spending. At a minimum, expenditures for food and cloth-
ing will increase. But you’re also likely to spend more on housing, insur-
ance, day care, and education. On top of that, if you want to play an
active role in raising your children, working at a full-time job won’t be
possible. So while you consider the added expenses, you may also need
to factor in a decrease in income.
No simple rules exist for estimating how children will affect your house-
hold’s income and expenses. On the income side, figure out how much
you want to cut back on work. On the expense side, government statis-
tics show that the average household with school-age children spends
about 20 percent more than those without children. Going through your
budget category by category and estimating how kids will change your
spending is a more scientific approach. (You can use the worksheets in
Chapter 3).

 Boost insurance coverage before getting pregnant. Make sure your
health insurance plan offers maternity benefits. (Ask about waiting peri-
ods that may exclude coverage for a pregnancy within the first year or
so of the insurance.) With disability insurance, pregnancy is considered
a preexisting condition, so women should secure this coverage before
getting pregnant. And most families-to-be should buy life insurance.
Buying life insurance after the bundle of joy comes home from the hospi-
tal is a risky proposition — if one of the parents develops a health prob-
lem, he or she may be denied coverage. You should also consider buying
life insurance for a stay-at-home parent. Even though the stay-at-home
parent is not bringing in income, if he or she were to pass away, hiring
assistance could cripple the family budget.
 Check maternity leave with your employers. Many of the larger
employers offer some maternity leave for women and, in rare but thank-
fully increasing cases, for men. Some employers offer paid leaves, while
others may offer unpaid leaves. Understand the options and the finan-
cial ramifications before you consider the leave and, ideally, before you
get pregnant.
 Update your will. If you have a will, you’ll need to update it; if you 
don’t have a will, make one now. With children in the picture, you 
need to name a guardian who will be responsible for raising your 
children should you and your spouse both pass away.
 Enroll the baby in your health plan. After your baby is welcomed into
this world, enroll him or her in your health insurance plan. Most insur-
ers give you about a month or so to enroll.
 Understand child-care tax benefits. For every one of your children with
an official Social Security number, you get a $3,300 deduction on your
income taxes (tax year 2006). So if you’re in the 25 percent federal tax
bracket, each child saves you $825 in federal taxes. On top of that, you
may be eligible for a $1,000 tax credit for each child under the age of 17.
That should certainly motivate you to apply for your kid’s Social
Security number!
If you and your spouse both work and you have children under the age
of 13, you can also claim a tax credit for child-care expenses. Or you 
may work for an employer who offers a flexible benefit or spending plan.
These plans allow you to put away up to $5,000 per year on a pre-tax
basis for child-care expenses. For many parents, especially those in
higher income tax brackets, these plans can save a lot in taxes. Keep in
mind, however, that if you use one of these plans, you can’t claim the
child-care tax credit. Also, if you don’t deplete the account every tax
year, you forfeit any money left over.
 Skip saving in custodial accounts. One common concern is how to 
sock away enough money to pay for the ever-rising cost of a college
education. If you start saving money in your child’s name in a so-called
411
Chapter 21: Survival Guide for Ten Life Changes

custodial account, however, you may harm your child’s future ability to
qualify for financial aid and miss out on the tax benefits that come with
investing elsewhere (see Chapter 13).
 Don’t indulge the children. Toys, art classes, sports, field trips, and the
like can rack up big bills, especially if you don’t control your spending.
Some parents fail to set guidelines or limits when spending on children’s
programs. Others mindlessly follow the examples set by the families of
their children’s peers. Introspective parents have told me that they feel
some insecurity about providing the best for their children. The parents
(and kids) who seem the happiest and most financially successful are
the ones who clearly distinguish between material luxuries and family
necessities.
As children get older and become indoctrinated into the world of shop-
ping, all sorts of other purchases come into play. Consider giving your
kids a weekly allowance and letting them discover how to spend and
manage it. And when they’re old enough, having your kids get a part-
time job can help teach financial responsibility.
Starting a Small Business
Many people aspire to be their own bosses, but far fewer people actually
leave their jobs in order to achieve that dream. Giving up the apparent secu-
rity of a job with benefits and a built-in network of co-workers is difficult for
most people, both psychologically and financially. Starting a small business is
not for everyone, but don’t let inertia stand in your way. Here are some tips
to help get you started and increase your chances for long-term success:
 Prepare to ditch your job. To maximize your ability to save money, live
as Spartan a lifestyle as you can while you’re employed; you’ll develop
thrifty habits that’ll help you weather the reduced income and increased
expenditure period that come with most small-business start-ups. You
may also want to consider easing into your small business by working at
it part-time in the beginning, with or without cutting back on your
normal job.
 Develop a business plan. If you research and think through your busi-
ness idea, not only will you reduce the likelihood of your business’s 
failing and increase its success if it thrives, but you’ll also feel more com-
fortable taking the entrepreneurial plunge. A good business plan should
describe in detail the business idea, the marketplace you’ll compete in,
your marketing plans, and expected revenue and expenses.
 Replace your insurance coverage. Before you finally leave your job, 
get proper insurance. With health insurance, employers allow you to
continue your existing coverage (at your own expense) for 18 months.
Individuals with existing health problems are legally entitled to purchase
412
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

an individual policy at the same price that a healthy individual pays.
With disability insurance, secure coverage before you leave your job 
so you have income to qualify for coverage. If you have life insurance
through your employer, obtain new individual coverage as soon as you
know you’re going to leave your job. (See Chapter 16 for details.)
 Establish a retirement savings plan. After your business starts making a
profit, consider establishing a retirement savings plan such as a SEP-IRA
or Keogh. As I explain in Chapter 11, such plans allow you to shelter up
to 20 percent of your business income from federal and state taxation.
Caring for Aging Parents
For many of us, there comes a time when we reverse roles with our parents
and become the caregivers. As your parents age, they may need help with a
variety of issues and living tasks. Although you probably won’t have the time
or ability to perform all these functions yourself, you may end up coordinat-
ing the service providers who will. Here are some things to consider when
caring for aging parents:
 Get help where possible. In most communities, a variety of nonprofit
organizations offer information and sometimes even counseling to fami-
lies who are caring for elderly parents. You may be able to find your 
way to such resources through your state’s department of insurance, 
as well as through recommendations from local hospitals and doctors.
You’ll especially want to get assistance and information if your parents
need some sort of home care, nursing home care, or assisted living
arrangement.
 Get involved in their health care. Your aging parents may already have 
a lot on their minds, or they simply may not be able to coordinate and
manage all the health care providers that are giving them medications
and advice. Try, as best as you can, to be their advocate. Speak with their
doctors so you can understand their current medical condition, the need
for various medications, and how to help coordinate caregivers. Visit
home care providers and nursing homes, and speak with prospective
care providers.
 Understand tax breaks. If you’re financially supporting your parents,
you may be eligible for a number of tax credits and deductions for elder
care. Some employers’ flexible benefit plans allow you to put away
money on a pre-tax basis to pay for the care of your parents. Also
explore the dependent care tax credit, which you can take on your fed-
eral income tax Form 1040. And if you provide half or more of the sup-
port costs for your parents, you may be able to claim them as
dependents on your tax return.
413
Chapter 21: Survival Guide for Ten Life Changes

 Discuss getting the estate in order. Parents don’t like thinking about
their demise, and they may feel awkward discussing this issue with their
children. But opening a dialogue between you and your folks about such
issues can be healthy in many ways. Not only does discussing wills,
living wills, living trusts, and estate planning strategies (see Chapter 17)
make you aware of your folks’ situation, but it can also improve their
plans to both their benefit and yours.
 Take some time off. Caring for an aging parent, particularly one who is
having health problems, can be time-consuming and emotionally drain-
ing. Do your parents and yourself a favor by using some vacation time to
help get things in order. Although this time off may not be the kind of
vacation you were envisioning, it should help you reduce your stress
and get more on top of things.
Divorcing
In most marriages that are destined to split up, there are usually early warn-
ing signs that both parties recognize. Sometimes, however, one spouse may
surprise the other with an unexpected request for divorce. Whether the
divorce is planned or unexpected, here are some key things to consider when
getting a divorce:
 Question the divorce. Some say that divorcing in America is too easy,
and I tend to agree. Although some couples are indeed better off parting
ways, others give up too easily, thinking that the grass is greener else-
where, only to later discover that all lawns have weeds and crabgrass.
Just as with lawns that aren’t watered and fertilized, relationships can
wither without nurturing.
Money and disagreements over money are certainly contributing factors
in marital unhappiness. Unfortunately, in many relationships, money is
wielded as power by the spouse who earns more of it. Try talking things
over, perhaps with a marital counselor. If you invest in making your rela-
tionship stronger, you’ll reap the dividends for years to come.
 Separate your emotions from the financial issues. Feelings of revenge
may be common in some divorces, but they’ll probably only help ensure
that the attorneys get rich as you and your spouse butt heads. If you
really want a divorce, work at doing it efficiently and harmoniously so
that you can get on with your lives and have more of your money to
work with.
 Detail resources and priorities. Draw up a list of all the assets and liabil-
ities that you and your spouse have. Make sure you list all the financial
facts, including investment account records and statements. After you
know the whole picture, begin to think about what is and is not impor-
tant to you financially and otherwise.
414
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

 Educate yourself about personal finance and legal issues. Divorce
sometimes forces nonfinancially oriented spouses to get a crash course
in personal finance at a difficult emotional time. This book can help edu-
cate you financially. Visit a bookstore and pick up a good legal guide or
two about divorce.
 Choose advisors carefully. Odds are that you’ll retain the services of
one or more specialists to assist you with the myriad issues, negotia-
tions, and concerns of your divorce. Legal, tax, and financial advisors
can help, but make sure you recognize their limitations and conflicts of
interest. The more complicated things become and the more you haggle
with your spouse, the more attorneys, unfortunately, benefit financially.
Don’t use your divorce attorney for financial or tax advice — your
lawyer probably knows no more than you do in these areas. Also, realize
that you don’t need an attorney to get divorced. As for choosing tax and
financial advisors, if you think you need that type of help, see Chapters 7
and 18 for advice on how to find good advisors.
 Analyze your spending. Although your household expenses will 
surely be less when you go back to being single, you’ll probably have to
make do with less income. Some divorcees find themselves financially
squeezed in the early years following a divorce. Analyzing your spending
needs pre-divorce can help you adjust to a new budget and negotiate a
fairer settlement with your spouse.
 Review needed changes to your insurance. If you’re covered under
your spouse’s employer’s insurance plan, make sure you get this cover-
age replaced (see Chapter 16). If you or your children will still be finan-
cially dependent upon your spouse post-divorce, make sure that the
divorce agreement mandates life insurance coverage. You should also
revise your will (see Chapter 17).
 Revamp your retirement plan. With changes to your income, expenses,
assets, liabilities, and future needs, your retirement plan will surely need
a post-divorce overhaul. Refer to Chapter 4 for a reorientation.
Receiving a Windfall
Whether through inheritance, stock options, small-business success, or lot-
tery winnings, you may receive a financial windfall at some point in your life.
Like many people who are totally unprepared psychologically and organiza-
tionally for their sudden good fortune, you may find that a flood of money
can create more problems than it solves. Here are a few tips to help you make
the most of your financial windfall:
415
Chapter 21: Survival Guide for Ten Life Changes

 Educate yourself. If you never had to deal with significant wealth, I don’t
expect you to know how to handle it. Don’t pressure yourself to invest it
as soon as possible. Leaving the money where it is or stashing it in one
of the higher-yielding money market funds I recommend in Chapter 12 is
far better than jumping into investments that you don’t understand and
haven’t researched.
 Beware of the sharks. You may begin to wonder whether someone has
posted your net worth, address, and home telephone number in the
local newspaper and on the Internet. Brokers and financial advisors may
flood you with marketing materials, telephone solicitations, and lunch
date requests. These folks pursue you for a reason: They want to con-
vert your money into their income either by selling you investments and
other financial products or by managing your money. Stay away from the
sharks, educate yourself, and take charge of your own financial moves.
Decide on your own terms whom to hire, and then seek them out. Most
of the best advisors that I know don’t have the time or philosophical ori-
entation to chase after prospective clients.
 Recognize the emotional side of coming into a lot of money. One of the
side effects of accumulating wealth quickly is that you may have feelings
of guilt or otherwise be unhappy, especially if you expected money to
solve your problems. If you didn’t invest in your relationship with your
parents and after their passing, you regret how you interacted with them,
getting a big inheritance from your folks may make you feel guilty. If you
poured endless hours into a business venture that finally paid off, all that
money in your investment accounts may leave you with a hollow feeling
if you’re divorced and you lost friends by neglecting your relationships.
 Pay down debts. People generally borrow money to buy things that they
otherwise can’t buy in one fell swoop. Paying off your debts is one of the
simplest and best investments you can make when you come into wealth.
 Diversify. If you want to protect your wealth, don’t keep it all in one pot.
Mutual funds (see Chapter 10) are an ideally diversified, professionally
managed investment vehicle to consider. And if you want your money to
continue growing, consider the wealth-building investments — stocks,
real estate, and small-business options — that I discuss in Part III of this
book.
 Make use of the opportunity. Most people work for a paycheck their
whole lives so they can pay a never-ending stream of monthly bills.
Although I’m not advocating a hedonistic lifestyle, why not take some
extra time to travel, spend time with your family, and enjoy the hobbies
you’ve long been putting off? And how about trying a new career that
you may find more fulfilling and that may make the world a better place?
416
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Retiring
If you spent the bulk of your adult life working, retiring can be a challenging
transition. Most Americans have an idealized vision of how wonderful retire-
ment will be — no more irritating bosses and pressure of work deadlines;
unlimited time to travel, play, and lead the good life. Sounds good, huh? Well,
the reality for most Americans is far different, especially for those who don’t
plan ahead (financially and otherwise). Here are some tips to help you
through retirement:
 Plan both financially and personally. Leaving behind a full-time career
creates big challenges, such as what to do with all your free time.
Planning your activities is even more important than planning finan-
cially. If the focus during your working years is solely on your career and
saving money, you may lack interests, friends, and the ability to know
how to spend money when you retire.
 Take stock of your resources. Many people worry and wonder whether
they have sufficient assets for cutting back on work or retiring com-
pletely, yet they don’t crunch any numbers to see where they stand.
Ignorance may cause you to misunderstand how little or how much you
really have for retirement when compared to what you need. See
Chapter 4 for help with retirement planning.
 Reevaluate your insurance needs. When you have sufficient assets to
retire, you don’t need to retain insurance to protect your employment
income any longer. On the other hand, as your assets grow over the
years, you may be underinsured with regards to liability insurance (refer
to Chapter 17).
 Decide on health care/living options. Medical expenses in your retire-
ment years (particularly the cost of nursing home care) can be daunting.
Which course of action you take — supplemental insurance, buying 
into a retirement community, or not doing anything — depends on 
your financial and personal situation. Early preparation increases your
options; if you wait until you have major health problems, it may be too
late to choose specific paths. (See Chapter 16 for more details on health
care options.)
 Decide what to do with your retirement plan money. If you have money
in a retirement savings plan, many employers offer the option of leaving
the money in the plan rather than rolling it over into your own retirement
account. Brokers and financial advisors clearly prefer that you do the
latter because it means more money for them, but it could also give you
many more (and perhaps better) investment choices to consider. Read
Part III of this book to find out about investing and evaluating the quality
of your employer’s retirement plan investment options.
417
Chapter 21: Survival Guide for Ten Life Changes

 Pick a pension option. Selecting a pension option (a plan that pays a
monthly benefit during retirement) is similar to choosing a good invest-
ment — each pension option carries different risks, benefits, and tax
consequences. Pensions are structured by actuaries, who base pension
options on reasonable life expectancies. The younger you are when you
start collecting your pension, the less you get per month. Check to see
whether the amount of your monthly pension stops increasing past a
certain starting age. You obviously don’t want to delay access to your
pension benefits past that age, because you won’t receive a reward for
waiting any longer and you’ll collect the benefit for fewer months.
If you know that you have a health problem that shortens your life
expectancy, you may benefit from drawing your pension sooner. If you
plan to continue working in some capacity and earning a decent income
after retiring, waiting for higher pension benefits when you’re in a lower
tax bracket is probably wise.
At one end of the spectrum, you have the risky single life option, which
pays benefits until you pass away and then provides no benefits for 
your spouse thereafter. This option maximizes your monthly take while
you’re alive. Consider this option only if your spouse can do without this
income. The least risky option, and thus least financially rewarding while
the pensioner is still living, is the 100 percent joint and survivor option,
which pays your survivor the same amount that you received while still
alive. The other joint and survivor options fall somewhere between
these two extremes and generally make sense for most couples who
desire decent pensions early in retirement but want a reasonable
amount to continue should the pensioner die first.
 Get your estate in order. Confronting your mortality is never a joy, but
when you’re considering retirement or you’re already retired, getting
your estate in order makes all the more sense. Find out about wills and
trusts that may benefit you and your heirs. You may also want to con-
sider giving monetary gifts now if you have more than you need.

Ten Tactics to Thwart Identity
Theft and Fraud
In This Chapter
 Protecting your personal information
 Paying attention to activity in your accounts and credit history
H
ucksters and thieves are often several steps ahead of law enforcement
officials. Eventually, some of the bad guys get caught, but many don’t,
and those who do get nabbed often get back to their unsavory ways after
penalties and some jail time. They may even be in your neighborhood or on
your local Little League Board. (For an enlightening read, check out Dr. Martha
Stout’s book The Sociopath Next Door [Broadway Books].)
Years ago when I lived on the West Coast, I got a call from my bank informing
me that they had just discovered “concerning activity” on the joint checking
account I held with my wife. Specifically, what had happened was that a man
with a bogus ID in my name had gone into five different Bank of America
branches on the same day and withdrawn $80 from our checking account at
each one. After some detective work on my part, I discovered that someone
had pilfered our personal banking information at my wife’s employer’s payroll
offices. Fortunately, the bank made good on the money that they’d allowed to
be withdrawn by the Eric Tyson impostor.
I had been the victim of identity theft. In my situation, the crook had
accessed one of my accounts; in other cases, the criminal activity may
develop with someone opening an account (such as a credit card) using
someone’s stolen personal information. Victims of identity theft can suffer
trashed credit reports, reduced ability to qualify for loans and even jobs
(with employers who check credit reports), out-of-pocket costs and losses,
and dozens of hours of time to clean up the mess and clear one’s credit
records and name.

Unfortunately, identity theft is hardly the only way to be taken to the cleaners
by crooks. All sorts of scamsters hatch schemes to separate you from your
money. Please follow the ten tips in this chapter to keep yourself from falling
prey and unnecessarily losing money.
Save Phone Discussions for Friends Only
Never, ever give out personal information over the phone, especially when
you aren’t the one who initiated the call. Suppose you get a call and the
person on the other end of the line claims to be with a company you conduct
business with (such as your credit card company or bank). Ask for the
caller’s name and number and call back to be sure he or she is indeed with
that company and has a legitimate business reason for contacting you.
With caller ID on your phone line, you may be able to see what number a call
is originating from, but more often than not, calls from business-registered
phone numbers come up as “unavailable.” A major red flag: if you try calling
back the number that comes through on caller ID and discover that the
number is bogus (a nonworking number).
Never Respond to E-mails 
Soliciting Information
If you’re an e-mail user, you may have seen or heard about official looking
e-mails sent from companies you know of and may do business with asking
you to promptly visit their Web site to correct some sort of billing or account
problem. Hackers have become very clever and can generate a return/sender
e-mail address that looks like it comes from a known institution but really
does not. This unscrupulous practice is known as phishing, and if you bite at
the bait, visit the site, and provide the requested personal information, your
reward is likely to be some sort of future identity theft problem.
To find out more about how to protect yourself from phishing scams, visit the
Anti-Phishing Working Group’s Web site at www.antiphishing.org.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Review Your Monthly Financial
Statements
Although financial institutions such as banks may call you if they notice
unusual activity on one of your accounts, some people discover problematic
account activity by simply reviewing their monthly credit card, checking-
account, and other statements.
Do you need to balance bank account statements to the penny? No, you
don’t. I haven’t for years (decades actually), and I don’t have the time or
patience for such minutiae. The key is to review the line items on your state-
ment to be sure that all the transactions were yours.
Secure All Receipts
When you make a purchase, be sure to keep track of and secure receipts,
especially those that contain your personal financial or account information.
You could keep these in an envelope in your home and then cross check
them against your monthly statement.
If you don’t need to retain your receipts, be sure to dispose of them in a way
that would prevent a thief from being able to decipher the information on
them should someone get into your garbage. Rip up the receipts, or if you
feel so inclined, buy a small paper shredder for your home and/or small 
business.
Close Unnecessary Credit Accounts
Open your wallet and remove all the pieces of plastic within it that enable
you to charge purchases. The more credit cards and credit lines that you
have, the more likely you are to have problems with identity theft and fraud
and the more likely you are to overspend and carry debt balances. Also,
reduce preapproved credit offers by contacting 888-5OPTOUT (888-567-8688)
or visiting www.optoutprescreen.com.
421
Chapter 22: Ten Tactics to Thwart Identity Theft and Fraud

Unless you maintain a card for small business transactions, you really “need”
only one piece of plastic with a VISA or MasterCard logo. Give preference 
to a debit card if you’ve had a history with accumulating credit card debt 
balances.
Regularly Review Your Credit Reports
You may also be tipped off to shenanigans going on in your name when you
review your credit report. Some identity theft victims have learned about
credit accounts opened in their name from reviewing their credit reports.
Because you’re entitled to a free credit report from each of the three major
credit agencies every year, I recommend reviewing your reports at least that
often. The reports generally contain the same information, so you could
request and review one agency report every four months, which would enable
you to keep a closer eye on your reports and still obtain them without cost.
I don’t recommend spending the $100 or so annually for a so-called credit
monitoring service that will update you when something happens on your
credit reports. If you’re concerned about someone illegally applying for credit
in your name, know that another option for you (in some states) to stay on
top of things is to “freeze” your personal credit reports and scores (see the
next tip).
Freeze Your Credit Reports
To address the growing problem of identity theft, increasing numbers of
states are passing credit freeze laws, which enable consumers to prevent
access to their reports. At the time of this writing, the following states enable
consumers, typically for a nominal fee, to freeze their credit information: CA,
CO, CT, IL, KS, KY, LA, ME, NV, NJ, NC, SD, TX, UT, VT, WA, and WI. (In some of
these states — IL, KS, SD, TX, VT, and WA — only identity theft victims may
freeze their reports.)
The individual whose credit report is frozen is the only person who may
grant access to the frozen credit report.
For an up-to-date listing of state freeze laws, visit the Web site www.pirg.
org/consumer/credit/statelaws.htm.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Keep Personal Information 
off Your Checks
Don’t place personal information on checks. Information that would be useful
to identity thieves and that you should not put on your checks includes your
credit card number, driver’s license number, Social Security number, and so
on. I also encourage you to leave your home address off of your preprinted
checks when you order them. Otherwise, every Tom, Dick, and Jane whose
hands your check passes through knows exactly where you live.
When writing a check to a merchant, question the need for adding personal
information to the check (in fact, in numerous states, it’s against the law to
request and place credit card numbers on checks). Use a debit card instead
for such transactions and remember that your debit card doesn’t advertise
your home address and other financial account data, so there’s no need to
publicize it to the world on your checks.
Protect Your Computer and Files
Especially if you keep personal and financial data on your computer, consider
the following safeguards to protect your computer and the confidential infor-
mation on it:
 Install a firewall.
 Use virus protection software.
 Password-protect access to your programs and files.
Protect Your Mail
Some identity thieves have collected personal information by simply helping
themselves to mail in home mailboxes. Especially if your mail is delivered to
a curbside box, stealing mail is pretty easy.
Consider using a locked mailbox or a post office box to protect your incom-
ing mail from theft. Be careful with your outgoing mail as well, such as bills
with checks attached. Minimize your outgoing mail and save yourself hassles
by signing up for automatic bill payment for as many bills as you are able.
Drop the rest of your outgoing mail in a secure U.S. postal box such as you
find at the post office.

Glossary
adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM): A mortgage whose interest rate and monthly
payments vary throughout its life. ARMs typically start with an artificially low
interest rate that gradually rises over time. The interest rate is determined by a
formula: margin (which is a fixed number) plus index (which varies). Generally
speaking, if the overall level of interest rates drops, as measured by a variety of
different indexes, the interest rate of your ARM generally follows suit. Similarly,
if interest rates rise, so does your mortgage’s interest rate and monthly pay-
ment. Caps limit the amount that the interest rate can fluctuate. Before you
agree to an ARM, be certain that you can afford its highest possible payments.
adjusted cost basis: For capital gains tax purposes, the adjusted cost basis is
how the IRS determines your profit or loss when you sell an asset such as a
home or a security. For an investment such as a mutual fund or stock, your
cost basis is what you originally invested plus any reinvested money. For a
home, you arrive at the adjusted cost basis by adding the original purchase
price to the cost of any capital improvements (expenditures that increase
your property’s value and life expectancy).
adjusted gross income (AGI): The sum of your taxable income (such as
wages, salaries, and tips) and taxable interest less allowable adjustments
(such as retirement account contributions and moving expenses). AGI is 
calculated before subtracting your personal exemptions and itemized 
deductions, which are used to derive your taxable income.
after-tax contributions: Some retirement plans allow you to contribute
money that has already been taxed. Such contributions are known as after-
tax contributions.
alternative minimum tax (AMT): The name given to a sort of shadow tax
system that may cause you to pay a higher amount in federal income taxes
than you otherwise would. The AMT was designed to prevent higher income
earners from lowering their tax bills too much through large deductions.
American Stock Exchange (AMEX): The second largest stock exchange in the
United States; it typically lists mid-sized firms and many of the new exchange-
traded stock funds.
annual percentage rate (APR): The figure that states the total yearly cost of
a loan as expressed by the actual rate of interest paid. The APR includes the
base interest rate and any other add-on loan fees and costs. The APR is thus
inevitably higher than the rate of interest that the lender quotes.

annuity: An investment that is a contract backed by an insurance company.
An annuity is frequently purchased for retirement purposes. Its main benefit
is that it allows your money to compound and grow without taxation until
withdrawal. Selling annuities is a lucrative source of income for insurance
agents and financial planners who work on commission, so don’t buy an
annuity until you’re sure that it makes sense for your situation.
asset allocation: When you invest your money, you need to decide how to
proportion it (allocate) between risky, growth-oriented investments (such as
stocks), whose values fluctuate, and more stable, income-producing invest-
ments (like bonds). How soon you’ll need the money and how tolerant you
are of risk are two important determinants when deciding how to allocate
your money.
audit: An IRS examination of your financial records, generally at the IRS
offices, to substantiate your tax return. IRS audits are among life’s worst
experiences.
bank prime rate: See prime rate.
bankruptcy: Legal action that puts a halt to creditors’ attempts to collect
unpaid debts from you. If you have a high proportion of consumer debt to
annual income (25 percent or greater), filing for bankruptcy may be your 
best option.
bear market: A period (such as the early 2000s) when the stock market expe-
riences a strong downward swing. It is often accompanied by (and sometimes
precedes) an economic recession. Imagine a bear in hibernation, because this
is what happens in a bear market: Investors hibernate and the market falters.
During a bear market, the value of stocks can decrease significantly. The
market usually has to drop at least 20 percent before it is considered a bear
market.
beneficiaries: The people to whom you want to leave your assets (or in the
case of life insurance or a pension plan, benefits) in the event of your death.
You denote beneficiaries for each of your retirement accounts.
blue chip stock: The stock of the largest and most consistently profitable
corporations. This term comes from poker, where the most valuable chips
are blue. The list of these stocks is unofficial and changes.
bond: A loan investors make to a corporation or government. Bonds gener-
ally pay a set amount of interest on a regular basis. They’re an appropriate
investment vehicle for conservative investors who don’t feel comfortable
with the risk involved in investing in stocks and who want to receive a steady
income. All bonds have a maturity date when the bond issuer must pay back
426
Personal Finance For Dummies, 5th Edition 

the bond at par (full) value to the bondholders (lenders). Bonds should not
be your primary long-term investment vehicle, because they produce little
real growth on your original investment after inflation is factored in.
bond rating: See Standard & Poor’s ratings and Moody’s ratings.
bond yield: A yield is quoted as an annual percentage rate of return that a
bond will produce based on its current value if it makes its promised interest
payments. How much a bond will yield to an investor depends on three impor-
tant factors: the stated interest rate paid by the bond, changes in the credit-
worthiness of the bond’s issuer, and the maturity date of the bond. The better
the rating a bond receives, the less risk involved and, thus, the lower the yield.
As far as the maturity date is concerned, the longer you loan your money, the
higher the risk (because it is more likely that rates will fluctuate) and the
higher your yield generally will be.
broker: A person who acts as an intermediary for the purchase or sale of
investments. When you buy a house, insurance, or stock, you most likely do
so through a broker. Most brokers are paid on commission, which creates a
conflict of interest with their clients: The more the broker sells, the more he
or she makes. Some insurance companies let you buy their policies directly,
and many mutual fund families bypass stockbrokers. If you’re going to work
with a broker, a discount broker can help you save on commissions.
bull market: A period (such as most of the 1990s in the United States) when
the stock market moves higher, usually accompanied and driven by a growing
economy and increasing corporate profits.
callable bond: A bond for which the lender can decide to pay the holder ear-
lier than the previously agreed-upon maturity date. If interest rates are rela-
tively high when a bond is issued, lenders may prefer to issue callable bonds
because they have the flexibility to call back these bonds and issue new,
lower-interest rate bonds if interest rates decline. Callable bonds are risky for
investors, because if interest rates decrease, the bond holder will get his
investment money returned early and may have to reinvest his money at a
lower interest rate.
capital gain: The profit from selling your stock at a higher price than the
price for which it was purchased. For example, if you buy 50 shares of Rocky
and Bullwinkle stock at $20 per share and two years later you sell your shares
when the price rises to $25 per share, your profit or capital gain is $5 per
share, or $250. If you hold this stock outside of a tax-sheltered retirement
account, you’ll owe federal tax on this profit when you sell the stock. Many
states also levy such a tax.
427
Glossary

capital gains distribution: Taxable distribution by a mutual fund or real
estate investment trust (REIT) created by securities that are sold within the
fund or REIT at a profit. These distributions may be either short-term (assets
held a year or less) or long-term (assets held for more than one year).
cash value insurance: A type of life insurance that is extremely popular with
insurance salespeople because it commands a high commission. In a cash
value policy, you buy life insurance coverage but also get a savings-type
account. Unless you’re looking for ways to limit your taxable estate (if you’re
extremely wealthy, for example), avoid cash value insurance. The investment
returns tend to be mediocre, and your contributions are not tax-deductible.
certificate of deposit (CD): A specific-term loan that you make to your
banker. The maturity date for CDs ranges from a month up to several years.
The interest paid on CDs is fully taxable, thus making CDs inappropriate for
higher tax-bracket investors investing outside tax-sheltered retirement
accounts.
closed-end mutual fund: A mutual fund that decides upfront exactly how
many shares it is going to issue to investors. After all the shares are sold, an
investor seeking to invest in the closed-end fund can only do so by purchas-
ing shares from an existing investor. Shares of closed-end funds trade on the
major stock exchanges and therefore sell at either a discount if the sellers
exceed the buyers or at a premium if demand exceeds supply.
COBRA (Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act): Name of the
federal legislation that requires health insurers and larger employers to con-
tinue to offer health insurance, at the employee’s expense, for 18 months
after coverage would otherwise end — for example, when an employee is 
laid off.
commercial paper: A short-term debt or IOU issued by larger, stable compa-
nies to help make their businesses grow and prosper. Credit-worthy compa-
nies can sell this debt security directly to large investors and thus bypass
borrowing money from bankers. Money market funds invest in soon-to-
mature commercial paper.
commission: The percentage of the selling price of a house, stock, bond, or
other investment that’s paid to agents and brokers. Because most agents and
brokers are paid by commission, understanding how the commission can
influence their behavior and recommendations is important for investors and
home buyers. Agents and brokers make money only when you make a pur-
chase, and they make more money when you make a bigger purchase.
Choose an agent carefully, and take your agent’s advice with a grain of salt,
because this conflict of interest can often set an agent’s visions and goals at
odds with your own.

commodity: Raw materials (gold, wheat, sugar, and gasoline, for example)
traded on the futures market.
common stock: Shares in a company that don’t offer a guaranteed amount of
dividend to investors; the amount of dividend distributions, if any, is at the
discretion of company management. Although common-stock investors may
or may not make money through dividends, they hope that the stock price will
appreciate as the company expands its operations and increases its profits.
Common stock tends to offer you a better return (profit) than other invest-
ments, such as bonds or preferred stock. However, if the company falters, you
may lose some or all of your original investment.
comparable market analysis (CMA): A written analysis of similar houses cur-
rently being offered for sale and those that have recently sold. CMAs are usu-
ally completed by real estate agents.
consumer debt: Debt on consumer items that depreciate in value over time.
Credit card balances and auto loans are examples of consumer debt. This
type of debt is bad for your financial health because it’s high-interest and it
encourages you to live beyond your means.
Consumer Price Index (CPI): The Consumer Price Index reports price
changes, on a monthly basis, in the cost of living for such items as food,
housing, transportation, health care, entertainment, clothing, and other 
miscellaneous expenses. The CPI is used to adjust government benefits, 
such as Social Security, and is used by many employers to determine cost-
of-living increases in wages and pensions. An increase in prices is also 
known as inflation.
co-payment: The percentage of your medical bill that your health plan
requires you to pay out of your own pocket after you satisfy your annual
deductible. A typical co-payment is 20 percent.
credit report: A report that details your credit history. It’s the main report
that a lender uses to determine whether to give you a loan. You may now
obtain a free copy of your credit reports annually.
debit card: Although they may look like credit cards, debit cards are different
in one important way: When you use a debit card, the cost of the purchase is
deducted from your checking account. Thus, a debit card gives you the con-
venience of a credit card without the danger of building up a mountain of
consumer debt.
deductible: You may be thinking that this is a new product from the Keebler
elves. Unfortunately, a deductible is actually much more mundane. With
insurance, the deductible is the amount you pay when you file a claim. For
429
Glossary

example, say that your car sustains $800 of damage. If your deductible is
$500, the insurance covers $300 and you pay $500 out of your own pocket for
the repairs. The higher the deductible, the lower your insurance premiums
and the less paperwork you expose yourself to when filing claims (because
small losses that are less than the deductible don’t require filing a claim).
Take the highest deductibles that you can afford when selecting insurance.
deduction: An expense you may subtract from your income to lower your
taxable income. Examples include mortgage interest, property taxes (item-
ized deductions), and most retirement account contributions.
derivative: An investment instrument whose value is derived from other
securities. For example, an option to buy IBM stock does not have value in
itself; the value is derived from the price of IBM’s stock.
disability insurance: Disability insurance replaces a portion of your employ-
ment income in the unlikely event that you suffer a disability that keeps you
from working.
discount broker: Unlike a full-service broker, a discount broker generally
offers no investment advice and has employees who work on salary rather
than on commission. In addition to trading individual securities, most dis-
count brokerage firms also offer no-load (commission-free) mutual funds.
diversification: If you put all your money into one type of investment, you’re
potentially setting yourself up for a big shock. If that investment collapses, so
does your investment world. By spreading (diversifying) your money among
different investments — bonds, U.S. stocks, international stocks, real estate,
and so on — you ensure yourself a better chance of investing success and
fewer sleepless nights.
dividend: The dividend is the income paid to investors holding an invest-
ment. With stock, the dividend is a portion of a company’s profits paid to its
shareholders. For example, if a company has an annual dividend of $2 per
share and you own 100 shares, your total dividend is $200. Usually, estab-
lished and slower-growing companies pay dividends, while smaller and faster
growing companies reinvest their profits for growth. For assets held outside
retirement accounts, dividends (except from tax-free money market and tax-
free bond funds) are taxable.
Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA): A widely followed stock market index
comprised of 30 large, actively traded U.S. company stocks. Senior editors at
the Wall Street Journal select the stocks in the DJIA.
down payment: The part of the purchase price for a house that the buyer
pays in cash upfront and does not finance with a mortgage. Generally, the
larger the down payment, the better the deal you can get on a mortgage. You
can usually get access to the best mortgage programs with a down payment
of at least 20 percent of the home’s purchase price.

earthquake insurance: Although the West Coast is often associated with
earthquakes, other areas are also quake prone. An earthquake insurance
rider (which usually comes with a deductible of 5 to 10 percent of the cost to
rebuild the home) on a homeowner’s policy pays to repair or rebuild your
home if it is damaged in an earthquake. If you live in an area with earthquake
risk, get earthquake insurance coverage!
Emerging Markets Index: The Emerging Markets Index, which is published
by Morgan Stanley, tracks stock markets in developing countries. The main
reason for investing in emerging markets is that these economies typically
experience a higher rate of economic growth than developed markets.
However, the potential for higher returns is coupled with greater risk.
equity: In the real estate world, this term refers to the difference between the
market value of your home and what you owe on it. For example, if your
home is worth $250,000, and you have an outstanding mortgage of $190,000,
your equity is $60,000. Equity is also a synonym for stock.
estate: The value, at the time of your death, of your assets minus your loans
and liabilities.
estate planning: The process of deciding where and how your assets will be
transferred when you die and structuring your assets during your lifetime so
as to minimize likely estate taxes.
Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA): The FNMA (or Fannie Mae) is
one of the best-known institutions in the secondary mortgage market. Fannie
Mae buys mortgages from banks and other mortgage-lending institutions and,
in turn, sells them to investors. These loan investments are considered safe
because Fannie Mae buys mortgages only from companies that conform to its
stringent mortgage regulations, and Fannie Mae guarantees the repayment of
principal and interest on the loans that it sells.
financial assets: A property or investment (such as real estate or a stock,
mutual fund, or bond) that has value that can be realized if sold.
financial liabilities: Your outstanding loans and debts. To determine your net
worth, subtract your financial liabilities from your financial assets.
financial planners (or advisors): A motley crew that professes an ability to
direct your financial future. Financial planners come with varying back-
grounds and degrees: MBAs, Certified Financial Planners, and Certified Public
Accountants, to name a few. A useful way to distinguish among this mixed
bag of nuts is to determine whether the planners are commission-, fee-, or
hourly-based.
431
Glossary

fixed-rate mortgage: The granddaddy of all mortgages. You lock into an inter-
est rate (for example, 7 percent), and it never changes during the life (term) of
your 15- or 30-year mortgage. Your mortgage payment will be the same amount
each and every month. If you become a cursing, frothing maniac when you
miss your morning coffee or someone is five minutes late, then this mortgage
may be for you!
flood insurance: If there’s even a remote chance that your area may flood,
having flood insurance, which reimburses rebuilding your home and replac-
ing its contents in the event of a flood, is prudent.
401(k) plan: A type of retirement savings plan offered by many for-profit com-
panies to their employees. Your contributions compound without taxation
over time and are usually exempt (yes!) from federal and state income taxes
until withdrawal.
403(b) plan: Similar to a 401(k) plan but for employees of nonprofit 
organizations.
full-service broker: A broker who gives advice and charges a high commis-
sion relative to discount brokers. Because the brokers work on commission,
they have a significant conflict of interest: namely, to advocate strategies that
will benefit them financially.
futures: An obligation to buy or sell a commodity or security on a specific
day for a preset price. When used by most individual investors, futures repre-
sent a short-term gamble on the short-term direction of the price of a com-
modity. Companies and farmers use futures contracts to hedge their risks of
changing prices.
guaranteed-investment contracts (GICs): Insurance company investments
that appeal to skittish investors. GICs generally tell you one year in advance
what your interest rate will be for the coming year. Thus, you don’t have to
worry about fluctuations and losses in your investment value. On the other
hand, GICs offer you little upside, because the interest rate is comparable to
what you may get on a short-term bank certificate of deposit.
home equity: See equity.
home-equity loan: Technical jargon for what used to be called a second mort-
gage. With this type of loan, you borrow against the equity in your house. If
used wisely, a home-equity loan can help pay off high-interest consumer debt
or be tapped for other short-term needs (such as a remodeling project). In
contrast with consumer debt, mortgage debt usually has a lower interest rate
and is tax-deductible.
432
Personal Finance For Dummies, 5th Edition 

homeowner’s insurance: Dwelling coverage that covers the cost of rebuild-
ing your house in the event of fire or other calamity. The liability insurance
portion of this policy protects you against lawsuits associated with your
property. Another essential element of homeowner’s insurance is the per-
sonal property coverage, which pays to replace your damaged or stolen
worldly possessions.
index: (1) A security market index, such as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index,
is a statistical composite that measures the performance of a particular type
of security. Indexes exist for various stock and bond markets and are typi-
cally set at a round number such as 100 at a particular point in time. See also
Dow Jones Industrial Average and Russell 2000. (2) The index can also
refer to the measure of the overall level of interest rates that a lender uses as
a reference to calculate the specific interest rate on an adjustable-rate loan.
The index plus the margin is the formula for determining the interest rate on
an adjustable-rate mortgage.
individual retirement account (IRA): A retirement account into which
anyone with sufficient employment income or alimony may contribute up to
$4,000 per year ($5,000 if age 50 or older). Based on your eligibility for other
employer-based retirement programs and which type of IRA you select (regu-
lar or Roth), your contributions may be tax-deductible.
inflation: The technical term for a rise in prices. Inflation usually occurs
when too much money is in circulation and not enough goods and services
are available to spend it on. As a result of this excess demand, prices rise. A
link is present between inflation and interest rates: If interest rates do not
keep up with inflation, no one will invest in bonds issued by the government
or corporations. When the interest rates on bonds are high, it usually reflects
a high rate of inflation that will eat away at your return.
initial public offering (IPO): The first time a company offers stock to the
investing public. An IPO typically occurs when a company wants to expand
more rapidly and seeks additional money to support its growth. A number of
studies have demonstrated that buying into IPOs in which the general public
can participate produces subpar investment returns. A high level of IPO
activity may indicate a cresting stock market, as companies and their invest-
ment bankers rush to cash in on a “pricey” marketplace. (IPO could stand for
It’s Probably Overpriced.)
interest rate: The rate lenders charge you to use their money. The higher the
interest rate, the higher the risk entailed in the loan. With bonds of a given
maturity, a higher rate of interest means a lower quality of bond — one that’s
less likely to return your money.
433
Glossary

international stock markets: Stock markets outside of the United States
account for a significant portion of the world stock market capitalization
(value). Some specific stock indices track international markets (see Morgan
Stanley EAFE index and Emerging Markets Index). International investing
offers one way for you to diversify your portfolio and reduce your risk. Some
of the foreign countries with major stock exchanges outside the United States
include Japan, Britain, France, Germany, and Canada.
junk bond: A bond rated Ba (Moody’s) or BB (Standard & Poor) and lower.
Historically, these bonds have had a 1 to 2 percent chance of default, which 
is not exactly “junky.” Of course, the higher risk is accompanied by a higher
interest rate.
Keogh plan: A tax-deductible retirement savings plan available to self-
employed individuals. Certain Keoghs allow you to put up to 25 percent of
your self-employment income into the account.
leverage: Financial leverage affords its users a disproportionate amount of
financial power relative to the amount of their own cash invested. In some
circumstances, you can borrow up to 50 percent of a stock price and use all
funds (both yours and those that you borrow) to make a purchase. You repay
this so-called margin loan when you sell the stock. If the stock price rises,
you make money on what you invested plus what you borrowed. Although
this money sounds attractive, remember that leverage cuts both ways —
when prices decline, you lose money not only on your investment but also 
on the money you borrowed.
limited partnership (LP): These partnerships, which are often promoted in 
a way that promises high returns, generally limit one thing: your investment
return. Why? Because they’re burdened with high commissions and manage-
ment fees. Another problem is that they’re typically not liquid for many
years.
load mutual fund: A mutual fund that includes a sales load, which is the com-
mission paid to brokers who sell commission-based mutual funds. The com-
mission typically ranges from 4 to 8.5 percent. This commission is deducted
from your investment money, so it reduces your returns.
marginal tax rate: The rate of income tax you pay on the last dollars you
earn over the course of a year. Why the complicated distinction? Because 
not all income is treated equally: You pay less tax on your first dollars of 
your annual earnings and more tax on the last dollars of your annual income.
Knowing your marginal tax rate is helpful because it can help you analyze 
the tax implications of important personal financial decisions.
434
Personal Finance For Dummies, 5th Edition 

market capitalization: The value of all the outstanding stock of a company.
Market capitalization is the quoted price per share of a stock multiplied by
the number of shares outstanding. Thus, if Rocky and Bullwinkle Corporation
has 100 million shares of outstanding stock and the quoted price per share is
$20, the company has a market capitalization of $2 billion (100 million × $20).
Moody’s ratings: Moody’s rating service measures and rates the credit
(default) risks of various bonds. Moody’s investigates the financial condition
of a bond issuer. Its ratings use the following grading system, which is
expressed from highest to lowest: Aaa, Aa, A, Baa, Ba, B, Caa, Ca, C. Higher
ratings imply a lower risk but also mean that the interest rate will be lower.
Morgan Stanley EAFE (Europe, Australia, Far East) index: The Morgan
Stanley EAFE index tracks the performance of the more established coun-
tries’ stock markets in Europe and Asia. This index is important for interna-
tional-minded investors who want to follow the performance of overseas
stock investments.
mortgage-backed bond (GNMAs and FNMAs): The Government National
Mortgage Association (GNMA, or Ginnie Mae) specializes in mortgage-backed
securities. It passes the interest and principal payment of borrowers to
investors. When a homeowner makes a mortgage payment, GNMA deducts a
small service charge and forwards the mortgage payments to its investors.
The payments are guaranteed in case a borrower fails to pay his or her mort-
gage. The Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA or Fannie Mae) is a
publicly owned, government-sponsored corporation that purchases mort-
gages from lenders and resells them to investors. FNMA mainly deals with
mortgages backed by the Federal Housing Administration.
mortgage broker: Mortgage brokers buy mortgages wholesale from lenders
and then mark the mortgages up (typically from 0.5 to 1 percent) and sell
them to borrowers. A good mortgage broker is most helpful for people who
don’t want to shop around on their own for a mortgage or people who have
blemishes on their credit reports.
mortgage life insurance: Mortgage life insurance guarantees that the lender
will receive its money in the event that you meet an untimely demise. Many
people may try to convince you that you need this insurance to protect your
dependents and loved ones. Mortgage life insurance is relatively expensive
given the cost of the coverage provided. If you need life insurance, buy low-
cost, high-quality term life insurance instead.
municipal bond: A loan for public projects, such as highways, parks, or cul-
tural centers, that an investor makes to cities, towns, and states. The tax-
exempt status of their interest is what makes municipal bonds special:
435
Glossary

They’re exempt from federal taxes and, if you reside in the state where the
bond is issued, state taxes. Municipal bonds are most appropriate for people
in high tax brackets who invest money outside of tax-sheltered retirement
accounts.
mutual fund: A portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities that is owned
by numerous investors and managed by an investment company. See also no-
load mutual fund.
National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation (NASDAQ)
system: An electronic network that allows brokers to trade from their offices
all over the country. With NASDAQ, brokers buy and sell shares using con-
stantly updated prices that appear on their computer screens.
negative amortization: Negative amortization occurs when your outstanding
mortgage balance increases despite the fact that you’re making the required
monthly payments. Negative amortization occurs with adjustable-rate mort-
gages that cap the increase in your monthly payment but do not cap the
interest rate. Therefore, your monthly payments don’t cover all the interest
that you actually owe. Avoid loans with this “feature.”
net asset value (NAV): The dollar value of one share of a mutual fund. For a
no-load fund, the market price is its NAV. For a load fund, the NAV is the “buy”
price minus the commission.
New York Stock Exchange (NYSE): The largest stock exchange in the world
in terms of total volume and value of shares traded. It lists companies that
tend to be among the oldest, largest, and best-known companies.
no-load mutual fund: A mutual fund that doesn’t come with a commission
payment attached to it. Some funds claim to be no-load but simply hide their
sales commissions as an ongoing sales charge; you can avoid these funds by
educating yourself and reading the prospectuses carefully.
open-end mutual fund: A mutual fund that issues as many shares as
investors demand. These open-end funds do not generally limit the number
of investors or amount of money in the fund. Some open-end funds have been
known to close to new investors, but investors with existing shares can often
still buy more shares from the company.
option: The right to buy or sell a specific security (such as a stock) for a preset
price during a specified period of time. Options differ from futures in that with
an option, you pay a premium fee upfront and you can either exercise the
option or let it expire. If the option expires worthless, you lose 100 percent of
your original investment. The use of options is best left to companies as hedg-
ing tools. Investment managers may use options to reduce the risk in their
436
Personal Finance For Dummies, 5th Edition 

investment portfolio. As with futures, when most individual investors buy an
option, they’re doing so as a short-term gamble, not as an investment. For
example: You have an option to buy 100 shares of Rocky and Bullwinkle Co.
stock at $20 per share in the next six months. You pay $3 per share upfront as
the premium. During this time period, R&B’s share price rises to $30, and you
exercise your right to buy at $20. You then sell your shares at the market price
of $30; you make a $10 profit per share, which is a return more than three times
larger than your original investment.
pension: Pensions (also known as defined benefit plans) are a benefit offered
by some employers. These plans generally pay you a monthly retirement
income based on your years of service and former pay with the employer.
performance: You traditionally judge an investment’s performance by look-
ing at the historic rate of return. The longer the period over which these
numbers are tallied, the more useful they are. Considered alone, these num-
bers are practically meaningless. You must also note how well a fund has 
performed in comparison to competitors with the same investment objec-
tives. Beware of advertisements that tout the high returns of a mutual fund,
because they may not be looking at risk-adjusted performance, or they may
be promoting performance over a short time period. Keep in mind that high
return statistics are usually coupled with high risk and that this year’s star
may turn out to be next year’s crashing meteor.
pre-certification: A condition for health insurance benefit coverage that
requires a patient to get approval before being admitted to a hospital for 
nonemergency care.
preferred stock: Preferred stock dividends must be paid before any divi-
dends are paid to the common stock shareholders. Although preferred stock
reduces your risk as an investor (because of the more secure dividend and
greater likelihood of getting your money back if the company fails), it also
often limits your reward if the company expands and increases its profits.
price/earnings (P/E) ratio: The current price of a stock divided by the cur-
rent (or sometimes the projected) earnings per share of the issuing company.
This ratio is a widely used stock analysis statistic that helps an investor get
an idea of how cheap or expensive a stock price is. In general, a relatively
high P/E ratio indicates that investors feel that the company’s earnings are
likely to grow quickly.
prime rate: The rate of interest that major banks charge their most credit-
worthy corporate customers. Why should you care? Well, because the inter-
est rates on various loans you may be interested in are often based on the
prime rate. And, guess what — you pay a higher interest rate than those big
corporations!
437
Glossary

principal: No, I’m not talking about the big boss from elementary school who
struck fear into the hearts of most 8-year-olds. The principal is the amount
you borrow for a loan. If you borrow $100,000, your principal is $100,000.
Principal can also refer to the amount you originally placed in an investment.
prospectus: Individual companies and mutual funds are required by the
Securities and Exchange Commission to issue a prospectus. For a company,
the prospectus is a legal document presenting a detailed analysis of that com-
pany’s financial history, its products and services, its management’s back-
ground and experience, and the risks of investing in the company. A mutual
fund prospectus tells you about the fund’s investment objectives, costs, risk,
and performance history.
real estate investment trust (REIT): Real estate investment trusts are like a
mutual fund of real estate investments. Such trusts invest in a collection of
properties (from shopping centers to apartment buildings). REITs trade on the
major stock exchanges. If you want to invest in real estate while avoiding the
hassles inherent in owning property, real estate investment trusts may be
right for you.
refinance: Refinance, or refi, is a fancy word for taking out a new mortgage
loan (usually at a lower interest rate) to pay off an existing mortgage (gener-
ally at a higher interest rate). Refinancing is not automatic, nor is it guaran-
teed. Refinancing can also be a hassle and expensive. Weigh the costs and
benefits of refinancing carefully before proceeding.
return on investment: The percentage of profit you make on an investment.
If you put $1,000 into an investment and then one year later it’s worth $1,100,
you make a profit of $100. Your return on investment is the profit ($100)
divided by the initial investment ($1,000) — in this case, 10 percent.
reverse mortgage: A reverse mortgage enables elderly homeowners, typi-
cally those who are low on cash, to tap into their home’s equity without sell-
ing their home or moving from it. Specifically, a lending institution makes a
check out to you each month, and you can use the check as you want. This
money is really a loan against the value of your home, so it’s tax-free when
you receive it. The downside of these loans is that they deplete your equity in
your estate, the fees and interest rates tend to be on the high side, and some
require repayment within a certain number of years.
Russell 2000: An index that tracks the returns of 2,000 small-company U.S.
stocks. Small-company stocks tend to be more volatile than large-company
stocks. If you invest in small-company stocks or stock funds, this is an appro-
priate benchmark to compare your performance to.
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC): The federal agency that admin-
isters U.S. securities laws and regulates and monitors investment companies,
brokers, and financial advisors.

simplified employee pension individual retirement account (SEP-IRA): Like
other retirement plans, a SEP-IRA allows your money to compound over the
years without the parasitic effect of taxes. SEP-IRAs are relatively easy to set
up, and they allow self-employed people to make annual contributions on a
pre-tax basis.
Social Security: If you’re retired or disabled, Social Security is a government
safety net that can provide you with some income. The program is based on
the idea that government is responsible for the social welfare of its citizens.
Whether you agree with this notion or not, part of your paycheck goes to
Social Security, and when you retire, you receive money from the program.
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index: An index that measures the performance of
500 large-company U.S. stocks that account for about 80 percent of the total
market value of all stocks traded in the United States. If you invest in larger-
company stocks or stock funds, the S&P 500 Index is an appropriate bench-
mark to compare the performance of your investments to.
Standard & Poor’s (S&P) ratings: Standard & Poor’s rating service is one of
two services that measure and rate the risks in buying a bond. The S&P rat-
ings use the following grading system, listed from highest to lowest: AAA, AA,
A, BBB, BB, B, CCC, CC, C. See also Moody’s ratings.
stock: Shares of ownership in a company. When a company goes public, it
issues shares of stock to the public (see also initial public offering). Many,
but not all, stocks pay dividends — a distribution of a portion of company
profits. In addition to dividends, you make money investing in stock via
appreciation in the price of the stock, which normally results from growth in
revenues and corporate profits. You can invest in stock by purchasing indi-
vidual shares or by investing in a stock mutual fund that offers a diversified
package of stocks.
term life insurance: If people are dependent on your income for their living
expenses, you may need this insurance. Term life insurance functions simply:
You determine how much protection you would like and then pay an annual
premium based on that amount. Although much less touted by insurance
salespeople than cash value insurance, it’s the best life insurance out there
for the vast majority of people.
Treasury bill: IOUs from the federal government that mature within a year.
The other types of loans that investors can make to the federal government
are Treasury notes, which mature within one to ten years, and Treasury
bonds, which mature in more than ten years. The interest that these federal
government bonds pay is free of state taxes, but it’s federally taxable.

Glossary

underwriting: The process an insurance company uses to evaluate a
person’s likelihood of filing a claim on a particular type of insurance policy. 
If significant problems are discovered, an insurer will often propose much
higher rates or refuse to sell the insurance coverage.
will: A legal document that ensures that your wishes regarding your assets
and the care of your minor children are heeded when you die.
zero-coupon bond: A bond that doesn’t pay explicit interest during the term
of the loan. Zero-coupon bonds are purchased at a discounted price relative
to the principal value paid at maturity. Thus, the interest is implicit in the dis-
count. These bonds do not offer a tax break, because the investor must pay
taxes on the interest he would have received.
