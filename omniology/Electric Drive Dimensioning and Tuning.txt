Preface
Preface
Each point of our life is the point of choice
Yuly Daniel 
There is always an increasing demand for most modular, flexible, and integrated solutions. This in turn 
is causing designers to find ways of enhancing their product offerings in response to such demand. 
Designs are fast becoming more commonplace, in part because technology advances are making them 
easer and also because an integrated solution functions more effectively as a whole rather than the sum 
of the individual elements that comprise it.
An electric drive is the electromechanical system that converts electrical energy to mechanical motion of 
the driven machine. As a rule, it has more capability than the separate motor, gear, or power converter in 
their composition. To meet the application requirements, every component must be evaluated according 
to its own capability before selecting it for use on a drive. This must be considered when selecting and 
tuning multiple motor-gear-converter combinations. 
This book is intended primarily for the university-level learners of an electromechanical profile, including 
the bachelor and master students majored in electrical engineering and mechatronics. It will help also 
technicians and engineers of respective specialities. Those who have completed the basics of electric 
drive are welcome to this advanced course. 
The proper choice of the driving equipment to meet the load requirements called dimensioning is 
discussed in the first three sections of this book. The amount of power and torque produced by a drive 
must always be at least equal those required by the load. If the drive cannot produce sufficient values, 
it will either fail to start the load, stall, or run in an overloaded condition. The book illustrates how the 
load can be determined. In order the machine to perform without excessive overshoot, settle within 
adequate time periods, and have minimum errors, the electric drive must be tuned. In the last three 
sections of the book, the control systems are discussed which are the basis of the adjustable converter-fed 
electric drives. They implement motor speed, position, flux, and torque management, realise coordinated 
motion of multiple mechanisms, and convert information of the automatic process. As the electric 
drives exhibit highly coupled, nonlinear, and multivariable structures, their control generally requires 
complex algorithms that can be performed by microprocessor controllers along with fast-switching 
power converters. 
I wish you much success in designing and tuning electric drives.

Project Planning
1	 Project Planning
1.1	
Project requirements
Request for proposal. To find an optimum system composition the complex project planning is conducted. 
As a rule, this process begins from the request for proposal, which clarifies the types of motors, gears, and 
power converters as well as the system organisation to obtain the highest reliability, best dynamic and 
static properties, minimum dimensions or loss, and acceptable cost. An equipment type has to satisfy 
the required technical and economic indices.
To start the project planning, the load data, such as mass, speed, forces, frequency, operating times, 
geometry of wheels and shafts as well as the performance conditions are collected. Using these data, 
the required amount of power in regard to efficiency is calculated, and the output speed is determined. 
Then, the gears, motors, and power converters are selected from the manufacturer catalogs and 
databases observing the individual operating conditions. For fast and effective determination of the 
drive components, the leading vendors suggest the project planning programs where extensive data of 
electronic catalogs are available as the datasheets. Thus, the user can choose between uncontrolled and 
controlled drive systems, required components, and their accessories.
Drive specifications. Failure to proper specifying of a motor drive can result in a conflict between the 
equipment supplier and the end user. To avoid such a problem, the design specifications should reflect 
the operating and environmental conditions listed:type of application
--
performance conditions and duty
--
supply conditions and harmonics 
--
supply voltage, current, and frequency 
--
power and torque ratings 
--
speed range, minimum, and maximum values 
--
accuracy and time response
--
efficiency and power factor

Project Planning
Both an equipment supplier and a customer should work as partners and cooperate from the beginning 
of the project until successful commissioning and handover. It is advisable that the customer procure the 
complete drive system, including system engineering, commissioning, and engineering support, from 
one competent supplier. It is one of the first priorities to identify applicable national and international 
standards on issues related to EMC, harmonics, safety, and noise, smoke emissions during faults, dust, 
and vibration. Overspecifying the requirements could often result in a more expensive solution than 
necessary. The customer must have an idea about the drive interfaces, voltages, mechanical power, and 
shaft speed because the torque and current are calculated from these. The frequency and the power factor 
depend on the choice of the motor and the gear. For a high-power drive, it is always recommended to 
carry out a ‘‘harmonic survey’’ which will reveal the existing level of harmonics and quantify approaching 
the new levels.
Other classifications, not listed above, include the following:
--
working voltage: low (less than 690 V) or medium 
--
current type: ac or dc 
--
mechanical coupling: direct, via a gearbox, or indirect
--
packaging: integrated motors as opposed to separate ones 
--
movement: rotary, vertical, or linear motion
--
drive configuration: stand-alone, system, dc link bus, etc.
--
braking mode: regenerative or non-regenerative
--
cooling method: direct and indirect air, liquid, etc.
Classification by applications. Every application is targeted to the specific load. The way the drive 
performs is very much dependent on the load characteristics. With regard to applications, four main 
groups of motor drives are available, namely appliance drives, general-purpose drives, system drives, 
and servo drives. Table 1.1 describes typical applications and main features of these groups.

Project Planning
Electrical requirements. Electrical rules regulate the kind of electrical power and technical characteristics 
of the primary supply circuit and the load. 
The drives are designed to operate in a wide range of supply voltages, from low voltage to higher voltage 
at supply frequencies of 47…63 Hz. Many supplies vary outside those levels. For example, supplies at 
the end of long power lines in remote areas can rise excessively when large loads are no longer present. 
Industries with locally controlled and generated supplies can have poor regulation and control. Power 
systems in certain parts of the world may not meet expected tolerances. The supply circuit sometimes 
has steady or transient asymmetry. Thus, operation outside the stated supply levels will probably cause 
damage and must be avoided.
In the case of ac supply, input voltages, currents, frequencies, and the number of phases are rated as 
well as the quality of electrical supply as a whole. In the group of quality factors, the steady state and 
dynamic stability, possible non-sinusoidal shape of waves, time, and periodicity of dynamic disturbances 
are included. In the case of low-power supply source, the harmonic content of the input current, the 
power factor, and the timing diagrams are limited. In the case of long cabling distances, the electrical 
resistance of the wiring is to be taken into account. When the high harmonic currents flow through the 
cables, the distributed inductances and distributed capacitances are also significant. Thus, the resonant 
phenomena and signal shape distortion should often be eliminated or limited.

In the case of dc supply, input rated voltages and currents as well as the power supply quality are also 
indicated. Among the quality factors, the steady state and dynamic stability, possible time and periodicity 
of dynamic disturbances are listed. The ripple level and frequency are the important features of dc supply. 
Again, in the case of low-power source, the supply line dynamic value of electrical resistance is limited. 
This parameter helps to evaluate the influence of the input current on the output voltage, commutation 
spikes and drops under the load rising and lowering.
An electric drive is supplied with ground and phase fault protection, overheating and overcurrent 
protection. Table 1.2 illustrates the difference of protection equipment (2 – Full protection, 1 – Partial

A designer must take into account the full scope of protection grounding standards. The grounding 
methods and elements should have constant transient rated resistance during the full time of duty. 
Other standards and technical rules concern different technological and production modes. Particularly, 
they are: electrical connectors and leads, marking, signal sizes and levels, cabling circuits, metrological 
devices, ergonomics, etc. 
The following standards regulate possible variants of the used equipment:

Converter type defines an electromagnetic interference level (EMI) and electromagnetic compatibility level 
(EMC) of electric drive. Both indexes are regulated by directives EEC 89/336, EN 61800-3, EN 50081, EN 
50082, by international standards IEC 801 and national standards. Manufacturers support the required 
levels of emission by radiation and conductivity, electrostatic charge, pulse noise, and radio frequency 
immunity, as well as supply voltage and magnetic fields deviation protection.

Equipment enclosure. The drive design depends on the maintenance conditions and functional place of 
equipment, such as autonomous, built-in, or a part of another device. An autonomous module is the most 
commonly employed type, thus the requirement of standard housing is typical. Mechanical resistance 
to shocks, vibrations, etc. is another characteristic. Methods of control, repair, and reconstruction 
processes are very important also. When the influence of humidity and water is high, plus an aggressive 
environment, hermetic sealing is the solution of the problem. The same concerns the storage conditions.
An enclosure holds the drive components together and also protects the internal components from 
moisture and containments. The degree of protection and cooling depends on the enclosure type. There 
are two categories of enclosures, open and totally enclosed. Open enclosures permit cooling air to flow 
through the motor. In some applications, the air surrounding the motor contains corrosive or harmful 
elements which can damage the internal enclosure parts of a motor. A totally enclosed non-ventilated 
enclosure limits the flow of air in this case.

Normally, IP54, IP55, or IP56 are recommended. Increased corrosion protection for metal parts and 
additional impregnation of the winding (protection against ingress of moisture and acids) are possible, as 
well as delivery of explosion-protected type motors and brake motors in conformity with enclosure class 
EExe (increased safety), EExed (motor increased safety, brake explosion-proof), and EExd (explosion-
proof).
1.2	
Operating modes
Cooling methods. Every motor is ultimately rated dependently its thermal loading. At overheating 
caused by inadequate cooling or overloading, the machines fall out. Therefore, the motors are supplied 
with thermal protection against overheating, overvoltage protection, overload protection, and time-current 
protection called It monitoring.
From the viewpoint of cooling, all the machines are divided in accordance with the IC (International 
Cooling) scale MEC 34 as enclosed motors, protected motors, natural air cooling motors, self-ventilation 
motors, and forced ventilation motors.
Because of the great variety of the thermal conditions the motor rated data are referred to the ambient 
temperature 40 ºС. When the motor is expected to work upon other temperatures, the load is recalculated 
in respect to the rated one. The conversion factors are usually given in the motor datasheets. For example, 
to exclude overheating at low speeds the motors of increased power (derated motors) are recommended 
to apply. For example, Omron requires the derating level of 40…45% for continuous operation at 5 Hz 
and 25…30% for operation at 10 Hz. 
Some vendors design their equipment with the service factor indicated in the nameplate of the machine. 
Service factor is a number that is multiplied by the rated power to determine the power at which the 
motor can be operated. Therefore, a motor designed to operate at or below its nameplate power rating 
has a service factor of 1.0. The motors designed for a service factor higher than 1.0 can, at times, exceed 
their rated power. For example, a service factor of 1.15 permits operation at 15% above the rated power. 
Of course, any motor operating continuously above its rated power will have a reduced service life.

. As 
the motor heat capacity is proportional to its volume and the motor heat emission factor is proportional 
to its area, the enclosed low-speed motors of high power are heated and cooled down slowly whereas 
the small machines do it faster. Thus, the induction wound rotor motors and dc machines have 
°
ττ

1…270 minutes and induction squirrel-cage self-ventilated motors have 
°

instance, for the motor series 1LA from Siemens at 0.06 kW 
°
ττ
= 11 s and at 75 kW 
°
ττ
= 50 s.
The thermal classification is provided in accordance with EN 60034. An ability of the motor insulation 
to handle heat is defined by motor insulation class. The four insulation classes are A, B, F, and H. The 
classes identify the possible temperature rise from an ambient temperature of 40º C of the surrounding 
air. Classes B and F are the most commonly used. Starting from an ambient temperature of 40˚C, the 
winding temperature of the Class B motors may increase by a maximum of 120˚C.
An ambient temperature, that is the temperature, is an important heat parameter also. It shows the 
temperature of the motor windings before starting the motor, assuming the motor has been stopped long 
enough. The temperature rises in the motor windings as soon as the motor is started. The combination 
of an ambient temperature and a permissible temperature rise equals the maximum rated winding 
temperature. If the motor is operated at a higher winding temperature, service life will be reduced. An 
increase of the operating temperature of 10°C above the permissible maximum can halve the motor 
insulation life expectancy. Every insulation class has a margin allowed to compensate for the motor hot 
spot, a point at the center of the motor’s windings where the temperature is higher. 
To find the temperature curve of the working drive, the thermal balance equation needs to be solved. 
Nevertheless, for the electric drives operated at the above given alternating loads with often start-ups 
and stops, the curve would be very complex. Such approach to the power counting is very laboriousness 
and its accuracy seems low. Therefore, other methods are used for the motor heating calculation upon 
the cycling and acyclic loads.

Duty modes. The rated power of a drive is always associated with a specific mode of operation. Operating 
modes are classified in accordance with EN 60034. They are normally specified for continuous operation, 
short-term operation, and periodic operations. To this aim, the load diagrams, primarily the torque patterns 
and the power patterns are used.
The size of the driven motors is generally chosen for continuous operation at a rated output, yet a 
considerable proportion of motor drives are used for duties other than continuous. As the output upon 
such deviating conditions may differ from the continuous rating, accurate specification of the duty is 
an important prerequisite for proper planning. The number of possible duty types is strongly limited. 
In high-performance applications, such as traction and robotics, the load and speed demands vary with 
time. While the traction equipment accelerates, the startup torque must be higher (typically twice the 
nominal torque). As the torque varies with time, so does the motor current (and motor flux linkage 
level). The electric, magnetic, and thermal loading of the motor and the electric and thermal loading of 
the power electronic converters have definite constraints in a drive specification. Table 1.5 categorizes 
operating duties into eight major types.
Type
Duty
Description
S1
Continuous running
Operation at constant load of sufficient duration for the thermal 
equilibrium to be reached.
S2
Short-term
Operation at constant load during a given time, less than required to reach 
thermal equilibrium, followed by de-energizing of sufficient duration to 
reestablish machine temperatures.
S3
Intermittent periodic
A sequence of identical duty cycles, each including a time of operation at 
constant load and a de-energizing time. In this duty type, the cycle is such 
that the starting current does not significantly affect the temperature rise.
S4
Intermittent periodic at a 
high startup torque
A sequence of identical duty cycles, each including a significant period of 
starting, a period of operation at constant load, and a de-energizing time.
S5
Intermittent periodic at a 
high startup torque and 
electric braking
A sequence of identical cycles, each consisting of a time of starting, a time 
of operation at constant load, a time of rapid electric braking, and a de-
energizing time.
S6
Continuous periodic
A sequence of identical duty cycles, each consisting of a time of operation 
at constant load and a time of no-load operation without de-energizing.
S7
Continuous periodic at a high 
startup torque and electric 
braking
A sequence of identical duty cycles, each consisting of a time of starting, a

The S2 mode is a short-term operation, i.e. operation with a constant load state for a specific limited time 
tL followed by a pause until the motor reaches the ambient temperature once again (Fig. 1.1 (b)). Here, the

 accomplish the full cycle duration 
τ. In this mode some crane mechanisms and the rapid traverse drives of the machine-tools operate.
The S3 mode is a periodic operation without impact of the start-up procedure on the motor warning-up. 
This mode is presented by a sequence of similar cycles (Fig. 1.1 (c)), each comprising a cycle duration τ 
with a constant load tL and a pause t0 in which the motor is at standstill. The motor temperature during 
the service time

Thus, the cdf represents the ratio of the service time duration tL to the full cycle duration. Maximum 
cyclic duration of periodical motor drives is 10 minutes. 
Often the cyclic duration factor is expressed by percent and is applied as 15%, 25%, 40% or 60%. For 
example, the cyclic duration 60% per minute corresponds to the motor operation 60 seconds with the 
following 40-second standstill. This mode is used in hoists, robots, drill machines, woodworking and 
grinding machines, some saws, fans, and conveyers.
An intermitted duty S6 (Fig. 1.1 (d)) is typical for many machine-tool drives. This periodic operation 
where the start-up procedure influences the warning-up is characterized by a cyclic duration factor 
and, in the case of induction motor, the number of stops and starts per hour. Every cycle consists of the 
loading work and the idle. The period continuation here is enough short thus the machine temperature 
does not reach the steady-state value.
The drive duty cycle also affects the reliability and the service life expectancy of power devices. Repetitive 
load cyclic duty results in additional thermal stresses on power devices. Frequent drive acceleration and 
deceleration result in repetitive junction temperature rise and falls at the cyclic duty. The life expectancy 
of devices is often determined by the maximum allowed number of cycles for a given power device 
junction temperature rise.

Motor dimensioning
Safety factor. Specification of the driving motor should meet the requirements of the driven machine in 
all the working modes, primarily in torque and power. Motor overloading causes fast isolation wear and 
mechanical damage. At the same time, unwarranted derating results in the frame size and cost increasing 
as well as the power loss deterioration. Therefore, it is required to bring the motor usage to the load 
characteristics as close as possible, with justified reserve.

In machine-tool constructions and robotics, the safety factor is accepted as 1.2…1.4 whereas in metallurgy, 
for instance, it reaches 1.8…2.2. In hoist mechanisms the motor dimension derates in units. Mass relation, 
backlashes, gaps, and transient requirements play an important role. The service factors (ratios of derated 
and rated powers, torques, currents, etc) are not normalized therefore the motor manufacturers set them 
basing on different criteria.
Long-term duty. Dimensioning procedure for the long-term duty upon the steady load includes the 
choice of the nearest machine, which specification meets the full load

 are the rated motor power and torque. 
The problem of the motor selection in the case of alternating loads is more sophisticated. Many machines 
have the cyclic operation mode in which the working cycle often fits either the single operation or the 
separate operation or technological step. The loading diagram of each cycle usually has the sections of 
constant power or torque of the definite duration. The curved diagram is often subjected to approximation 
by the stepped line. After that, both the rated capacity and the required motor torque are counted using 
one of the four following methods: the average loss method, the equivalent (rms) current method, the 
equivalent (rms) torque method, or the equivalent (rms) power method.

Nevertheless, an application of this method seems problematic due to the need in calculation of losses at 
the particular loading using the detailed motor datasheets. Therefore in practice the method of average 
losses is used only to validate the preliminary chosen machines being counted, for example, using the 
average static load with some empirical safety factor,

where I and R are the motor current and resistance. It should be mentioned that, due to the pauses in 
the working cycle, average losses calculated for the equivalent long-term mode should overcome the 
actual steady-state losses. In other words, the error of this method is proportional to the pause duration. 
To count the running ( dt ), braking ( qt ), and pausing ( 0t ) sections, the cooling deterioration factor

where st  − duration of the steady-speed operation. Usually, it is assumed

and 
ck  = 0.5 for the induction machines.
Additional motor heating is caused by the semiconductor power converters which are the sources of the 
pulsing current. Such heating is counted by the pulsing factor

isolated motors for the semiconductor-fed drives.
To use the method of equivalent current, the rated current limit is to be set as 
I

. This limit is 
suitable to validate the power and torque of the preliminary selected motor.
Transients and resulted dynamic loading normally increase the required motor power. The intermitted 
duties cause additional problems in motor dimensioning. Particularly, to work upon the alternating load 
in press industry the flywheels are applied. The principle of the flywheel drive is based on the idea that 
the peak (shock) load affects only the useful work whereas in the loose running it is insignificant. Thanks 
to the flywheel, an excess energy of inertia mass is accumulated in idling, which then is consumed in 
the working part of the cycle. In this way, accumulated energy of the moment of inertia J applied at the 
speed change from ωmax to ωmin,

This approach has more error than the method of equivalent current has because the assumed propor-
tionality cannot be satisfied in many aspects. 
Equivalent power. The method of equivalent power has even more error as it is based on the propor-

At the same time, the main advantage of this method concerns the suitability of the loading diagram 
applying. Nevertheless, while the motor speed alternates within the broad range, this approach cannot 
be used.
Applying of both the methods of equivalent torque and equivalent power is suitable for the motor choice 
basing on the rated value restrictions, such as

Periodic duty. The specialised periodic duty motors are featured by the rated cyclic duration factors cdfM

If the required periodic duty motors are absent, the S1 motor is to be selected which rated power is 
to be increased by the derating factor k. For instance, Sew Eurodrive proposes the following derating 
factors for S3: cdf = 15% corresponds k = 1.1; cdf = 40% corresponds k = 1.15; cdf = 25% corresponds 
k = 1.3; and cdf = 15% corresponds k = 1.4. When the speed varies in the range 5…10, this company 
recommends the long-term motor application. For the larger ranges, the motor of the nearest small 
dimension with forcing cooling is selected.

Short-term duty. For the short-term mode, the standard cycle durations τ are 30, 60 and 90 minutes. The 
specific short-term motors are very rare manufactured therefore the S1 motor is selected the rated power 
of which must be increased by the derating factor. For instance, Sew Eurodrive proposes the following 
factors for S2: τ = 60 minutes – 1.1; τ = 30 minutes – 1.2; and τ = 10 minutes – 1.4. 
Also, for the short-term mode the S1 motor power may be defined using the ratio of short-term losses

 to long-term losses

 called an overheating factor:

δ
=

τ
.
To be fully used in the short-term mode, the motor should be loaded in the way that the isolation 
temperature does not exceed the permissible limit to the end of the work cycle. 
If the use of the common-mode long-term motors in this situation seems unsuitable, the periodic duty 
motors come to practice, counting cdfM = 15% for τ  ≤ 30 minutes, cdfM = 25% for τ  ≤ 60  minutes, and 
cdfM = 40% for τ  ≤ 90 minutes.
Starting frequency. Very common ac drive systems are found which have a high starting frequency and 
a small counter-torque, for example a travel drive. In this case the power demand is in no way decisive 
for the motor selection, but rather the number of starts. The high starting current flows each time the 
motor is switched on and heats up the motor over-proportionally. If the heat absorbed is greater than 
the heat dissipated by the motor ventilation system, the windings will heat up to an inadmissible level. 
The thermal load capacity of the motor can be increased by a suitable choice of the thermal classification 
or by forced cooling.
By some manufacturers, the permissible starting frequency of an ac motor is given as so-called no-load 
starting frequency at cdfM = 50% (

FGI
). This value expresses how often the motor can accelerate the 
moment of inertia of its rotor without a counter-torque at 

FGI
 per hour to the maximum motor speed. 
If an additional moment of inertia has to be accelerated or if the loading occurs, the run-up time of 
the motor increases. Since current flows during this run-up time, the motor is more severely thermally 
loaded and the permissible starting frequency drops.
Often, the mechanism work cycle does not reach 10 minutes though the required starting frequency is 
high. In this case, an impact of the start-up and braking losses becomes the determinative factor of the 
motor choice for operation in S4 and S5 periodic duties. Hence, for an induction motor selection the 
hour permissible starting frequency is additionally calculated to heat the motor without over-temperature

The idling small machines permit 500…1500 switching per hour. As the power increases 50 kW, this

protected motors have higher permissible starting frequency than the enclosed machines. Often this

 Fig. 1.2 Flowchart of an electric drive design algorithm
Some particular cases of the described technology deal with the problem of equipment modernization 
when the gearboxes or the motors are specified beforehand. Often, mechanical units are designed together 
with electric drives thus the dimensioning starts as the first stage of design.
In any case, three groups of databases are available, namely AM, AG, and AC. The first group includes motors, 
which differ in powers PM and speeds ωM. Each motor has the rated and maximum shaft torques, moment 
of inertia, mass, efficiency, and electrical parameters. The group AG includes mechanical transmissions 
that differ in their power PG and gear ratio i. Each gear has rated and maximum torques, input and 
output speeds, moment of inertia, dimension, and efficiency. The group AC involves power converters.

Gear selection. On the first stage of dimensioning, the set AG is restricted by the required load power, 
torque, moment of inertia, and speed,

. These requirements are defined by the travel diagrams 
and necessary safety factors as well as by operational features, weight, and other indexes. To calculate 
the forces, the mechanism load diagrams are used. 
When the load is constant and works continuously, to calculate the power the kinematical diagrams 
and equipment technical data are used. When the load changes, effective (rms) values of parameters are 
calculated taking into account the alternating modes. When the machine works shortly or periodically, 
the appropriate calculation methods are applied.
To keep up the constant torque, the gear rated power and rated torque should meet the maximum load 
power. At that, a gear requires the necessary overload capacity to operate normally on the maximum 
speed. Some mechanisms maintain two speed ranges: low constant torque range and high constant power 
range. In this case, the gear is selected in accordance with these ranges. 
Anyway, the gear has to be selected with a safety factor, which depends on the load type. The machines 
of the first type have a safety factor of 1. Among these are fans, compressors, pumps, conveyers, and 
carriers which velocities change slightly during operation as well as the units with inertia ratio

less than 1.2. The second group has the safety factor of 1.25 and includes such mechanisms as elevators, 
balanced machines and hoists with some speed range requirements as well as the units with inertia ratio 
below 3. The third group has the safety factor of 1.5, and covers mixers, crushers, roll-tables, lathers, and 
robots, operated in the broad speed ranges.

The mechanisms differ not only in their load character but in the calculation methods. Thus, the hoist 
drives usually have no typical service cycle. Their mode of operation depends on a number of factors 
and the load changes in the broad restrains. Elevator mechanisms have very strong requirements on 
the smooth adjustment and weak damping. The tunnel boring machines and the excavators have long 
kinematical transmissions, which may oscillate and jam. Different lathes require high accuracy and quick 
action. The specific peculiarity of plodders, mills, mixers, centrifuges, and ship rigging deals with the 
high starting torque and broad temperature range as well as operation in high humidity and current-
conducting dust. The counter-torque of pumps and fans depends on the speed. Conveyers and mills have 
the transitional distributed loads whereas the robots operate under the alternating moment of inertia. 
For the machines that operate with heavy starting and braking modes, the gear manufactures state high 
utility factors, up to 1.8 or 2. All these features have to be taking into account in the dimensioning, 
placing, assembling, and connection processes.
Motor selection. Following the permissible gear limiting, the motor capacity restrictions are imposed. 
The rated motor torque, power, and speed should exceed the respective load values. Motor moment 
of inertia commonly comes to 1…100% of the load inertia. For all that, the low-dynamic units accept 
the smaller values and the high-dynamic machines − the greatest quantities. Every gear associates with 
all possible motors that power and torque meet the load requirements as well as the speed meets the 
transmission requirements. 
First, the presence of the geared motors is examined. The low inertia motors are preferable for apparatus, 
printers, small robots and other fast-speed units. Remaining groups of machines require the common-
mode motors. Accurate mechanisms use servomotors whereas the induction machines are used in 
low-precision open loop systems. To build powerful industrial machinery, the large-scale induction and 
synchronous motors employs. In the particular cases, especial motors are introduced.
Next, the quality of transients and steady-state processes of each motor-gear pair is examined. To that 
end, the system analytical optimization or the computer dynamic simulation may be used to derive full 
information concerning the quality of the designed system. The library of the drive models serves as the 
major part of the optimization methods.
Then, obtained estimation is used to sort the selected motor-gear pairs on descending of the quick-action, 
power, cost, etc. Thereafter, each selected motor is tested on the equivalent thermal load and starting 
possibilities using the drive duty diagrams including their torque and power patterns. The duty diagram 
differs from the load diagram by the start-up and braking areas that correspond to the possible system 
accelerations and decelerations. Particularly, the drive dynamic torque is calculated by these diagrams as:

where td is the time needed to accelerate (or decelerate) the inertia J to the speed ω.

Project Planning
The thermal mode is satisfactory if the motor rated torque and rated power exceed the effective quantities, 
which have been calculated on the base of duty diagrams. To check the start-up conditions, the full load 
and maximum sticking friction is to be taken into account. If some conditions are failed, it is the reason 
to exclude the motor from the list of candidates.
Selection of power converter. Further, selection of a power converter begins. Most manufacturers have 
their own methods for the converter choice dependently on the required adjustment mode (speed, torque, 
path, etc.), speed range, and accuracy.
During the final optimal motor-gear-converter set selection process, a designer takes into account the 
start-up time, braking, steady-state motion and additional estimations, properties, and features of the 
desired system. As well, he pays need to reliability, brand name, service life as well as maintainability, 
guaranty, and so on.
As a rule, this procedure is automated to a great extend by the existing computer aided design systems. 
Computers serve both for calculations and for the component selection and section agreement, sorting, 
and search the optimal variants. The last problem belongs to the non-linear programming area and its 
solution depends in many ways on the used algorithms and software.
Further, the general design stages are discussed in conformity with the above presented algorithm.

Experimental determination of moments of inertia. To find the moment of inertia of a machine, an 
experimental method may be used based on the equation of the free run −TL = Jsω. For this purpose, a 
mechanism runs with some speed ωL which power PL is measured and the torque is calculated as follows:
L

speed trace at t = 0 determines the derivative

L .
In such a way, the dynamic component of the driven load is determined by the geometric characteristics 
of the decelerated or accelerated machine, its density, and required acceleration. The more is this 
component, the more powerful should be an electric drive. Usually, the high precision machine-tools, 
robots, servo- and positioning systems have the highest dynamic requirements in distinct from the 
pumps, fans, and auxiliary drives.
2.2	
Load calculation formulae
To calculate the driven load, the specific mechanism features should be taken into account. In most kinds 
of machines, the static components of the driving force develop the work counter-forces FLW, counter-
torques TLW, and powers PLW on the one hand and overcome the transmission and motor friction, Fμ, 
Tμ, Pμ, on the other hand,

Load Calculations
Metal-cutting equipment. The cutting strength of the metal-cutting equipment depends on the cutting 
depth h, the cutting tool edge width l, and the tool geometrical properties. By applying the safety factor 
ks to take into consideration the material features, the next formulae may be used to describe the cutting 
strength and torque: 
FLW = kshl
TLW = FLrL
The radius of applied force rL is the property of the grinding wheel, the milling cutter, or the leading gear 
size. If some non-right angle φL occurs between the cutting strength and the rotation axis, the torque 
formula will change as follows:
TLW = FLWrLsin φL
The feed velocity v defines the cutting power as follows:
PLW = FLWv
Hoists and robots. Concerning the hoists, the main problem is to exceed the gravity force. The similar 
goal is typical for some drives of the drilling, milling, and grinding machines. Rising and lowering 
strengths of the mass m are calculated through the gravity acceleration g,
FLW = mg

The radius of the applied force and the transport velocity define the static torque and power of the drive. 
When the counter-mass mL appears, 
FLW = (m – mL)g
To design an electric drive of the rotational mechanisms, the torque caused by the unbalanced gravity 
forces of the moved weights and constructional elements is to be taken into consideration:
TLW = mgrL
where rL is the distance between the rotational axis and the centre of gravity. In robots, the static torque 
often depends on the rotational angle φL of the mechanism. It varies while the robot moves the load 
and this relation may be differently non-linear. Therefore, graphics and sheets are used to produce 
calculation in these cases.
Conveyers. Conveyer systems have the distributed load of the carried materials and the conveyer tape, 
thus their strength,
FLW = mgμ,
depends on the specific resistance μ of the supporting. The overall torque is defined by the forces of the 
tape and the static resistance of other elements. It is determined through the tension difference of the 
oncoming (FLWon) and outcoming (FLWout) brunches of the tape:
TL = (FLWon – FLWout)rL
Here, rL is the radius of the leading drum. To calculate the conveyer power, the angular speed of the 
drum ωL is used:
PLW = TLWωL 
Often, the conveyer power is connected with the volume capacitance q as follows:
PLW = qgρ(μl ± h) 
where μ = 3 to 30, l is the length of the horizontal projection of the path, h is the height of the material 
lifting or lowering, and ρ is the material density. 
In the cases discussed above, the work torque is practically independent on the speed thus it is considered 
as a constant value.

fans, centrifugal pumps, and conveyers have the cubical dependence on the velocity, and their static 
torque has a squared relation.
2.3	
Friction forces
Definition. Friction is the resistance for the relational motion of the contacted bodies in their contact 
points. Dependently on the motion mode, the slipping friction and the rolling friction are distinguished. 
Slipping friction of the pressed surfaces is caused by the micro unevenness because of which the contact 
area occupies a very small part of the full square (from 0.001 to 1%). Thus, even at the very low loading 
there is a great specific pressure in the contiguities. Slipping friction depends on the contact area 
conditions and on the lubricants. In vacuum, frictionless is possible without any pellicles and chemical 
combinations. Coulomb’s friction occurs in air without lubricants and pollutions causing jerking and 
cogging at the low-speed motion. Border friction takes place in the case of the thin pellicles, often of 
oil. Oil friction occurs when the solid layer of a lubricant divides hard surfaces. Semi-oil friction is a 
composition of oil and border friction.
Friction force. The vector of the slipping friction strength has an opposite direction to the vector of the 
relational motion velocity in the tangent plane of the rubbed surfaces. The maximum retarding force 
of the relational motion of the rubbed bodies, which arises at the motion starting instant is known as 
sticking friction or friction of rest, Fμs. It always exceeds motion friction Fμ.

Antifriction measures. To decrease the friction impact on the load operation, different means have been 
proposed. Thus, in the positioning mode of multi-operational machine-tools, the rolling guides provide 
fast and precision output. In the contouring mode of bidirectional milling machines, the slipping guides 
with very low friction are in use. When the strengths are high and velocities reach 0.1 m/s, the combine 
slipping/rolling guides are suitable. The hydrostatic systems are popular in the heavy milling machines.

Mechanical Transmissions
Kinematical circuits of technological equipment require small gaps and backlashes, low elastic 
deformations, and simple design. The following three main properties qualify the kinematic designs − 
transmission ratio, efficiency, and rigidity.
First, an ideally solid mechanical system is examined here.
Transmission ratio. The motion ratio of the driving and driven units is described by a travel function. 
When this function ties momentary speeds or paths, it is called a transmission ratio:

a linear ratio,

Here, v and l are the linear velocity and displacement of the driving shaft as well as vL and lL are the

linear velocity v is proportional to the rotational point distance rL from the axis of rotation:

models provides the universality of the gearbox applications. The gears with cylindrical toothed wheels 
and ratios from 0.2 to 10 develop the highest speeds. The spur bevel gears with external engagement have 
higher wear resistance and better smoothing, noiseless and heightened speeds. Thanks to the decrease of 
the teeth number of the small wheel, their size is less than other gears. The gears with cylindrical wheels 
and inner engagement are of high compact, high overload, low slip, but they are of less technological 
from the production point of view. 
Efficiency of a pair of the toothed wheels depends on the number of teeth, gearing properties, circular 
force, and friction factor μ. The steel teeth usually have μ =  0.08 to 0.12. The steel worms, toothed wheels, 
and bronze teeth of the driven wheels have μ =  0.15 to 0.25 on the velocities up to 2 m/s.
Efficiency of a cylindrical pair is approximately

Other transmissions. The friction transmissions with parallel axes (Fig. 3.1 (b)) are popular in instrument-
making industry where they alter the speeds by 2 to 5 times.
Rim, rope, cord and chain flexible transmissions (Fig. 3.1 (c)) transmit the long-distance motions of 2 to 
10-times speed variations with the broad nomenclature of the pulley diameters. 
To raise the torque on the shaft of a rotational mechanism i times relatively the torque of the prime mover 
of the same power, the parallel and cross-axis transmissions are used. The following relation describe 
the mechanisms with crossing axes:

This ratio concerns of the helical (Fig. 3.1 (d)) and worm (Fig. 3.1 (e)) gears. To convert rotation into 
the forward motion, the rack-toothed gears (Fig. 3.1 (f)), friction couplings (Fig. 3.1 (g)), camshafts, and 
hinge-lever mechanisms are in use.
In the rack gears, rotation is converted into the forward motion thanks to the gear rotation in respect 
to the straight toothed rack. A gear revolution corresponds to the linear motion of 2πr, whereas the 
reflected radius is equal to:

Mechanical Transmissions
The same method is used to calculate the travel functions of the wheel gears, pulley-rope, and drum-rope 
transmissions.
To build the high-precision or noiseless joints as well as to pass the high forces, the screw-nut and ball-
screw gears are recommended, which accompany the screw motion by the travel of the lathe component 
connected to the screw-nut. To exclude the dead point in these transmissions, a pair of springing nuts

Efficiency of the screw-nut transmission is ηL = 0.5 to 0.8. The rack-toothed and planetary gear efficiencies

The wave gears have significant ratios. When properly mounted, they slow down the rotation by 10 to 
270 times and ensure the high overload capability and low backlashes. Thanks to the wave generator 
with the elastic mechanical link, this gear has a plenty of simultaneously geared teeth (up to 20 %) that 
contribute to raising the transmitted power and accuracy. It is convenient to pass the motion in the 
hermetic machines. Wave gear efficiency is usually 0.7 to 0.9. 
Clutches are the integral parts of machine-building. The electromagnetic toothed clutches ensure 
the reliable shaft connection and pass the rotation without freewheeling. Specially shaped teeth allow 
to synchronize rotation and to convert speeds by the clutches. The same problems are resolved by 
electromagnetic disc clutches with air and oil cooling and by magnetic and non-magnetic discs having 
ratios of 1 to 5. Efficiency of the leading clutches is in the range of 0.95 to 0.98 whereas the disc clutches 
have efficiency 0.75 to 0.92.

shown in Fig. 3.4. The shaft rotation of the motor M is delivered to the load shaft 1 through the power 
geared transmission, then to the shaft 2 through the instrument gear. The shaft 2 is connected to the 
shaft 3 of the position sensor BQ by the disk clutch. Gear ratios are shown in the diagram. The load

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Elasticity forces
Definition. When the long shafts, chains, or ropes are used to transmit the motion, the droops, lags, and 
movement distortion occur because of elastic deformation. Elastic sections provoke various oscillations 
in the mechanism:
--
free oscillations upon the reference change and load torque variation;
--
forced oscillations coursed by external periodical forces irrespective of the system motion; 
hunting induced by an interaction of the motoring object and external energy sources; 
audio oscillations (noise). 
If the external periodic force coincides with the frequency of one of these oscillations, a resonance 
will appear. This results in the mechanism ware and breakage as well as in the production of quality 
deterioration. To eliminate elastic oscillations and to accelerate their damping, the transmission rigidity 
and the viscous friction are to be increased.
Double-mass system. An electric drive with elastic sections is considered as a multi-mass system in 
distinct to earlier discussed single-mass systems. In the most cases, an elastic mechanism may be simulated 
as a double mass system where the pair of masses replaces all moving parts as shown in Fig. 3.5 (a). The 
first mass is concentrated on the motor shaft. It has moment of inertia JM, rotated with the speed ω and 
traveling along the angular path φ. The second mass is separated from the motor by an elastic section. 
This mass has a moment of inertia JL revolving with the speed ωL and passing an angular path φL. An 
elastic torque causes deformation by sagging, lengthening δl, or twisting δφ,

Table 3.1 Formulae of the solid factor for typical kinematical sections
The inverse quantity of cβ, which defines the mechanism compliance, is called an elasticity factor.
To account for an elasticity of a hoist, the replacement circuit may be figured as a three-mass system 
shown in Fig. 3.5 (c)). Here, the mass on the motor shaft, the mass of the drum with a rope, and the 
weight mass are emphasized. In the circuit, next designations are assumed: JL – moment of inertia of a 
drum with the rope, mL – weighting mass, cβ1 ‑ gearbox solid factor and cβ2 – rope solid factor. In the 
special cases, this circuit may be simplified. Thus, if the backlashes occur, m = 0 may be considered 
because

Multi-mass system. Sometimes, the branchy multi-mass circuit is used (Fig. 3.5 (d)) where the drum 
rotation courses the mass m1 hoisting up and the mass m2 hauling down. In this circuit, one have to 
consider the motor shaft moment of inertia Jn, the drum with a rope moment of inertia JL tied with Jn 
by cβ1, and masses m1 and m2 linked to the drum by elastic sections cβ2 and cβ3. In the case of parallel 
elastic connection shown in Fig. 3.5 (e),

As a rule, the solid factor of a toothed belt does not exceed 0.2 N/μ, and 1 N/μ in the case of the chain 
transmission. This index for the lathe rack-pinion transmissions reaches 100 to 300 N/μ whereas for the 
ball-screw pairs it exceeds 1200 N/μ. 
Reflecting of elastic sections. The method of the speed damping in the elastic system depends on the

Usually, these frequencies are restricted by 0.1 Hz in the mine hoists, drags, and sluices as well as by 
300 to 700 Hz in the high precision lathes. Referred rigidity of the feed drive for the control numerical 
control lathe occupies the range from 100 to 1300 N/μ, thus the amplitude of the linear oscillation is in 
the range 1 to 5 μkm and the amplitude of the angular oscillation does not exceed 0.01 radians.

It is customary to retain the dumping factor within the range of 0.05. Equivalent damping of robots, 
excavators, and mining hoists falls in the range 0.1 to 0.3. It reaches 0.4 in rolling mills and hoisters.

, the system may be considered as an absolutely rigid drive disregarding its elastic 
properties. All remaining cases should be subdivided into the weakly, essentially, and strongly connected 
systems. In the case of the weak connection (γJ < 1.5) as well as in the case of the strong connection 
(γJ > 10) an electric drive poor dumps the load oscillations. At the same time, since the inertia ratio 
approaches a unit, the load affection the motor becomes weaker. Otherwise, an elastic connection may 
provoke significant system flapping, which depends on the inertia ratio γJ.

Load gaps and backlashes
Gap. A gap is the mechanism area δl or δφ causing the path difference within which an elastic force is 
equal to zero. As far as the path difference exceeds this area, the gap locks and the mechanism sections 
continue their interaction. An example of the elastic circuit with a gap is given in Fig. 3.7 (a). The gap 
model (Fig. 3.7 (b)) is the following:

Backlash. Other parameter of the elastic mechanical systems is called a backlash, or a plug (Fig. 3.7 (d)). 
The backlash causes non-identical drive response upon the identical set-points, which differ only in their 
sign. It blights significantly to the follow-up system sensitivity. The backlash action determines by the

Protection measures. To exclude the gaps and backlashes from the precision lathes, the screw kinematic 
pairs strain preliminary or automatic gap excerption applies. Thereto, the split adjusted toothed wheels 
are used often. As well, additional toothed transmissions and specific adjusted clutches are introduced. 
Totally, gaps and backlashes of the precision units do not exceed 0.1 to 10 μkm.

Transfer functions and block diagrams of drive components
To tune electric drives, the linear models are best suited thanks to the classical theory of the linear system 
control. The drive components, which can be described by the linear models, are expressed mathematically 
by the operator Laplace transformation using transfer functions and block diagrams.
A transfer function is the mathematical model of a linear chain. It describes the operator image of one 
of the output variables with respect to one of the input variables at zero starting conditions. To proceed 
from the differential equations to the Laplace images, the differential operator called a Laplace operator 
is used being considered as an algebraic value. In symbols,

Therefore, by introducing the single quantity s, we get a lot in return − many differential equations can 
now be solved algebraically. This is quite a general method because the linear equations are often more 
easily solved than the differential ones.

Regulators and Filters
Because of the second-order transfer functions (4.3) and (4.4), the step responses of the motor speed 
and current may be presented by the periodic or non-periodic traces the shape of which depends on the 
time constant ratio. At τT > 4τe they are exponential or non-periodic, but while τT < 4τe they oscillate 
as is plotted in Fig. 4.2 by the dotted, dashed, and solid lines.

Fig. 4.2 Typical drive step responses
As a rule, the major transient impact results from the mass of the running inertia evaluated by the 
mechanical time constant τT. At the non-oscillating process, the electromagnetic time constant τe has 
low impact on the dynamic characteristic. On the contrary, the oscillating processes are significantly 
defined by the electromagnetic time constant.
Power converters of motor drives are often modeled as simple linear circuits described by the differential 
equation of the first order (Fig. 4.1 (a)) with a transfer function

Here, kC is the converter gain, which depends of the converter function. It may be the ratio of the 
output voltage to the reference signal of the controlled rectifier, or the ratio of the output frequency to 
the input current of the inverter, etc. The time constant τC defines the average converter delay. In the

where τCf = 1…10 ms is the time constant of the input filter, m is the number of ripples, and f1 is the

for the elastic and non-linear chains.

Analogue regulators and filters
To implement the discussed above drive topologies, continuous and discrete automatic elements or the 
program tools are used. Analogue, or continuous, converters are realised on the basis of the linear amplifiers.
Figure 4.3 presents the circuit diagrams and time responses y(t) of the different analogue regulators − 
proportional (P) controller, PI controller, PID controller and their combinations built on operational 
amplifiers. In Table 4.1 the formulae for their calculation are collected.

Regulators and Filters
To calculate regulators, the apparatus of the transfer function operation calculus is applied. 
Circuits used to remove unnecessary variations of dc and ac signals are known as filters. Depending on 
the passive and active components, filters are classified as passive filters and active filters. The first are 
built on resistors, capacitors, and inductors, whereas the active filters use only resistors and capacitors 
together with op amps and are considerably easier in design than passive filters. The circuit diagrams 
of the filters are similar to those of the regulators. The frequency responses y(f ) of the active filters are 
also given in Fig. 4.3 above. Table 4.3 collects the formulae for their calculation.

Table 4.2 Formulae for filter calculations
The following filters are presented here: low-pass filters (LPF), high-pass filters (HPF), a band-pass filter 
(BPF) and a band-stop filter (BSF). To calculate filters the apparatus of the transfer function operation 
calculus is also used.
4.3	
Digital filters and regulators
Digital filters and digital regulators built using the microprocessor technique and computer software 
have some specific features. As a rule, a digital unit replaces a group of analogue devices. Moreover, it 
usually processes additional functions, such as the testing modes, automatic auxiliary calculations, self-
tuning, signal override control, information exchange, diagnostic, and alarm generation. An arbitrary 
filter function is represented by the digital device as an algorithm and the corresponding program. The 
software may be corrected before running and during maintenance, and the tuning range is typically broad 
enough. At the same time, digital devices have some drawbacks, such as lower accuracy as compared to 
their analog prototypes because of the limited calculation step τ0.

Static accuracy of electric drive 
Recall the control topologies of electric drives. All variable-speed electric drives relate to the close loop 
systems. The system inputs y* specify the required angular frequency ω*, velocity v*, or position φ* 
as well as the demanded torque T*, current I*, or voltage U*. The feedback signals are acquired from 
sensors coupled with the control objects, such as power converters, motors, and driving machines. These 
signals are processed by the controllers managed the control system. Thanks to the feedback, the referred 
signal is compared with the sensor signal using the subtracter in the case of the negative feedback or 
the summer in the positive feedback. Sometimes the regulators are mounted into the feedback loop but 
usually they are placed directly ahead the control object. In the former case shown in the block diagram 
of Fig. 4.4 (a) the feedback with the regulator of the transfer function Wr(s) envelops the object W0(s). 
The reference (set-point signal) y* is compared with the feedback signal ς and their difference δ comes 
to the object as a reference impact. In the latter topology shown in Fig. 4.4 (b) the regulator directly 
affects the object whereas the feedback includes only sensors and filters described by the transfer function 
Wy(s). This method is commonly used in the electric drive.

 Fig. 4.4 Positioning of the regulator in the close loop system
The goal of a feedback is to increase the control accuracy by raising the static rigidity through the speed 
holding, which in turn increases the servo performance. Oppositely, in the systems those free oscillation 
period is harmonized with the run-up time the rigidity should be decreased to reduce the machine 
loading.
One of the main modes of the electric drive performance is the steady-state operation at the constant 
or smoothly changed inputs and disturbances. The major parameter of such performance is the steady-
state error composed of both the error resulted from the set-point reproduction and the error resulted 
from the disturbance,
χ
δ
+
∗
δ
=
δ
.
Other errors caused by non-sensitivity and non-linearity of the regulators and sensors are usually 
eliminated by the system hardware and software.

system of the second order removes the steady-state errors of the permanently changing signals.

Control Principles of Electric Drives
5	 Control Principles of Electric 
Drives 
5.1	
Modal control and standard settings
Following the selection of the control topology, the regulators are to be designed. To provide the optimum 
settings, the control system has to follow some principles.
In distinct from the above discussed static properties, the system dynamic properties are defined by the 
transfer function, primarily by the roots of the characteristic polynomial. The modal control principle 
requires looping the controllable object with multiple feedbacks to reach the output transients having 
the typical (standard) distribution of the roots of the system characteristic polynomial. To generate the 
best dynamics, the modal controllers are required that process the all the possible object states. As not all 
the object variables are usually accessible by the sensors, these controllers should include the observers 
to reproduce inaccessible data mathematically, basing of the information acquired from sensors. In the 
simpler cases, the local regulators are designed to process the only accessible values, such as currents, 
voltages, speeds, paths, etc. measured by the feedback sensors. 
Describe the close loop system shown in Fig. 4.4 (b) by the transfer function

The engineering systems have the restricted rate of response. Call the minimum time of the system 
response as a small equivalent time constant τμ which serves as the measure of an electric drive response 
rate. Because of this unbalanced delay, any drive is described by a differential equation of, as minimum, 
the first order. 
The system transfer functions W(s) differ depending on their characteristic polynomials. Let the desired 
transfer function be described by the simplest first-order model having the characteristic polynomial

In this case, the motor drive will have very stable exponential step responses plotted above in Fig. 4.2

 Fig. 5.1 Standard settings
Thus, the close loop drive transient shape, oscillation, and stability depend on the relation of the time 
constants rather than on their absolute values. 
To select the factors a1 and a2 which provide the time optimal transients (

in Fig. 3.1 above), 
the so-called standard tuning (setting) is applied (Fig. 5.1 (b)).

Control Principles of Electric Drives
The time-optimal non-periodic exponential transient (EO) in the second-order system takes place at 
a1 = 4. Its running time is 9.5τμ without overshoot. In the third order system, a similar characteristic has 
the curve having a1 = 3 and a2 = 9. In the first-order system, a similar view is obtained by selection a1 = 2.
The time-optimal monotonous (non-oscillating) step response in the second-order system takes place 
at a1 = 2. Its running time area settles between 4.7τμ and 10.5τμ with the overshoot γ = 4.3% above the 
steady state value. This standard setting is called a modulus optimum (MO). In the third-order system 
a similar characteristic has the curve having a1 = 2.25, a2 = 6. In the first-order system a similar view is 
obtained by selection a1 = 2.
The time-optimal oscillating transient in the third order system takes place at a1 = 2 and a2 = 4. Its 
running time is 3.1τμ with the overshoot γ = 43% above the steady state value. This standard setting 
is called a symmetrical optimum (SO). To obtain the similar characteristic in the second-order system, 
an inaccessible value of a1 = 0.25 would be required. In the first-order system there are no oscillations.
Thus, the close loop drive running time and overshoot depend only on the loop model and the small 
equivalent time constant τμ. All the other parameters have no significance in the properly designed 
system with high linear characteristics.

Control Principles of Electric Drives
5.2	
Sequential correction of simple objects
The principle of the sequential correction requires the system to be divided into the loops each including 
the series-connected controller Wr(s) and object Wo(s) as Fig. 4.4 (b) shows. Normally, one of the object 
time constants (rarely two or three of them) is considered as the large time constant τo whereas other are 
the small time constants τμi. The controller aims to balance the large time constant, thus converting the 
control loop into the simple system, preferably of the first order. Theoretically, it is desired to develop a 
fully inertia-free loop although in practice some non-sensing parameters are presented in the system, thus 
a small equivalent time constant τμ is kept in any case. The rules of such balancing are discussed further.
Let an object is described by the simple first-order model shown in Fig. 5.2 (a),

Cascading
The principle of cascading proposes dividing the complex object into the maximum possible easily 
controlled sub-objects to arrange a multi-loop system. The number of loops is equal to the number of 
the sub-objects. Each loop includes the controller linked in such a way that the output of the previous 
controller specifies the behavior of the next one. Respective block-diagram of the looping cascade is 
presented in Fig. 5.4. The object of each outer controller includes both the appropriate sub-object and 
the inner loop keeping its own controller. Two signals are compared at the input of each controller, the 
loop set-point signal and the loop actual signal measured by the loop sensor.

 Fig. 5.4 Cascading
Clearly, cascading is used together with the principle of sequential correction. The large time constants 
of the loops are balanced by the corresponding controllers to decrease the loop inertia. Corrected loops 
have merely the small time constants and are described by the low-order transfer functions supported 
by the standard settings.

where k is a scale factor which reflects all the regulator gains to the single regulator input. For the

Thus, since the number of loops grows, the controller and the outer loop time constants grow, being 
doubled in each new loop. In other words, every loop steps down twice the system speed response and 
the drive precision.
A jog of the cascading systems is executed sequentially for each close loop starting, possibly, from the 
inner loop. If the inner loop has the factory setting (for instance, the current loop), the jog will begin 
with the next loop (for example, the speed loop).
Initially the P-controller is included into the loop. By the gradually increasing of its gain, the response 
of the moving system is examined upon the small step input signals thus preventing the saturation. As 
the close loop gain grows, the loop transient time is reduced along with its overshoot magnification. 
As the process obtains the oscillating feature, the gain stops to increase and even slightly decreases. If 
this way does not provide the demanded frequency band, the system must be tested for resonance and 
non-linearity, which restrict the bandwidth.

Control Principles of Electric Drives
After that, the highest possible integral component is included into the controller. By gradual decreasing 
of its time constant, the step response of the moving non-saturated system is examined again. Along 
with the integral time constant lowering, the loop overshoot increases and, as its value overcomes the 
permissible level, the integral change is to be finished.
If the loop response remains insufficiently fast, the differential component can be included into the loop. 
By gradual increasing of its gain, the step response of the moving non-saturated system is examined 
once again. Along with the differential time constant growing, the loop overshoot increases and, as its 
value overcomes the permissible level, the tuning will be finished. 
Thereupon, the regulator restriction components are switched on. Now, the input signals are to be 
increased to test the non-linear system response. This is the last step of the loop jog following which 
the jog of the next outer loop can start.

Speed control 
The goal of the variable speed electric drives is to keep the prescribed motor speed stable and independent 
of the load and supply disturbances. To ensure the speed control has the required wide control range, 
as even the lowest speeds need to be detected accurately, a high-resolution tachometer and a processor 
with an extremely short sampling time are often required. This, in turn, demands a speed controller of 
high processing capacity and power.
To provide the speed sensing, the tachometer the signal of which is proportional to the speed is mounted 
directly on the motor shaft. The set-point value ω* (desired speed) is continuously compared with the 
actual value ω in the control system. The speed difference determined in this way is used by the speed 
controller to regulate the power stage of the converter in such a manner that the motor reduces the 
controller difference. This represents a close loop speed regulating circuit.
In Fig. 6.1 (a) the block diagram of the converter-fed electric drive with the negative speed feedback 
is presented which satisfies to the above shown Fig. 4.4 (b). In this speed-stabilizing circuit the control 
object is described by the transfer functions of the power converter

Tuning the Electric Drives
Accordingly the sequential correction principle, multiple setting variants are possible here. The MO 
tuning ensures the fast response of the set-point ω* processing with a small speed error δω. At the same 
time, it provides the slow response of the disturbance TL processing with the sizable overshoot but with no 
steady-state error δω. Herewith the speed recovery time is proportional to the ratio of τo and τμ. The SO 
setting ensures the fast non-periodic processes with a small error of the disturbance processing. It has the 
slow response of the set-point processing with the sizable overshoot and without the steady-state error.

Combined speed-current control 
As the single-loop variable-speed electric drives do not control the torque they can satisfactory adjust 
the speed only at the constant load. To unstable loading the multi-loop systems suit better. The block 
diagram of the double-loop speed controlled motor drive is shown in Fig. 6.4. In this cascading system, 
the inner loop controls the current whereas the outer loop controls the motor angular frequency i.e. the 
system speed. The output signal from the speed controller serves as the set-point of the current loop. 
The current controller compares the set-point and the actual values and generates the control signals 
that are routed to the control stage of the power converter. The current loop is the innermost control 
loop of the system and must therefore respond very quickly, as this will determine the quick action of 
the higher-level speed controller.

In the case of the transistor power converters, which operate at high switching frequencies of more than 
ten kilohertz, the converter inertia is ignored. 
The current loop is usually calculated assuming the demanded current restriction at the fixed speed 
value, that is at 
0
=
ω
s
, ignoring the EMF feedback 
0(
N
 . Herewith the control object of the current 
loop is described by the following transfer function:

At this tuning, assuming 
,
H
P
W
!!
W
, the loop should operate without the steady-state error therefore the 
system is expected to have the fast response on the supply perturbations. 
Nevertheless, in the majority of cases the small steady-state error remains due to the EMF feedback. 
To reach the acceptable accuracy, the current regulator is to be jogged or the EMF influence must be 
compensated, for instance by the LPF or by the non-linear correction. In the former case the quick action 
drops whereas the circuit is complicated in the latter case.
In the servo drives the current loop is closed and tuned by the manufacturer. To increase the accuracy, 
this tuning can be self-corrected periodically. For this purpose, at the beginning of operation the motor 
is momentary wired to the testing dc source (
0
1 =
f
) to measure the actual stator resistance, 
I
U
R =
0
. 
Then, in action, the parameters of the current regulator are constantly recalculated meaning the actual 
resistance drift which can be estimated using the thermo-sensor signals as follows:

Following the tuning, the current loop is considered as the part of the control object in relation to the 
outer speed loop.
In the transfer function of the control object of the speed loop, the optimized current loop, the 
compensated EMF feedback, and the scaled combined inputs are presented as follows:

To provide the SO setting, the PI-controller with the same gain and the time constant

applied. This approach is known as the double-integrated system design. In distinct from the single-
integrated system, it provides the slower set-point and supply disturbance responses but has no steady-
state torque errors. Nevertheless, the dynamic speed sag at the load jump still remains.
As an example, the transients of the single-integrated system are presented in Fig. 6.4 (b). The system has

whereas the solid couple shows the running up 40 rad/s at the current limiting.

 Fig. 6.5 Block diagrams of an electric drive with path control
According to Fig. 5.1, to provide the nearest to the EO setting, select a1 = 3 and a2 = 9. The tuning 
similar to the MO setting is obtained by selection a1 = 2.25 and a2 = 6. The SO setting is accessible at 
a1 = 2 and a2 = 4. Usually, the implementation and tuning of such a controller is sufficiently complex, 
thus the conventional approach assumes the system decomposition to some cascades, typically the path 
and the speed ones.
The block diagram of the double-loop path controlled electric drive with an inner speed loop is shown 
in Fig. 6.5 (b). In this cascading system, the inner loop controls the motor angular frequency whereas 
the outer loop controls the path that the load travels. The external position set-point φ* is the reference 
variable used by the system. The error δ between the position set-point φ* and position actual value 
serves as the input signal for the path regulator which produces the relevant set-point speed for the 
motor. The speed set-point and actual values are compared in the lower-level speed regulator. The 
output signal of the speed regulator is routed to the gate circuit which generates the control signals for 
the power converter control stages.

To obtain the SO setting of the path loop, the PI-controller is needed with the same gain and the time 
constant τrφ = 4τμφ . In this case, an LPF has to be placed between the path and speed controllers with 
a transfer function

. As a result, the transfer function of the control object is reduced 
to the third-order model, which can be corrected by the above described regulators.
The choice of the path setting is defined by the drive dynamic and static requirements. In the steady 
state mode, the use of the SO-tuned PI-controller results in the following transfer function of the open 
loop path control system:

This setting provides the step response of high quality without the steady-state path error. At the same 
time, integration always deteriorates the drive dynamics due to the slowing of the motor starting and 
the raising of the drive overshoot. 
As shown above in Fig. 2.5 (c), the predictive control which uses a feedforward signal is an effective 
method to drop the steady-state error without excessive dynamic errors. One possible way to introduce 
the feedforward loop is shown by the dotted lines in the path control block diagram of Fig. 6.5 (b). Here, 
the feedforward controller with the transfer function of the differentiator kfs is connected across the path 
P-controller. The transfer function of the path-controlled drive is as follows:

Other values of kf result in the overbalancing or misbalancing. Since the feedforward is effective only 
within the certain range of input signals, this has neither to act on the system control response nor on 
its response to disturbances. Therefore, it is usually switched off from the control circuit during the 
starting and breaking operations.

The elasticity impact on the electric drive behaviour can be neglected while the load moment of inertia 
referred to the motor is by far less (
J
γ <1.5) than the own motor inertia as well as while the elasticity 
does not cause the current oscillations in the open-ended system, just appearing on the high frequencies. 
In other cases the elasticity must be taken into account at the design and tuning of the close loop systems 
because of the resonant phenomena. At high inertia ratios (
J
γ >10) the elasticity affects significantly the 
motor speed and torque. Herewith, an implementation of the standard settings proposed for the solid-
state systems becomes unattainable. In the common case, the gains of the current and speed regulators 
are to be of 
J
γ  times below as compared with the hard system.
To prevent an essential control accuracy drop, different approaches have been proposed.

Electric Drive Dimensioning And Tuning
103 
Tuning the Electric Drives
The simple method to avoid an operation at the resonant frequencies relates to the generation of the 
especial set-point laws known as the frequency window skip (jump frequency method). Unfortunately, 
this solution is unacceptable for the tracking and programmable systems which require the accurate 
processing of the broad set-point spectres.
Another approach is based on the inclusion of the correcting devices into the control system. For this 
purpose the electric drives are supplied by the filters, primarily the LPF, resonance suppression filters, 
and adaptive vibration suppression controls. Particularly, in the Mitsubishi servo drives such filters are 
allocated behind the speed regulator outputs. 
Figure 6.6 (b) presents the frequency response of the elastic load with two resonant splashes at the 
frequencies 1f  and 2f . To define these frequencies, the driven mechanism is subjected to the identification 
process by its swinging at small amplitudes using the built-in amplitude-frequency analysers. If the 
frequency response is unknown, the filters will be tuned directly on the object. 
The LPF are tuned at the first resonance frequency, approximately 
-


 where k is the open-ended 
system gain. Herewith, the transient character is preserved though the gain is 
J
γ  times reduced as 
compared with the hard system.
More effective are the anti-resonant sections on the basis of the second-order BSF tuned for the 
particular resonant frequency bands. As the operation frequency catches these bands, the filters reduce 
the open-ended system gain. The notch frequency and the gain decreasing depth of the BSF are selected 
manually or with the help of the specific adaptation instruments. For this purpose, first, the low speed 
gain is assigned and the search of the BSF frequency starts aiming to suppress the resonant frequencies. 
The search starts from the high (1000 Hz) frequencies with the gradual their reducing (up to 100 Hz). 
Following the frequency finding, the regulator gain increases and the filter tuning repeats until the 
maximum bandwidth will be reached. Figure 6.6 (c) illustrates the tuning results of two BSF which have 
suppressed the resonant splashes of Fig. 6.6 (b). 
The tracking and positioning electric drives with the elastic loads are locked either through the motor 
shaft or through the mechanism shaft, or they are supplied by the two position encoders as shown in Fig. 
6.6 (d). The first variant meets the low tracking requirements, thus the system conditions are similar to 
those of the adjustable-speed drives. For the second and third variants, the dynamical object properties 
essentially depend on the joint machine-regulator parameters. Besides, the system quality is affected by 
the control loop backlashes and gaps which reduce the drive bandwidth resulting in the self-oscillations. 
The influence of these sources may be decreased by the elevation of the drive damping abilities.
